 Displaced and the other when I announce your name you could raise your hand Lisa to benedec Bury Hassan Athena Viscuzzi Mars Vogel Beverly Zabriski who is? Helix Center executive committee member organized this wonderful program and we're very grateful to her Also Simon dang is on his way and will be joining the discussion as soon as he arrives So without further ado Well we were talking before this about the effect of people's stories on each other and I guess You're the one that's done the research on this so maybe if you could start us off with how you think that relates to this topic So we Basically what we're doing in my lab we look in how people communicate So I'm an old scientist at Princeton University and my lab we're looking now a Storyteller convey his ideas To the audience, so basically we're scanning the brain of the listeners Why they listen to me speaking for example and my brain while I'm speaking to you And basically What we see that in good communication The brain of the listeners become coupled to the brain of the speaker and And the stronger the similarities between my brain patterns now and your brain patterns Mean that we managed to communicate and you can really understand me Most likely it's not happening now, right? You see on that You need to get used to my accent. We need to develop a common ground. We need to have common ideas of what we talking about and then it will emerge at the end of the conversation hopefully and And I think that especially in these days we see more and more that it's very easy to interrupt communication it's very easy not to be coupled to the other anything When good communication happening is like a magic I thought I will eventually become coupled and I think the question in these days how can we can really improve communication and In Increase the similarities in our responses and serve background and certain understanding of the topics We are talking about instead of dividing and biking because it's very easy for the listeners to be decoupled and Not to want to be engaged in communication So since we're talking we're in a climate, let's say where people are being othered a lot, yes What are those conditions that we need to create so that people can listen to each other I Think that the two really important things for communication to happen I think first we need to develop similar joint language like if you were talking about different aspect and have different beliefs and and Filters by which we perceive reality It's very easy to be decoupled. So for example when I was reading the news yesterday is In the attack on the media I got really scared by trying to say that For example, journalists are the enemy of the people because that means that one of our basic Knowledge and way to create a society now is undermined and If we don't know what is the fact and what are the tools will be very difficult to establish this coming down and It will be very easy to divide us more and more and anything that basically We're living in a water to become more and more fragmented And I think there are some forces that like it That can gain power from this fragmented reality and that's something we need to fight against We're very much a story We did not exhibit the stories These are How these is third-person stories these aren't these aren't stories of our educators But the goal is to create a sense that this is that the experience of others is very much like the experience of immigrants And very much like the experience of visitors who don't identify naturally with the immigration experience We don't have that sense of whether we're connected at that sort of a granular level for us It's it's it's very superficial Are people saying to us things like yes, my grandparents experience the same thing or are they saying things to us which they are increasingly Today I don't have to listen to that crap anymore. There's been a change And we can tell our story we own our own stories and we don't have to connect our stories and stories of other people It would be wonderful to be able to to see the kinds of connections that you That you study and and what it is that facilitates would facilitate our ability to make connections more real So you were talking about the exhibit that doctors without borders did earlier this this year about So that's the organization I work for I'm highlighting our experiences with refugees all over the world and the whole point of that was that in telling the stories and Making people more than telling the stories but actually making people kind of go through a simulation of that experience that that's It's impossible not to be moved. I guess, you know, I think we come from I come from a place where it's Stories are moving, you know, and we encourage forms where people can tell their stories because that's what's going to shift People's minds, but I guess what you're saying is kind of challenging not necessarily. There have to be some conditions. Yeah, I think that There's something really interesting about storytelling and it's way more effective way of communication than anything else if If a doctor will come and we tell you that you have a cancer and we start to detail all the facts To be very difficult for you to process But if you will talk with someone that went through this To the therapy and will tell you his own personal experiences suddenly will get information So I think in storytelling, it's a way for us to communicate the way more effectively because You know, we all humans we all suffer we all have families we all have friends We we went to the world So it's very easy to connect when you have this like very basic common ground to use for When you go and and really become very abstract and then it's more difficult for people to be coupling in in the understand the situation Well, I think that's the premise of having the work that you're doing retelling stories from history and then also in the kind of presentations where we were having I guess all when when we're trying to Talk about the displaced and raise empathy for them and services and funding hopefully We do rely on story. I think that's kind of the idea. We do rely on stories But I think what you're I think we're all increasingly Just talk You said you need a common language in order to hear somebody else's story, and I think we're all increasingly siloed And just listening to the people who speak our language, you know, I mean in terms of Yeah, I mean, you know and that there would be words Like if if somebody's telling me his story Was an illegal immigrant That's it. I've stopped listening, you know, because I don't In my language, there's no such thing. There's no illegal immigrants So we speak a different language so finished look you know my empathy And Some guards, right and in your intuition is absolutely right. This is exactly what do we see basically I can we did an experiment that was a very simple experiment. It was like listening to 50-minute story by JD Salinger. So basically everyone listening to the same story the story was about a husband that lost track of his wife in a party and He calling his best friend in the middle of the night asking did you see my wife? It's a very simple story For half of the audience we say that the wife even affair and is with the friend at this actual moment and for the other group we said that the husband is lunatic and And really we have a very iraqi man way And it's like one sentence was enough to make the audience Understand the story in a very different way It and it was so strong that we can look on the brain of each listener of Intel You believe that the wife even of her or you believe that the husband is lunatic and If you think that one sentence Can filter your reality Right and think about what happening if you listen to Fox News 424 hours a day or you read the New York time Then for the same news event that you exposed to you have very different filters And as you were saying this filters going to change everything And if I was saying that if we want to have the same filters on reality we It's more challenging to communicate and There is something good about it because you want The different opinions coming to so you don't want everyone to have the exact same or something about the reality And but also you want some common ground then the question how to balance it It's something that we don't really know how to do and it's always the same thing And then there's quite a difference is you've already raised Between telling someone else's story that is your story because you're engaging it and then telling your story which is much of I Believe what you have done is that you have told your own story She when we talk about From the experience of a person's that happened to leave in it It is something that cannot be Tall to somebody who have no clue What it means for instance To be in a situation knowing that What tomorrow would be like To be in a situation Whether they're going to be tomorrow or not to be in a situation where Somebody will be in charge of your life yourself Somebody will be giving you a margin order that You have to be left right or you shouldn't be there but In 21st century For me looking back The darkness and sadness Demonization and helpless and this is what The displaced person or refugees or immigrants Is the same thing just different names a different circumstances at the time in 21st century For me myself when I look at the suffering of the others knowing that I've been there But I'm not longer there I'm now a different person who is in a position to Talk about a sufferings of the other persons who Don't know how to say now who cannot I I Won't be and I don't want this and I don't want this and this is what I so I Always ask myself Why? any persons At the moment in 21st century should go through what I went through maybe 40 years ago At the time when the We the world's talking about the the global economy global environment What about the global humanity? Where we have to sometime to look at the time when we have a technology that We know What is happening in South Africa within 24 hours? Which was not like that 50 years ago 40 years ago Why a person have to fuck up in In a tree and climb in a boat risky a journey Without knowing what would happen in the middle of the oceans But they decided so These are the things that they the the rules should be addressing what make that persons be so desperate That To leave the place where he or she was born the place where any person is proud To call it home because the place where he was born Sometimes cannot replace even that how bad it is And then even the the metals of the the sense of where you what was born It's good because God created you to be in that place God didn't create a you to be in heaven Creating you to be in that place. So this is the miss that We in the world are not discussing To address the issue What makes a person so desperate? to risk his life or her life Seeing immigrants Washing out by the oceans and after the drown Seeing People risking their life to be shot at To go to rather side so I think there is something fundamental that We in the world that we are in especially we in a better world where we are today We have to look into it if there is a problem sin the home where I come from I think the solutions should be Can we address it? Can we find a solution to that problem so that? Simon will not risk his life for a journey with our knowing What will be ahead of that? I think that's the That discuss it if you want to do that So I'm thinking about Simon is the way that you Believe that people are inextricably tied to their homes, you know and are fundamentally identified to whole Sorry, I lost my the way that people are Fundamentally tied to their homes and the particular problems that refugees have When they are essentially homeless and stateless and Also the responsibilities then that governments have to create or not create a sense of home in those kind of interstitial moments when people are traveling and Morris I was wondering, you know at the Tenement Museum given your own research on home how People form those neighborhoods organically we're talking about that downstairs as Americans We assume that movement is natural we assume that people are created with Opportunities to go somewhere else where an end stage at least for the moment of That process but in most of the world it's very much like the the world that Simon speaks to people Didn't expect to move they moved only under the most desperate Circumstances so we tell the stories of people who for whom there was a differential the lower east side The streets were not paved with gold as the the language of of some of American history has it These were extraordinarily difficult circumstances People encountered struggle they were strangers. They weren't they weren't the victims of terror in the place to which they came In many cases they were victimized by terror in the places they left They came because there was marginally more opportunity and significantly more Safety the question then was how do you reconstruct something? How do you make a community when you're there? not because of of something that you had always dreamt of doing but Something that that was forced a choice that was forced on you because of conditions in the place you came from I mean, I I think of this personally what would I be at this age still? I don't know living in Poland if if My parents hadn't gone to Siberia and wound up wound up here I Don't know that if as an American I think oh, I can think of nothing worse than spending my life in Poland But so there there is a there are positive outcomes But we assume those positive outcomes and yet what we need to do is realize just what the difficult the difficulties are of that movement how How undesired that movement is in almost all cases so so came from look from the story why the borders were more open on the faulty is it because The situation in the state was after the depression there was a need for new power To come in and so they opened the borders a slight remote. It wasn't like they clear up and right because now we see that the borders are closing more and more But I think the economic situation of the people around Actually is better than what was on the 40s. I titled now the process. Why we closed the borders? In this particular moment in time in history We we have more resources to give we closed them for the first time in the 1920s In the laws of 1921 in 1924 established a racial system That determined who could enter this country and cut immigration back from a million a year to 150,000 a year Favourying people of superior racial backgrounds Northern Europeans Western Europeans cutting out altogether Asians cutting out altogether Africans and restricting to a handful Eastern and Southern Europeans so Eastern Europeans polls and Russian poll Russian Jews and Polish Jews had been entering at 300,000 a year They were cut back to 5,000 story the Holocaust is the story of the 1924 Johnson Redact Past in this country After the war there's a slight opening not because as And by the way then the key to those 1920 laws or that the United States was experiencing great prosperity in the 1920s it was one of our really great periods, but an awful lot of people in America Thought they were losing their country's identity. They were Agriculture collapsed essentially as a source of employment Small towns gave way and people whose lives were built up in In their identities were tied to rural America or small town America To what we would today call red state America Thought that they were losing the future and so they cut off anything that threatened to continue change in 1945 when the horror of the death camps became unavoidable President Truman wanted to allow In refugees to enter the country Congress wouldn't go along it believed that the same conditions that had prevailed in the 20s Still obtained Truman had signed an executive order that allowed literally a handful a couple of thousand survivors of the camps Into the United States Without congressional authorization in 48 they signed Congress passed the first refugee act that wound up allowing about 200,000 European refugees and and That included about 80,000 Jews actually more Ukrainians came in under that law It's an irony there Then Jewish survivors we didn't change our laws till 1965 In the city of the as part of the civil rights movement and now we're at another one of those moments probably with great prosperity And yet with people who who are losing There there it's like the 20s in a lot of ways people who are losing their sense of the nation Belonging to them and wanting to go back to a pre-civil rights America wanting to go back to a white America indeed to a white protest in America and That's where we are where we are and how it has been and some people would argue that there's a fundamental change in the economy not the Superficials of of prosperity or lack of prosperity It's economics and identity So if you take this another three of Lucky the 20s in 1920s then we should be really worried because we all know what happening in the 30s and the 40s What what happened was the same thing that's happening in the 30s and 40s in Europe Yeah seems to be happening again Yeah in in Europe right the irony for us is that usually after an election in some Emerging part of the world the American president calls up the new dictator and says will will be your will Collaborate with you as long as you respect for a rule of law and human rights and this time after our election was on Hala Merkel of all people who called Donald Trump to offer the same collaboration going forward if the United States respected human rights and rule of law There there's also such a difference between waves of immigration when there is some choice involved and the homo T for forced from home and that was the exhibit of Doctors without borders that forced from home and you've worked in many different kinds of refugee camps in different countries Yeah, when you were talking every my worked in Maban County in South Sudan and the Near the shilok people And You were I thought I heard you say how people Downplay that experience of being wrenched from your homeland how it really is You know a loss a death a grief, you know to be forced from home like you say but that there's the loss of the of the What you were saying you're God given Homeland, you know Now you know other people have used that idea anyway But it was I think that's true that people really you know We when we think of trauma even we think of well, it's somebody died or you you witnessed this But just the loss of homeland just the loss of of of of common language You know of but not just the the tongue but the Markers, you know Is so It's something you need to recover from you know that it's this loss and I was working With a very small group of people from Sudan who would take it were in a refugee camp in South Sudan and they had no Language and they had no word in their language for depression and so I was trying to explain What's depression and we were trying out different words and? the educated people in that spoke Arabic and then their native language and And then so we're going back between the few languages trying to figure out You know what is depression? You know when people are crying and they can't get over it and they're staring out the window and they can't function And they said oh you mean when you're missing your village You know and so that became our word for depression like missing your village You know that it's that fundamental, you know that it's a it's a It's a mental illness to to be wrenched from home, you know, I always remember that and You know talking to I Was Talking to a young man from Central America the other day Who had to flee his father was murdered by gangs, you know and the You know his father was murdered all these horrible things happened, but the biggest component of the grief was The the future that he had anticipated in his own place his own God Yes in place, you know And that he was never going to have that again and that one person with a gun could take that away from him the rest of his life You know I really think we estimate that I mean the idea that people are crawling over our you know borders to take our jobs or some Thing like that But you know then I think in this goes back to the story telling then Can it really be only people who've experienced this who understand are there? You know like when you tell the story of the 1920s immigration laws I Wasn't there, but I'm having that experience right now. I can understand your story right of how the in prosperity xenophobia Arises So I didn't have I have you know, how do we create these? environments where the language where people can understand people who have not been rinsed from their home can Understand the severity of that and and you know or people who have not been oppressed can understand what that really means and how wrong it is and Hopefully, you know so that people who are oppressing Can understand what they are doing and stop doing it But that that presumes empathy And it can't be presumed Yeah, I will go to my grave presuming They can't take that away from me Home is such an elemental concept But even if we haven't been driven from our home or nation Or the people whose language that we share that idea of leaving home is Something that we can all that we've all encountered even if it's just that struggle. Let's say to leave home and I was telling you that we I was recently in Greece at a refugee camp and One of the camps it was a Syrian camp And it had just opened about two years ago and the people who had the military who organized the camp Basically just organized people numerically and they gave them their boxes they call them isoboxes to live in based on whatever number that they happen to be assigned when they entered So all of the mostly Syrian families were there and they were just organized numerically, but then over the space of one summer they reorganized themselves according to communities or tribal affiliations or whatever kinds of smaller cultures They wanted to affiliate with and I think that that was a really powerful experience The amount of agency that any one person has When they are in refugee camp was remarkable to me You know the idea of being able to leave your box and where would you go? You needed to have an appointment at another box or you need to be you know You need to have an appointment with the medical staff where you need to be going to a class But people didn't just walk around and wonder what they might do for the afternoon I mean this idea of what it means to be home or what it means to be at work Or what we currently call a third space right that place that we hang out with our people You know this is something that's really missing in a camp and it was it was somewhat remarkable to me that the people would Organize the camp. I mean certainly for reasons of efficiency, which are completely understandable You know that they would just organize people numerically, but it was also Wonderful to see the agency that people took Upon themselves to reorganize and to see how that was allowed for you know that shift once there We've had that in this country with the resettlement the refugee resettlement program has put people You know the long here and this and everybody has reconfigured themselves You know that there was a study like within five years everybody had Migrated to find their own people and create the little Italy's in the Chinatowns and the the things that that people need I also saw that in South Sudan where there was a Society that was organized around shakes and so they all moved themselves around and we would call the different parts of the camp according to the the shay who you know I'm going to Shake so and so's part. I'm going to the according to the clans the whole camp had been renamed as opposed to ABC According to But even among economic migrants who are much more fortunately situated in a city like New York You've got dozens of hometown societies organized by Mexican villages. You've got these hometown associations organized by Chinese regions and and communities and if you go back in time you'll have in the on the Lower East Side the Lonsman Shaftan people who came from some god forsaken village in Ukraine and Banded together with others of that same background because there's something of home That that was that significant to their identity to who they were to really empower them to help make their way in this very strange world You see There is a word which we learned people like me that it said nothing like home And come down to Why you replace home to your refugees can This is a refugee scale there have to be something Undescribables that took home away and make you a displaced persons and Nobody within this audience Can describe it Be a refugee more than a person's who was from home and become a refugee for instance We all know about their slavery you read from the books how bad it is demonizations and but If you tell me to explain to you You will be in tears different from what you read in the book because there are certain things that a Person have to withhold it within inside you cannot throw it out Nobody should be a refugee What should be a displaced persons? That's my opinions and If that's the case why we have a Flow millions and millions of refugees again at the time when we talk about Globalizations and so on and we have the beautiful organization here talk about the issues Which they supposed to be responsible about the UN We sometimes make me to be disappointed Of the UN how it move away from the principles of the university declaration of the human rights When you have and you mentioned in southern students Where at the moment with speaking we have about four millions southern Sudanese our refugees Question is why? Yes southern Sudan has been from refugees to the refugees Since the time of independent of sedans in 1965 The war has been going on and on and off and on and so on in other words From the refugees to the refugees to the refugees Even those those who find better like me There is nothing to replace home I remember when I went back to southern Sudan The place where there is nothing absolutely nothing there is no running water. There is toilet. There is no nothing absolutely, you know it But I feel something joy I feel like even that I didn't eat for a day There is no hunger because I feel full Of home It is not compared to my daughter, which was born here if I took her over there There's no connections. She will be like I'm going home Which is where he's supposed to be so the point I'm trying to make I think we have to have a commons of Humanity in us Where we have to look at? The problem what make people become refugees Sometimes it is very complicated To explain to the person who was not but to me for instance if people of southern Sudan Become refugees then there is somebody is responsible The father of the house of southern Sudan is responsible It is in my house if my kids running around then who is going to be blamed It have to be me as a father Somebody have to say and say we have to hold these call these person and explain to us like this Father why his kids are running around making thing difficult for the others and That's it, you know, I feel very strongly that the solutions to any Crisis where vis-a-vis Immigrants and refugees is it's not to bring them into your house The solution have to be home Because bringing it to your house is not a solution at all The question if if it is a solution, how many you are willing to take? Because yes, there is Go to East and Asia there are maybe a hundred a million the one to come in your house Go to Africa. There's another hundred million go to Europe go to Anyway in the world if your place is a better place for these problems How many you willing to take? And that's why I feel very strongly always Where the refugees came from We have to address it what made them to be a refuge now the world talk about the refugees of Syria. Yes, I Personally half as a lasset He's responsible if he's responsible, how can we let him? replace destroyed life of millions, and he is one person's And then now we have a crisis the problem blaming I was why you're not taking 10 and why you're not taking 20 and why you're not taking 30 Why we don't even take one man out and let people stay in where God given right? Do you think that there's a difference and this is to the whole group Between those who feel they have to leave their homeland because of famine or drought or Some uncontrollable nature aspect versus a power dynamic versus a totalitarian Submission aspect because I I would imagine that the way the psyche processes that is quite different It's one thing to be you know upset I mean we know that the river is drying comes back to us, but it's a different thing Then let's saying someone from another cult within your own religion or a tribe within your own country push you for survival and I wonder Have there been studies of the different kinds of trauma in that regard? Did you see anything different from the Afghans and the Syrians for instance and So I guess I'm struck because how the psyche processes it is very different from how the UN and International law codifies it right so at the camps that I was at the Syrian refugees were given very different resources and treatment then at another camp where the Iraqis and Afghans were because the Afghans and Iraqis were not going to be eligible for refugee status because they weren't considered to have fled as war time refugees whereas the Syrians Were going to be entitled for refugee status therefore their children got to go to Greek schools They lived in very different kinds of circumstances in terms of the psyche I think that they did understand that they had a different status Which was one that was more prospective You know they were able to look toward their future and see a different place I mean to your point Simon the Iraqis and the Afghans knew that ultimately I think they were going to have to go back home and in a different way than you mean it I think which is that going back home is a kind of healing return. They didn't see it that way Because it wasn't going to be that way for them So I think that that's a real difference in how people are treated as refugees You know those conditions under which they left. Yeah, I totally agree that the differences are artificial differences that we impose all displacement is because of inequality It's all All a power dynamic People who came You know My grandparents came because there was less there and more here That's a power dynamic. It was unfair. Who's wrong? You know, it's all because of injustice and then we compound it by making Categories, I think you know when we treat people with trauma, I mean to me And I'm not a researcher so I just make this stuff up You know, but the big difference is the level of helplessness that was involved right and that a traumatic You know, which is why sexual violence is so difficult to get over because it's it you've lost control over what comes into your own body right it's just So the the level of disruption and and so if I have been Raised knowing that the world is unjust my whole life and then I'm going to have to make decisions based on that injustice and do the best I can I might be less traumatized when I move to to save my So then if I grew up thinking There is maybe some you know that there is justice in order in the world and then I violently find out that there isn't and have to flee in the middle of the night however, I would say that all of this is power dynamics and that we have a world of globalization and All it does is give us more information about how unequal it is, you know that now any kid in Wherever me and mark can be on his Facebook seeing what other people have that he doesn't have you know That that's what globalization has given us and not read distribution Distribution do you think the way? Your topic and say you have the power now to change dynamic is there even a solution to that Yes, I mean, I think you know, I think we're always Trying I mean, I think humanity has always tried to evolve situations of greater justice and greater distribution You would just not going to interrupt anyone. No, no, please just it, but I would challenge them Yeah, I don't think that that's hardwired into us by the way, and I say that without evidence except as a historian Yeah Because Simon was saying we should let everyone go back But the conflict brought people away from me and And we were saying that people want to protect what they have so why should I give more Texts more money from what I'm earning lose my income for other people that's coming I Want to protect it so so the This feeling of honor I've Two meanings right and I think it's the source of the conflict First it's like it's like really pure feeling of this is where I belong and The other is this is mine and not yours, right? So it's also create a boundary between one and another and this is why people if you take serious for example, it's not like an Asset that is in power it's a minority the alloy that controlled the majority of the Sunic and They know that if they will lose The Sunic without their majority going to Pinance them so it's fight of their life and it's also their own and and And the question because we cannot fix it from the outside And then we cannot open the borders for everyone that want to come In this dynamic I think we a bit stuck I as liberal as we do not know how to fix it and as conservative they don't know how to fix it then and Sometimes I'm feeling that We don't really discuss the complexity of the situation and And we go to the place that is our comfort zone we believe everyone are equal for example that Something that we can operate with but we don't know how to make it a pen I don't know how to fix it I Think there is something she mentioned about when she passed all of us but the kind of refugees and immigrants because There are too so many layers when it comes to Immigrants or those who the refugees there are those who want to go to choose for the better life there are those who false to become displaced persons and this is the real refugees in my opinion and And come down to what I said before about why a person have to be refugees What is the problems and if we? Genuineing I'm not talking about we talk about the the global rule that which is today Focus and invest in in solutions of the crisis of very refugees to diagnose why they become people become refugees I Things will be better than investing in Sending the refugees things and so on and so on and so on it will be less cheaper by If saw the students refugees are four millions and the father of that saw the student in the problems And and we focus on that person Why he became a problem and identify and address this and solve these things I think we will save ourself You know time and energy and resources of debating one another and a qi you know taking and why You refuse into text for instance It my opinion is the world should have to look and invest in Solving the problem what met the refugees as refugees I guess what you're saying is who is this for who's the world who is the world the United do nothing nations Because Based on it is this true. That's why we keep you know going because we are not they are there because all the The country the nations where the problem come they sit where and they sit in one place, which is the UN Let's take two examples listen to him in Iraq It was governed by the tactic the capital right Saddam Hussein the US went in To cover the country replace it with like a democratic government and the country collapsed I don't think something good came of the Iraq war. Maybe Isis came out of it. Hey take Syria Obama was about to attack Syria and At the end he decided to back off and not to put military ground on Syria, right? And then the lesson came into Syria are they fixing it? Who will fix Syria? I will fix the luck it's As you think it's like the people in the place Need to fix their country and if and if they cannot Because the power dynamic and I agree everything is about power dynamics is too complicated It's very difficult from the outside to fix it and and and now we really stuck in in in the crisis and And because everything is connected. It's one thing Syria on you like it coming out to Europe and I would say in Europe and exchanging the US and we are all part of this dynamic because it's a global world in the centers everything is connected and It's a very serious Problem that we don't know how to fix And we have for a long time To go back to barbers question about Is there a difference between people leaving for one circumstance or another? Obviously people who leave because their lives are at risk are one end of a continuum and People who leave because there's some differential that they think that life could be better Somewhere else are at the other end, but people have been leaving for both of those reasons Leading places for a very long time whether it's the idiot sons of English aristocrats who realize there was nothing for them If they stayed in England in the in the early 17th century and wound up Populating the American or leading the American south or whether it was people whose whose livelihoods disappeared as Europe industrialized in the late 19th century Whether it's people who fled a flood of war in none of those power Embalances has anyone figured out how to stabilize Sending societies different as the dynamic involved in the sending was I don't want anyone to think that Leaving England because you're a cavalier as opposed to a Puritan is the same as as leaving Syria Because your life is in imminent danger Well, yeah, I mean maybe this is going too far off track, but one thing I've always been perplexed by is the desire to colonize right like that's like Because we're always dealing with people who are fleeing You know like who don't want to leave home because they're fleeing or then we talk You know, so that's a refugee and an immigrant is somebody who thinks there's something better on the other side I mean, what's a colonizer like that's really sick Which is how this country started like it like what's that that you leave your home to go take somebody else's? How does that fit into this? Sorry, I'm like way off, but you know when I go to these places. I I really it really puzzles me Like why do people want to take other people's homes? Instead of improving their own because that's what colonialism is answering your own question your question was Why don't we find a way to improve societies where they are and the answer is we haven't And we haven't for a very long time Colonization is one element to that one aspect of it And I think that is that this the The argument should be focused on and that's why I said before there is nothing like home For instance, and I seen the works of doctors without borders In many places in the south of Sudan even before the peace agreement between the north and the south I always take a risk to go to into the war zones And sometimes We have to carry the patience for the whole day and Reach to the where the deltas without borderized station I in the midnight and I remember I was in northern by the south which is not enough and I and The child and a mom They just felt six and you know something had to be done all day and we have two doctors with us but there's no medicines and According to them if we find a medicine these people will Will survive if we are not going to find a medicine then within 48 hours they So we have to walk for nine hours To reach where the doctors without border so in my opinion The investments of the argument should be finding a solution And wish that the doctors without borders and instead of they because they like their life sometimes are in dangerous You know it. I don't need to tell you how many your workers in in in my band was kills in in in in because the The environment is hostile environments So the solution have to be invested in finding a solution where they is and the doctor without border instead of risking They have to go there and train a person. Okay, and instead of you relying on Tradition medicines which probably you know there are people in my band are lying They're on medicine because there is no other way to find Doctors, so this is where the focus in my opinion should be today in a state of taking Four million Syrian refugees whom are now need to get our who already refugees to take them somewhere To my opinion. That's not a solution to take four million in southern Sudanese who are now refugees in their own country Is not a solution we have in Uganda one and a half million southern Sudanese They're living in in in life I don't want to describe it There is no dignity by Being a dispersed person in a place which is not your own For you to survive you have to do ABC And you just figured out what do I mean by ABC to survive? But if we find a solution to their home believe it or not I would write there Be in my village you mentioned before and Figured out how would I survive whether I want to go to the river in Nile to get a fish? in instead of be in an hostile environment where There is no dignity of my child There is no sense of human of home I become homeless and helpless So I think that's this that's what we in the world have to be addressing And I'm just you know who am I to to to to to tell the world There are so many different levels to address here and it seems to me though that it's Also really important to address the ethical practice of how we respond to people in need Even while maybe the primary Response needs to be to fix the situation because there are always going to be people in need on the sidewalk Right in front of this building that are displaced and that are homeless So the question becomes I think how do we ethically respond? You know we don't have any behavioral A con economist on the panel who could explain game theory and why we take from other people You know like they have to have something and we want it so we take it and it would be maybe Interesting to have somebody like that on this panel But how do we how do we respond ethically with the few resources that we have? and I continue to you know to Reflect as I hear you talk about the primacy of home and how that may change for any of us depending upon where We've been raised. I mean in Queens where I'm from I Don't feel a really powerful affiliation with Queens as if I'd be ripped out of my home If you know to like God and then God thank you So, you know what is it about certain circumstances that evoke that really powerful Elemental affiliation where if you did not live there then you're homeless You know that's a really powerful thing to say and what are the various conditions that shift for people You know that makes some people have that primary affiliation and others not But is it really the case that it's not if if we will take you and Departure out of the US and Africa what you feel displaced not from Queens to Brooklyn Yeah, I would feel yeah if I had to move to Staten Island I think Really displaced Yeah, so who are your people right? That's always the question is how how do you constitute a community of people around you? You know you're asking what kinds of resources are available actually pointing to how few resources there are It's really how few resources we make available because resources are in in the case of homes for those seeking better lives They're nearly There's there are so many that they're uncountable We we had from Simon the numbers of refugees 4 million here 4 million there those are large numbers until you realize that this country alone Between 1865 and 1914 took in 25 million people that's a big and got nowhere near full Nowhere near full So the resources are there what's missing is the empathy the will the willingness to Not so much share Because with one mindset we realize that we are enriched by movement we've we've talked about people who are displaced and and moving and Seeking something we can shift that to the society that societies that in the past have welcomed them and Part of our argument that the tenement museum and all history is an argument by the way science is not I understand that you free but part of our argument is that almost anything we could point to in terms of this country's Prosperity its culture its dynamism Literally its health is the result of immigration and To cut ourselves off from that now you don't need to repaul Krugman or David Brooks, though I do To to to hear the argument pulled out of the literature that if we do this we do ourselves Really to economic not just lack of growth, but ultimately in significance and boredom and well that too. Yeah People like us are blessed to be given an opportunity And we cannot take this for granted and that's why some of us we Felt that being here is a place but at the same time we have to stay and Look after those who are not Fortunate to get what we get and we become the voice of those who have no voice We speak on people who have cannot speak for themselves for instance one time I have About 300,000 southern Sudanese flee from Egypt after they was attacked by the police in a gift since that In front of the UN in Cairo Because what happened was that there was being considered as refugees without knowing where they're gonna go and then when southern Sudan's Peace was being signed between the north and the south all the issue of the refuge through their name already there they Nobody talk about it because nobody sure what would be the future of southern Sudan is going to be a piece within or Independence or separate to countries So they want to know and then they went and you know peacefully camps in front of the UN in Cairo and then The UN call on this Egyptian security We're almost 100 and something people were skills So they they they felt that they are not welcome in Egypt and then some of them takes a risky journey to a crossing the border from Egypt all the way to Israel and The numbers at that time but 28 people who went there We got information there are southern Sudanese being detained because they are carrying the Sudanese passport saying that you cannot You can go anywhere, but you cannot go to? Bela daradu the enemy country that's Israel to them So Israelis of course there was very concerned People coming without knowing then they're coming from and a country which is hostile to them So they want to know who are they and so on I have to get involved some there because they cannot reach to the levels of the government to To to tell they the the the the Israeli that these are not your enemy. These are people who just Run for their life. They run from southern Sudan They end up in Egypt assuming that there is safety there they're being attacked in Egypt and that's why they came here They are not even threat to you Because if you ask them that do you have a problem with Israel? They're gonna say no, that's why they came here. So I'm begging you let them give them a chance Yes, that peace agreement until Six years from now We'll southern Sudan probably will become independence even nobody believe me then so I have to be loving on their on their behalf and we end up with 30,000 southern Sudanese People from the north people from the arforean and the issue of refugees in Israel become a crisis at the same time But I have maintained my position with them that these are people Who are not seeking to be here? Believe it or not One sudden Sudan become independent all these people are going to go back Because to me as I said before there is nothing like home and you cannot replace home because Running away from where you was born is not a solution Then who is going to remain there? If that's the case then let find any place where there are problems in the world and take everybody out of there And then they're going to be a crisis where we putting them to so Eventually they was given a chance of opportunity and so on and then southern Sudan to come independence And all these are refugees who happened from southern Sudan all of them are back in southern Sudan Even though very unfortunately We didn't respect what happened in southern Sudan today should have happened So come to the to the to the argument of refugees the solution always have to be home and We have to address why a person have to go. Yes, if there is a way where we can give him because we are human being Sometimes even we Hear when somebody begging for something you always if you have you feel some kind of humanity We give even the law say that you don't do that But I'm a human being my conscious telling me that I have to do that and that's even why people like me was given Opportunity in this country and that's why people like me should not take that opportunity And then look for my own affairs and instead of looking for the affairs of the others I think Simon there's a piece underneath that that you're really addressing Though which is a sense of choice. I mean some people would choose to leave Some people would choose to go back but the most profound sense of displacement is when you don't feel you have choice and I mean I probably would be among those Would flee as I did from Rochester, New York, you know, and Others would certainly want to go homes But the issue is that that sense of autonomy and that's what gets taken away in terms of the displacement the refugee Situation it is absolutely and if you look at that those who was given a choice The majority will then will prefer to go home if there's a my place will be a place where I will For instance, and I will speak for myself as an American sitting with this suit What for bend me not to go back to saw the students and in my village and make that place a place to look like United States If there is environment safety and peace and security in that place and That's why we have to focus on what make people to become a refugee because those who flee of the conflicts Their numbers are you compare to those who flee with with a choice of Immigrant or better life Those who have been driven by when I talk about millions in southern Sudan These are people who did a choose Compared to somebody who want to okay. I want to go to Brussels for instance But these two four millions if you ask them where a Brussels data have no idea So we leave the issue of me immigrant those who want to leave for individuals Who want to take a risk a gambling to? to explore the world but a human being should not be a Refugees well, I think we're talking about the difference between choice and force that and the power dynamic as you were saying I mean you're a you you chose to you chose to move to a country different from the country of your birth so you're talking you come from a Perspective that is different than this Yeah, this is why I'm not a few three I because someone is right. I wasn't forced out. It's a very different It was your choice it was my I will never say that I'm in the future. I mean that would be like email to say so I had options in my country and I had options over and I choose to come and explode them and I'm following my dreams and the society give me opportunity to follow my dreams I have only to be thankful. I cannot do and that is not a crisis. That's not the crisis Refugees who might be in this place. Yeah I have a question I want us to get into before we wrap up and ask for questions Were you surprised by the outpouring of support in this country? for Organizations that deal with refugees and human rights ACLU International Rescue Committee doctors at that borders when they were threatened I I one has the sense that people found that they really had a value in the acceptance and Facilitating of others and that that but it took a crisis it took a challenge Before that really came out. Could you could you address that? Morris sure I think that what you're speaking to is that What has for a long time been the dominant American narrative the story we tell ourselves about who we are and where we come from and probably a majority of Americans believe that the immigrant story is their story and a Conscious denial of that narrative threatens their sense of who they are and there and really their their Deepest values the question is how long that can be maintained. It's it's it's not just a matter of being able to Mobilize people or or have them write checks. There's a political system out there that doesn't necessarily respond to the majority or responds to a majority that's constructed and reconstructed and is There are powers that play here that threaten that narrative So where we are right now at least when it comes to the stories we tell ourselves To storytelling and empathy at that level. We're in a good place What our feet what my fear is will we be in that good place? Five years from now a generation from now That's what's scary. I was joking to my wife who's sitting behind me earlier today that while there we're being part we are rightfully paranoid about what's going on today as Opposed to the 60s, which is the last time I recall This level of oh my god. They're out to get us this time the FBI and the CIA on our side Who would have thought? Oh Yeah, I just think of the power of visual storytelling in the media in in terms of how it I Think galvanized a response for people. I think about that now famous image news image of the little boy in Aleppo sitting in the back of an ambulance and And how so many people saw in that little boy children and vulnerable children and and trauma you know for once a face of what trauma looked like you know to just see that boy So disconnected from whatever was in front of him and it really Galvanized people as as well as I think the image that had come out in the news of maybe a few months before of The little child who drowned on lispost right and how that got people speaking in a way that we weren't quite speaking before And have you have you seen an outpouring of more attention? Um, yeah, I mean we're all raking in the cash. Yeah, but I mean there um, you Know even this nation of immigrants thing is a story because the history is its a Country that colonized and other people and then imported a lot of people to involuntary slavery to build a country. That's That's this what this country is. Yeah, okay And then some people immigrated after all of that, you know Um, so even that's a story and the fact that we can see the face of trauma in that little Syrian boy, but we can't see it When a child is shot by the police in our or by a vigilante, you know in our own communities Um, so it's It's always difficult as much as I'm I will go to my grave being an optimist They are never gonna take that away from me, you know because I really believe that's the last thing You know, I've been rereading Victor Frankle a lot. You know, I really um, they can't have that, you know, um but um Where am I going with it, you know that it's It's that these are illusory victories, I guess, and that we still need the big victory, you know the one And who is the we that's going to drive? I don't know That's going to redistribute everything Equitably and sustainably and Make it snow in February again and Um I don't know but um so so Um You know not to be cynical but just to be accepting of the fact that there's always a lot of things going on at once and so that the um outpouring of goodwill towards refugees and immigrants is um, I I Is a lot due to compassion and a lot due to self-preservation that I I I want to be sure that we are not this guy, you know, I want to be sure I um went to the woman's march with a sign saying white women we need to do better Right because 50 and 53 percent of white women voted for trump And white women would say to me really But not me I didn't And to me that's our country, you know, so I want to be at this march to be sure that that's not me You know, but what What are we doing to change the conditions that create these things? It's just really what you're saying, you know, what are we doing to create the to change the conditions that create displacement What are we doing to to change the conditions that created this Hopefully very temporary regime that we're facing and so so is this outpouring of of funding and goodwill Really changing the the conditions and I don't want to down I think it's great You know, I don't want to say I don't want to be cynical about that because Maybe this is what's going to get Everybody thinking and and willing to mobilize on a whole new level um You know, I I I You know I Have seen that in my life, you know, gay people can get married in this country now. I mean In my lifetime, you said you people thought you were crazy to say that south Sudan would be an independent country I mean we have seen things that were unthinkable, you know, I mean we You know, I think we we forget thing and we forget like when HIV hit this city what was going on? I mean that that felt like You know an unimaginable Um and and the reactions and the othering talk about othering right. I mean the the pariah, you know, and These things change they do go for the better and you know, um and so I just This this is part of going towards The better, but it's not it. I guess, you know that the outpouring is just a little part of it. I guess I don't Yeah, well to be more inclusive here in the room. Um, I would like to ask anyone who would Of course, and you know For what this country has given to me and I seen it's given to the others in the world I still believe that the generosity that come from america Will steal there and I'm very optimistic Based on what I Have seen that american has given to the others To the point that you mentioned even today we have in a book where American can bring in the settlement program 250,000 a year There is no side things in any other countries that we have you know Numbers which is being fixed Uh, you go to england. They don't have that thing you go to german. You go to anywhere But in america there is even sometime go beyond that so I'm really uh, remain better optimist of american in generosity And and and and we have that's why we're talking about that. We should not Try as in a country or immigrants. We should not take things for granted. Let's look After others who have no voice and let be their voice Okay, thank you very much So, um, if anyone would like to ask a question I'm going to keep this constructed to questions not not statements And I have to apologize in advance if I have to cut off anybody, but i'm going to if I need to So Please would you begin for us? Yes, um I'm probably i'm not allowed to say this but I really want to make the moderator feel a little better Only about 12 percent of white women voted for donald trump You know if you go back only 50 percent of the population voted 25 percent of the population voted for trump another 25 Maybe half the women now the question thank you all so much, but I do have a quick question Thank you for allowing me to say that. I really want her to feel better. Yeah the um No, I want to feel better. I want to do better Do you think And you're so you each have so much wisdom. Do you think that? That we as americans have become so in your to to suffering To displacement to violence to trauma that that has a very Serious consequences on the way we respond to it and if the answer is yes What if anything are we or can we do about? indifference towards trauma violence I'll defer I'm supposed to be the moderator, but i'm going to put my two cents in here. No, no, no. I don't mind Tupperay. I don't have that kind of complex, but um I think the capacity to feel shame Has been extremely important. I think the outpouring of support has come from a feeling of shame and a feeling of shame of what goes on within our own culture That we really have to allow ourselves to feel it is an impetus and a stimulus, but i'd like to hear americans through philanthropy Probably give only tens of billions of dollars a year to deal specifically with Those issues the issues of those who are underserved The issues of those who are in some ways unfortunate that's not matched anywhere in the world I would not make the case that we're that it's the best way or that it's effective totally effective But if you're talking about people's feelings That somehow there is something unjust out there and they ought to address it And offer a lot of people in this country address it through their pocketbooks There is a feeling that something dark happened and I think we feel it and we are afraid of it now from the same And we all I think this is there is a lot of fear and most of us came today to talk about it And I think it's only the beginning because it's It happened a few months only two months ago Even less I So I think when at the beginning, I think it's not going to change quickly I think it's going to be way darker than it is now So we all wore it and we all think how to change and I think we need to act as you are doing basically You're going out and trying to change and someone trying to change and Only by We tend to be active with in a way and Expecting that it would be a long process Maybe we will win at the end You did mention, you know There's always A homeless person in front of us, you know outside the like We can all start there like today, you know Like you don't have to send a hundred dollars to doctors without borders You can give a dollar to that person and I really believe You know, that's You know You know That's what we're doing to Whatever you called it, you know if we've been in your to suffering like Let's make sure let's they can't do that to us like they can't You know, we will defend our right to give a dollar to somebody who may not deserve it You know, they can't have that Sorry You should really make me set up We're comparing Americans attitudes towards immigration in the 1920s versus now Is the issue more Not so much the relative wealth of a country, but the amount of inequality in the country I've read that Well, any cause a major problem now and it hasn't been this bad since the 1920s. So maybe that's the common thread It I would say yes inequalities in issue, but the displacement is the larger issue People by the 1920s who had Spent their lives and assumed that their futures would be in small towns in New Hampshire Or in farms on the Great Plains That had been ripped from them by economic change by The transformation the industrialization of agriculture by the rise of industry In the same way today. This isn't this is Joseph Stiglets's argument. This is their so People today Who are? Industrial workers or coal miners and those are the the constituencies we've heard most about in the last year Those folks have seen their world disappear Their world is being displaced by Silicon Valley and all the best and the brightest coming in on h1b visas and disrupting everything All right, that's that's the similarity. It's it's uh, I don't think it's poverty and Much as I don't like inequality I don't think it's inequality either and by the way the 20s happened 10 years after the United States began to seriously Address the question of inequality to the progressive income tax and any number of other Literally progressive measures like laws against child labor. So the 20s were a good time if you're looking at the the trajectory towards social justice much better than now I think there's been a lot of science psychological studies that claim that Your relative well-being is not as important as how you compare other people in that in terms of their total happiness If everyone's poor Doesn't bother people as much as when you're poor and you see other people very wealthy And yet the people who most loudly speak against inheritance taxes are people with nothing So a lot I would like to believe that logic matters I've You know, I've got a PhD and demonstrated I could keep that keep a consistent thought through 300 pages of text Uh, I don't think it does I don't think if we if we tell them that it's their health insurance that they'll lose they won't do that They'll do that anyway So that's another issue why Americans vote against their own interest I want to address something Athena said That you believe very deeply that there is an innate empathy The people who do you believe that the concept of the other is also innate? It's been certainly through every civilization we know every time we know um Mm-hmm. What do you think of that? Yeah, maybe they go together. I don't know that's yeah. Yeah Unfortunately, um Yeah It's still shocking The you know and and how it meant I mean south to then is shocking how the People can slaughter each other after having fought so long for their Freedom from another entity that was slaughtering it's it's shocking. It's it's shocking um I don't know if you've read Maybe I'm going off on a tangent here, but Sebastian younger's uh latest thing about Um Yeah, tribe. Yeah, but that that um Um, oh no, it wasn't in that I was reading something else. Anyway, that's really interesting stuff in there about how the actually the Symptoms of PTSD are more from the the loss of connection than from the actual thing that happened to us And I see that in my work a lot my current work which is working with uh expatriates when they come home from very difficult situations and There's definitely a correlation between those who are still connected to a A base and those who have lost that connection from working all over the world so much that Totally I subscribe to that, but no, I was reading something else on combat by this um Bill clays piece in the times no his um vessel band or it's no it's anyway a guy who writes military stuff and um saying And he's talking about resili- preparing warriors for resilience blah blah blah, but he's saying that there's um uh There is a taboo in all cultures against a human killing a human You know Yeah, yeah that guy. What's his name? Yeah him. Yeah, yeah, yeah Um Right, that's like that was a really that was soldiers on this on purpose and they They don't actually That's one aspect right but then and then that the trauma of killing somebody is not just a trauma It's a taboo trauma, you know what I mean? Like it's it's just so wrong So Where am I going with this? I don't know where I'm going with this I'm saying they're boasted maybe you're right that they're both innate and that their flip sides of the same coin maybe I'm not sure that I know that they're both innate and that the only way that you can overcome that taboo is to other The only way that you can overcome your natural empathy. Okay. Now it's making sense Yes, we're hardwired for empathy. I don't know. He's the hardwired guy. Don't ask me. I make all this up That you know our natural inclination is empathy and and and love and unicorns And the only way to do it is to is is is to Other somebody and make them less than human and that's what you see all over the world in these conflicts where people Just make somebody less and and I think that's why I've been going Back so much to reading When I started working with riff Refugees reading Literature from the Holocaust, you know, how can people think this of each other? How does this work in their heads? It's the oppressors that fascinate me, you know, like how does that happen? Then Yuri from your work So, you know, so I'm coming from a dynamical system perspective and not from innate Perspective so I would say the following it up And I can connect it easily to the other cost and I'll go up in in in Israel and being so and by like second generation and first generation survivors and There was was the question. How did German could be so evil? Right. How can they not to operate the camps and any two? It's like it's not human, right? And again Realization that Each human being and it doesn't include each one in the room, okay? No one is excluded from that every divine aspect and a dark aspect And it's all a matter of dynamic of the play between them and and sometimes The best can come from human and sometimes the worst can come from the same human and and being in difficult situation and I was in combat situation. I saw dark things coming from people that I loved and I was really surprised by it and This is human and I think it's a matter of times and context I can remember even there was like out black out in Manhattan for three days from 23rd below And my friend that was living there was saying that after two days of people become kind something become more nasty even in this very rich Manhattan Island, right? So it's two about all of us and And as humans what we need we need to strive to bring the best in ourself even in dark times And and that's what we need to do and I think We need to find a way to to improve the dynamics even when it's spiraling down and start to get pretty dark You have to come and I think you have to come up and get in line here Thank you. Did you want to say any and do you want to come down? It's better. Yeah Okay I'm from South Sudan and we go back and forth My person is How could you let a government could be such an other countries Because we talk about this this place and refugees so Displaced people they do not choose to lick their homes Right now I have my own family my my sister and 16 other kids they ran off So basically if they don't run it are they gonna be killed or otherwise So how could we stop a detector government from doing that to each people? Is there a way either the UN or the US because South Sudan didn't come independently that the US fight And everybody in other american helped us to be free And I believe Whatever they are doing to each other is absolutely wrong And I remember earlier someone mentioned about certain things he don't want to touch or he don't want to it's dehumanizing We are talking about children getting raped women getting raped And not only that couple of days ago they announced that South Sudan is Is stopping basically the whole country is stopping to death that family So This is It's like getting out of control. So how can we intervene at the US or the UN To stop this from getting out of control like completely I Prepare you guys check it first and then uh, no, I'm not I don't know the the political solution. I you know Yeah, okay, okay Political power about humanitarian because if people are fleeing or they're hungry the whole country is stopping Should we do anything or you know to help them at at least like humanitarian Assistant, yeah, I mean the only thing that's happening in South Sudan is humanitarian assistant There's no government functioning that I know of I don't know maybe Yeah, actually, yeah, what my sister here saying it is What she's asking it is the question being asked by the four million that I talked about before uh, that question is being asked by 280 000 Uh, those whom are under the united nations protections And you know them even in jubah in jungula in apanil Since 2013 They are in the capital, but they cannot get out But because of the security of the president Will execute them even to the point that the security are just around there in jubah the capitals Uh, there was something terrible happened Uh to those who came out Including the angios who went there to work and help them They will be attacked by the bodyguard or the president uh, american citizens humanitarian with rapes Uh, in that in the capitals And nothing being said by the u.s. So the question she asking it is a genuine question Uh, southern Sudan didn't fall from the sky and become a nation in one night It went through the united state congress a united state senate the president of united states that Put a bill called sudan peace act to stop the war between the north and the south And which that the president and his follows and we're talking about all parties by the way There was nothing happened for the two party to come together To to vote as one block Except in the case of sudan peace act Where that the issue that the slavery have to be stopped The war the longest war in the in the world have to be stopped between the north and the south And based on that seeing everything being signed by the president become law Uh, you had yet to have an obligation to assist Billions of dollars to the people of sudan's Humanities and others follow because when american take the lead Other would follow and then there was given a chance because there was a debate whether The the the the referendum should be delayed or not I personally I went walk barefoot in all the offices of the elected official in the congress And in the senate to deliver to them address them one each individual If you if you delay these referendum then there's a The the bomb will go up because southern Sudanese then you're telling them that Then you remain go back to the miserable situation so the war will go back against so the southern Sudan was given a chance Independent was a referendum was conducted in sousadisto understand the defendant through american help After we did that help that we give them millions of billions of dollars People who doesn't know how to balance the books Without accountability without even somebody to follow what this money being used for for the first time to have a nations Uh come out when we depend on with wealth in their hands oil money In the in the hands of individual who doesn't have an account that was fighting war and so the president offers become a place where You become rich in one night Where millions are being stolen every day in the office of the president by his relative and so on and so on For god sake if you guys are aware of it four billion dollars Was distributed by the president to his cabinet Because he's taking a big chunk about of that and then later on he turned around to tell them that bring the money back And then now we have joj kuni I leading this investigation of recovering this much that I'm going to be covered All we need in southern Sudan today is to recover The life of a child who is dying now And then since the world came out last week that there is a femme in southern Sudan they talk about 20 people a day die in our hunger and it steals uh we're still talking with the man who is in charge who who replaced them the man who brought the catastrophe on southern Sudan and this is where uh my sister is questioned combat In my opinion if there is a way we have to reach out towards entrance The united states have more obligations to rescue southern Sudan in the situation where they are in today Based on what they did what they showed them as I When when these peace agreement was not being signed between the two parties. I have to go on hanguage five or 45 days I want to die and she was with me by the way Until the president of bama realized that I don't want him to die in front of me And then he went to add this peace was signed but the president of southern Sudan rejected it He said and I quote this peace agreement. It is not a grand or if he's not a bible I'm signing but I'm not going to implement it and nobody even hold him responsible to me That person the president of southern Sudan by the name salva keel mayardit Have to be whole accountables of a half a million southern Sudan who paris in four years Half a million of four million summa now displaced At kids are being rep on a daily basis rep in southern Sudan become You know it Ever but talk about it Then why we don't have one would I correct To say to this man enough is enough simply because of the dollar we give you that's the question why why don't we have Why don't we hold them accountable? Well, there was a problems with my cousins The president of the united said brok obama You know the policy of not don't rock the boats uh lead to This situation because southern Sudan if as I told them I told him the president of the united state southern Sudan is an american baby And that's why I went on a honger's life to tell him that the baby you brought to the world He died before our own hands and we don't want to hear that story I think again it goes to the story. This was a great success We got south Sudan free from the horrible Islamic people and walk away in Sudan and hanas Very sad Yeah, no and it's absolutely Thank you for asking that question very important That was incredible and Several times during the session people said why did it happen now you just gave this exemplary Explanation that's incredible. You know, I don't think many of us knew that but I'm wondering and this kind of goes to the other When we look at the other then we can do things And we've always looked at Russia as the other and when south america went all the trouble there That was that was the other and even today it's the other and we don't necessarily Well, I'd like to know what what you think of that and that Because I think we do have the UN as you suggested And then the gentleman there said that it's never going to improve I guess until we have another on another solar system You know, they will behave But anyway As uh, steve bannan Says the other day other Uh that we're not part of a global community. There is We are part of a nation that defines itself As every nation does in opposition to every other nation Uh For us for americans for a long time that other was ideological It was hard to have a racial basis for our nationality Because the united states was separating itself from britain And there was an awful lot of overlap there if you used race So we emphasized those things that we learned about in third grade Religious freedom What was it political democracy? Social opportunity they weren't quite real But they made us different from britain. They were real enough Over time We've used those or at times when we've become a little bit more insecure We've reverted to race Uh, we shifted to race over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Afterworld where too we went back to ideology As you pointed out the Russians were extraordinarily important to us When they were the soviet union They were the they were the communist world The enslaved world and we were the free world Free world included. Oh, I don't know Franco spain it included lots of things that maybe weren't quite free But weren't in the soviet sphere Then the soviets did something horrific They evaporated in 1989 We woke up one day with no other after 25 years of a civil embracing a civil rights view of who we were toward racial equality toward economic opportunity toward I don't know a culture built intolerance toward accepting one million immigrants a year That's what the 1965 law as amended is about without racial basis We still do that by the way But it's in those other areas that we've then begun to shift back to race George hw bush now the sainted One of the great presidents of the 20th century got elected by running ads about willy horton Remember a black convict in massachusetts So we moved we have been moving for the last 20 years Increasingly toward a racial definition of who we are and that's what we Because that's all of us as a nation embraced at the polls a scant Form of is a bit only three months Let's get three months or so three and a half months, but who's counting a goal a racial definition of nationhood Don't get me off on race No, we're back we have we Right now what we have is great back What we the people who've lost their jobs in the coal mines the people who've lost their jobs in the industrial plants That that is that's it's a group that it wants to make america white and great and racially based again Um, so thank you. I'm alif and aviary. I really enjoyed the diversity of perspectives of the panel Um, i'm going to try to make a question out of the comment I just had a really quick comment, but i'm going to now that i'm rocking the mic try to transform it into a question Um, so I wanted to say a quick element about i know you talked a lot about um aspects of empathy and the The one comment that i'm trying to transform has to do with when um You look at a lot of the cadre of empathy studies they really demarcate the capacity for um Empathy breakdown really tends to be around um different social identity categories when you know, there's the in-group kind of outgroup and that tends to be What we are hardwired for is the identification for um, you know, whatever I identify as my kind of in-group However, my community is defined or my social identity categories are defined and then whoever I other which is my outgroup And that tends to be the ways in which empathy is the quickest and the fastest to breakdown So that generally is like, whether it is nation states or nationalities or cultural identity categories or races And that is the- i'm getting into my question. Yeah, and that is generally that was my comment is around Ethnocultural empathy and so I think it's really um, Misopportunity whenever we're talking about empathy to not talk about the specificity of Ethnocultural empathy because that tends to be where empathy tends to be the hardest and tends to be where It breaks down so that we do get the outcome of war and the missed capacity to see somebody as not our equal or as um, not even deserving of our time attention and love or capacity for um, compassion So it's around differing social identity categories where we have the hardest to identify with another person so with that um, my question now is Uh, when you guys were all talking as a panel You said americans are very very generous with our capacity for giving funds. So uh, you raised the idea that when Recently we are You know giving and uh donating a lot toward um new Well cherries recently and uh with seeing pictures and um connecting a lot with refugee um Individuals and not so much with you know the black lives matter movement and a lot of other um Social justice activities that we really need to kind of garner but not feeling a lot of connection with so how do you see there being a capacity for other social groups for us to connect to And having more empathy with different social identity categories. How do you see these connections being able to be made across different groups as it's Kind of maybe garnering from our pockets to actual people. How do you see more connections being able to be made? How do you see emotional connections being able to be made and more connections across different categories being garnered? How do you think that can be done? So Yuri do you want to keep that on? Okay. Yeah, I can tie Thank you I think again, it's it's the story that we tell and finding a common ground So You know We can all be very empathetic and we cannot be very close and see the other and it's in group and out group It's the right term so very Because you know sometimes as we were saying we go out in Manhattan and see people on the street living and we don't see them at all But we're going to denote Money for people that are starving in Syria, right? So and now you ask why You don't know so do not to the armlets but in front of you So it's we can all have this we all have this like two sides, right? We can be open to some and we can close to other and and if we want to amplify something we need to create To change the boundaries and they discuss and that's the only way to do it. So If now is the focus or is on something then this organization will get the money, right? If the focus will be on I think the other organization will get the money and And now we need to decide as a group giving delimited the sources and giving our nature for in-group versus out group How do we define our group? Oh, yeah, are we Americans? Are we global citizens? Are we from Queens? I mean we can we can have many different entities, right? Are we liberal? Are we conservative? Are we reading the New York Times? I mean we can divide it and and it's Up of us now in this moment of crisis to define the way in which we can Build a common ground that can move us forward to where we want to be in 20 years and if we will fail Other people will do it for us like Steve Bannon There really I have a question I guess for both Alison and Uri are you saying that it's a rhetorical problem then that How we language who the other is is dynamic and one can actually be strategic? I don't think it's rhetorical. It's the rhetorical sound like it's world with no accent I don't mean it now. We're just talking about language and I think Worlds are accent. I mean you do think with words I don't think that if you speak you do something and you can really change the reality and I think what we see now For the moment the attack on the media that It's an act it's deliberate act to change something in the strikes of the society And if they will succeed They will gain power for many years to give them a lot of power. It's a very smart move It's not a crazy guy that's talking this It's not it's not a crazy guy. It's simply know what he's doing. It's a very smart move And and now that you see the move you want to react and people reacting and now there's It's not a rhetorical world. It's it's a real world but The concept and there are some sense and how we move forward for me and that's That's what's happening now. I think I think what you're really pointing out is that it's as if within all of us There's the fight between affinity and empathy And we're seeing a clustering around groups of affinities But I would like to thank this affinity group those of you who have come and stayed with us through this And the wonderful speakers and presenters Very much appreciate the really wonderful level of discussion and your good energy for being here today. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you I
