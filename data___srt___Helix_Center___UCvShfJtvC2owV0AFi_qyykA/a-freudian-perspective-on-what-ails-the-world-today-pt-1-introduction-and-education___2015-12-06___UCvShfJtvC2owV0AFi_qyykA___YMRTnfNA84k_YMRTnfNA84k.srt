00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
We're going to go.

We're going to go.

00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
We're going to go.

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Wait.

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,500
And then I'll say,

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
the future will be better.

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
And then I'll say,

11
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,500
the future will be better.

12
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Yeah, it's going.

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
So, I'm going to be able to

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
have my own.

15
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,500
It's not.

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
It's not.

17
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,500
It's not.

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,500
We'll be able to have our own.

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:59,500
and for Jr Mich round

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:46,060
I'm Edward Nersesian, the director of the

21
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,660
Healing Center and I want to welcome you to this joint meeting between the Commutee

22
00:01:51,660 --> 00:02:01,420
Freud and the Healing Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and Society.

23
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:10,180
This meeting which has to do with this content in the society at the moment was proposed

24
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:19,220
to us by the Commutee Freud and Emil Mallet and Maria and we are very happy for being

25
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,060
able to organize it under our auspices.

26
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,100
I will ask the president of the New York Psychoanalytic to say a few words.

27
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:35,580
Dr. Eunbachinga.

28
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,580
My name is Eunbachinga.

29
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:48,580
I am the director of the National Commutee.

I am the associate of the National Psychoanalytic Institute at the New York and later at the New

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:09,220
I recommend it to verge to be famed as a York Ri BAT.

33
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,020
Want to ask a question.

34
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:06,660
Please call ourselves in favor of the

35
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:06,300

extremism.

39
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:52,380
This d

40
00:04:52,380 --> 00:05:00,340
it is correlated with the

41

42

the U.S.

63
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:08,020
Thank you.

64

Dr. Mark Smaler, President of the American Psychoanalytic,

65
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:26,020
and the American Psychoanalytic Association.

66
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,020
Thank you, Ed.

67
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,020
I'd like to thank the Helix Center in New York Psychoanalytic

68
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,020
for hosting, obviously a very timely Congress.

69
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,020
Maria asked me last spring,

70
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,020
when we were in Stockholm, if I might join you,

71
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,020
and I'll be able to be here for part of the day,

72
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,020
but as I have thought about what this Congress,

73
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,020
this committee will be addressing,

74
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,020
two things came to my mind.

75
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,020
And it began last Wednesday evening,

76
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,020
Wednesday afternoon, in between patients.

77
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,020
I kept getting alerts on my phone

78
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,020
that there had been a shooting in San Bernardino,

79
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,020
in California, about 40 miles east of Los Angeles.

80
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:22,020
I paid attention, but then went back to my patients,

81
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,020
and then that evening was meeting my wife for dinner.

82
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
We went through the whole dinner,

83
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,020
and I completely forgot about the shootings.

84
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,020
And I wanted to just say something about

85
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,020
that kind of forgetting.

86
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,020
Number one, I'm kind of numb,

87
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,020
as I think many people are in this country,

88
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,020
in terms of the frequency of these mass shootings,

89
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,020
whether they be political or just the individual rampage

90
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:59,020
of somebody compelled to kill him or herself and others.

91
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,020
But that numbness has set in, for me,

92
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,020
over the last couple years.

93
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,020
The other hesitation, I think, that led to my forgetting,

94
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,020
to speak about this, is that when my wife was six years old,

95
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,020
and though the memories are a bit cloudy,

96
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,020
she was in her first grade class in the north shore of Chicago

97
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,020
and sitting at her desk,

98
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,020
and there were, she heard popping noises from outside the classroom.

99
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,020
The next thing she remembers is huddling under her teacher's desk

100
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:39,020
and the teacher telling her and her fellow students to be very quiet.

101
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,020
And there was more commotion, more popping in the hallway

102
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,020
outside the classroom, and then silence.

103
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,020
And what had happened was a 30-year-old,

104
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,020
very troubled, very disturbed woman,

105
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,020
had gone into this elementary school

106
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,020
and began shooting children and teachers,

107
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,020
left the school and went and shot down the street

108
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,020
and saw some house in the neighborhood.

109
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,020
This was somebody who had been under psychiatric care,

110
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,020
obviously not successful.

111
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,020
And so every time there is a shooting,

112
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,020
my wife relives that trauma.

113
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,020
And in that sense, it's close to me and to our family.

114
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:29,020
Our job, it seems to me, whether these kinds of violence

115
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:35,020
is individual, of an individual who's gone mad,

116
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:41,020
or a group that on the basis of an ideology imagines

117
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,020
that they have to kill in order to get that ideology across,

118
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,020
that is something that's psychoanalysts,

119
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:54,020
that this group and whether in Europe or in the US

120
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,020
and throughout the world, now we have something to offer.

121
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,020
I was telling someone last night at Ed's cocktail party

122
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,020
that I spent a day and a half in Washington, D.C.,

123
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,020
in September with our lobbyists,

124
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,020
and visiting staff of congressional leaders

125
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,020
to talk about are there ways that we can prevent

126
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,020
these kinds of mass shootings.

127
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:23,020
I live in a country that continues to be obsessed with guns

128
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,020
and cannot let go of guns.

129
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:30,020
If you read the statistics about the numbers of people killed

130
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,020
in our country with guns compared to anywhere else in the world,

131
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,020
it's shameful.

132
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,020
So we can talk with congressional leaders about that.

133
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:44,020
But what they're also very interested in is they're interested

134
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,020
in what we offer in everyday language,

135
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,020
a psychoanalytic perspective about what compels an individual

136
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,020
to do this.

137
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,020
And these kinds of meetings are critical and essential

138
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,020
and call us to leave our offices,

139
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:05,020
to stand up from behind the couch and go out into our communities,

140
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,020
our larger communities, like you all have come here today

141
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,020
and say something about it because the public is desperate for answers.

142
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:20,020
Because if not, that hopelessness, that helplessness that sets in,

143
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,020
that I experience every time I get that CNN alert on my phone

144
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,020
that there's been yet another shooting, that numbness sets in,

145
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,020
and we have to interfere with that.

146
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:36,020
We know something about the impact of hopelessness

147
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,020
and helplessness that creates that kind of numbness

148
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,020
and through our educating the public and offering what we have,

149
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,020
what we've known about the human experience,

150
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,020
but also what we can learn from our communities,

151
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,020
what we can learn from these acts of violence.

152
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,020
We have something to learn as psychoanalysts as well.

153
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,020
That's a very important piece of it.

154
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,020
But I think if we do that, we can have an impact.

155
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,020
And even if it just is to save some lives.

156
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,020
On my signature, on my email, I say,

157
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:15,020
psychoanalysis, now more than ever, psychoanalysis, now more than ever.

158
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,020
Thank you, and thank you for inviting me.

159
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,020
APPLAUSE

160
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,020
Dr. Charles Melman, who is the founder of the

161
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,020
Laconian Psychoanalytic Association,

162
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,020
International Laconian Psychoanalytic Association.

163
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:47,020
Dear friends of New York,

164
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,020
Moriel and Paris.

165
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:59,020
So there is one thing that surely we have in common with food

166
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,020
and probably with Lacon as well.

167
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:13,020
And that is that we haven't done any better than they have.

168
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,020
What do I mean by that?

169
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:26,020
I mean that we have failed to have academics as well as public opinion

170
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:33,020
take into account the case to the understanding of the world

171
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:39,020
that are provided by psychoanalysis.

172
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:51,020
Let us consider the greed and the dream problems that we have to face today.

173
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:58,020
We shall perceive that fruit and probably Lacon as well showed

174
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:05,020
that we had no choice but interpret and elaborate them

175
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:23,020
adequately if we were to solve them in an adequate way.

176
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,020
What does that imply?

177
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:34,020
It implies some form of complicity between former enemies.

178
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:39,020
Who thus become partners also?

179
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:46,020
They have to be given the information that will take them away from their blind hatred

180
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:55,020
of the other, which is none other than self-hatred.

181
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:02,020
But is there such a thing as justified hatred?

182
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:09,020
This point, however, is not the subject of our discussion today.

183
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:22,020
Fred and Lacon did see that Thanatos could be the overwhelming force.

184
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:35,020
Thus today, the world may be seen as divided into two groups.

185
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:43,020
On the one hand, we have the peoples whose only law is enjoyment,

186
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:50,020
and for the sake of enjoyment they are ready to sacrifice their own life.

187
00:16:50,020 --> 00:17:12,020
The only thing that the two groups seem to have in common is an addictive

188
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:22,020
behavior pattern. No addiction, unfortunately, is not something that can be subject to

189
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:35,020
dialectics, which means that it is out of the reach of reason.

190
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:43,020
We wish to have the works of Fred listed among the world heritage sites

191
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,020
referenced by UNESCO.

192
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:55,020
You are well aware that such a step will not change the course of a story.

193
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:04,020
However, it will be a small stone paving the way for the possibility of a different future.

194
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:11,020
Thank you.

195
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:26,020
The first round table is on education, and the participants are Marilia Eisenstein,

196
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:37,020
Victor Azale, Paul Fry, Gerard Pomey, and Jean-Jacques Moskowitz.

197
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:56,020
The participants were delighted when my senior passport went on toisible in the

198
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:18,020
Thank you, Ed. So I have a great pleasure and honor to chair this first panel on education.

199
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:27,940
And it will be an open discussion if someone to read a paper or a short paper or part of

200
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:35,660
the paper and then discuss I think the best is to fee free.

201
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:42,740
But I will probably give to Professor Frye.

202
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,500
We'll start.

203
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,700
Well thank you and welcome all.

204
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:56,900
My French is equal to reading and comprehension but unfortunately very little to speaking.

205
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:07,780
So you will have to endure my English which I will at least attempt to enunciate slowly.

206
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:16,900
I chose this panel because of course while I have opinions about civilization and about

207
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:25,700
discontent I feel a little more qualified to speak about education.

208
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:32,260
In recent years in addition to the various duties you can imagine as an English professor

209
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:40,860
I have become the executive co-director of the Yale New Haven Teachers Institute and its

210
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:47,300
national emanation which is called the National Initiative.

211
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:56,900
And what we do is sponsor collegial content driven seminars for teachers preschool through

212
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
high school.

213
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:04,540
I have taught a great many of these in the summer time and during the course of teaching

214
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:13,380
them I have heard perhaps to invoke the word more meaningfully for the first time the discontent

215
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,020
of teachers.

216
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:23,260
And I am very much concerned that and by this I mean primarily what we call public school

217
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:32,420
teachers that is to say state and locally sponsored education as opposed to privately

218
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,580
sponsored education.

219
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:42,140
I am very much concerned about this and the paper that I have distributed takes up what

220
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:51,100
I take to be the two dominant modern philosophies of education neither of which I think are

221
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:58,340
in any way adequate to the needs of the student population in general and neither of which

222
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:04,420
I think sufficient even for the students whom it is best calculated to serve.

223
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:10,220
The first of these philosophies of education in a certain sense however consciously of

224
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,740
course is unclear.

225
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:20,980
Decends from Plato and the idea behind it is that you e-dos or draw out knowledge in

226
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:32,380
students through a process of warmth in atmosphere participation and encouragement of creativity.

227
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:39,900
This philosophy of education dominated educational thought in the 60s and the 70s what you might

228
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,340
call the Aquarian Age of education.

229
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:51,020
Another philosophy of education has largely supplanted it owing to the inadequacies of

230
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,380
previous one and that is a philosophy that seems to me derives most respectively speaking

231
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:05,020
from Locke because it seems to suppose that the mind is a blank wax tablet on which information

232
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,540
needs to be imprinted.

233
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:14,500
And it is obviously a very different attitude toward the mind and it puts teachers in the

234
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:21,260
same subject position exactly as students because teachers too are supposed to be blank

235
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:29,100
wax tablets on which both pedagogical skill and the content they teach need to be imprinted

236
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:36,420
and in this atmosphere we have what in English we call teaching to the test an emphasis on

237
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:45,500
core knowledge to be imparted largely by rote in classroom situations and in the teachers

238
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:52,900
own behavior the supposition that everything they do needs to be scripted.

239
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,620
In the French translation it says screeped and I'm afraid I think it should be screeped

240
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:05,740
and maybe acry day would be a clearer term I don't think the correct term is screeped.

241
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:11,980
In any case that's what we call what teachers are obliged to do both in preparing their daily

242
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,860
lesson plans and also in meeting the class.

243
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:24,980
You begin by saying good morning class as you're told to do and then your teaching duties

244
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:33,740
proceed from there all of them script well it seems to me that one great advantage of

245
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:38,940
invoking Freud on an occasion like this is that if we understand these two traditions

246
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,220
differently he can be seen to reconcile them.

247
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:48,660
On the one hand while he's no more interested in innate ideas than most people are since

248
00:24:48,660 --> 00:25:01,500
Kant he nevertheless does have strongly inculcate us to recognize the as one of the preliminary

249
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:10,540
speakers said desire to learn the innate disposition to know or to learn which is in part driven

250
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,020
by infantile sexual researches.

251
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:19,180
The infant is as desperate to know the truth about the things that matter to him or her

252
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:25,500
as a philosopher is to know about the things that matter to him or her during the course

253
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:33,420
of growing up latency adolescence there's the great danger of course that this desire

254
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,540
to learn will be suppressed altogether.

255
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:43,980
On the other hand we can make something of the Lockean tradition if instead of the idea

256
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:50,380
of the blank wax tablet we keep in mind the notion Freud's notion of the mystic writing

257
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:58,740
pad in other words the palimpsest of imprinting that acknowledges the dynamic relationship

258
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:05,300
between unconscious drives and the effort all of us make to form something like a coherent

259
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:18,580
consciousness and it seems to me that the basis for pedagogy and for mediating the issues

260
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:24,860
of transference that have to be involved in education but that surround these two philosophies

261
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:33,220
of education crudely the platonic and the Lockean it seems to me that the issue for education

262
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:43,940
is understanding that the vagaries of human love which so much drive the wish to know

263
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:56,300
need to be through the transference transformed stabilized as a kind of object love that we

264
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:04,980
can call the love of understood ideas and by this means we need to recognize that both

265
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:14,260
the edible resistance to the mentor or teacher and the abject identification with the mentor

266
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:23,620
or teacher need to be curved mediated and a common ground between these radical extremes

267
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:29,860
both of which it seems to me can be recognized in the structure of discontent that concerns

268
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:36,340
us so much abject identification with the mentor of course has a great deal to do with

269
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:43,060
the formation of fundamental solidarity and edible resistance to the teacher sometimes

270
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:50,620
in the same personality has a great deal to do with the generation of hatred so it's

271
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:57,980
commonplace enough to say so but it seems to me that our task is finding through our

272
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:05,140
understanding of the dynamics of the transference a common ground between these undesirable extremes

273
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,300
thank you I'm sorry if I went on too long.

274
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:20,420
No you were not long told and it was I'm personally I was very moved.

275
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:29,380
Because you you really have a very psychoanalytical understanding of what teaching is I mean the

276
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:36,140
part of the casexis you have to casexis a person you have to have a strong casexis

277
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:44,780
on the teacher and then if things go well this casexis can go from the person of the

278
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:54,500
teacher to what he teaches and that seems very important and I was also very interested

279
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:08,100
in your paper to the place you give to philosophy saying that finally a child is in love with

280
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:15,980
philosophy because he wants to understand how mind the mind works.

281
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,860
Thank you.

282
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,860
Who wants to react?

283
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,860
Yes.

284
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,860
I can.

285
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,860
Yes.

286
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,860
I can.

287
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,860
I can.

288
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
I can.

289
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
I can.

290
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,860
I can.

291
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,860
I can.

292
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
I can.

293
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,860
I can.

294
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,860
I can.

295
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,860
I can.

296
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,860
I can.

297
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,860
I can.

298
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,860
I can.

299
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,860
I can.

300
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,860
I can.

301
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,860
I can.

302
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:52,120
But listening to the president speaker first, I am speaking that there is no relationship

303
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,760
evident between education and teaching.

304
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:06,620
Because on the method, at this because in the method teaching does not let speak of anything

305
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,620
especially not speak of about sexuality, about drives,

306
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,540
about what any kind of obscenity

307
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,580
that is repressed by the common education.

308
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,140
And it's on the contrary of psychoanalysis

309
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:35,140
who's first, I don't know to say, the rule is to let speak,

310
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:44,140
to let speak the free association, which are not free,

311
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,220
which are all going back to the drives,

312
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,420
to the obscenity of drives,

313
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:57,420
which is not permitted by good education.

314
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:02,420
In principle, there is no way to join education

315
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,020
and psychoanalysis on the method.

316
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:11,020
But in fact, anybody can see that there is in the life,

317
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,620
there is a strong relationship.

318
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,300
I mean that education as well as psychoanalysis

319
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,300
are the same boundary with the prohibition of incest.

320
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,500
And this prohibition is,

321
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,460
is what?

322
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,100
Commanding, commande.

323
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,100
Yes, commande.

324
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,340
Insisted on, demanded?

325
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,140
Demanded, yes.

326
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:53,980
Yes.

327
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,980
Demanding, demanding the repression.

328
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,220
There is a strong relationship

329
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:08,780
between what is so necessary

330
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,620
in the, in the,

331
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,620
in what is the way psychoanalysis is leading to,

332
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,860
that means to two main things

333
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,580
that has something to do with this contents,

334
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,580
that is resolution of the symptoms by speaking,

335
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,700
because only speaking as a subject and the symptom

336
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,180
has no subject and speaking is making some,

337
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,820
some help.

338
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,140
First thing against this content,

339
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,140
and second thing is the dissolution of the edifice complex

340
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,460
as the end of analysis on the front end

341
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,260
is a way to understand it.

342
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,820
And so on this way it's very clear

343
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,500
that analysis has something very strong

344
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,940
to see with education,

345
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,100
but the method are not the same.

346
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:29,100
So we are, I mean, we have a good orientation

347
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,700
by speaking first of the question of education.

348
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,700
A way to educate that has nothing to see with science.

349
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,900
Science has not been able to civilly-see

350
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,940
the mind of the people.

351
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,700
Always this discontent is going on,

352
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,340
on his basis of sexual discontent,

353
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,340
and science itself is changing,

354
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,340
and is now like a new religion,

355
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:13,340
trying to give explanation of what are the sources

356
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,340
of this contents, but outside of the sexual reasons,

357
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,340
and outside of the prohibition of incest,

358
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:31,340
which is the law on which the edifice complex tech

359
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,500
is universality, and which are the way

360
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:44,340
in which we are trying to civilize,

361
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:49,180
civilize the desire, always savage,

362
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:54,060
because taking within this discontent.

363
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,260
But maybe I will not say no more from now,

364
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,180
and after in the discussion, to say no.

365
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,100
If I understood well,

366
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,580
Girard Pamele you are saying that psychoanalysis

367
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,220
and education have the same aim,

368
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,220
but it totally, totally controversial or different method.

369
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,780
One is contracting, and the other is deconstructing.

370
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,900
Yes, that's it.

371
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,180
There's a wonderful paradox in your paper

372
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:32,180
that I admire very much, and the idea is that education

373
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,820
or pedagogy advocates free speech,

374
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,900
yet speaks under inhibition,

375
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,620
and psychoanalysis fully acknowledges

376
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,620
that language is a prison house within which we struggle,

377
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,420
and is much more skeptical about free speech,

378
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:53,780
while at the same time articulating issues

379
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,060
that pedagogy tends to wince away from.

380
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,660
It's a wonderful paradox.

381
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:04,660
I wonder how it's affected by the loss of verbal inhibition,

382
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,140
let's say in post-war times.

383
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,900
It's true that the schools, and here again,

384
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,820
I speak only from American experience,

385
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,100
are remarkably alert senses,

386
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,740
very frequently on the subject of sexuality,

387
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,300
but at the same time there is among students,

388
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,100
and of course among teachers too,

389
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:37,100
the common currency of freedom to speak about these things

390
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,020
in less formal situations.

391
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,660
So I would think that there would be a slight erosion

392
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,180
of this paradox,

393
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,180
perhaps not for the good or for any productive end,

394
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,460
owing to the collapse of verbal inhibitions

395
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,300
in the last few generations.

396
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,940
I don't know what you would think about that.

397
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,300
The sexual education I am speaking of

398
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,180
is not the sexual education of free speech,

399
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,940
or on how to make love or things like that.

400
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,180
It's something like a more profound

401
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:27,180
that includes the discontent of what is coming

402
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,620
from the edipus complex.

403
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,860
And of that, there is no speech, nowhere possible,

404
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,340
because it's a very personal thing.

405
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,580
I mean, the men, like the women,

406
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,140
are afraid of their own desire,

407
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,900
which is coming from the discontent itself,

408
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,620
and it's only analysis we can do,

409
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:56,660
we can make that more civilized.

410
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,180
We can come to terms with it, rationally perhaps,

411
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,780
but not emotionally.

412
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,620
Yes.

413
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,460
Yes.

414
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,580
It makes sense because you have discourses,

415
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,900
which are very, very welcome-stranded,

416
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,900
and very intelligent and full of culture,

417
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:25,540
but what Andre Green would call dead discourses,

418
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,940
because when the discourse is no more rooted in the drives,

419
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,340
it becomes totally different, concrete.

420
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:42,340
Yes. For example, what is coming from our buzzies culture,

421
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:53,100
is some kind of hate of the feminine.

422
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,180
Of the feminine, I say.

423
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,500
I mean, of the castration.

424
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,500
And this can be educated by rational ways,

425
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,500
but only with personal ways like analysis.

426
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,380
That's why we have, I mean,

427
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,380
something very unique to give to civilization,

428
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,180
and with these contents.

429
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,300
Yes.

430
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,140
Yes, yes.

431
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,980
Thank you.

432
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,740
I speak in France, excuse me.

433
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:36,220
It would be much easier to own our plans,

434
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,900
and to do some stuff.

435
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,580
Excellent.

436
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,180
We're so thrilled.

437
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,820
We are so grateful,

438
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:52,040
and the architects of coming here

439
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:56,580
are two separate groups.

440
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:55,580
I really want to be very bummed that my studies were to be Osse

441
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:16,500
beating his fucking hair...

442
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,540
OK.

443
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,580
Thank you.

444
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,580
Thank you.

445
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,580
Now, what's interesting?

446
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,060
As such,Sizey wishes that necessary

447
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,920
are all leading together by clearer approaches

448
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,380
and which we are facing answered

449
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:40,260
and thousands of Sturke

450
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:25,460
different conflict

451
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:45,300
choices

452
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,900
And phrases and sounds

453
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,960
And the country has been working hard.

454
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,740
So we are looking at all the electric values

455
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:52,980
and our

456
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,900
jetson, and Marvel engineers

457
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,940
who spoke at its own

458
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,260
communities, that make a Beta for the

459
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,260
planet.

460
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,080
I have read they have the same

461
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,220
sound of

462
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:24,620
but apparently this is the kept up with the Excellent

463
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,660
entrepreneurs now

464
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,460
somehow so often

465
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,620
there's an charred

466
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,940
for Erma Fan Kills

467
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,140
that's why absolutely

468
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,640
is the case

469
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,760
and this actually does not

470
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,540
I'm not them

471
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:51,600
directly at the stage

472
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,680
point or third

473
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,300
involved a set of

474
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,380
collaboration

475
00:44:01,380 --> 00:43:54,720
the

476
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,020
co- owner and

477
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:00,180
the

478
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,580
mberg

479
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:05,520
that

480
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,180
it is

481
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,160
the

482
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,100
opponent

483
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,520
the

484
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,680
live this historic meaning.

485
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,400
Today,

486
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:14,680
we will be shooting at the Introductory

487
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:21,680
Madden

488
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:37,160
Show

489
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:33,920
It's not the second term, but this means education,

490
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,740
realize that to get involved and consider

491
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,580
What kind of

492
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,360
sustainable

493
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:12,360
private

494

professions

495
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,300
and

496
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,080
is

497
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,160
going to produce

498
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:18,820
with

499
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,040
clients

500
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:20,580
Ins,

501
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,660
we

502
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,000
are

503
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,440
developing

504
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,560

application, heavily

507
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,980
Oh, yes.

508
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:58,440
On the 10th planet and originally Temrob voluntary planet

509
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,340
there and we meet in need, continuing continuingarrow

and eye Judith is never mentors

511
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,040
and lives and kind of essays.

512
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:08,820
Do you ever have

513
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,760
to moderate  age

514
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,600
not have Random

newly

516
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:38,340
The Ministry Council should also consider to a conclusion that's all natural 2 cases.

517
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:45,340
3 particular 3 borderline different cases, and 14 both Muslim cause analysis,

etc.

521
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,120
I would like to thank you for the support of the church,

522
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,120
and to the people who are here,

523
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,120
and to the people who are here,

524
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,120
and to the church, the church,

and to the church, the church, the church,

00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,120
and to the church, the church.

527
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,120
Thank you.

528
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,120
Thank you.

529
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,120
Thank you.

530
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,120
Thank you, Martyn.

531
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,120
One question.

532
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:23,120
Did everybody understood French?

533
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,120
And shall I make a very brief summary?

534
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,120
Yes, ma'am.

535
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,120
I'll try to.

536
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,120
It's not so easy.

537
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:39,120
But Jean-Jacques Muscovic started saying how moved he was

538
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,120
to speak in New York in this symposium,

539
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,120
especially after the tragic Paris events,

540
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:51,120
and what happened yesterday in San Bernardino.

541
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:59,120
He evoked the hate of humanity,

542
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:08,120
and went back to Freud's papers on human destructivity.

543
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,120
He picked up one expression,

544
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:18,120
which is an expression that one can find in Freud's 1916

545
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:26,120
Y War, no considerations on war,

546
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:30,120
where he speaks of the individual people,

547
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,120
the individual mass.

548
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:40,120
And then he said that he thinks that the word discontent

549
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,120
is a very feeble word,

550
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,120
that one should say more, something like

551
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:58,120
destructivity, something more

552
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,120
than discontent.

553
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:11,120
Then he went to the relation between infantile sexuality

554
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:18,120
and saying that nowadays religion and moral

555
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:25,120
is no more able to contain the violence,

556
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:33,120
which starts with infantile sexuality.

557
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:40,120
He quoted Andre Mallejo, who in 1953,

558
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:48,120
already said about he had a premonition saying that

559
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:54,120
if the 21st century is not a religious century,

560
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:59,120
it won't exist.

561
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:06,120
So he had the idea of the danger of the religion now.

562
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:12,120
Now, he, Jean-Pierre Mascavitch,

563
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,120
if I understood well,

564
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:24,120
closed his remarks by seeing how much education,

565
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:30,120
social education, education, teaching,

566
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,120
is important, of course, as we already said,

567
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:39,120
in the round table, but how much it can also be something

568
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,120
which is totally insufficient,

569
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:52,120
because it can totally erase the unconscious fantasy.

570
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:57,120
And he said something which for me is very important.

571
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:02,120
He said we should be very much aware

572
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:08,120
of the seduction of the terrorist attacks,

573
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:13,120
the seduction of violence of destitute activity,

574
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,120
because of course we are all,

575
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:23,120
we have a fundamental violence in all of us.

576
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:29,120
Yes, yes.

577
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:34,120
Yes, yes, yes.

578
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:39,120
No, of course.

579
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,120
No, no.

580
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:31,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be

581
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:52,120
the truth is not to be the truth.

582
00:54:52,120 --> 00:55:02,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

583
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:07,120
It is not to be the truth.

584
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:12,120
It is to be the truth.

585
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:25,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

586
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:31,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

587
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:46,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

588
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:53,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

589
00:55:53,120 --> 00:56:03,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

590
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:12,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

591
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:26,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

592
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:34,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

593
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:44,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

594
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:51,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

595
00:56:51,120 --> 00:57:06,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

596
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:14,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

597
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:24,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

598
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:34,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

599
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:47,120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

600
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:54,880
One thing that will probablyique the subject from your family is development today,

601
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:01,800
the

602
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,400
textile

603
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:10,900
That's for you or the intrigued

604
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,660
You get issue as so whole as we

605
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:22,660
I think that's a very important thing.

606
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:27,660
I think that the people who are in the U.S.

607
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,660
are in the U.S.

608
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,660
and in the U.S.

609
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,660
are in the U.S.

610
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,660
and in the U.S.

611
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,660
and in the U.S.

612
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,660
and in the U.S.

613
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:52,660
so there are many people who are in the U.S.

614
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:57,660
and in the U.S.

615
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:02,660
and in the U.S.

616
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:05,660
and in the U.S.

617
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:12,660
and in the U.S.

618
00:59:42,660 --> 01:00:03,340
And are pigs for his Drag

619
00:59:45,060 --> 01:00:03,580
America?

620
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:05,480
The

621
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:18,080
Okay, I'll try very, very briefly.

622
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:30,400
Big Dawahdulay was saying that the previous speaker was as pessimist as Freud was.

623
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:40,460
We all know Freud's pessimism and he rose then two questions saying that first of all

624
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:50,720
reading the paper and listening to Muscovitch wrote to his mind that the word discontent

625
01:00:50,720 --> 01:01:00,900
is becoming a crucial psychoanalytical concept which is at the core of our daily work.

626
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:13,600
And then that he heard in the speech of Muscovitch something which was of an urgency, urgency

627
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:22,520
to find answers, urgency to react, urgency to understand. And he says, Victor Azulay said,

628
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:29,520
that between the discontent and the urgency, there was something which was lacking which

629
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:43,480
is the work of education. And the, that education is what is constituting finally the identity.

630
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:52,320
And I think that you were finally making a link to the next round table between education

631
01:01:52,320 --> 01:02:04,400
and identity of course, because to be educated one must have, one must be constructing his

632
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:14,400
own identity with education.

633
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:40,360
I would like to mention that Raj said the  Owl had to Professor

634
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:44,260
something that the people middle from.

635
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:48,020
Live from the old mes Hangs.

636
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:49,140
in combination with the local

637
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,860
which the people and the local area

638
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,840
these are actual

639
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,720
is one where there is going to be a

640
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:14,120
to help raise money and you will see that our problem is not

641
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:21,220
possible to forgive those people and Trustees not to seem to

642
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:07,800
more than they report so that we are willing to

643
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:13,220
look at the approval of audit of the

644
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:11,220
potner in these

645
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:34,640
but I could ask you, whether I have your integrated

646
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,840
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO more often

647
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,840
if you devoted yourself

648
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:45,480
Okay. Please.

649
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:56,840
I feel that probably one duty we have before us is to discuss quayons.

650
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:05,520
Mr. Poemier makes a very interesting distinction in his paper between to believe that and to

651
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:19,520
believe in qua qua, which I think bears careful examination because there's certainly a difference.

652
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,720
We have a kind of a philosophical feeling about believing that.

653
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:28,760
I believe that such and such is the case, for example.

654
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:37,920
Whereas we have a religious, perhaps a squeamish religious feeling about believing in.

655
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:46,520
And yet the whole concept of belief, it seems to me, still has very much to do with identity

656
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,040
formation.

657
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:54,720
Perhaps we all of necessity and spontaneously believe something.

658
01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:01,320
I feel very much as though I were on the couch and so I will confess that I believe painfully

659
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:06,920
little myself, which in a certain sense perhaps exempts me.

660
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:14,120
I don't think you need to worry too much about my turning violent tomorrow as a result.

661
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:21,560
But on the other hand, I'm often the sort of person who's often accused of creating

662
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:27,200
an intellectual void into which fanaticism can rush.

663
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:34,400
I resist the charge, but at the same time it's this question.

664
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:43,480
Whether or not there is a structure of belief that actually resists fanaticism, for example,

665
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:52,480
somehow or another based on coming to terms with the understanding of the violence within

666
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:59,400
or whether on the other hand the resistance to fanaticism is in a certain sense necessarily

667
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,440
a resistance to belief as such.

668
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:10,440
I would like, I would be very interested in hearing that question pursued.

669
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:24,480
You know, you reminded me, Ron Britton, British psychoanalyst, wrote a lot about belief in

670
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:29,240
relation to what we call internal reality.

671
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,760
Yes.

672
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:31,760
Yes.

673
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:32,760
Yes.

674
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:42,000
And I think it's very important what you said and belief can of course be part of internal

675
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,360
reality and then be worked through.

676
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:54,760
Or if it's not worked through, it can exactly go to fanaticism or delusion.

677
01:08:54,760 --> 01:09:06,320
I should tell you something about education.

678
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:20,720
Freud in 1916 wrote, We Believe That Civilization has been created under the pressure of the

679
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:33,320
large extent being constantly created anew since each individual who makes a fresh entry

680
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:43,160
into human society repeats this sacrifice of institutional satisfaction for the benefit

681
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:51,840
of the whole community by refusing of this sacrifice, the new individual necessarily

682
01:09:51,840 --> 01:10:10,720
comes up against the discontent present in civilization and today is the same problem.

683
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:14,160
Any comment?

684
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,160
Yes, maybe.

685
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:24,440
The comment that as Mr. Mark Smalert said, we have to learn.

686
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:40,240
We have to learn not only thinking that violence is founding itself on some personal problems

687
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:48,680
of people who are a problem to finish with with their parents and so on.

688
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:54,400
But there is something specifically cultural.

689
01:10:54,400 --> 01:11:02,080
And this is what is specifically cultural is not only the fault of the author.

690
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:09,840
There is not in one way the religious people, we are fighting against religion for atheism

691
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:22,360
which permits to finish with this kind of violence on one side and ourselves, our societies

692
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:28,520
who are at least and who have finished with this violence.

693
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,840
This is not true.

694
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:35,840
We have our own violence and we have to confess it as well.

695
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:51,880
I mean, it's not only the other culture which is in theological, political violence, our

696
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:55,600
self as well are in this violence.

697
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:08,680
I mean, capitalism is not something on the side of a taste in a very evident way.

698
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:18,120
It is as well a theological, political commandment, a criterion one to be on the wealthy side,

699
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:29,040
to be the strongest there is competition violence in scripted with our belief and our belief

700
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:34,800
in God as well is written on each dollar in God we trust.

701
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:43,560
So I think we have to learn to and to think about that as well.

702
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:50,560
Perhaps I can open the discussion to the audience if someone wants to, yes, please.

703
01:12:50,560 --> 01:13:00,560
Yes, I would like to try to remember and give those other words.

704
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,560
But I have a good round of words.

705
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,560
Does it matter?

706
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,560
Does it matter?

707
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,560
Does it matter to be the truth?

708
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:17,200
And the comments you just made and bring them together in order to also make a connection

709
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:23,620
between the question of education and the larger social, cultural, and political questions

710
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:24,520
we are considering.

711
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:34,420
You know, Adorno in his famous article on after Auschwitz said the role of education

712
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:43,360
should be to create autonomous citizens who can critically enter into the public sphere

713
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:48,920
and challenge, question, evaluate the ideology, belief, solutions, whatever you want to call

714
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,960
them with a group.

715
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:59,720
And I appreciate your stress on the role of transference in education and character formation

716
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:04,720
in the classroom is my calling.

717
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:08,720
As someone who has taught in university, I have had occasion to observe that there is

718
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:13,720
as much transference in a seminar room as there is in the consulting room.

719
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:28,720
So the point I want to make is that if we think of education in terms of the idea which

720
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:36,160
utilizes the transference of the teacher, I think the goal should be as you suggested

721
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:47,600
is to take the transference, take the identifications, and transform them into a situation where

722
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:54,600
the student identifies with the teacher in terms of his or her critical capacities, dedication

723
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,680
to truth, willingness to call things into question.

724
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:05,600
And he or herself becomes an autonomous critical thinker.

725
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,360
And to connect that to your last remark about the distinction between believing in and believing

726
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:21,000
that, you might say a secular identity is one that is committed only to believing in when

727
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,920
believing in is justified, what the analytic philosophers used to call that justified a

728
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,520
surgeon or justified belief.

729
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:37,960
So that if one is cathected that stance, that identity, then all believing in should be

730
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:44,960
subject to inquiry, criticism, and to see if they can be translated into a justified believing

731
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:45,960
that.

732
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:46,960
Thank you.

733
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:53,960
Emi Malle.

734
01:15:53,960 --> 01:16:02,960
Good morning, friends.

735
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:15,280
As co-founder with Charles Melmont, I want to say something about what I heard this morning.

736
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:26,920
The Freud Committee was founded to explain why today Freud could be not an explication,

737
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:35,400
but could be very accurate to understand what is coming in extremism, in nationalities,

738
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,120
in a dead drive.

739
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:45,280
And I think it's very important not to take Freud as a commentator, as a journalist like

740
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:54,160
I am of the actuality, but to understand what is happening today, and I try to speak in

741
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:58,760
French and Maria will translate.

742
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:16,880
And I hope you answer the answer from my other hand.

743
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:23,880
and the other was that the medicalization of psychoanalysis.

744
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:42,880
The other was that the medicalization of psychoanalysis.

745
01:17:42,880 --> 01:18:11,880
The real approach that Americans make against Freud is a constitutive identity.

746
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,960
There are many heading to

747
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:20,960
the world they're queuing gap that theletists might be doing in stereotyping."

748
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,540
There was an excuse to quote Bob Cohen's

749
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:29,540
hope that he has a bias of our marvelous identity.

750
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:30,560
murder.

751
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,080
INE

752
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:53,160
in Paris, in San Bernardino, and in Arabia show that Freud was right first.

753
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,200
or has acquired the needlu

754
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:57,960
and Umua

755
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:08,260
and the

756
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,300
in reclaiming the —

757
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:18,800
the

758
01:19:48,800 --> 01:20:04,800
So now Europe and United States, Arabia, we all have a chance to get together to realize this point that in fact the death drive and the life drive, eros and Thanatos can be...

759
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,800
Can go side by side.

760
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:23,800
One point in common between Freud and the Americans is that Freud and Americans read the Bible.

761
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:31,800
What does the Bible say about the drive?

762
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:51,800
The Bible says that the death drive and the life drive go side by side, hand in hand, but we have to choose the life drive.

763
01:20:51,800 --> 01:21:06,800
The Bible says that Freud and Americans are not able to do this, but they are not able to do this.

764
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:14,800
And we can see from Freud's work and his life how he put the arrows before Thanatos.

765
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:29,800
In conclusion, it's worth talking to the plural of Freud, itself with someone who believes in Christ, his future falconment is theement of Writing & Economics of his english.

766
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:52,800
And I think that the economists who won the Nobel Prize,

767
01:21:52,800 --> 01:22:01,800
Edwin Felds said that in taking a risk, an economic risk,

768
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:07,800
for progress and for life, Freud taught us more than an economist.

769
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,800
Thank you.

770
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:16,800
Yes, please.

771
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:23,800
I'm not current with Freud.

772
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:28,800
I haven't read Freud probably in 30 or 40 years.

773
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,800
And I don't condone violence.

774
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:42,800
Schopenhauer, to describe the concept of resenting a deep abiding resentment, anger.

775
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:50,800
I understand what motivated those people in California and those people in Paris.

776
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,800
We are told that anti- that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic,

777
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:01,800
that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitic, and we're not allowed to discuss these issues at all of it,

778
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:08,800
as led to our committing unbelievable atrocities in the Middle East.

779
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:15,800
I understand the rage that people can feel when they feel that their own people are being assaulted,

780
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:22,800
and they have no way to even cry about that.

781
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,800
I don't condone violence.

782
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:32,800
I don't condone the slaughter of innocent people, but I do not feel that I am innocent.

783
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,800
I don't think anybody sitting in this room is innocent.

784
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:40,800
French foreign policy is as much an atrocity as American foreign policy.

785
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:48,800
French history with colonialism is as much an atrocity as what the United States has done

786
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,800
over my entire lifetime.

787
01:23:52,800 --> 01:24:00,800
And I think that more than Thanos and Eros being part of the human personality,

788
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:08,800
I think we have to speak about our own personal responsibility for where we have led this world.

789
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:14,800
And I think you're being far too gentle on ourselves here.

790
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:21,800
We bear responsibility for what we're facing today, every one of us.

791
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:25,800
Thank you.

792
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:34,600
Well, first I think you can hear in the responses both of Monsieur Moskowitz and Monsieur B'omé

793
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:43,800
the acknowledgment of a violence within and especially of a violence from the standpoint of superiority,

794
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:51,800
which is, let's say, the structure of a self-condonation, although it doesn't emphasize it,

795
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:57,800
our task today to think about Freud in relation to these matters.

796
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:02,800
And in that regard, I'd like to go back to the death drive.

797
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:09,800
In beyond the pleasure principle, Freud toys controversially with biological metaphors,

798
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:19,800
as we know, and speculates that the death drive is the wish of the organism to return to a simpler state.

799
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:28,800
In other words, in a certain sense, to uncomplicate itself to the point of a zero degree.

800
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:37,800
That's, it seems to me, an extremely challenging and, can I say, seductive speculation,

801
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:45,800
because I think one of the things we need to acknowledge feeling in ourselves is precisely that wish for

802
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:49,800
a return to a simpler, organismic state.

803
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:56,800
The question to me is the relation between the death drive and quéons.

804
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,800
And quéons, and belief.

805
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:09,800
To believe that one, to wish, to be with God in saying, for example, Allah is great,

806
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:17,800
is, it seems to me, a more or less open and direct expression of the death wish.

807
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:30,800
But on the other hand, not to backtrack and rehabilitate quéons, because what I said before is really my stance on these things.

808
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:38,800
But on the other hand, it's clear that there's a sense in which one might believe in something that affirms life.

809
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:52,800
And that if, you know, given the premise of the necessity of belief, which in a certain sense, for example, marks acknowledged,

810
01:26:52,800 --> 01:27:02,800
one might at least think of education as a matter of cultivating those beliefs in something that affirms life.

811
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:11,800
Rather than, rather than in something that makes us wish immediately to leave life so as to be with something higher.

812
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:16,800
I totally agree with you and with your comments.

813
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:30,800
I just wanted to add that I really think that the definition that was given by Freud in the outline of what his death drive

814
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:42,800
is extremely important because it shows that death drive is important in every, even in the thinking process.

815
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,800
It is to separate.

816
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:57,800
And to think we have to put things together when little children, you teach them that Annapal and Epea, they are fruits.

817
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:06,800
But he also has to learn that Annapal is different than Epea and they have to be separated.

818
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:11,800
So death drive is in the thinking process of everyday's life.

819
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:23,800
But what you mentioned, it can also go to this belief of total tranquility.

820
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:30,800
And that, and beyond, and that, yes, of course.

821
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,800
I have to...

822
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:40,800
You wanted to speak and then jump, and then jump.

823
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:54,800
So...

824
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,880
and steps in the image.

825
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,980
That is what brings us to the folks

826
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:33,400
in our system for Blanca.

827
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:52,060
We are constantly able to

828
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:53,060
No.

829
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:55,060
See for Traduina.

830
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:56,060
Yes.

831
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,060
Yeah.

832
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:10,340
Jaujia Mascovic was underlining that Freud spoke already in 1916 of the enigma of this

833
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:26,260
activity and hate and that is an answer to the edla fibles, la completude.

834
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:36,820
We, the unerability of human, it's an answer to human vulnerability.

835
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:47,020
So there are two choices or education and the work of civilization and he didn't say

836
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:56,740
that, but I think I was thinking of Kultur-Aghabite and or Babarisma.

837
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:58,940
Yes.

838
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:12,460
I think with the question of Paul Free, maybe we are reaching to a point that Freud has

839
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:26,500
lived as a question, a point where Freud has only give something for us to look for because

840
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:32,020
he says it, I think, in a special way.

841
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:43,100
Why to prefer to be dead, to answer to the death drive, to prefer to be near the father,

842
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:48,180
which is in the sky, I mean the father of the religion.

843
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:50,380
Why to prefer death?

844
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:59,140
Because it's like that the mass murderers, they know they will die as well.

845
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:05,940
And I think that Freud has not answered to the question, what is a father?

846
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:16,060
He has not answered because there is no possibility of answer in the sense that father is always

847
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:26,700
a son and there is a choice between the dead father or the son who wants to be a father.

848
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:29,460
And he can't answer to this question.

849
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:37,660
I mean, on this point to be like the father is to be like the dead father.

850
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:46,340
I mean, when a son wants to be a father, he identifies himself to the dead father.

851
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:49,420
He wants to kill his father, his own father.

852
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:57,260
And so there is a circle and there we are maybe a question to answer to.

853
01:33:57,260 --> 01:34:02,220
Something that Freud has not solved, I think.

854
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:07,500
Manja?

855
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:12,500
A couple things to respond to the panel.

856
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:19,980
And I teach community college for many years and I also teach students who have difficulties

857
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:21,940
with English, immigrant students.

858
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:25,660
I run a program for them and I'm also a psychoanalyst in private practice.

859
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,620
So I have a little bit of both of these fields.

860
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:34,020
I wanted to say one thing about the idea of Dr. Fry said about love of understood ideas

861
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:42,420
and to touch on the point of Jean-Jacques's point of the seductions of violence and to

862
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:50,580
maybe hypothesize that it's making understood ideas less understood or putting castration

863
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:59,100
as an opening to combat the seductions of violence on the part of teachers and the part

864
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:03,740
of opening discussion that makes something possible.

865
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:09,700
And nobody said today, I mean, the important point that education is one of the impossible

866
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:11,660
professions for Freud, right?

867
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:17,900
So we're dealing with a point of impossibility and to kind of make that point of impossibility

868
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,840
exciting.

869
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:24,660
And I have the point that we all share that we can't finally, finally have an answer

870
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,660
to.

871
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:28,820
The death drive would be on the side of the finally, right?

872
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:33,820
So that was one point, one first point.

873
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:39,820
So the idea that understood ideas lack, that understood ideas are never finally understood

874
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:42,260
or could always be understood another way, right?

875
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:45,100
So that's the opening towards education.

876
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:50,540
That was one, and then the other is that I think that some I think that still on France

877
01:35:50,540 --> 01:36:01,140
and this thanks you are doing valuable education, colleague and manager, then, simply on this

878
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:09,520
add-up or an example of their own intellectual educationMAs who we have a tiny of work you

879
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:12,520
It's very difficult to understand the truth.

880
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:17,520
It's very difficult to understand the truth.

881
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:22,520
So for some of them it's fantastic and revolutionary to come to school.

882
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:25,520
They can talk about sex, they can talk, they feel they can talk about anything.

883
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,520
So these, they're not as separate as they used to be long time ago.

884
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:31,520
Thank you.

885
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:36,520
Thank you.

886
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:39,520
I wanted to apologize for the phrase.

887
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:43,520
I didn't mean by understood ideas, received ideas.

888
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:53,520
I meant ideas thought through autonomously with the understanding of course that they always need to be thought through again.

889
01:36:53,520 --> 01:37:04,520
At the risk of responding as the superficial American psychoanas, just a couple of thoughts.

890
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:12,520
I'm so glad to be here and I would like to be able to stay longer but I can't in these issues.

891
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:16,520
But especially regarding education.

892
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:31,520
Like you, I, for 14 years, ran a program in an alternative public high school in Chicago working with mostly kids, adolescents and gangs.

893
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:43,520
Having most of whom it experienced unspeakable trauma by the time they're 10, 12 years old.

894
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:54,520
And their involvement in the gangs begins to make absolute sense that having had the experiences that they've had, had any of us had similar experiences.

895
01:37:54,520 --> 01:38:04,520
We too would have wanted to be a part of something beyond ourselves as a way to repair the damage of that original trauma.

896
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:10,520
On the surface, and again, remember I said I was trained in Chicago.

897
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:20,520
I used to sneak into lectures of Heinz Cojat who had obviously a great influence on my psychoanalytic career.

898
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:33,520
One of the fascinating things when you observe what looks on the surface like the most self-destructive behavior and a wish to die.

899
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:41,520
That by the time the kids are sent to the alternative high school, that's what they're up against.

900
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:51,520
It is amazing and remarkable and something that's humbling as a psychoanalyst to see that we provided treatment right in the school.

901
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:56,520
Psychoanalytic treatment, individual and group treatment right in the school.

902
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:07,520
So they would have math class and then they might come to a group. They would have English class and then see an individual therapist who was either an analyst or psychoanalytically oriented.

903
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:18,520
The transformation in a relatively short period of time of that aggressive violent behavior is remarkable.

904
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:28,520
The experience of being listened to, being heard, having an opportunity to have someone witness one's internal state.

905
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:43,520
And the transformation of that's what seems like inevitable violent behavior like a gang experience provides begins to fall away.

906
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:55,520
The death instinct, if you will, begins some kind of a transformation into a wish to live, into a wish to learn.

907
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:06,520
Now we've all experienced this in our offices, but to see it dramatically in terms of adolescents who are so violent by the time they come to school, high school,

908
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:20,520
and to see the little bit of a compassionate and pathic experience become transformative, like I said, is very humbling to the psychoanalyst.

909
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:32,520
And I think the question is, is there something we can learn from that at the risk of sounding superficial? Thank you.

910
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:39,520
Thank you, Mark.

911
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,520
Yes.

912
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:46,520
I just want to add something, what you said.

913
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:56,520
That is to say, we cannot divorce education from the social cultural environment.

914
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:11,520
And of course, the creation of institution at the time, or the problem of institution at the time of fraud was completely different than what we have to cope with.

915
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:17,520
That is to say, sexuality is no more an issue in repression.

916
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:28,520
The market has invaded our way of life, and the market is extremely permissive in relation to our driver instincts.

917
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,520
It's very permissive.

918
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:44,520
And of course, in this social cultural environment, the identity formation is much more complex and has become, in a way, a sociological issue.

919
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:58,520
One should not forget that the terrorists in Paris were all coming from prison, delinquency, criminality and so on.

920
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:05,520
It means that they have totally failed the process of the identification.

921
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:30,520
In other words, we cannot discuss education in the old way, in the way it is perhaps still authorized to the elite, which has a way to promote the elitist education with certain tutors, professors and so on,

922
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:36,520
going to Harvard and Yale later on, if the parents can afford it.

923
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:58,520
We are living in a very, very divided society where a lot of people, especially in outside the cities in France, are totally devoid of the normal educational process.

924
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:10,520
Yes, thank you. I would like to add something which is linked to all what was said.

925
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:27,520
Now, in the construction of the ego of a little child, let's say about four years old, when there is difficulty, the child may have a little child.

926
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:37,520
He may become phobic, which is a system of a defense system.

927
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:51,520
If this phobic defense cannot be constructed because there is a failure, there are more serious difficulties.

928
01:43:51,520 --> 01:44:02,520
Shall I take an example? All the child can become phobic and have a phobia of cats, like little hans with horses.

929
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:19,520
But if he cannot construct this phobia, because the environment is not good enough, instead of that, he will not have a psychic defense, but he will start saying, I do not like cats.

930
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:38,520
And from I do not like cats, he can go to I hate cats. And then to, all cats are hateable. And finally, we should kill all cats.

931
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:59,520
Have a good one, only? Yes. I should forward concern after me today as always numerous factors of social, cultural or political unrest,

932
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:14,520
which underlie contemporary discontent produced in individuals at the loss-fricant, identically disturbances,

933
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:29,520
more destabilizing that the mere feeling of this quiet, individual identity problems are complicated by a new ennishiness,

934
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:43,520
they are no due to an insidious instability produced by external disturbance, social, economic, cultural and political,

935
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:59,520
certainly tangled together, exercising their competitive, destructive effect on a disoriented subject who feels lost these disturbance and divine,

936
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:16,520
with the internal crossroads of fidelity uncertainties, creating fricy in the destabilized sense of self.

937
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:29,520
Thank you. I think we will end this panel. I want to thank the speakers and to thank everybody.

938
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:48,520
So there is a lunch break and then everybody back here will be there. The noon meeting which will start precisely at 2 o'clock.
