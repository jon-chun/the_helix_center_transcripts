1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Okay. The last session of today is on identity. And

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:28,600
the participants for that are counterclockwise. No, clockwise. Clockwise, Charles Melman.

3
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:47,400
It's your Whitbrook. I'm sorry, White Book. Then it is Anvido. Then...

4
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:57,480
I will... I will... You are not on the list. And then it is Jean-Michel Gabbat, and then

5
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:06,080
Marie Lyasens. Charles Melman is cheering the group, so he will be going.

6
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:19,000
Putting on a metal room. It's how it moves. It's all the pain. It's so much weight.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,940
This is everything.dden up space. Or 16,000 meters, all the way around.

8
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:24,540
I think I would rather speak in English.

9
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:37,860
So, when I started to tackle the question of identity, of course identity is very linked

10
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:46,460
to the question of education, because to be educated and to get a training in any sense

11
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:53,940
to be trained, to be educated means that you need to have your own identity.

12
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:02,500
But if not, then you are not educated, you become a clone.

13
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:15,860
So how to tackle the question of identity, I chose three points, mainly subjectivity,

14
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:31,340
secondly, what is the ability to say no, the ability to rebel and the ability to think.

15
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:44,100
And the title of my paper is the very well-known sentence by Descartes, the past anniversary,

16
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:52,660
I think that's identity.

17
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,300
We were speaking of the terrorist attacks.

18
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:05,460
When I started to think about this paper, what came to my mind was a book by a friend

19
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,740
journalist whose name is Jean-Apsfeld.

20
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:17,300
The book is translated in English and it's called A Season of Machate.

21
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:29,700
And the book relates Jean-Apsfeld was very moved by the massacre of the two Tsis in Rwanda.

22
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:37,020
So he wrote a first book and his second book, A Season of Machate.

23
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:45,980
His book where he went for nearly six months and interviewed the killers.

24
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:55,140
He interviewed those people who were good people, they were peasants, they had absolutely no

25
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,640
hostility.

26
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:07,700
But one day they were given orders that they had to kill their neighbors and friends from

27
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:15,740
the morning, half past nine to four o'clock they had to take Machate and to kill.

28
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:23,100
Fifty thousand Tsis were killed like that out of a population of 60,000, which is quite

29
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,820
amazing, that took place in five weeks.

30
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:37,180
So Jean-Apsfeld went to interview those killers and he is not a psycho analyst, he's a very

31
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,660
good journalist.

32
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:48,460
And he was struck himself by the fact that the discourse was absolutely concrete.

33
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,020
There were no emotions, no affects.

34
00:05:53,020 --> 00:06:02,980
And he said a language without images, which for a analyst is very interesting because

35
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:12,740
it's what we would call a language which is no more rooted in the drives and there's

36
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,780
no formal regression possible, no images.

37
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,020
No representations.

38
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:32,180
And about from this book I went to, what came to my mind are two other books.

39
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:44,380
One is Anna Arent, the banality of the evil, where she relates the trial of Aitman in Jerusalem.

40
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:51,180
And he's also, it's not an emotive discourse.

41
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:58,220
If you see the minutes of the trial, it's quite amazing.

42
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:11,660
He relates and he said that he never imagined and he simply, he didn't seem guilty because

43
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:21,660
he didn't want the shore to take place but he was just obeying orders.

44
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:32,340
From that point, one can think what is exactly, there are people who don't want to think.

45
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:42,860
So in the previous panel, somebody was, we were speaking of the love or the obedience

46
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,220
to the leader, which is for me, it's not really love.

47
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:59,380
It is, I love him, yes, but I stopped to think because he thinks for me and not thinking

48
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,300
can be comfortable.

49
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:10,380
Sometimes thinking is painful and not to have to think can be felt as comfortable.

50
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:17,980
And that was one very crucial question when we think of terrorism, of attacks, of any

51
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:27,460
kind, of those terrible social problems.

52
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:38,340
The third thing is you all know, I imagine, the book of Stanley Milgram.

53
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:48,700
Stanley Milgram is this professor of psychology who did this experiment.

54
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Maybe, if you don't know it, I can stop, I think everybody knows the experiment of

55
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Milgram.

56
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,700
So I won't go.

57
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,700
Just made a movie.

58
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,100
Yes, yes, yes.

59
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:17,620
So this shows that it's absolutely incredible how people who are intelligent, who are good

60
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:33,660
people, who even can be smart, facing authority and even a totally vague authority can obey,

61
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,780
that means stop thinking by your absence.

62
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,140
They act, they simply act.

63
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:54,340
So that put me to the conclusion and I will stop at that point that identity is based

64
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:04,300
on the capacity of continue to think and to want to think, and specially, that means

65
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,780
also the capacity to say no.

66
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:18,660
Because if you think at one point you cannot always obey authority.

67
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:27,220
So I think that Freud has two main papers on that question.

68
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,780
One is the negation, of course.

69
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:37,700
And the other one is the splitting of the ego in the defense process, where he shows very

70
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:56,420
well that there are some, I forget the word, secretrés, scarves, there are some scars in

71
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,460
the ego which will never, never heal.

72
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:12,900
And this scarves in the ego is the part of the unconscious ego which will always be open

73
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,740
at this scarves which will never heal.

74
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:25,580
And that means that only working through constantly and trying to keep our thinking process alive

75
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:43,540
is the only way to continue and not to be blind to what we are doing or not to do things

76
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:49,020
that we wouldn't like to do but that we have the tendency.

77
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:58,980
Because as it was said, evil is not outside, evil is in all of us and sadism is in all

78
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:10,380
of us and we could all become killers.

79
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,180
Thank you, thank you, Marina.

80
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:20,020
Thanks a lot.

81
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:44,180
Good evening.

82

second morning I

85
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,380

No

89
00:13:12,140 --> 00:12:46,920
It's

90
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,140
Not

91
00:13:42,140 --> 00:14:09,580
commodity, sequ

00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,580
and support we set substitution.

I am a philosopher who is a philosopher who is a remarkable.

94
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,580
I am a former dezer of the law, a former dezer.

95
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:04,580
I am a former dezer of the law, a former dezer of the law,

96
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,580
a former dezer of the law, a former dezer of the law.

97
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,580
Thank you very much for entering Dune.

98
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:27,760
Let me say, in interaction, that it will trademarks his law as

99
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,580
a progress IN this story,

100
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:53,820
so that we don't even feel aiy

101
00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:03,820
exist, and flee from GET DOZ

102
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:10,820
It is a very difficult proposition.

103
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,820
It is a very crucial proposition.

104
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:26,820
It can seem surprising that identity is regularly linked to a presentification sign of virility,

105
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:32,820
whether it is manifested or it is the scar of this sacrifice.

106
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:51,640
On the earlier day, the presence of virility,

107
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,820
whether we are human, is calling out your spreads?

It's not a secret.

who was the Bible,

135
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,060
who said,

136
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:33,060
a realistic road movie.

137
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,260
A road movie.

138
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,860
Road movie, road movie.

139
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,260
Huh? Road movie, road movie.

140
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,460
Road movie.

141
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Road movie.

142
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,460
Road movie.

143
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,460
A realistic road movie.

She said,

145
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
she said,

146
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,460
for me now.

147
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,460
Hmm?

148
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,460
Lise von Rheelen.

149
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,460
He said,

150
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,460
two total shows.

151
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,460
He said,

152
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,460
the lesson,

153
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,460
to the one who's

154
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,460
a true

155
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,460
and

156
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,460
a message of energy.

157
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,460
He said,

158
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,460
the compliment of the film,

159
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,460
he said,

160
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,460
for the man,

161
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,460
who knows the religion.

162
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,460
Me okeun,

163
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,460
the religion only brought

164
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,460
in a catholic.

165
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,460
And the pretense of text

166
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,460
is the reference.

167
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
I think it's a big thing,

168
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,460
but it's a real thing.

169
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
He said,

170
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,460
the question is,

171
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,460
how do you think

172
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,460
of the consequences?

173
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,460
Could some resale resort or

174
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,460
to suburbia?

175
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:55,460
Shall we try to translate?

176
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,460
I didn't expect to translate.

177
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,460
That would be difficult.

178
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,460
Look,

179
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:08,460
I will sum up because

180
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,460
Schalman mostly a lot of very

181
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,460
interesting things.

182
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,460
Well, he started saying that

183
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,460
we are all driven by an object,

184
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,460
the object of our

185
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,460
unconscious fantasy.

186
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,460
And that, of course,

187
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,460
that is unconscious

188
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,460
and we are full of it without

189
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,460
even knowing exactly where we

190
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,460
are going and what we are

191
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,460
thinking.

192
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,460
I think this is very important.

193
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,460
Now, he raises the question,

194
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,460
when does that start?

195
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,460
When do we start, finally,

196
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,460
to really construct an identity,

197
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,460
even if a huge part of our

198
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,460
identity will always remain

199
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,460
driven by something that we don't

200
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,460
know?

201
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,460
I couldn't answer to this question.

202
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,460
I would rather say that I would

203
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,460
put it around the adiabus complex

204
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,460
or between three and four.

205
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,460
I mean, around the construction

206
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,460
of the superego.

207
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,460
And a superego, which, of course,

208
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,460
is rooted deeply into the

209
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,460
id.

210
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,460
I would put it like that.

211
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,460
And finally,

212
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,460
Schal, talk about the

213
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:01,460
three monotheistic religions

214
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,460
saying that what is very different

215
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,460
is that choral is considered to be

216
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,460
directly written or dictated by God.

217
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,460
And what I understand is the

218
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,460
difference because if it's dictated

219
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,460
by God, it has not to be

220
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,460
interpreted.

221
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,460
And the two others monotheistic

222
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,460
are interpretations and lead to

223
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
more and more and more

224
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
interpretations.

225
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
Yes?

226
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
You agree with that?

227
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,460
Sure.

228
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,460
Thank you.

229
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,460
Merci beaucoup sommes.

230
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,460
Meruis.

231
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,460
Meruis.

232
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,460
Les l'édour les jons.

233
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,460
A precedent.

234
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,460
Nous s'spadeurs.

235
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,460
L'iréin a travais de exegez.

236
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,460
Eres sur desinés and gémété

237
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,460
amine.

238
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,460
Yes, interpretation, which will

239
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
never end.

240
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:04,460
Because one interpretation

241
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,460
leads to another, one and so on

242
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,460
and so on.

243
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,460
So it's an ongoing work.

244
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,460
I would suggest that we should

245
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,460
make a distinction between

246
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,460
interpretation and critique.

247
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,460
And what I'm going to say,

248
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,460
before I have to preface what I'm

249
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,460
going to say with a statement.

250
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,460
I in no way want to endorse the

251
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460
whole idea about class of

252
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,460
civilizations or celebrate the

253
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,460
west or deny the history of

254
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,460
western imperialism and colonialism.

255
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,460
Nevertheless, and I will probably

256
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,460
be accused of Islamophobia and

257
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,460
Eurocentrism, but nevertheless

258
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,460
what I want to say is this.

259
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,460
Well, I don't know what it's like

260
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,460
in France at this point.

261
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,460
But here, especially Columbia

262
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,460
where I teach, thinkers who have

263
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,460
been influenced by deconstruction

264
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,460
and post-colonial theorists are

265
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,460
constantly making the point that

266
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,460
identity isn't unitary.

267
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,460
Identity is always heterogeneous,

268
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,460
not unified, not solidified,

269
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,460
not final.

270
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,460
But they fail to apply their

271
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,460
point to the west.

272
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,460
The identity of the west isn't

273
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,460
unified either.

274
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,460
And as Kesteriadis argued, the

275
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,460
social formation of the west is

276
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,460
made up by two competing projects.

277
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,460
What he called the project of

278
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,460
autonomy and the project of

279
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,460
domination.

280
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,460
The latter is the history of

281
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,460
imperialism, colonialism,

282
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,460
domination of the globe,

283
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,460
domination of the nation, and so

284
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,460
on and so forth.

285
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,460
But there is something else that

286
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,460
happened in the west which makes

287
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,460
critique possible in a way that

288
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,460
it isn't another culture.

289
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,460
I mean, if you look to the

290
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,460
Greeks, for example, and I don't

291
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,460
think that's a way to celebrate

292
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,460
the Greek miracle.

293
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,460
But the unoxford classicist and

294
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,460
philosopher, Loy, G.E.R. and Loy,

295
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,460
has done extensive research,

296
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,460
comparative research between

297
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,460
Greek science, Chinese science,

298
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,460
and Indian science.

299
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,460
And he is intimately familiar with

300
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,460
all the text and sometimes it

301
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,460
makes it impossible to read.

302
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,460
But I mean, he's no

303
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,460
one, that's what I'm trying to say.

304
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,460
And his question is, why did

305
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,460
inquiry go further in Greece than

306
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,460
it did in either of these other

307
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,460
places?

308
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
And his answer is that the

309
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,460
structure, there was a certain

310
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,460
anti-authoritarianism in Greece.

311
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,460
As opposed to certain

312
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,460
structures of authority in China

313
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,460
and India which allowed inquiry

314
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,460
to go beyond a certain point in

315
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,460
Greece, whereas the

316
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,460
authoritarianism, the

317
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,460
perseverance of inquiry to power

318
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,460
prevented it from going that far

319
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,460
in China and India.

320
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,460
And then, I mean, I'll probably

321
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
be accused of being a

322
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,460
defender of the Enlightenment.

323
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,460
And I don't want to defend it in

324
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,460
its 18th century mode, but I do

325
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
want to defend it.

326
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,460
But then, contact,

327
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,460
they're all, so ours is the age

328
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,460
of critique.

329
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,460
And he enunciated the principle

330
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,460
that we shouldn't accept any

331
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,460
idea, any norm, any value, in the

332
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,460
name of traditional authority.

333
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,460
Simply because it's been passed

334
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
on and simply because the

335
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,460
authorities say it so.

336
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,460
And that, in principle, I mean,

337
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,460
it doesn't happen, it's violated

338
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,460
all the time, but in principle,

339
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,460
every important idea has to

340
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,460
stand before the test of

341
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,460
critical reason.

342
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,460
And I think these two

343
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,460
sediment and historical

344
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,460
experiences mean that they're

345
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,460
something sedimented in our

346
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,460
history, which needs to be

347
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,460
defended and needs to be

348
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,460
asserted against the other

349
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,460
strand of our history, which is

350
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,460
the project of domination.

351
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,460
Would you agree that that's

352
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,460
very near what you said is

353
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,460
quite near?

354
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,460
When I say the capacity to say

355
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,460
no, it's very important.

356
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,460
To say no to the idols of the

357
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,460
tribe.

358
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,460
Exactly.

359
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,460
And to acknowledge, no, this

360
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,460
is not mine.

361
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,460
I don't feel this and I don't

362
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,460
want to feel it.

363
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,460
Lloyd even makes the point in the

364
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,460
ilea that the other soldiers

365
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,460
stand up and say no to a

366
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,460
minna, which is almost unheard of.

367
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,460
They had the right to speak up

368
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,460
and to challenge their king

369
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,460
general in a way that was

370
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
uncharacteristic.

371
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:22,460
Also, something you said, one of

372
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,460
your earlier panels, that we see

373
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
the death drive in thinking

374
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,460
because the capacity to say no

375
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,460
and separate is the same.

376
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
That's true.

377
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,460
But at the same time thinking

378
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,460
goes against the death drive

379
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,460
because insofar as the death

380
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,460
drive wants to seek the

381
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,460
release attention, this version

382
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,460
of tension, thinking requires

383
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,460
the increase in tension, the

384
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,460
buildup in tension.

385
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,460
That's true.

386
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,460
Both are true.

387
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,460
Both are totally true and that's

388
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,460
why what is destructive.

389
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,460
It's not the death drive only

390
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,460
because it's the individual.

391
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,460
It's the unabiding.

392
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,460
I might slightly disagree in

393
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,460
terms of what has already been

394
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,460
discussed earlier today.

395
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,460
The question of the death drive

396
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,460
and teaching and identification

397
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,460
and the recent problems and

398
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,460
attacks in California and

399
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,460
connected and I think what we see

400
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,460
here is that education and

401
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,460
identity or identification are

402
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,460
somehow linked.

403
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,460
I would just begin by going back

404
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,460
to the sentence that has often

405
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,460
been quoted today.

406
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,460
Freud said that education is

407
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,460
impossible.

408
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,460
Educate, govern, psychoanalyze,

409
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,460
impossible professions.

410
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,460
Just to say that this is where

411
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,460
we are now, but precisely I think

412
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,460
our discussion is impossible.

413
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,460
This evening.

414
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,460
Nobody will come out of here with

415
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,460
a good sense of what we're doing

416
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,460
or saying to languages.

417
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,460
We won't understand each other.

418
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,460
That is clear.

419
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,460
Yet this impossible is what can

420
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,460
be used and I think we need to

421
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,460
think through the impossible.

422
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,460
And I think this is where La

423
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,460
Conne or De Rida or Bataille can

424
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,460
help us.

425
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,460
Why?

426
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,460
Because precisely the impossible

427
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,460
is a certain paradoxical mode

428
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,460
of thinking and you know like

429
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,460
what De Rida often does in his

430
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,460
text to bring us to an aporia.

431
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,460
We don't know.

432
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,460
We are stuck and so on.

433
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,460
Which in a way interrupts a

434
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,460
certain common discourse and I

435
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,460
think we should go back to Freud's

436
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,460
idea of what is this

437
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,460
impossibility here.

438
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,460
How is it connected with the

439
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,460
task of educating?

440
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,460
Is it possible to educate while

441
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,460
it is impossible to do so

442
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,460
normally?

443
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,460
On the other hand we have the

444
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,460
question and you started by

445
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,460
quoting the card.

446
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,460
I think therefore I am.

447
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,460
La Conne as we know

448
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,460
refrised it as I think Colin

449
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,460
quote therefore I am.

450
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,460
We can think it like I think

451
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,460
it's a good question.

452
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,460
Therefore I am.

453
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,460
I think therefore I am like a

454
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,460
whole phrase.

455
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,460
What I mean is that in terms of

456
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,460
the institutions that have to do

457
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,460
with identification or

458
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,460
education we can think of the

459
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,460
two parallel institutions that

460
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,460
have been so cooperative in

461
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,460
France recently.

462
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,460
On the one hand it's a high

463
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,460
schools, universities and elite

464
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,460
institutions and on the other

465
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,460
hand the jails where most of the

466
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,460
radical militants have learned

467
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,460
to identify with an ideal.

468
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Which I think is also why we

469
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,460
had that question earlier.

470
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,460
Why are we maybe more moved by

471
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,460
the Uldurahoke and Betacron attacks

472
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,460
in Paris and they are playing

473
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,460
in Beirut and so on.

474
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,460
Why is it because it's just

475
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,460
normal kids having fun.

476
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,460
Any sense what we always aspire

477
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,460
to that our children can go out

478
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,460
on a cafe at night and enjoy

479
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
life.

480
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,460
And so that looks like very

481
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,460
different from with the

482
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,460
Ozzier 20 years ago when the

483
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,460
Goldenberg was attacked.

484
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,460
Okay, use religion as the city

485
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,460
and so on.

486
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,460
Today is just sort of everyday

487
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,460
style of life with which everybody

488
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,460
here in this room can identify

489
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,460
as something we think is good.

490
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,460
It may not be that good.

491
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,460
But if we think of the

492
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,460
rapidity of the identification we

493
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,460
have all those accounts of

494
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,460
marginalized disenfranchised

495
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,460
kids from the suburbs of

496
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,460
Paris who go to jail because

497
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,460
they first drug, they do deep

498
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,460
drugs, they are dealing, they

499
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,460
get called by the police, they

500
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,460
go to jail and then they

501
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,460
identify with an absolute faith.

502
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,460
And so this is the function of

503
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,460
identification.

504
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,460
Against this a certain

505
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,460
impossibility of the institution

506
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,460
of learning and teaching is a

507
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,460
good counter poison, I would

508
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,460
say.

509
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,460
I would put it as a particular

510
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:53,460
position I'd say in the

511
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:41,760
race, that only

512
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,960
make sense, not just upper

513
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:39,460
offensive

514
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
perspective but rooted in

515
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:59,660
important actions,

516
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:02,460
as people who make restrictions

517
00:34:02,460 --> 00:33:54,460
foraina's

518
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,220
and other SI,

519
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,760
colleague Paul

520
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,760
And I think that the

521
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,760
discussion is very important,

522
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
and I think that the

523
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,760
discussion is very important.

524
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,760
And is wondering if the humanities

525
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,760
can address the question of identity

526
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,760
and the civilization and its

527
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,760
discontent.

528
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:20,760
The question of the

529
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,760
discussion is

530
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
that the

531
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,760
discussion is

532
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
very important.

533
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
And when you are looking at

534
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
the question of the

535
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
discussion, the question of

536
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
the discussion is

537
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
very important.

538
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
And I think that the

539
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
discussion is very important,

540
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
and if the question is

541
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,760
very important,

542
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
is very important.

543
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,760
After Freud and Lacon,

544
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
which was in her text,

545
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
she's wondering if

546
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,760
we can understand

547
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
that the

548
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
discussion is very important.

549
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
So the question is

550
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
why is the question

551
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
very important.

552
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
The question of the

553
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
contemporary subject.

554
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
I think that the

555
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
discussion is

556
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
very important.

557
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
The question is

558
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
how do you

559
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
look at the

560
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,760
discussion of the

561
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,760
discussion and

562
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,640
all of its

563
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,240
things and

564
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,240
those who Jamie

565
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:31,240
nodding and

566
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,760
thinking that

567
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:44,200
be Veilow

568
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,200
The

569
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,820
How they do the

570
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,240
introduce

571
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,920
teachers and students.

572
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,920
And also, you, as an example, a particular character,

573
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,920
a philosopher, a philosopher,

574
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,920
and a philosopher, a person,

575
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,920
a person who has a mission to make a difference.

576
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,920
And the actuality.

577
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
On a second term,

578
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,920
she will interrogate the humanistic study,

579
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,920
which are philology, rhetoric, interpretation,

580
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,920
which open to the plurality of the unconscious meaning.

581
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,580
And then the whole characters who take the

582
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:05,240
the

583
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,060
dimensions women,

584
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,220
they take values that often

585
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:08,600
be

586
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,280
an

587
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:23,960
guides

588
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:29,100
...and then we got to the very beginning of the French.

589
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,160
This is another question by Jan beauty teacher

590
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:25,020
that we have found in the l

591
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:40,940

level as much as other people should

00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:41,640
in case the

cast

595
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
Something like that

596
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,900
we are recording

597
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,520
...

598
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,180
nice

599
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,680
Ko

600
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,040
to protect the people of the country,

601
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,480
and to defend the people of the country.

602
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,480
And to protect the people of the country.

603
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,080
She will use the writings of a French rapper

604
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:12,440
to illustrate the system of reading

605
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,560
that she wants to expose.

606
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,520
Her name is Milani Diyana.

607
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:24,120
Milani spew his memory from the end of March

608
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,240
in 2004 Align gn skies

609
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:23,640

610
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:37,560
forms of the

611
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,880
definition and implement it carefully.

612
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:21,400
Our

613
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:21,800

614
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:28,400

615
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,960

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:47,960
know

617
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,960
And I want to thank you for your time.

618
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,960
I want to thank you for your time.

619
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,960
I want to thank you for your time.

620
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,960
Thank you for your time.

621
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,960
The signifier discontent runs in the contemporary zeitgeist.

622
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,960
And what interests her is to the fact that she calls herself

623
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,960
a suburbanite.

624
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,960
I want to thank you for your time.

625
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,960
I want to thank you for your time.

626
00:39:30,960 --> 00:40:00,920
In French, a happy with two Rs means to be abrasive.

627
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,500
If you take the role of

628
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:26,340
medical people back in depressing

629
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:33,820
then he always cares on the poor and wont do anything because his blaster was with a

630
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,060
dirty relic.

631
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,740
A Frenchragpe also means fear.

632
00:40:37,740 --> 00:41:06,740
She wants to insist on her stage name, which is written

633
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:13,740
in the AIM apostrophe S.

634
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:31,740
The AIM is the abbreviation of diamond, which is from the Greek.

635
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:37,740
The AIM is the name of the Greek.

636
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:43,740
The Greek language is the name of the Greek.

637
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:51,740
It's the name of the Greek language.

638
00:41:51,740 --> 00:42:02,740
The AIM is the name of the Greek language, and the name of the Greek language is the name of the Greek.

639
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:09,740
The AIM is the name of the Greek.

640
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:30,740
The AIM is the name of the Greek language.

641
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:46,740
She uses an anagramatic strategy coupled with a substantial and substitution to change her patronime by translating into Greek, which is...

642
00:42:46,740 --> 00:43:06,740
The AIM is the name of the Greek.

643
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:19,740
This prefigurates the cleavage between D and AIM.

644
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:41,740
The AIM is the name of the Greek language, which is the name of the Greek.

645
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:51,740
The AIM is the name of the Greek language, which is the name of the Greek language.

646
00:43:51,740 --> 00:44:19,740
The AIM is the name of the Greek language, which is the name of the Greek language.

647
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:30,740
The AIM is the name of the Greek language.

648
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:39,740
The AIM has a name of the Greek language, which is the name of the Greek language.

649
00:44:39,740 --> 00:45:06,940
In her analysis, the two signifiers black and white appear by analyzing the world lucosia,

650
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:12,740
which is lab launch, and melancholia, which is lab noir.

651
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:41,680
She also says,boy, let's follow Z

652
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,680
and I'm happy to talk to you later.

653
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,680
I'm going to go to the room.

654
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:56,680
At this time, she announced a very naively done identification

655
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,680
to women, to her mother and to her friends.

656
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:08,680
At this time, she announced a very good identification

657
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,680
to her mother, to her mother.

658
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:20,680
At this time, she announced a very good identification

659
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,680
to her mother, to her mother, to her family,

660
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,680
to her mother, to her mother, to her mother.

661
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,680
Through the failure of the identical operation,

662
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,680
she chose to conform to the right, the ritual.

663
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,680
She's great, yes.

664
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,680
In the summer, the men were not able to deliver

665
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,680
to the women of the exterior.

666
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:05,680
The men of the apartment were not able to do it.

667
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:14,680
They were not able to do it.

668
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:24,680
Her father, which she describes as a convinced atheist.

669
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:33,680
She was a very good atheist.

670
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,680
She was a very good atheist.

671
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,680
Her daughter, the Orthodox, Christian Orthodox,

672
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,680
were long veils in churches.

673
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:53,680
She was a very good atheist.

674
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:59,680
She was a very good atheist.

675
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,680
She was a very good musician.

676
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:13,680
She was a very good atheist.

677
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:22,680
What comes to mind is that Nicosy, the Capriella Cyprus,

678
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,680
is cut into Greek versus Turkish.

679
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,680
The duality has its origin in her father's origin,

680
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,680
which are never mentioned in her book.

681
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,680
It's about my family drinking"?

682
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,680
After years since the fortteals were dated,

683
00:48:49,680 --> 00:49:06,260
our pianist was gathered in Europe des

684
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:33,260
The second identification is made through the veil that she adopts from the Greek tradition.

685
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:41,120
I think it is an corresponds to the

686
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:46,080
international version of co- vascular manufacturing in the world at length five days when the

687

You have to clear up.

689
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,640
In several independent differentoes

690
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,480
we can translate to whether

691
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,000
or not to play with any element

692
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,080
that you might like it in your future.

693
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,060
Sometimes Roberg

694
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:39,700
The

695
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:49,980
autobiography is emblematic of the history of a manic depressive woman which is out of

696
00:50:49,980 --> 00:51:05,500
bounds without limit. The trajectory of the group is reversed to

697
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:12,420
virilization that she describes by saying that when she was younger she was

698
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:19,220
masculine and very hard with herself and others.

699
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:44,820
Thank you.

We can trace in our work whom many people,

938
01:05:51,640 --> 01:06:13,720
there are Agricultural

939
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:18,720
In the interview, I just prefer to call myself a Jew.

940
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,720
It's a very good thing.

941
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,720
I'm a Jew.

942
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,720
I'm a Jew.

943
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,720
I'm a Jew.

944
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,720
I'm a Jew.

945
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,720
I'm a Jew.

946
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,720
I'm a Jew.

947
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,720
I'm a Jew.

948
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:45,720
Maybe I should say this in English.

949
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:56,720
That Freud was interviewed by this protonatsy writer, very famous man, who had been born in Germany, wrote in English, Yarek.

950
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,720
Interviewed everybody at that time.

951
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:05,720
And he went, Freud said, look, I want to call myself a Jew, not a German.

952
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:10,720
Yarek, oh, I was hoping, here I said, that you were more a universalist.

953
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:16,720
But I can understand the anger of Freud indeed, certain things happen and so on.

954
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:31,720
But in that debate, what interested me in, so it's a debate that was published in a collection, very interesting, in 1957, on the future of psychoanalysis.

955
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:44,720
It makes you want to laugh or to cry, I don't know exactly which, when you see what the imagined psychoanalysis would be like in, let's say, half a century earlier.

956
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:49,720
But there are many, many issues about education, identification, science and so on.

957
01:07:49,720 --> 01:08:00,720
But fundamentally, what you can see is that Freud, first, we talked about the critique of American ideas and denounces,

958
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:08,720
as he always does, the superficiality of American cultural life and the medicalization of psychoanalysis.

959
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:21,720
But then he says, you don't know your own classics, he says to an Whitman, because Whitman, if sex were lacking or were lacking.

960
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:34,720
So Freud still believes that what is shocking in, let's say, American ideology of the common man is the sexual idea.

961
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:44,720
What he then discovers talking with Virac is that the most shocking thing is the death drive, to return to what we were saying earlier.

962
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:53,720
And he really goes on on on about the death drive, because Virac is ready to accept the idea, I think you were saying this, this morning very well.

963
01:08:53,720 --> 01:09:05,720
But, and I think Freud's anti-CP may have anticipated, you know, the culture of Hollywood and the certain soft form, diffuse eroticism and publicity,

964
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:15,720
and everywhere today on any screen we can open and so on. That has been completely absorbed by mainstream American culture and Western culture,

965
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:25,720
whereas the idea of the death drive, that is still something that, surprisingly, somebody like Virac who loved the Nazis couldn't take.

966
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:36,720
But you know, the story is even more complicated, because everything most of us find obnoxious about American culture and consumerism and how I would,

967
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:48,720
was introduced by Freud's nephew, Bernays, I don't remember. And he took his uncles ideas and invented what they call it.

968
01:09:48,720 --> 01:10:02,720
And he was hired by the big corporation, blah, blah, blah, and he was the agent of all of this.

969
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:20,720
But I think it took to conclude maybe on this and something that I owe to Charles Merman, because I can say that I started learning about LACON in a seminar you taught in Paris in 1969,

970
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:36,720
so that's a long time ago at the economic superior. In LACON you have this awareness that in the text I quote, there is a pedagogy of the death drive,

971
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:51,720
which is a little paradoxical to think today, because you were suggesting that what can we learn from the death drive, basically to avoid it, no. To understand what it means.

972
01:10:51,720 --> 01:11:12,720
And so for LACON it has to do with language and perhaps with literature. This is I think why when we teach literature we also have to work with the death drive, which is I think more difficult than to work with the fact that students may fall in love with us and so on.

973
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:18,720
We know how to deal with that, but we don't know how to deal with their death drive.

974
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:23,720
You've been part of their transverse is also the negative transverse of the death drive.

975
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:27,720
The transverse isn't just euros.

976
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,720
Can you go to the microphone please?

977
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:43,720
You did.

978
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:49,720
Well, you also saw that it might be a cool thing, but some things are just barely as good as much, but obviously the better.

979
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:53,720
When people experience, those are great

980
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:57,060
and midsettle, people have come

981
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:00,360
and LOT of music and then they himself

982
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:03,760
have posterity.

983
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,680
Nah fullfloor is being used

984
01:13:06,680 --> 01:12:57,200
Basically, she does the fifth

985
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,520
Oh 3-4

986
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,600
At first she history support

belly meditation

Nah hezac

992

01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,040
enthal

994
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:12,460
Yeah

995
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:13,820
Hehe

996
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,200
She converses

997
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,840
He comes to me

998
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:36,840
This is to Maria.

999
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:46,840
The identity is based on the capacity to say no.

1000
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,840
Philosophically, I do agree with you.

1001
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:59,840
But from a psychoanalytical point of view, I'm not sure that identity exists as such.

1002
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,840
It's like the baby for Winnicott.

1003
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,840
You see, it does not exist as such.

1004
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,840
Freud's thought of identity as a social relationship.

1005
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,840
Identity was social.

1006
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:19,840
And you refer to the London genocide.

1007
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:28,840
There is another book which I recommend, Scott Strauss, who analyzed different villages, different regions.

1008
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:38,840
And I remember the conclusion that the same type of people sometimes did resist other participating in the killing.

1009
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:48,840
In other words, the environment and the political environment was this system in the commitment of the crimes.

1010
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:54,840
So the question is, what does it mean, identity as such?

1011
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,840
I agree, thank you.

1012
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:03,840
I don't think identity is one entity.

1013
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:13,840
Identity is a long and fluctuating process, which has to do with recognition by the other two.

1014
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:23,840
You have your identity, but you are also identified by the look of the other.

1015
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:28,840
Perhaps if I can add something to your remark.

1016
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:38,840
What Charles Melman was discussing with the example of the supporters is a little more than identity.

1017
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:48,840
It's this mixture of results and identity that Clampera, for instance, analyzed very well in the language of the Third Reich.

1018
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:55,840
And I know that book showed exactly what Mussolini did in Italy.

1019
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:09,840
Not just an identity to being Italian or Nazi or German or Aryan as non-drew, but the resource that was allowed to happen.

1020
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:21,840
And I think this is what a good club and my city of Philadelphia is very known for having really very rowdy supporters of the Phillies and so on.

1021
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:29,840
You know, if you join that you will be able to kick out people's heads and bash them and so on.

1022
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,840
That will be part of the little premium.

1023
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:39,840
And so this is the kind of excessive enjoyment I think, in Italy as kinetic.

1024
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:48,840
Try to describe this very well in what has been translated in English as my crowds and massed in German.

1025
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:55,840
It really about the unleashing of enjoyment in a crowd, in massed.

1026
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:03,840
It's I think different from just identity, we all need a certain identity, but that's special kind of identity.

1027
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:11,840
A one line from Avid, I think that fits especially this country very well in our discussion is,

1028
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:35,840
if you are afraid to fall in love, go into business.

1029
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:42,840
BlackSupp IntrInformation has had a powerful issue that StarCraft had since.

1030
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:39,840
It feels Exhibitionist type Curij, exposition, humour, propaganda, incarceration,

1031
01:17:52,840 --> 01:18:03,040
but it doesn't ever actually go in

1032
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:56,940
to a Reich with men in saber

1033
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:00,200
There were a lot of struggle foraged money.

1034
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:06,580
Maybe I'm perfect and the question

1035
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:11,300
And, like right now, it wants to be context

1036
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:14,000
It's a very well addressed

1037
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
But the money's going a bituxed

1038
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,260
If this funeral doesn't hold

1039
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,460
And it'll be favorable for' Westminster

1040
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,480
So we start

1041
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:31,360
in this nature the RanchWerect of some information.

1042
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:37,840
Here are the text for native

1043
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:45,000
which Garcia andcontrol still ask his authors

1044
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:42,520
The

1045
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,940
closest to grow, it's a Tessette

1046
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,120
David

1047
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:53,360
a lot of people who actually likes to do some

1048
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:48,680
And if it will equal those Catherine'sbc

1049
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:52,480
in 2019?

1050
01:20:52,480 --> 01:21:00,720
of translation as a deal against

1051
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:03,700

William

1062
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:39,700
I am very grateful to you for your

1063
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,660
dedication.

1064
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:43,660
I am very grateful to you.

1065
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:47,580
I am very grateful to you for your

1066
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,580
commitment.

1067
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:52,300
No, just to conclude, just something which is

1068
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:57,420
quite rather an anecdote, but came to my mind,

1069
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:03,500
I don't know if you all know that the one who

1070
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:09,500
always fight against the idea of nationalism was

1071
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,700
Sasha Mazor.

1072
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:14,820
And in the same time, he was also the one who

1073
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:19,860
fight to have the first ladies admitted in

1074
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:26,420
university, which is quite interesting because we

1075
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:35,220
evoked the problem of the women identification, women

1076
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:41,820
representing the otherness, and of course, the danger of

1077
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:48,580
nationalism and unique identity when identity becomes

1078
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:53,380
something totally restrictive and not an ongoing process.

1079
01:22:53,380 --> 01:23:04,860
Thank you all for coming tomorrow morning.

1080
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:07,020
The meeting will start at 10 o'clock.

1081
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,020
At 10.
