1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,800
I know there was a bit of a confusion yesterday about the time to start, but we can't really

2
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,020
wait till 10 o'clock because we also have to take our position in the video.

3
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,980
So why don't we start now?

4
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:40,020
This morning's panel, which is the final panel before we open it for a broader discussion,

5
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:49,420
is called Nationalism, Nationalism, and the participants are Emil Malek, who is Director

6
00:00:49,420 --> 00:01:00,000
of Passage, and Adapes, and we have Joe Jayash, who is not here yet, who is out.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,020
We have Lingamuel, writer, professor, School of Visual Arts New York.

8
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,980
We have Paola Mielli, psychoanalyst, president of Abracou, Psychoanatic Association, and

9
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,620
we have Pierre Desser-Nachlenz, who is here from Switzerland, who is professor of International

10
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,660
Relations at UNIL.

11
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,020
So we'll start right away.

12
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,020
Thank you.

13
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,540
Yes, good morning.

14
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,140
Sunday morning in New York is like in Paris.

15
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:40,980
People stay still for breakfast, but we have to work together.

16
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:55,620
Two years ago, we founded the Fides Committee with three objectives.

17
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:07,140
We work about three subjects, education, identity, and nationalism.

18
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:20,020
The idea of the committee is if we could learn from the past to have an orientation for the

19
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,780
future.

20
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,740
It's not easy today because education is a very bad situation.

21
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:43,140
We spoke about this yesterday, identity we could do many things with identity.

22
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,340
It's love, it's death.

23
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,900
We spoke about this yesterday.

24
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,940
And nationalism.

25
00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:01,700
I don't think that nationalism is a close idea.

26
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:09,500
And for these sessions that I have the pleasure to introduce, we have to think nationalism

27
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:20,780
has a concept in evolution and to confront nationalism with globalization today and with

28
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,220
religious extremism today.

29
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:31,540
Because nationalism is not as I told you something close.

30
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:39,140
I will say some words about three or four things.

31
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,980
What is the weather of civilization today?

32
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:56,460
We don't have world-worlds like the last century, but we have conflicts coming.

33
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:04,020
And we don't know if these conflicts are social, economical, political, religious.

34
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,020
They are mixed, completely mixed.

35
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:16,460
Some years ago I wrote a book about this, the name is Al-Qaeda Against Capitalism.

36
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:22,460
I think that Al-Qaeda is also a reaction against capitalism.

37
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:31,940
It's not only a religious extremism, as we have to think about the weather of civilization.

38
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:40,260
Everything to Freud, we have to think about the place of the religion in our society,

39
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,940
but the place also of the spirituality.

40
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,620
What means spirituality today?

41
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:55,260
Because the difference between Marx and Freud with religion, and I will speak about this,

42
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:07,740
is that Freud is discussing with the religious, but Marx puts the religious outside the discussion.

43
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:17,060
We have also to think what is the therapy, what is the therapy, is modern therapy against

44
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:28,940
nationalities, as if cosmopolitanism is the therapy against nationalities yesterday and

45
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,580
today.

46
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,700
What is the weather of civilization today?

47
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:45,420
I think we are living in strange times, very strange times.

48
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:55,940
The past two centuries have been marked by the consequences of two revolutions, French

49
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,340
revolutions and American revolution.

50
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:09,580
And today we don't know exactly what means democracy, progress.

51
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:17,820
We don't know if international trade is good for people or not.

52
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:25,500
And our life today is somewhere without ideology.

53
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:34,820
We don't have no communism, no fascist really, and we could not say that extremism, mostly

54
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:43,660
mixed amism, is fascism, it's something, but we don't know exactly.

55
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:54,420
But what we see in the world, in the peoples, you could also see the same things inside

56
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,140
individuals.

57
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:10,340
Because people they consider that today they could do everything, no limitless in pleasures,

58
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:18,540
no limitless in needs and desires, and sometimes confusion between needs and desires.

59
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:27,140
And today with the internet, with Facebook, Google, other sources of communication, it's

60
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:36,660
impossible to know what is individual, what is private and what is public.

61
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:42,100
And this is a big problem, it's a big problem.

62
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:51,780
Because there is a false sentiment, the false sentiment is that the progress of technology

63
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,020
could be a progress of humanism, it's not true.

64
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,940
If you take the religious people, the Muslim people, the Jewish people, the Christian people

65
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:11,660
who are very orthodox, they are scotch-ups, they like very much internet, Facebook and

66
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,580
all these things.

67
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:22,460
As it's a big problem, that the progress of technology today is not a human progress.

68
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:31,820
It's a facility for work, sometimes it's a facility for long, because it's messy, lingered.

69
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:40,100
But we are not sure today that the progress of science, the progress of technology, is

70
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:46,420
a progress of humanity.

71
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,500
What is happening today is not new.

72
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,220
The man like niche man, it's not true.

73
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:06,020
I found in the poem of Bodleir, everybody knows Bodleir here.

74
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:14,300
He spoke about the idea of God with his omnipotence and omniscience.

75
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:21,100
This is the portrait of the homo economicus modern today.

76
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:30,140
He thinks that he has all the power like a God-man today.

77
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:40,500
And if you take what is happening in Middle East, the ideal of some killers come from

78
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,660
this.

79
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:49,540
They consider themselves with the omnipotence and the omniscience of God.

80
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,940
That is the portrait of our civilization today.

81
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,460
The

82
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:02,660
principal and the least know when they have passions on their sofa.

83
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:14,380
I think that Dr. Nurse Chae-Shion has one day Mr. Madoff in his cabinet.

84
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:27,020
And the speculators, the modern traders, they are typical of style, life.

85
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,860
They don't know where they live.

86
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:37,380
They don't know what is the moment for life, what is the moment for work, what is the moment

87
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,180
for love.

88
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:48,340
They are all the time moving and we have the same thing in the civilization today.

89
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,180
We have connections between religion and populism.

90
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:58,540
We have connections between nationalism and patriotism.

91
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,460
It's not so easy to separate patriotism to nationalism.

92
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,060
For example, flags on windows.

93
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,700
Is it patriotism or is it nationalism?

94
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:21,780
Today what happens in France, we put flags on the windows.

95
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,260
Two months ago, three months ago, it was a nationalist expression.

96
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,180
Today it's a humanist expression.

97
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:38,420
As we have to think, the nationalists in confrontation with the civilization and with

98
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,180
the modern standards.

99
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:47,740
Hello.

100
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:55,780
We are in a civilization where he is going with advances and regresses.

101
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:06,340
I am not going here to substitute myself as a pope or any government in establishing

102
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:13,620
an intangible political prognostic about nationalism.

103
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:25,740
More realistically, I think we have to refer to the Freud works and what Freud said about

104
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:32,140
the hard dance of culture and education in our life.

105
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,700
The eta, the topics of the Freud Committee.

106
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:43,820
We are coming from this and we are going in this way.

107
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:50,060
For himself, Freud was against nationalism.

108
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:57,940
He wrote, national exaltation is a feeling that I am obliged to qualify as disastrous

109
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,060
as an unfair.

110
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,580
This is a philosophy.

111
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:10,540
But personally, he was an European and he stayed an European.

112
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:18,140
He knows that European was not only the country of alignments.

113
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:26,100
He was living in Vienna and he knows that in Vienna it was anti-Semitism, populism,

114
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,220
nationalism and all these things.

115
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,980
As he knows that this subject is a part of the life.

116
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,220
He knows this.

117
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:48,700
But he tried to understand this, not in staying in the moment, but he tried to understand what

118
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,500
is happening in other civilization.

119
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:01,020
Greek, Egyptian, Roman in the Bible and what he finds.

120
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:13,900
He finds what we say yesterday, I have a situation of Freud here.

121
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,940
He wrote about this, death is made of love.

122
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,620
Together they rule the world.

123
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:41,500
I think that with this sentence we could understand what is today happening inside our world.

124
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:53,460
As my question for this session is to understand what we could do against nationalism.

125
00:14:53,460 --> 00:15:01,460
This is a cosmopolitanism, a terra p, against nationalism.

126
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,540
We could think so.

127
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:14,060
But the German civilization at the beginning of the Second World, La Republic, the Weimar,

128
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:20,060
was a very alignment civilization.

129
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:28,660
And what happens 10, 20 years after it was the Nazi civilization.

130
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:37,220
As we are not sure that there is a model of civilization against nationalism, we could

131
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:52,500
only think about two subjects to introduce love and to introduce cosmopolitanism in our

132
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,660
civilization.

133
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:06,060
And we could not be sure that the science progress is enough to struggle the nationalism.

134
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,820
We have to love with this.

135
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:21,620
We have to consider and to discuss all the times with religions, with spirituality.

136
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:31,060
And we have to don't consider that the world of civilization is happening today.

137
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:38,060
I think there is a battle of inside every civilization.

138
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:44,820
If we take the Muslim world, they are inside the Muslim world a battle.

139
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:53,060
They don't know exactly how to confront to globalization.

140
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,580
In the Christian we have the same problem.

141
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,580
In the Jewish we have the same problem.

142
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,580
Israel is also in the same problem.

143
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:10,060
But we have to know that what happens today is not different than what happens at the

144
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,660
beginning of less century.

145
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:22,220
Less century, the intellectuals like Freud, Einstein, and Schneitzler, everybody.

146
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,180
They have the same problem.

147
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:31,380
They have to be proud of their culture, proud of the civilization.

148
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:38,580
And however they tried to be out of the national age.

149
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,740
It was a big problem.

150
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,980
And remember what happened during this time.

151
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,580
In one side he's Freud with an Avant, exactly against the nationalism.

152
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,220
In the other side was Heidegger and Duke.

153
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,940
They were in the Nationalism.

154
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,140
And they are all intellectuals.

155
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,900
All are big intellectuals and however.

156
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:14,140
What is yesterday, I remember yesterday with Ed Hobins.

157
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,140
This is a point interesting.

158
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:27,260
At this time Freud said, I am not Austrian, I am not German, I am also Jewish.

159
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:39,740
As he took Jewish identity as a sense of humanity and not as a religious sense.

160
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:46,300
It was the same view with Stephen Swide, it was the same view with Anarand.

161
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:55,020
They consider that they have to be outside the nation at this time.

162
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,540
Because the nation was completely foolish.

163
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:04,940
Although I think that we don't consider that patriotism could be the solution.

164
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:16,140
There is no solution, we have to struggle every day, every minute and to stay in a way

165
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,140
universality.

166
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,900
This is our project and it is the project of the Freud Committee.

167
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,900
Thank you.

168
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:35,500
And now we begin this panel.

169
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,500
You are writer, professor, school of visual arts in New York.

170
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:50,140
Yes, I am a historian and I will follow your theme of studying the past to understand the

171
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,540
present.

172
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:59,060
You are all familiar with, as you mentioned, that Freud collected antiquities from Egypt

173
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,220
and classical civilization.

174
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:17,020
And I am going to just describe a few and I brought a cast of one to show you.

175
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:24,180
Freud began collecting in the 1890s and he assembled a collection of several thousand

176
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,380
objects.

177
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:35,580
Throughout his writing from the 1890s until his death, he makes the analogy between psycho

178
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:41,900
analysis, digging in the past and the memories and reconstructing the history of the patient

179
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:51,060
and archeologist, digging up buried fragments and reconstructing the history of a city.

180
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:57,100
I will read you one quote from him from the 1890s.

181
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:07,260
Thus it came about in this first full length analysis of hysteria that I arrived at a procedure

182
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,180
of clearing away psychological material layer by layer.

183
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,860
And we like to compare it to the technique of excavating a buried city.

184
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,500
That is from studies in hysteria.

185
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:27,220
If you have been to the Freud Museum in London or if you have seen photograph, you know,

186
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:38,180
the Freud organized his collection or about 30 objects like an audience on his desk and

187
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,980
he wrote by hand.

188
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:46,620
And he just reminded, he thought of himself as writing for the ages, not for the contemporary

189
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:55,100
anti-Semitic medical community in Vienna, but for the Chinese scholar, for Osiris Lagada,

190
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,540
the under world.

191
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,380
In the center, he didn't collect Asian antiquities.

192
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:10,620
They were given to him as gifts, but he kept them and he featured them in his collection.

193
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,580
The center of his desk is a scholar's screen.

194
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:20,980
No, it's with a Jade scholar, a Chinese scholar in the center of it.

195
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:27,500
In the front of that, he put his favorite piece, a statue of Athena, goddess of wisdom and

196
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
war.

197
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,780
He was a fighter.

198
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:38,180
Also on his desk, he had Osiris, okay, god of the under world, and then a smaller statue

199
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:44,940
of his wife Isis, suckling little Horus, her baby.

200
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:53,460
And the legend of Osiris in the legend, as you recall, Osiris was killed by his brother

201
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,060
Seth, who was jealous.

202
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:03,700
And he dismembered his body, scattered the body of Osiris down the Nile River.

203
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:09,020
Many women would have given up if her husband was dead and dismembered, but not Isis.

204
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:15,820
She got her own boat, traveled down the Nile, found the pieces, put them back together,

205
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,100
and assembled the first mummy.

206
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,020
It's her legend.

207
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:26,580
And then she magically conceived a child and raised little Horus, who we've seen, seen

208
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:34,060
suckling on this statue, to avenge the death of his father, which he did.

209
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:40,980
And for Freud, these stories retold, he looks to these stories because they're retellings

210
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:48,580
and they're the essence of human emotions, love, jealousy, sibling rivalry, marital devotion,

211
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,020
revenge.

212
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:55,860
Another figure, it's a baboon of thought, okay?

213
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,580
It sits in the corner of Freud's desk.

214
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:07,980
It's a little marble baboon, very animal looking, and it has in the top of it a half moon.

215
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,780
It's a deity of thought.

216
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:21,820
And he combines the lower animal deity with a sophisticated intellectual who thought.

217
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:27,340
Thought is traditionally the inventor of hieroglyphics.

218
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:35,380
And as such, the baboon of thought, it reminds us that our animal passions underlie our higher

219
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,060
intellectual pursuits, represented by thought.

220
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:46,220
And the baboon of thought was all, Freud also liked it because it was the, the baboon of

221
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:52,780
thought featured as the judge in the weighing of the heart ceremony after death.

222
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:59,580
Okay, after the body was dismembered and the parts put in jars, the baboon of thought

223
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:05,860
was the judge of whether the deceased, not whether he'd been good or bad, but whether

224
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,300
he told the truth.

225
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:20,580
The little sphinx, and this I brought you a, I don't want to get unplugged here, all

226
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,980
right?

227
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,580
This is a, this is a cast of Freud's, one that's in Freud's study.

228
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,740
So it's, so it's a cast, like a museum reproduction.

229
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:37,580
It's a, the original is terracotta, sphinx, Hellenistic, it's from the second century

230
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,580
BC.

231
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,660
Okay, and so Freud owned this in about six other sphinxes.

232
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:48,060
He has a black figure of vase that's edifice on the sphinx.

233
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,060
Okay?

234
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:56,700
Anyway, and Freud collected these because he felt that the myth of edifice in the sphinx

235
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:02,540
is told by the playwright Safa Glies that it captured a stage in child development,

236
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,100
little boys.

237
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,900
And this is a quote from Freud.

238
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,580
This is a letter to Fleese in the 1890s.

239
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:15,180
I found in my own case too, being in love with my mother and jealous of my father.

240
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:21,020
And now I consider a universal event in early childhood, if though we can understand the

241
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:26,620
gripping power of Safa Glies's edifice rex, and why we all appreciate this statue, the

242
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:34,980
timelessness of these stories and what they tell us about the human condition and history.

243
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:41,420
The, the couch in, in Vienna, and you have photographs, you have the, all the Engelman

244
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:47,180
photographs downstairs in your library, I, I'm see.

245
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:52,060
And if you recall, over the couch, there's a, there's a print.

246
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,900
It's a very, the original is a very colorful print.

247
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:02,940
It still exists in London of Abu Sembal, you know, the, the Rakka Temple.

248
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:10,540
And it's, it's a reminder, you know, so it's a reminder of Freud's word play and love of

249
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:17,980
worth that this temple that cuts deep into Mother Earth is a, that the tran, the, the

250
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:24,820
name translates Father symbol, Abu for the Hebrew for Father in Sembal, the German for

251
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,500
symbol.

252
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:35,580
And Freud studied history, mythology, archaeology as a way of understanding his patience and

253
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,460
the politics of his time, you know, as you've said so well.

254
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,460
Yeah.

255
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,260
And today it's important for us as educators.

256
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:50,860
We're both teachers at the school of visual art and the others of you are teachers to

257
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,020
teach the lessons of history.

258
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,660
Throughout his long life, Freud continued to make this analogy.

259
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:04,340
And I'm going to end with a quote from the end of his life on the analogy between archaeology,

260
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,220
studying the past and psychoanalysis.

261
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,540
The first quote I gave you was from 1890s.

262
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:15,380
This is from 1937, the very end of his life.

263
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,180
And it, he came to feel at the end of his life, he was even in a better condition than

264
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,660
archaeologists.

265
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,820
They were dealing just with desiccated dead material, things had been buried.

266
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,780
And his patient was right there alive, right there before him.

267
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,540
He could keep trying to get more information.

268
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,940
Okay, this is Freud, 1937.

269
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:43,780
The psychoanalyst's work of construction resembles to a great extent an archaeologist's

270
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:50,060
excavation of some dwelling place that's been destroyed and buried.

271
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:57,220
The two processes are in fact identical, except that the analyst works under better conditions

272
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:02,580
and has more material at his command to assist him because what he's working with is still

273
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580
alive.

274
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,180
Okay, thank you.

275
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,180
Thank you.

276
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
Thank you.

277
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,180
Thank you.

278
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
Thank you.

279
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,180
Thank you.

280
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,180
Thank you.

281
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,180
Thank you.

282
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,180
Thank you.

283
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
Thank you.

284
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,180
Thank you.

285
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:26,060
I think that your discussion with your work is very important because you say that for

286
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:32,300
Freud archaeology was perhaps more important than psychology.

287
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,300
Oh, no.

288
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:47,900
No, but you use it because I remember two days or one day before he lived Vienna to Paris,

289
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,580
somebody asked him, are you free?

290
00:29:52,580 --> 00:30:02,420
I know that you are living and he said, no, I am not free until my antics are living with

291
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,460
me to London.

292
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,460
What do you think?

293
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,460
Why?

294
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:20,340
He has a so strong linkage with his antics and he wanted that all his antics could travel

295
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:31,060
with him as a matter of his work, why he was so pregnant with this.

296
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:36,540
Well, but he was a realist.

297
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:44,900
They're beautiful objects and he lived with them for so long and he purchased each himself.

298
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:53,300
Each one he took to the curator of antiquities at the Küsse Sorsches Museum and had it authenticated.

299
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,820
He was very fussy about the authenticity.

300
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:05,540
But he was a realist and you recall he asked the person who was going to help him get the

301
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:12,180
antiquities out, Marie Bonaparte, a gentile woman of wealth who could get them.

302
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:18,940
He was a realist and said that he might not have them all and asked her to smuggle one

303
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,940
out.

304
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:25,540
She dropped in her purse the little figure of Athena and he said, if I'm going to die

305
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,820
without these, I'd like her with me.

306
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,260
She put it in her purse and gave it back to him.

307
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:36,740
She was able to get the whole collection out.

308
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:42,700
He was so happy to have it surrounded, but he was a realist to about the times.

309
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:53,980
But today, the person who is a collectioner, you think that it's to have some eternity

310
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,900
to put them in front of him in a desk in a house?

311
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,900
Yeah.

312
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
Why?

313
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,660
Well, let's go to Freud again.

314
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,180
Freud almost never wrote about his collection.

315
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:12,220
He said one thing about it that I ever found was that what was it to collect?

316
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:19,580
He said what the collector has a surplus of libido and he puts it into objects, a love

317
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,380
of things.

318
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:31,820
No, that it's like a love of a person, but there's an attachment to it, a surplus of

319
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,380
libido.

320
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:43,540
And you said also that the emotions, he confronts emotions of antiques that use with emotions

321
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,020
of his passions.

322
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,780
And from this, he's coming the reflection.

323
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,780
Yeah.

324
00:32:52,780 --> 00:33:01,060
And I think the analogy is more the history of the object with the history of his patient.

325
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:06,100
You know, some would say, well, there's nothing the matter with his patient.

326
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,380
And he would say, no, it's a fragment.

327
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,860
It's from somewhere.

328
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,820
There's a story behind it.

329
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,460
Somebody made her.

330
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,780
And no, no, no to nationalism.

331
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:26,380
Do you think the extreme right in many countries, they consider that the modern is against

332
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,340
history and what is happening?

333
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,580
Do you think that it's true?

334
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:43,340
Well, the things that modern life, the globalization is something without history, without past.

335
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:49,740
Do you think that the critique is founded when the extreme rights is saying that the

336
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:56,740
modern people, they don't understand history, they don't have respect for these things?

337
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:05,980
Yes, of course, I mean that part of our problems internationally are a lack of knowledge of

338
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,980
history.

339
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,740
We have people destroying history, destroying objects from this time frame in the near

340
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,260
reefs today, as you know.

341
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:19,300
And it's a lack of understanding of history.

342
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:25,300
But also, whoever's, you know, the people that are doing that know the power of history.

343
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,540
That's why they want to destroy the temples.

344
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:36,700
You know, it's a way of destroying the influence of the West in Syria to destroy these temples.

345
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,900
So as a teacher, we need to understand it.

346
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:49,020
And why throughout history, people who have been conquerors have smashed the statues and

347
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,460
torn down the buildings.

348
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,620
And that in the end, we're all one people.

349
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:59,900
And Freud knew that's why he had on his desk Egyptian, Greek, Chinese.

350
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,020
It's all about the same humanity and to teach that lesson.

351
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,020
Yeah.

352
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,260
What's the reason one word about Freud's writing?

353
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,860
Because you mentioned it first as an art.

354
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,940
And what means good you speak from here?

355
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Yes.

356
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,940
You mentioned Freud's writing.

357
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,940
Uh-huh.

358
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,940
Because killing would be right.

359
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,940
Oh, yeah.

360
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,940
As an art.

361
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,300
Can you say something about that?

362
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,620
Well, I don't know that I could.

363
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,620
He just wrote long hand.

364
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,620
You know, and he-

365
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,620
It's incredible.

366
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,620
He's got it right.

367
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,060
I have spent a thousand hours with it at the Library of Congress.

368
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,060
Yeah, I'm familiar.

369
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,060
Yeah.

370
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,060
I wouldn't say it.

371
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:47,700
It's extremely difficult to, you know, once you learn to read it.

372
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,140
I don't actually see it that way.

373
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,580
I mean, not like Chinese calligraphy.

374
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,180
I mean, that's done as an art form.

375
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,660
It's done as to make the body of the mind as one.

376
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Okay.

377
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,460
I mean, I think it's just a sign of his time that he wrote by hand.

378
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,860
You know, I would rather than using a typewriter.

379
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,260
I mean, I would think that that more, yeah.

380
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,700
I hope I don't disappoint you.

381
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:20,500
Well, first I want to say we're having a wonderful morning.

382
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,140
I want to say a very stimulating idea as from the very beginning.

383
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,820
And I want to congratulate the French Committee and Dr. Nuressetian for getting together all

384
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,020
this assembly of people.

385
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:40,380
What I want to ask you, I mean, is whether you would like to consider one more aspect

386
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,540
of what you're discussing.

387
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,260
I eat the concept of power.

388
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,540
Since you mentioned Friedrich Nietzsche and the Superman.

389
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:55,740
I think the missing thing in Freud is power.

390
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:01,420
He couldn't deal with it because of his own reasons with issues of power and control

391
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,420
over the movement.

392
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:10,260
But I think if you want to understand nationalism and what he does is that these people are

393
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,180
drunk with power.

394
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,780
And this is true of them and of the Nazis.

395
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,900
The enlightened world also has issues with power.

396
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:26,060
So I think I would like for you to consider adding it to our project of teaching about

397
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:33,620
the issues that we have today as we had all through civilization with power.

398
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:41,860
And to lean, I'd like you to ask, you must have considered that too, we have here a program

399
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:46,820
way back with Philip T. is about the first gradiva.

400
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:52,500
And gradiva is also a very important piece in his collection that Barry Leif and how

401
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,660
it influenced his thinking.

402
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,460
In a proper history, there was one philosopher in England, R.G.

403
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:06,420
Collingwood, who connected historical research and historical understanding with archaeology

404
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,780
in a very important way.

405
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:18,300
Yes, an answer to R.G. about power.

406
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:31,540
When you regard modern history for less century, there is some nationalism who have succeeded.

407
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:37,020
For example, like Zionism.

408
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:50,020
If you confront what is writing about Zionism by Martin Buber, Gersham Sholem, Zing Munfroid,

409
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,900
he wrote about Zionism.

410
00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:06,540
All of them, they consider that Zionism could be universal, could be something for elevation

411
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,980
spirit.

412
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:21,260
And they were, all of them against the nationalism, but is it possible that power could succeed

413
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,220
without nationalism?

414
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,220
It's a big problem.

415
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:29,300
I don't think it's a possibility to do.

416
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:36,260
And it's exactly the same for all ideologies, all communities.

417
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:44,980
At the beginning, communism was power without nationalism, at the beginning, as an idea.

418
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,100
But it was the same everywhere.

419
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:59,340
But when we confront the idea with Passage Al Act, it's different.

420
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:09,780
As we could not say that nationalism is a way of construction of something.

421
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:19,980
It's what is coming when you go to Passage Al Act, you confront this thing.

422
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,100
As we could, it's a big problem.

423
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:32,180
And it's why we say that intellectuals are not in the reality somewhere, because they

424
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:42,260
are in anticipation of something, but when something arrives, they are outside the processes.

425
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:48,220
At the beginning, for example, the Syrianist Ben Gurion went exactly in the same position

426
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,660
of Martin Buber.

427
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,260
And after, he changed completely.

428
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:01,780
And there is a French writer who is not especially in favor of Israel.

429
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:07,700
He was director of a left Christian review of a screen.

430
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,340
He said something very interesting.

431
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:20,140
He said, don't consider the

432
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:27,020
way they need to have a construction of ideas.

433
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,460
But from this construction to the state is different.

434
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,980
That is a big problem.

435
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,500
Maybe we should do the round table.

436
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,780
And then because we have time afterwards for everybody to participate and ask questions

437
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,140
and interact with.

438
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:52,620
Perhaps Lynn has an answer to what a small answer I'd love to give you.

439
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:57,220
Yeah, I don't have an answer.

440
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,860
We could follow.

441
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:07,460
Hello, no, it's Paul, I'm Neil Yip, sequinarist.

442
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:14,380
First of all, thank you very much for inviting me to this colloquium, which I find very productive.

443
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:21,500
And I want to thank in particular the committee of Freud, the New York Secunality Society,

444
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,060
and Dr. Narcissian for organizing this event.

445
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:37,820
I'm going to try to extrapolate from my thinking for this encounter a few points.

446
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:44,020
I have to say that when I was invited to reflect upon nationalism and fundamentalism, I realized

447
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,980
that the topic is immense.

448
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:54,980
That is practically the more you read about it, the more you try to reflect upon it, the

449
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,500
more you are led to someplace else.

450
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,580
Because it's a very extensive question.

451
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:11,620
And as I mean, Malle was saying before, the very notion of nationalism is a notion in

452
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,620
progress, is a flux.

453
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,540
So it's difficult to tackle.

454
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:24,060
But I'm going to extrapolate a few points in order to find a little bit of a structure

455
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:30,340
for us to think about all these topics together.

456
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:37,420
The first thing that came to my mind when I thought about this particular question of

457
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:48,900
fundamentalism is actually pictures that I saw in October 2001 of demonstrators that

458
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:55,060
in Bangladesh that were part of the anti-U.S. protest.

459
00:43:55,060 --> 00:44:01,380
And that they were carrying banners with Osama bin Laden picture on them.

460
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:10,980
That in these banners on the back of Osama bin Laden's shoulders were appearing burnt.

461
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:19,580
That is to say the map is from Cezamis Street, which is a very, very popular children TV transmission

462
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,540
in United States.

463
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:29,620
So it was very surprising to see that the West Public Enemy Number One was shown alongside

464
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:35,860
a children character that is loved by the American media and that is a spoken voice

465
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,340
of American values.

466
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:46,860
And it seemed to me very significant because if all fundamentalism, and I think that this

467
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:53,580
is a point that we have to underline, all fundamentalism share protesting and reacting

468
00:44:53,580 --> 00:45:03,220
against change, resisting modernization, secularization, that they regard as the threat to the very

469
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,580
roots of their cultural identity.

470
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:17,900
As this example shows, in fact, the contamination they are resisting so furiously has already

471
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:27,020
happened, has already always happened because fundamentalists are in fact an integral part

472
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,060
of the world that they condemn.

473
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:36,300
And this is a number one point that I want to stress.

474
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,380
Even the fact that fundamentalists consider themselves being the guardian of a certain

475
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:50,660
orthodoxy that is bound to a certain identity, this brings us back to the question of identity

476
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,020
but I would say in particular to the question of cultural identity.

477
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,740
Yesterday we discussed the question of identity.

478
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:02,940
We didn't spend much time on the question of cultural identity.

479
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,780
In my view is structurally connected to the notion of a nation.

480
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:14,980
It is historically connected to the very birth of the idea of nations, of modern nations,

481
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:23,420
which we have to differentiate from the old notions of nations.

482
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,460
Let's put it this way, states, etc.

483
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:35,700
So the question of cultural identity, which should be threatened according to fundamentalists.

484
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:42,420
And okay, but for cultural identity obviously we make reference to a certain specific cultural

485
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:50,980
baggage that is given to a social group which mostly shares the same language but includes

486
00:46:50,980 --> 00:47:00,980
traditional experiences, values, know-how that are related to a particular social exchange

487
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,060
and particular geographical environment.

488
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:12,540
This idea of cultural identity as I was saying is connected with the modern notion of nation

489
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:25,020
which as Dr. Malay was pointing out concerns, it's an idea that is grown together with

490
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:33,420
the major revolutions of the 18th century and that leads to the legal adoption of natural

491
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:44,460
law, which implies a state whose power is not any longer absolute but is limited.

492
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:53,100
That is to say a new notion of the state which is the state founded on the rights of men

493
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:59,860
where the state is considered as a function of the individual and the individual no longer

494
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,620
considered as a function of the state.

495
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:14,260
So we see that the notion of cultural identity is by its very nature in flux.

496
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:23,620
Cultural identity maintain an unstable equilibrium between tradition and transformation constantly.

497
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:33,980
And as we were saying every notion of identity implies I'm not going to go now on the psychoanalytical

498
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:39,900
approach of the notion of identity which I find though extremely significant for the

499
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,340
understanding of this issue.

500
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:50,100
But just to say it in a few words, the process, the operation identification in psychoanalyzes

501
00:48:50,100 --> 00:49:00,140
indicates how identification relies structurally on an alienation.

502
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:07,060
The emergence of the ego, of the eye, of the subject of an assertion necessitates a passage

503
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:14,260
through what Mackand would call in an undefined subject, a reciprocal subject, that is to

504
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:20,380
say in exchange with the collective, to the point that the collective becomes the very

505
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,700
subject of the individual.

506
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:29,940
And obviously this is very clear when we think about the very manner in which the newborn

507
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:38,540
baby is basically impacted by the exchange with the other, an exchange with the other

508
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:46,620
that is in this very, you know, timing which is occurring at transmission that is symbolic

509
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:56,940
and imaginary, a real transmission that implies a certain inscription of pleasure on the body.

510
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:08,860
So I would say that subject identity in this respect is also a cultural identity by its

511
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,620
very nature.

512
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:18,060
But the process of identification is a process that doesn't occur only in childhood but doesn't

513
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:25,420
cease to develop throughout one's own life according to one's own social life, standing

514
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:31,540
the historical context in which we live, work, study, health and so on and so forth.

515
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:40,980
So in a sense identity is always cultural identities, is always in the state of becoming.

516
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:49,420
And therefore includes both an ocean of the community of kin and the idea of plurality

517
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,820
and difference by definition.

518
00:50:52,820 --> 00:51:02,500
So it's both, you know, a community of kin but at the same time plurality and difference.

519
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:07,380
I think that is very important because every time that we make reference to the idea of

520
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:17,740
cultural identity as if it were a unified concept, a one, it's in fact, you know, something

521
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:24,180
that is by definition very far from the notion of a cultural identity because it apostasized

522
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,780
the idea of sameness.

523
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:36,580
It somehow brings about a cult of the one that contradicts the very nature of the constitution

524
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:43,020
of the subject of language which by definition is the effect of the collective.

525
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:51,220
So every time that we speak of the one and sameness as a, you know, reference of identity

526
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:58,140
identification, we are basically, you know, contradicting the very nation of this part.

527
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:08,940
So I want to just say a word on the question of, because, you know, every time that we

528
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:16,500
see in history and also subjectively, the need, emerging the need of making reference

529
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:24,980
to a pre-stablish identity identification, the weaker is the subject that is expressing

530
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:25,980
it.

531
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,980
The weaker is the subject that is expressing it.

532
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:33,620
As it is in case, for instance, in adolescent when we see, you know, adolescent that are

533
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:40,420
in need of separating from their own, you know, family very easily embracing, you know,

534
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:47,100
group identification that allowed them to, you know, fabricate a sort of identification

535
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:51,580
faced to their own subjective vulnerability.

536
00:52:51,580 --> 00:53:02,420
So if a vulnerable subject finds is also support in the group and Freud has shown that putting

537
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:11,820
a person, a thing or an ideology at the place of the idea of the idea fosters the libidinal

538
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:18,180
ties among the members and strengthen the feeling of belonging.

539
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:26,540
As we said yesterday, the results of this, you know, identification to the group is very

540
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:35,660
often submission, homologization, normalization as, as Dr. Eisler pointed out yesterday, many,

541
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:44,020
many significant issue that is the responsibility, that is to say giving up, you know, one zone

542
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:48,860
responsible, subjective responsibility.

543
00:53:48,860 --> 00:54:00,820
Therefore, I would say to try to address, you know, the question of, you know, when is

544
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:08,780
it an uncertain historical moment, certain, you know, acting out as you were pointing

545
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,980
out occur?

546
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:18,580
I would say that the more the symbolic contest is lacking, and we go back to the question

547
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:27,620
that Dr. Menman pointed out yesterday, you know, the more there is lack of recognition

548
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:37,220
of social integration, of education, on effective, the more there is effective isolation, segregation,

549
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:46,380
marginalization, and the more unstable obviously is the subjective image, right?

550
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:54,740
And the ego responds to this instability with a defensive rigidity, Dr. Menman's call it

551
00:54:54,740 --> 00:55:05,820
virility yesterday, I would call it a paranoid rigidity, which very easily leads to aggressivity,

552
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:11,300
violence, and self-destruction.

553
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:16,620
As a Lakantotas, and I think that this is a very important point to underline, you know,

554
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:28,140
hatred is triggered by the very reaction of the ego vis-a-vis its own ideination, vis-a-vis

555
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,380
the ideination that constitutes itself, right?

556
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:36,620
So it's an internal sort, you know, process.

557
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:42,140
I just want to say that just another point that I think that is important because it

558
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:48,420
brings back something that Claude discussed yesterday.

559
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:58,340
Leaders take advantage of the individual weaknesses, obviously to reinforce the group's cohesion

560
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,260
and to obtain the submissions of the members.

561
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:06,700
But this submission, though, and I think that a psychoanalyst, we cannot, you know, not

562
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:13,700
take this into account, relies on manipulating the libidinal drives.

563
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:17,020
This is a point, right?

564
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:25,540
Which allows to run free these drives in the service of a common ideology.

565
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:33,220
For instance, whether the individual is rewarded or gratifies in this way, boasting his narcissism

566
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:42,540
or allowing him to kill, to rape, to dominate, to humiliate, that is to say the group and

567
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:50,300
the leaders of the group allow the, you know, members of the group to satisfy what Claude

568
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,260
called the murder lust, right?

569
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:57,620
Which I think it's a very important concept that Claude offered us.

570
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:01,780
That is not the same as the toadistribe, right?

571
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:12,000
Yesterday we discussed about the La Puscheon de Moix, the dev drives, and we saw how,

572
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,780
well, Freud spoke extensively about it, you know, how the drives are by the definitions,

573
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:19,780
you know, fused.

574
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:31,620
We have libidinal and the drive used to date, and that their fusion is at work, not in our

575
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:43,140
daily life, in our, you know, processing, as well as in our relation to the social bonding.

576
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:50,660
I think that it's, but it's worth it to distinguish, you know, the concept of murder lust, which

577
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:56,660
is something different from that, of that drives, because it brings about the murder

578
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:02,740
lust is just the last, the pleasure, the Jewish sons of killing, right?

579
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:08,780
Which means about precisely what Claude was pointing out yesterday, that is to say, you

580
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:16,660
know, the question of the Jewish sons that is unleashed, and that we see unleashed in,

581
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:23,420
unfortunately, every week in one some kind of mass murder going on.

582
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:28,700
So I think that it's worth it for us to work on this difference.

583
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:36,980
I also want to, another point I want to make is that, you know, I would like, it's definitely

584
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:43,660
true that we cannot come up with a definition of a notion of nationalism, but I think that

585
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:50,380
is worth it all to try to define the origins of these terms, right?

586
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:56,580
Because this will allow us, in a sense, to, you know, use a vocabulary in a certain manner

587
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:00,340
that maybe is clarifying.

588
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:06,660
Because, you know, the notion of nation, a modern nation is born, as I was saying before,

589
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:11,060
with, you know, a certain new conceptualization of the state.

590
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:21,500
By nation, we mean a cultural community of territorial relationship of kinship, right?

591
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:31,700
A state, instead, designates a structure that exercises a certain power of sovereignty on

592
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:36,700
a given territory through particular institution.

593
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:42,540
So the two concepts do not overlap, nation and state, right?

594
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:49,740
Because one is, you know, a cultural concept, and the other one is a legislative concept.

595
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,820
There are two different concepts.

596
00:59:52,820 --> 01:00:00,180
On the other hand, instead, nationalism, the concept of nationalism, you know, denotates

597
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,060
an ideology.

598
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:09,100
And actually, nationalism is a pretty recent concept, if you think about, you know, the,

599
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:17,660
for instance, the 1808, you know, fixed declaration on, you know, the reading on the

600
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:22,340
Deutsche Nash and that's, that's your own, right?

601
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:30,300
But is an ideology that presupposes, by definition, an opposition between one nation and the other,

602
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:37,700
and supports a single systematic vision that does not tolerate difference.

603
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:46,500
So in a sense, there is nothing that is far from the notion of nation, because nation

604
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:51,900
is a community in kinship, therefore a community in difference, right?

605
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,380
Then the notion of nationalism, right?

606
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,740
So here we have a paradox, right?

607
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:07,780
And in fact, you know, the very appeal to nationalism very often leads to destroying the cultural

608
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,500
identity of the nation.

609
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:16,340
You saw this obviously in Germany, where, you know, the very, you know, plurality of

610
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:25,740
the culture, of the quality of the German, you know, identity, cultural identity was

611
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:32,060
completely destroyed, you know, during Nazism, right?

612
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:37,700
And it's the same thing in a sense of what is happening today in certain, you know, in

613
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:45,060
this attack that, you know, the ISIS state, and by the way, I mean, I think that we have

614
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:52,980
to pay a little bit of attention here on the vicissitudes of the name ISIS, ISIS, et cetera.

615
01:01:52,980 --> 01:02:00,020
That is to say the name that Ash attributes to itself, because it's a name that has been,

616
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:05,860
you know, progressively modified over the last six years, seven years, and that is a name

617
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:11,420
that constantly makes reference to the notion of state, right?

618
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:22,900
And you know, obviously of an idea of an absolute state, which characteristic is precisely to

619
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:29,260
the nationalize, the nationalize, the nations that are conquered.

620
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:38,580
That is to say, to destroy the symbolic inheritance of this culture, right?

621
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:42,180
But including their own culture, right?

622
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:47,100
They are calling it their own culture, their own history of one's own culture.

623
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:52,220
I think that is very important because there is an aspect that I think we cannot not take

624
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:59,220
into account regarding what's happening in Paris, right, in this respect.

625
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:07,580
Because I could not not think, I mean, the question that yesterday was raised and why

626
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:15,020
is it that the issue, what happened in Paris, struck the world differently in a sense than

627
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:20,980
all the, you know, mass boundaries that are occurring, you know, at the same time, the

628
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:21,980
world.

629
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:27,860
I think that there is one reason that has not been mentioned, that has to do precisely

630
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:36,300
with the fact that this occurs in France, that is to say, in a country that had a French

631
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:45,420
revolution and had instituted a state organized on the rights of men, right?

632
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:53,380
I think that we cannot think of fundamentalism, you know, extrapolated from, as you were pointing

633
01:03:53,380 --> 01:04:08,220
out, the history, the modern history of industrialization, you know, colonization definitely, and globalization,

634
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,300
all the points that you pointed out.

635
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:22,260
But we cannot, you know, not take into account the fact that, you know, the idea of a state

636
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:31,100
that is proposed by ISIS is precisely opposite to the state that is being defended with the

637
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,620
French revolution in France.

638
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:41,060
That is to say, there is a no position on the notion of state that is a state here, right?

639
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:47,860
So, and, but I want, in this respect, I want to say that obviously the state of the rights

640
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:58,940
of men and that effect, obviously the democracy, the Western democracy, you know, is not, is

641
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:04,580
not not affecting also, you know, the Eastern one, right?

642
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:11,100
So as I was saying at the beginning, you know, is a discourse that is already taking place

643
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:17,380
within the very states that are fighting against it.

644
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:24,420
Because I would like just to, can I say one more thing?

645
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,420
One.

646
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,420
Okay.

647
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,420
Just one more thing.

648
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:33,300
I would return on certain consideration that I would say a constructive consideration.

649
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:39,580
But in order to do that, I would return in the discussion, I just want to say one thing

650
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:48,980
regarding with one thing, women, right?

651
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:51,420
Because it's relevant that all the form of formalism, fundamentalism, you know, from

652
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:55,140
different cultures, they target women, right?

653
01:05:55,140 --> 01:06:01,740
I mean, it's very clear in Evangelic fundamentalism, in the history of Evangelic fundamentalism

654
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:09,340
in United States, we should not forget that fundamentalism, the very word comes from the

655
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:17,540
foundation of faith that were, you know, spelled out and written by the Baptist Church

656
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:33,260
in United States in, you know, in the 1915, 16th, right?

657
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:36,300
But, you know, they express a common target that is women.

658
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:45,100
So I think that this leads us back to the question of hatred as Lacan taught us, as the

659
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:54,220
passion that is the closest to the very, I would say, existence, let's say in English,

660
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,940
division of the subject of language.

661
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:04,260
And that is precisely in response to such a division that it expresses itself.

662
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:16,020
It's not accident that Freud makes the refusal of femininity, a blag on their vibrate, the

663
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:25,420
key factors of resistance of the subject against his own truth, her own truth, regardless

664
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:30,740
one's own sex, is the refusal of femininity.

665
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:38,340
Obviously, and I want to stop on this, this implies a certain confrontation with quantum

666
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:46,780
subjective difference that is, you know, for many unbearable, right?

667
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:53,900
So I would say that the cult of the one that we see manifested today in many forms of

668
01:07:53,900 --> 01:08:03,940
recurrence to nationalism or to certain ideologies, you know, it's in fact, you know, a fetishization

669
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:07,740
of the cult of the one.

670
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:14,540
And that is the, based on the denial of one's own subjective existence, okay?

671
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,540
Thank you, Paula.

672
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:26,740
Thank you, Paula, for your brilliant communication.

673
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:30,900
Very briefly, three remarks.

674
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:34,940
You speak about nationalism and patriotism.

675
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:39,700
There is a reference in this game.

676
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:49,380
The general goal, he wrote in his memories, there is a big difference between national

677
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,300
ism and patriotism.

678
01:08:51,300 --> 01:09:00,460
And he said, nationalism is if we love the earth, the territory, the traditions.

679
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:08,180
And nationalism is if you exclude the differences.

680
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:12,780
It means who is not inside this is outside.

681
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:22,540
However, the culture of the goal was some thinkers like Barres and Barres consider that

682
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:25,020
we have to love the territories.

683
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:30,780
And from these ideas are coming also the bad nationalism.

684
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,180
It means there is a contradiction.

685
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:34,180
Absolutely.

686
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:40,660
You speak about cultural education and cultural identification.

687
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:48,300
How could you explain that inside the family, one brother could be a good man and one is

688
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,220
a murderer?

689
01:09:50,220 --> 01:10:00,180
And other consequence, Melman said yesterday that the women are not abroad, not stranger.

690
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:02,700
It means there is some universality.

691
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:09,660
How do you explain that today the murderer could be also a woman?

692
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,420
This is new.

693
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:23,700
And the third remark, you say that people need to be recognized to stop the alienation.

694
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:32,660
Do you think that it's possible to include Muslim culture in our global culture and civilization?

695
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:36,380
Should I try now?

696
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,260
If you think briefly and after.

697
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:46,540
So I want to say number one, there is a psychoanalytic concept that is the concept of the liberation

698
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:54,340
of identification which by definition is both structural and singular.

699
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:59,620
There is not such a thing as identity, for instance.

700
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:08,020
Two brothers within the same family, they may share a certain cultural background, but

701
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:12,580
they occupy a different symbolic place within the family.

702
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:18,460
So therefore there is no sameness here.

703
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:26,060
Each individual is by definition unique, even though belongs by definition to a symbolic

704
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:27,260
order.

705
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:30,500
But this by definition implies difference.

706
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,020
So there is not same in this concept.

707
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:39,980
So you can have two brothers of the same family behaving in ways, or having, developing

708
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:43,340
ones on identification in radically different manner.

709
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:51,180
This depends on the dialectic of their relation with their own caretakers which could change

710
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:53,260
radically.

711
01:11:53,260 --> 01:12:07,340
The question of the woman, I'm totally agreement with the daughter man, the radical other,

712
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:14,900
and what I'm saying is that Freud himself, the one brings about the notion of the refusal

713
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:22,580
of femininity, is bringing about the notion of, sorry.

714
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:31,980
The subjective refusal vis-a-vis its own alterity, the very alterity that he now beats it.

715
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:42,580
And regarding the question of, you know, this implies that women can be equally in denial

716
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:45,900
of their femininity than men.

717
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,500
There is no problem regarding this.

718
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:55,940
The lakana has explained to us, and thoroughly, how the subject position within sexation is

719
01:12:55,940 --> 01:13:04,500
a particular choice, and any subject can occupy either a male or a female position.

720
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:10,740
So it's not a question of the gender, what is the stake here.

721
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:21,700
So any kind of woman may decide to embrace the logic of the one, viral, the notion of

722
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:31,260
virility, or I would say a phallic ideology, and behaving that direction.

723
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:41,380
And to conclude with cultural, Muslim culture, recognize.

724
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,780
So to speak, this is a very complicated question.

725
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:50,460
I don't think that there is a big mistake in thinking that the masculine culture is a

726
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,460
one.

727
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:58,780
It's like saying the Western culture is a one, or Christianism is a one, or Judaism

728
01:13:58,780 --> 01:13:59,780
is a one.

729
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:02,100
I don't think that this is the case at all.

730
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:09,180
I think that, you know, when we speak about the masculine culture, we are speaking about

731
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:19,500
a variety of approach, vis-a-vis a certain cultural identification and a certain religious

732
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,980
identification.

733
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:31,020
We know that there are certain characteristics of Muslims that differentiate the Islamic

734
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:34,580
religions from the other form of monotheism.

735
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:40,500
And I think that Dr. Melman spoke yesterday about the fundamental one, that is to say

736
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,100
the direct idea of the text dictated by God.

737
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:50,780
But there are others that I think that are number one, since the very beginning, we've

738
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:58,380
seen the Islamic tradition, the religious Islamic tradition, there's been a conflict

739
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:05,620
between two different ineritants vis-a-vis the text and the word of God.

740
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,020
That is to say the Sunni and the Shiites.

741
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:15,860
So very early on, after 50, 60 years of the existence of the Muslims, you know, religion,

742
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:18,140
they had already conflicts among themselves.

743
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:23,140
So there is no possibility of treat it as a one.

744
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:30,380
And I personally think that the Muslim cultural tradition is already, you know, giving us

745
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:37,500
lots of very positive things that we are including within our own reflection and reasoning.

746
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,580
For instance, in the word of art.

747
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:40,580
Thank you.

748
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:46,980
We will take questions after, but no, it's time for the communication of Pierre de Sinac

749
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:53,940
Leung, who is professor in international relations in university in Swiss.

750
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:54,940
Pierre.

751
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:58,300
Thank you, Emil.

752
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:08,780
In order to follow the spirit of Alex and the instruction of Edward Nastasun, I will

753
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:18,300
be as short as possible in order to stimulate debate among ourselves, which so far has been

754
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:21,220
a little bit lacking.

755
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:27,580
The nation has been defined by vanadee and the sun.

756
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,080
Thank you.

757
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:38,380
As an imagined community, the members of this community do not know each other.

758
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:45,820
They are ever convinced that they share some common feelings.

759
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:53,100
They are not disputing their collective identity.

760
01:16:53,100 --> 01:17:02,980
This feeling of solidarity, the belief systems that goes with it, are therefore an effective

761
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:06,020
dimension.

762
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:16,900
It is obviously an illusion as the nation is by definition a very large group composed

763
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:29,700
of individuals who do not have a common social background and do not have common interests.

764
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:39,980
Those and sociologists like to explain this illusion by saying that it is constructed

765
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:48,260
by the states, constructed by the elites, and of course, the grain of truth in this

766
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,340
reality.

767
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:58,180
You cannot separate the nation, the construction of the modern nations without referring to

768
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:07,100
the history of the states and also to the history of wars among states.

769
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:14,940
But this notion of construction, I think, is a little bit too simple.

770
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:24,180
Obviously the masses participate in or even interiorize the nation.

771
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:32,940
It's not only something which is promoted by elites or by the government propaganda.

772
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:50,580
From 1914 to 1918, every day some 2000 soldiers in France died in the battle.

773
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:56,020
And you had an equivalent numbers on the German side.

774
01:18:56,020 --> 01:19:05,460
In Verdun, which lasted six months, a soldier was dying every second.

775
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:14,660
So you cannot explain that without referring to this nationalist illusion.

776
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:24,900
And it has been largely shared by a large, very large group of people.

777
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:34,300
And those who did not share this feeling were outside this type of history.

778
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:46,740
One has to read Swag, the devout fungesten, who shows the difficulty of being outside this

779
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,180
terrible pressure.

780
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:56,620
In other words, people accept to die for the nation morere polarically as they used to

781
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:59,020
say in France.

782
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:09,140
I am not making a distinction between nationalism and patriotism on this matter.

783
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:11,740
The idea of the nation is modern.

784
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:12,740
That's for sure.

785
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:22,900
It is associated with the invention of a new collective identity.

786
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:32,940
The nobility of the Auschian regime was obsessed by his blue blood.

787
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:35,420
By Cartier de noblés.

788
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:39,620
I don't know how you translate that.

789
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:49,420
The myth, the illusion of the nation has been to give blue blood to every citizen.

790
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:56,700
That is to say to every individual being part of the nation.

791
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:05,540
The repertoire of fantasies inherent to the nationalist discourse is fairly consistent.

792
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:15,180
It always comprise recurring emotional themes that express the pursuit of individual and

793
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:19,140
communitarian narcissistic needs.

794
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:27,860
Such as a strong affirmation of a collective identity, a quest for dignity, a sense of

795
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:31,620
superiority over other people.

796
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:42,180
People take pride in the nation to compensate for the individual and collective vulnerability.

797
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:50,460
These continuously affirm a touchy defense of their territorial and symbolic frontiers.

798
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:59,220
They envisage a nation as a spiritual creator that provides them with an identity, a purpose,

799
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:04,940
a glorious genealogy and a feeling of self-esteem.

800
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:11,580
In their nationalist myth, intellectuals and politicians develop narratives about their

801
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:20,300
nation's unique historical destiny, inspired and guided by the providence while incarnating

802
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:24,100
the highest values of civilization.

803
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:35,020
Indeed, we will never fully understand nationalism or even at no nationalist for that matter.

804
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:44,380
If we do not understand the unconscious and unconscious fantasy and desire which push

805
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:51,460
individuals and groups to invest in this imagined community.

806
01:22:51,460 --> 01:23:00,060
Historically, cities have been a fertile ground for nationalism.

807
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:07,340
It has developed, nationally has developed within large group, within crowd.

808
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:18,900
And what Freud said in 1920 about crowd and group behavior is absolutely pertinent to

809
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:22,780
understand nationalism.

810
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:30,620
And in nationalism, you have always a feeling of fraternity and the erection of a leader

811
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:41,180
who has to lead and to replace the ego ideal of every individual who is part of this community.

812
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:50,180
Historically, nationalism has been closely associated with socio-economic and political

813
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:53,580
insecurity.

814
01:23:53,580 --> 01:24:01,500
Helplessness at the individual and collective level has been a fertile ground for nationalist

815
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,620
ideology.

816
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:12,060
Nationalist ideology has flourished in time of socio-economic crisis, in time of rapid

817
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:20,140
structural transformation as a way to overcome feeling of collective insecurity.

818
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:26,940
This was particularly true in Europe over the later part of the 19th century.

819
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:33,820
This was a period characterized by rapid indus urbanization, critical change in production

820
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:42,420
pattern and socio-economic recession which affected people from all walks of life.

821
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:50,620
Not only the working class and small scale artisans, but also the elites.

822
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:56,940
Following World One, the crisis of political institutions, the breakdown of social cultural

823
01:24:56,940 --> 01:25:05,140
tradition and the collapse of European economy favored the development of fanatical ideology

824
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:13,060
which drew the support from social categories that had been most affected by unemployment,

825
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:24,980
marginalization and the loss of social statute.

826
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:38,300
It is worth noting in this context that nation states are not the only type of imagined community.

827
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:45,540
The same holds true for clients, for tribe, for religious groups.

828
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:54,020
And any other form of close communitarian links such as sects which defend their own

829
01:25:54,020 --> 01:26:01,620
particular social cultural identity in the pursuit of their interest and desire.

830
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:07,500
Ethnicity is a collective identity based on culture and history.

831
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:12,180
It is one possible pattern of group allergens.

832
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:19,380
It got me seen as a form of attachment closely related to feeling of kinship.

833
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:26,420
And as a matter of fact, you had two different expression of nationalism in the 19th century

834
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:31,300
for different historical reasons which I don't want to explain.

835
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:40,580
You had a notion, a more political notion of the nation like the French tried to defend

836
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:48,940
it or a more cultural one which was a more Germanic expression which is of course linked

837
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:55,980
to a different environment and political historical setting.

838
01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:03,500
As an air of enlightenment, a fraud counted on education which he associated with the

839
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,900
progress of reason.

840
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:14,460
Unfortunately, progress in education has not guaranteed this evolution.

841
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:23,300
Its advancement in liberal democracies has not ample recurrent outpouring of demagrarian

842
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:28,380
populism and even mass paranoia.

843
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:33,860
Communication networks and media tend even to exacerbate this trend.

844
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:41,900
Election are often influenced by weird individuals who overtly stimulate shocking and aggressive

845
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:48,820
behavior which pandemize a moral and political foundation of democracy.

846
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:56,420
Education can also become a source of frustration especially in developing countries when states

847
01:27:56,420 --> 01:28:05,620
do not succeed in providing adequate chaos opportunity and this failure favors the advance

848
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:12,900
of alienated and downgraded intellectuals and as a matter of fact, the leaders and militants

849
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:22,260
of political and religious movements belong often to these categories of individuals.

850
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:35,100
Today, social, economic and political condition breeds insecurity for large number of people.

851
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:45,660
All the more so that it is associated with dramatic social cultural changes.

852
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:57,540
This explains the resurgence of ethnoanationalism in Europe as well as in the southern hemisphere.

853
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:06,580
The dramatic social polarization in the United States might also explain partly the orientation

854
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:14,980
of the Republican Party, polarization which goes with the erosion of the middle class

855
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:23,260
and the extreme social economic disparity.

856
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:34,020
In other words, we will have to live with fanatical movements of different kind if we fail to

857
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:43,020
build new institutions, new states and not only the states but also new intergovernmental

858
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:51,900
institutions capable of ensuring a better social welfare.

859
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:55,900
Thank you very much.

860
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,900
Thank you.

861
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:08,460
Thank you, Pierre, for this very informal contribution and briefly two remarks.

862
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:23,420
You said that in nationalistic terms, national law is a formal figure but in civilization

863
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:29,340
terms, the symbolic law is coming from the father.

864
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:38,500
How you explain this contradiction between the formal figure and the father symbolic

865
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,180
law.

866
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:49,020
And the second thing, you say that in every nationalism, there is a leader, a leader who

867
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:54,860
controlled the people.

868
01:30:54,860 --> 01:31:02,100
You are informed of science politic and also of sequinaries.

869
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:07,300
But in Moses, he was the leader.

870
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:20,060
But Freud explains that his false origin in racial terms is a gauge to avoid the nationalism.

871
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:21,060
Do you?

872
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,060
I don't follow that.

873
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:47,000
In my opinion, the leader is a good leader, who is a firstíg

874
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,760
in the government.

875
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:54,480
Apparently, Hitler was Austrian born.

876
01:31:54,480 --> 01:32:03,560
And this was not quite a good guarantee of not being accepted in Germany.

877
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,920
So I don't think that...

878
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:11,280
I have difficulty in the following...

879
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:15,320
It's the same people, Austria and German.

880
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:19,320
in terms of different history.

881
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:26,320
Hitler came from a social background

882
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,320
from a historical environment,

883
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:37,320
which was very, very, very different from the German elites.

884
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:43,320
And this has also been something very shocking for the German

885
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:47,320
establishment at the time,

886
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:53,320
who had difficulty in adapting immediately to this new environment.

887
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:58,320
But in relation to the

888
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:05,320
to the nation

889
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:12,320
as a community

890
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:16,320
associated with the

891
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,320
with a woman, with the mother, with

892
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:24,320
the Jandarck in France.

893
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:29,320
It's not only, it's not only the case

894
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:32,320
because in time of war,

895
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:36,320
the leader is invested as

896
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,320
really the one who

897
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:43,320
who represent the nation.

898
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:49,320
And all these war criminals that you have on the place of

899
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:53,320
French city, French, and also in all these people,

900
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:59,320
were considered as a father of the French nation.

901
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:04,320
And they were associated with the

902
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,320
figure of the incarnation of the nation.

903
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:11,320
And so it's very divided.

904
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:15,320
You have fantasy about the nation, which is something

905
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:20,320
in which you could

906
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,320
completely rely on.

907
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:25,320
You could espouse this

908
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:30,320
this marginal representation of the nation.

909
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:33,320
So something in a way

910
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:38,320
that's going to be in the

911
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:39,320
way that you could be in the way that you can't

912
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:44,320
be able to do anything that you can do.

913
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:47,320
But when the nation takes arms, it's

914
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:50,320
it's neither leader.

915
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:54,320
And the leader is generally a man.

916
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:57,320
Okay, time for questions.

917
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:02,320
Maybe we stop about

918
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:02,320
five minutes for people to go to the bathroom.

919
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,320
Right.

920
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,320
I don't think in any media

921
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:10,320
a really accept.

922
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:14,320
It's true.

923
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:28,320
Thank you.

924
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,320
This is the

925
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:45,320
I think it's very interesting to see that I'm looking very interested in this book.

926
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,320
Okay, next one.

927
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:53,320
So, it's a gift for you, thank you very much, but the pleasure of having met you, really.

928
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:56,320
Yes, it's the same for me and I'm very pleased that I designed it.

929
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:01,320
Look forward to look at it.

930
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:02,320
Sure.

931
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,320
I don't think you can say.

932
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,320
Excellent.

933
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:21,320
Okay, thank you.

934
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:42,320
Thank you.

935
01:36:42,320 --> 01:37:05,320
Thank you.

936
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:20,320
Thank you.

937
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:41,320
Thank you.

938
01:37:41,320 --> 01:38:02,320
Thank you.

939

Thank you.

940

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

943

Thank you.

944
01:39:47,320 --> 01:40:08,320
Thank you.

945
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:29,320
Thank you.

946
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:50,320
Thank you.

947
01:40:50,320 --> 01:41:11,320
Thank you.

948
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:32,320
Thank you.

949
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:53,320
Thank you.

950
01:41:53,320 --> 01:42:14,320
Thank you.

951
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:35,320
Thank you.

952
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:56,320
Thank you.

953
01:42:56,320 --> 01:43:17,320
Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

999
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:54,320
Thank you.

1000
01:59:54,320 --> 02:00:16,320
Thank you.

1001
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:38,320
Thank you.

1002
02:00:38,320 --> 02:01:00,320
You have the end of the link between affect and reason.

1003
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:22,320
Well, I would like to suggest a general distinction.

1004
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:44,320
I think that he was predominantly concerned with individual psychology.

1005
02:01:44,320 --> 02:02:06,320
I think we should be aware of the difference when we approach political and social events.

1006
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:17,320
I know we understand the idea of state through individual psychology alone.

1007
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:26,320
I think you gave a very important historical review of the problem.

1008
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:39,320
This leads me to a second consideration. I didn't hear this morning anyone talk about terrorism.

1009
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:49,320
Not just nationalism. It's a different phenomenon.

1010
02:02:49,320 --> 02:03:11,320
It's a different phenomenon.

1011
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:20,320
This we saw in the murder of the prince and the princess of Austria.

1012
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:33,320
Today, a few terrorists with a few packets of bombs can terrorize a whole nation like France and America and state.

1013
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:44,320
We have nuclear weapons to fight big wars but were impotent when confronted by a few terrorists.

1014
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:50,320
I would also like to stress the historical phenomenon of terrorism.

1015
02:03:50,320 --> 02:04:02,320
It started in the early 19th century with the Russians murdering Tsar Alexander, who was a very enlightened reformer.

1016
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:10,320
It continues until today. How can we deal with terrorists?

1017
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:18,320
The other fact is that the Nazi state was not only ideological, it was a state built on terror.

1018
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:27,320
On a group of gangsters who took hold of a nation and the same thing was repeated in Germany.

1019
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:35,320
Hitler and Himmler and Heidelisch, they were all gangsters and international criminals.

1020
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:40,320
What the Euroberg trial established is crimes against humanity.

1021
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:43,320
We see this again today.

1022
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:52,320
My last remark is about father and son hostility and murder.

1023
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:57,320
The first murder in the Bible is not between father and son.

1024
02:04:57,320 --> 02:05:04,320
That's where Freud made his basic mistake because he went with Greek mythology and not with the biblical fact.

1025
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:08,320
In the Bible, the first murder is between brothers.

1026
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:14,320
Like you said, Emil, the afterlava Iachach, the mocha, and you changed it to Achicha.

1027
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:20,320
So it's the fratricidal hatred that creates wars and dissent.

1028
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:32,320
The terrorists today who choose their own father image and love and affection and bonding are actually fratricidal in their attack on the rest of mankind.

1029
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:35,320
Let's keep these things in mind.

1030
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:37,320
Thank you.

1031
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:45,320
My name is Marco Iachia.

1032
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:50,320
I am the Director of the Association for the South Nationalities.

1033
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:58,320
I'd like to attract your attention to a detail in the problem of identification, national identification.

1034
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:14,320
When we read newspapers today or we listen to a program, we see very difficult attempts to identify the purple trade

1035
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:21,320
as of the attacks in Paris or in the United States.

1036
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:36,320
Basically, to identify who they are, for example, when the riots about Belgian terrorists doing this or this or Paris or American terrorists,

1037
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:53,320
like all the mass killings in the United States, the difficulties come from the fact that in different parts of the world, there is a different approach to identification.

1038
02:06:53,320 --> 02:07:07,320
If you look at Europe, there were basically two approaches, the blood approach and the birth approach.

1039
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:13,320
Germany went by the blood approach, which lasted until the second World War.

1040
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:25,320
And even after the Second World War, Germany was willing to repatriate, for example, vulgar Germans who were Germans still in the time of country degrade,

1041
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:30,320
but considered as a blood germist, it can be repatriated.

1042
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:42,320
Later Germany changed slightly because of this Nazi situation by replacing blood by culture.

1043
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:47,320
That way, let's say, people of Jewish origin could qualify.

1044
02:07:47,320 --> 02:08:00,320
A purple blood approach is also spread up in every east of Germany, whether Poland or Russia, et cetera.

1045
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:13,320
Let's say somebody who is a tartar in Kazan.

1046
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:19,320
Kazan is Russian since the time of Ivan the Terrible, which still considered himself as a tartar, not a Russian.

1047
02:08:19,320 --> 02:08:24,320
Tartar by nationality, a Russian by citizenship.

1048
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:34,320
France had another way. France was land born in France, men's Frenchmen.

1049
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:38,320
But this was since the time after the revolution.

1050
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:46,320
But the France kind of got out of it, out of this business, by making obstacles.

1051
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:50,320
If you're born in France today, you're not automatically Frenchmen.

1052
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:57,320
There is a lot of conditions that you have to, which I will not list here, to take so much time.

1053
02:08:57,320 --> 02:09:05,320
United States took the French way of born in the United States and stick to this.

1054
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:08,320
Anybody born in the United States is an American.

1055
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:12,320
The white French moved away from it.

1056
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:27,320
Now, if I want to give you an example of a thorough attempt to identify a person, I can give something which I experienced myself.

1057
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:41,320
I was in Poland after the war. Coming from the Soviet Union, I was one of the Poles in the Soviet Union.

1058
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:54,320
I was at the University of Lodz, and we were given a kind of piece of paper to fill up our belonging, to whom we belong.

1059
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:59,320
We had a very fork-wester attempt to identify the national origin.

1060
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:07,320
It was citizenship, nationality, religion, and native language.

1061
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:21,320
I think if somebody cannot be pinned down by one of those, what I wanted to underline is the difficulty, really, to pin down what nationality is.

1062
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:30,320
I'm not speaking of sub-national groups and super-national groups, but to complicate this even more. Thank you.

1063
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:42,320
I think Charles and then Morrhenius, I think it's better if you go to death because the sound is better.

1064
02:10:42,320 --> 02:11:11,320
I wish to save few words after the presentation of Emil Mallet, about the difference between patriotism and nationalism.

1065
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:22,320
Maybe I will speak a mixed French and English when I can't do that.

1066
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:39,320
I think I misjudges that patriotism is when we love our ancestors and we thank them for their life.

1067
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:49,320
They gave us, and we are ready to continue Peppet-U.

1068
02:11:49,320 --> 02:12:02,320
We know it's not so easy because through it discovers the edipus complex.

1069
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:16,320
So it shows that the father we lost, we went to murder him.

1070
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:25,320
We are not satisfied with the life he gave us.

1071
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:42,320
And we know it's clinic that many people are depressed, melancholic, unhappy,

1072
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:55,320
and are not ready to thank the father we have to love.

1073
02:12:55,320 --> 02:13:16,320
Nationalism occurs when the people is bound, is or are bound.

1074
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:29,320
When people are bound by not so loved for the father, but the hatred for an enemy.

1075
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:46,320
And in this way we are ready to die to preserve the father.

1076
02:13:46,320 --> 02:14:06,320
So it seems that there is always a fight, a conflict between the love, but we aren't sure of this love.

1077
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:17,320
And the fact to be bound by the hatred against the enemy.

1078
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:33,320
May I say that I think that in Israel know they are more patriot than nationalists

1079
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:53,320
because what a Jew says is that his blade had before with the life which was given to him.

1080
02:14:53,320 --> 02:15:08,320
And to die in these circumstances is a pity.

1081
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:24,320
When we say we have to love our brother like ourselves, I would say that the brother has to be,

1082
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:45,320
and he says that he was a mishy, I think he says that he has to watch out because do we love ourselves.

1083
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:55,320
And that seems to be a question, maybe another point.

1084
02:15:55,320 --> 02:16:14,320
The only way to be near of father, close to him is to die.

1085
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:27,320
So this notion, this instinct has maybe something to do with that point.

1086
02:16:27,320 --> 02:16:29,320
Emil, what do you think?

1087
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:37,320
I have to tell you something.

1088
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:40,320
What is your name?

1089
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:56,320
Mark Humber, he said that it's not enough to consider that Moiz as a stranger is enough to be against nationalism.

1090
02:16:56,320 --> 02:17:04,320
I think that what we said is not in contradiction with what you said.

1091
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:20,320
I think that if Moiz is a stranger, it could be a guy for Hebrew people, only Hebrew people, and it's not enough.

1092
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:23,320
I agree with you, it's not enough.

1093
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:32,320
And always what is saying, Sha'ul Malmo, I think there is a big difference between love and territory.

1094
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:38,320
And it was a difference with the patriotism and nationalism.

1095
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:53,320
If you take the Bible, you have God who is transferring the law to Moiz as, and Moiz as transferring the law to the people.

1096
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:56,320
There is three transferred.

1097
02:17:56,320 --> 02:18:01,320
And the people became the people because he received the law.

1098
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:04,320
Before the law, he was not the people.

1099
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:08,320
This is the miracle of the law.

1100
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:20,320
But after, it's not Moiz as who is going to the country, it's his brother, A'arol.

1101
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:21,320
Why?

1102
02:18:21,320 --> 02:18:24,320
Because there is a castration here.

1103
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:36,320
God's consider that Moiz as the prophet is not able to continue to the territory.

1104
02:18:36,320 --> 02:18:45,320
If you see what is written in the Decalogue, the Ten Commandments, there is nothing about territory.

1105
02:18:45,320 --> 02:18:56,320
It's only the relation between a man with God and the relation between men together.

1106
02:18:56,320 --> 02:18:59,320
Nothing about the territory.

1107
02:18:59,320 --> 02:19:10,320
As it's not Moiz as who is following and entering in the country, it's his brother, A'arol, who is beginning.

1108
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:14,320
This is not contradiction with the Talmud.

1109
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:17,320
You take my monit.

1110
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:22,320
My monit is saying something very important.

1111
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:26,320
You have to take education from your father.

1112
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:37,320
But if your father is not able to give you the education, you have to keep love for your father, and you have to find another master.

1113
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:52,320
As Moiz was a master of the law, but outside the territory, I think there is difference between patriotism and nationalism.

1114
02:19:52,320 --> 02:20:01,320
As the law, we have only two things. I agree with you. Two things. We have the law and laws.

1115
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:08,320
We don't find this. I think perhaps Pierre-Cières-Rachlan is not.

1116
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:10,320
He doesn't agree with me.

1117
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:23,320
But I think the two things, the law and law, the law of the La Pilsi and the V, they are outside the nationalities, outside the nationalities.

1118
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:34,320
And they guide us to accept the law, to accept the territory, because we could not live without a territory.

1119
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:41,320
And I think it's a big injustice. I told you exactly what I think.

1120
02:20:41,320 --> 02:20:54,320
That we consider that the creation of Israel is for left people, is considered as a bad thing.

1121
02:20:54,320 --> 02:21:00,320
Personally, I consider it as one of the best things in the 20th century.

1122
02:21:00,320 --> 02:21:08,320
I told you what I think. We have to consider it as a banal ideological thing.

1123
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:13,320
Of course, it's not.

1124
02:21:13,320 --> 02:21:20,320
There is a gap between law and ideology in the creation of Israel.

1125
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:27,320
But it's the same thing that we find in all ideological things. It's the same thing.

1126
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:39,320
As I consider today that we have the law, we have the La Pilsi and the V, we have these two things.

1127
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:50,320
And it's what we have today to express, if you want, the nationalities for our mind.

1128
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:53,320
It's what I think. Thank you.

1129
02:21:53,320 --> 02:22:00,320
But for Marilla, maybe Pierre wants to respond to something. No? Yes?

1130
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:02,320
No?

1131
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:04,320
Marilla, you are.

1132
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:15,320
I think we have to be careful that this distinction between patriotism and nationalism is usually very ideological.

1133
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:20,320
We think patriotism is a good thing. Nationalism is bad.

1134
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:33,320
Historically, and from a doctrinal point of view, it's not that patriotism is about the love of the ancestor.

1135
02:22:33,320 --> 02:22:39,320
I mean, you see the love of the ancestor in every nationalist position.

1136
02:22:39,320 --> 02:22:48,320
I mean, there is always ancestor that we have to love as the heir of a nation.

1137
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:56,320
And I can, patriotism is often associated with the difference of a very small community.

1138
02:22:56,320 --> 02:23:05,320
And we forget that in both of this ideology, we have in-group, out-group.

1139
02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:13,320
You have the feeling that those who are in-group are good, except that in this out-group,

1140
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:21,320
there are always some subversive elements, the Jews, the Protestant in France, and so on and so on.

1141
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:31,320
You have always somebody who is destroying the community, being a patriotic or a nationalist community.

1142
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:41,320
I have another example. In Switzerland, we have Niech in the valleys.

1143
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:47,320
We had two communities, two villages, Chherminin and other places.

1144
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:51,320
I forgot the name. It's very close to Crump.

1145
02:23:51,320 --> 02:24:01,320
And these two small villages have been fighting each other about a story of Faufach.

1146
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:07,320
How do you call Faufach? About a band?

1147
02:24:07,320 --> 02:24:15,320
And it has totally structured their relationship for 100 years until 1945, and even later,

1148
02:24:15,320 --> 02:24:22,320
you could not be from this band and marry another person from the other bands,

1149
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:31,320
because they were from outside. And it was, I don't know, two or three kilometers separating these two villages.

1150
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:41,320
They were both patriots, you see. So I don't accept this distinction, because I think it's totally fake and totally ideological.

1151
02:24:41,320 --> 02:24:45,320
It was reality.

1152
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:48,320
Of course, it was symbolic reality.

1153
02:24:48,320 --> 02:24:58,320
But I mean, coming back to the issue of symbols, if I have the floor, I think it's interesting what you say about the issue of

1154
02:24:58,320 --> 02:25:02,320
a mandatory symbolic object.

1155
02:25:02,320 --> 02:25:12,320
I'm not a psychoanalyst, but I know that psychoanalysts have today a lot of patients who are so-called borderline.

1156
02:25:12,320 --> 02:25:20,320
And they have difficulty in symbolizing, in accepting the ambivalence of reality,

1157
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:31,320
and in accepting that what is real cannot be symbolic. So they are geared toward action.

1158
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:43,320
And what happened in Iraq, in Syria, when they destroyed this wonderful heritage of ancient civilization,

1159
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:52,320
they were destroying symbols of something which they could simply not understand, which was a source of humiliation,

1160
02:25:52,320 --> 02:26:07,320
and they could not understand that it was a symbol that something which was not real in the sense of their figurative understanding of the reality.

1161
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:17,320
And I think this has also taken into account when we speak about ideology in general and nationalism in particular.

1162
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:30,320
And of course, this brings us back to Tautem and Tabu, Tautem and Tabu, where the Tautem is such an important aspect of reality.

1163
02:26:30,320 --> 02:26:37,320
If you love me only very yet. I will not say a prayer.

1164
02:26:37,320 --> 02:26:42,320
Really, not really yet.

1165
02:26:42,320 --> 02:26:56,320
First of all, I wish to thank very much both the Alex Center, the New York Institute and Adna Sarsian for the organization of this weekend.

1166
02:26:56,320 --> 02:27:05,320
Thank you very much. Three free marks about what happened this morning, which was very interesting, I think.

1167
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:09,320
One is about Freud's collection.

1168
02:27:09,320 --> 02:27:19,320
I think that the love that Freud had for his collection is very over determined and very highly conflictual,

1169
02:27:19,320 --> 02:27:26,320
because he started his collection as a death of his father.

1170
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:33,320
And I think it has a strong link with something with his relation to his father,

1171
02:27:33,320 --> 02:27:44,320
and to a conflict between his Jewish identity, where representation are forbidden,

1172
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:52,320
and his Greek culture, where representation is absolutely classical.

1173
02:27:52,320 --> 02:27:56,320
I think that's very strong.

1174
02:27:56,320 --> 02:28:01,320
It's interesting to see it on that angle.

1175
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:11,320
The other thing, I wanted just to say that I felt very close and very interested by Paul as Miele's presentation.

1176
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:18,320
I just wanted to thank her. We have no time to discuss today, but it's a pity.

1177
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:22,320
And the third thing is to Pierre de Saint-Arclers.

1178
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:28,320
I wanted to tell you that you stressed something very important.

1179
02:28:28,320 --> 02:28:40,320
I think the feeling of insecurity and insecurity means not to feel protected by the laws of the audience.

1180
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:51,320
The laws of the country and the lack of the law protecting you in security with the exacerbation of nationalism.

1181
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:54,320
Thank you.

1182
02:28:54,320 --> 02:29:05,320
I too would like to thank Paul Miele for her very powerful presentation.

1183
02:29:05,320 --> 02:29:10,320
I think that we all stand on blood.

1184
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:18,320
Last week we celebrated a cultural heritage in this country we call Thanksgiving.

1185
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:33,320
And what we remember from that is that the first winter that the fundamentalist, misogynist, perverse group called the Puritans

1186
02:29:33,320 --> 02:29:38,320
were dying because they did not put enough away food for the winter

1187
02:29:38,320 --> 02:29:42,320
and that the Indians had saved enough and saved them.

1188
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:55,320
That was the first Thanksgiving. One year after that, the Puritans celebrated a holiday to remember that they had been saved the year before.

1189
02:29:55,320 --> 02:30:06,320
But the Puritans were the only one at the holiday. All the Indians had been murdered by that second year.

1190
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:08,320
Absolutely.

1191
02:30:08,320 --> 02:30:21,320
Just as the perversion and misogyny of the Inquisition was ending in Europe, it was beginning in this country.

1192
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:25,320
No, no.

1193
02:30:25,320 --> 02:30:30,320
No, the man in most COVID is Claude.

1194
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:34,320
I'm not just speaking that it's kind of what it's like.

1195
02:30:34,320 --> 02:30:36,320
No, no, no, it's sad.

1196
02:30:36,320 --> 02:30:38,320
I think I am not allowed to speak.

1197
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:40,320
We have a court of war.

1198
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:42,320
Oh, I speak words.

1199
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:44,320
Yeah, I speak words.

1200
02:30:44,320 --> 02:30:45,320
I speak words.

1201
02:30:45,320 --> 02:30:46,320
I speak words.

1202
02:30:46,320 --> 02:30:51,320
I speak words.

1203
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:59,320
I like what Paula said about women and empowerment or the coming to age of women, but I'm going on a different place.

1204
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:07,320
I think the U.S. got into the wrong foot with Bush right from the beginning speaking about an axis of evil.

1205
02:31:07,320 --> 02:31:13,320
And using the word somewhere along the line, I can't quote it exactly, of going on a crusade.

1206
02:31:13,320 --> 02:31:24,320
He inadvertently, I think, but some not even sure that he didn't think crusade on Christian soldiers and not really realizing even where it came from.

1207
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:30,320
But I was appalled that his speech writers didn't catch that or that they put that in.

1208
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:41,320
It's set right from the beginning, the wrong attitude, I think, a motion that's entered into a problem of a war without any careful reflection of what sort of war was being started.

1209
02:31:41,320 --> 02:31:51,320
This was a small group of people relatively in Afghanistan led by somebody coming from, I think Saudi Arabia.

1210
02:31:51,320 --> 02:31:53,320
I'm a very bad historian.

1211
02:31:53,320 --> 02:32:04,320
And the people in these countries strike me as more coming really from tribal identities than with their religious aspect as part of it also.

1212
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:13,320
Rather than they're more like a feudal system, and we were talking today about the modern state, and I was reading recently about the Magna Carter.

1213
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:18,320
And the Magna Carter, of course, wasn't the document that we respect today.

1214
02:32:18,320 --> 02:32:20,320
It came into being slowly.

1215
02:32:20,320 --> 02:32:31,320
It was a few feudal lords who were content with what King John was doing, who was a very bad king in certain ways in his administration,

1216
02:32:31,320 --> 02:32:47,320
and it's to get more power from him so that gradually the Magna Carter, because of a few words in it, became the founding of something that expanded into this idea of the state should be for the people.

1217
02:32:47,320 --> 02:32:56,320
And I feel that while it was already a word, the term that we use now, terrorism, came into being with the World Trade Center event.

1218
02:32:56,320 --> 02:33:03,320
What's new about it partly, the difference is that we have the modern phenomena of a technology that's combined with terrorism,

1219
02:33:03,320 --> 02:33:11,320
and perhaps without our even acknowledging it, it goes, as somebody mentioned today, beyond simply the human.

1220
02:33:11,320 --> 02:33:20,320
The humans aren't entirely in charge of the technology in a certain sense anymore, and we very rarely actually acknowledge that and think about that.

1221
02:33:20,320 --> 02:33:32,320
So today a person can take up an idea, and he can use it to bring down a huge building in New York City and kill 2,000 people.

1222
02:33:32,320 --> 02:33:35,320
Terrorists never could do that before.

1223
02:33:35,320 --> 02:33:49,320
So I think I've already mentioned that I think the modern state came into being very slowly, and that we haven't really understood what Paola was also talking about,

1224
02:33:49,320 --> 02:34:03,320
which is the thing that's already happened, which is that modern states and technology and ideas have somehow already happened to the people from these tribal societies,

1225
02:34:03,320 --> 02:34:15,320
but they don't really have a way or the educational ideological background to think about what's happened to them in a way that would allow them to even have a discourse with us.

1226
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:22,320
But we don't have it, we Europeans and Americans don't really reflect on how we don't have a discourse with them.

1227
02:34:22,320 --> 02:34:23,320
Thank you.

1228
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:41,320
This is a treasure island, and I'm so pleased that our French guests are here.

1229
02:34:41,320 --> 02:34:49,320
I just wish we had more New Yorkers coming and people from America to visit you, but really they are watching you on the Internet.

1230
02:34:49,320 --> 02:34:52,320
I'm promising, I'm hoping that they're watching.

1231
02:34:52,320 --> 02:35:04,320
There will be a reverberation, there should be a reverberations from the pebbles that you have thrown, the symbols, the words that you have thrown together.

1232
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:13,320
You'll have a good after effect, and I want to use one symbol that was so beautiful, it brought me here.

1233
02:35:13,320 --> 02:35:24,320
On the Internet I watched, and the symbol of the pigeon, the humble pigeon, the pigeon that is made up of different languages,

1234
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:35,320
how that pigeon must never put itself higher up on the hierarchy to be the superior, the king, the czar,

1235
02:35:35,320 --> 02:35:42,320
but remember the pigeon can fly, and my hope for you as well.

1236
02:35:42,320 --> 02:35:44,320
Thank you Claude Londman.

1237
02:35:44,320 --> 02:35:46,320
Claude, how did you?

1238
02:35:46,320 --> 02:35:53,320
Jean-Jacques was COVID to a bad Claude.

1239
02:35:59,320 --> 02:36:11,320
Yes, we are in New York, and the town where the United States of the organization is founded just after the war.

1240
02:36:11,320 --> 02:36:22,320
And I think it's possible for the Committee of Foreign to study the rights, the universal declaration of human rights.

1241
02:36:22,320 --> 02:36:33,320
And when you read this text by articles, 30, 30 articles, it's very interesting for me, perhaps for you,

1242
02:36:33,320 --> 02:36:41,320
we read possible subjectivity, each line of this text.

1243
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:59,320
And it's very interesting because the first article says, we are ego, ego, not two, all cities and all men are ego in the right and in dignity,

1244
02:36:59,320 --> 02:37:08,320
and the world of dignity is very difficult for the thinking of right because it's a literary term,

1245
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:18,320
and in 30 articles you see that, the singularity of men.

1246
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:29,320
The citizen is a collective man, and the singularity, and I think it's possible we will work the right and the psychoanalytic.

1247
02:37:29,320 --> 02:37:40,320
It's possible, I began in this work 10 years ago, but it's necessary to definition exactly for an analytic,

1248
02:37:40,320 --> 02:37:44,320
but it is the singularity. It's the subject, it's the ego, it's the antimatic, and the

1249
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:52,320
antim. What is it? And this article you see, this is exactly this problematic.

1250
02:37:52,320 --> 02:38:02,320
And in the first article you speak with a specialist, a friend of the organization of the United Nations,

1251
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:16,320
the nation, yes, is the name of the time here. It's possible you had some analytic idea, but it's very difficult.

1252
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:25,320
The singularity is necessary in this world. My singularity and the singularity of other,

1253
02:38:25,320 --> 02:38:43,320
my right to a report, my singularity, and I have a regular, yes, to recognize the singularity of other.

1254
02:38:43,320 --> 02:38:51,320
And the nation, plural nation, nation's organization, the patreonity of democracy,

1255
02:38:51,320 --> 02:38:52,320
just patreonity is very interesting to use with this term democratic, and what are you thinking about that in

1256
02:38:52,320 --> 02:39:13,320
the coming time. Thank you. If you agree, if you agree, we have no Claude Londban, a reaction of the panel, and we conclude together because it's

1257
02:39:13,320 --> 02:39:20,320
not a good thing. Yes, Claude, I was thinking about it.

1258
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:32,320
First of all, I want to thank the participants of the Round Table this morning, which was really very interesting,

1259
02:39:32,320 --> 02:39:56,320
of a high quality. There is an answer, I could say, an obvious answer to the problem of closed nationalism.

1260
02:39:56,320 --> 02:40:16,320
This answer is a political answer. It's trivial. I think we will agree to this answer.

1261
02:40:16,320 --> 02:40:29,320
The answer to the closed nationalism depends on the success of the failure of the European Union.

1262
02:40:29,320 --> 02:40:49,320
I can say that here in the United States, because I think the United States is a union.

1263
02:40:49,320 --> 02:41:08,320
It depends on what Jürgen Abermuss said. Is it possible to reach what he calls a post-nation, which doesn't mean the

1264
02:41:08,320 --> 02:41:24,320
dispersion of the nation? Is there a possibility of a post-nation? When I say the success of the European Union, I don't mean the

1265
02:41:24,320 --> 02:41:44,320
economic success. I mean the political success. What I want to say is as individuals, we belong to different sets.

1266
02:41:44,320 --> 02:42:00,320
In the terms of the theory of sets, which is a mathematical theory, one individual can belong to one set and to another set,

1267
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:19,320
and then also to another set, different sets. But what links all these sets together, and this is in reference to counter-theory,

1268
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:38,320
that there is one empty set. This empty set, we can refer it to the fact that the language in the language,

1269
02:42:38,320 --> 02:42:56,320
there is a signifier which is always missing. This empty set can make comfortable any individual people to belong to different sets.

1270
02:42:56,320 --> 02:43:16,320
I am proud to be French. I'm glad when France, the French soccer team wins the game, but I belong also to other sets.

1271
02:43:16,320 --> 02:43:38,320
For example, I belong from the beginning to the L'accanyan International Association. It's one set, and we try in our association to deal with the empty set.

1272
02:43:38,320 --> 02:43:58,320
There is nobody, no one who can say it is the one who can substitute to the empty set.

1273
02:43:58,320 --> 02:44:13,320
The empty set, it's what we call in the former discussion, is we can call it also the other with capital O.

1274
02:44:13,320 --> 02:44:28,320
Some things that will be never closed. So, there can be many different sets linked together, and one can belong to one or another set.

1275
02:44:28,320 --> 02:44:48,320
And different elements can belong to one set. I mean, we can be different and belong to the same set.

1276
02:44:48,320 --> 02:45:10,320
So, I wanted to say it is strange that a political question, which is I think the answer to the closed nationalism, is also a mathematical answer, and also a psycho-analytical answer.

1277
02:45:10,320 --> 02:45:12,320
Thank you.

1278
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:26,320
In the spirit of the American superficiality and simplicity, I would like to make a comment.

1279
02:45:26,320 --> 02:45:41,320
When I think about this, I am reminded that central to Freud's idea and central to psycho-analytic ideas is the notion of anxiety.

1280
02:45:41,320 --> 02:46:00,320
The notion of hyper-annemissioning and anxiety, which to me is one of his important papers, really talks about the sources and the causes of this anxiety, and in which way various defenses are mobilized in order which lead them to symptoms.

1281
02:46:00,320 --> 02:46:23,320
Now, anxiety is a response to danger, and danger is what motivates or leads to these feelings that we describe under other names, vulnerability, insecurity and so on, which are really manifestations of a response to danger.

1282
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:48,320
There is another form of anxiety, if you will. And underneath all these situations that we have discussed today is the fact that we are talking about people who either are really vulnerable or insecure or are made to feel that there is a danger there.

1283
02:46:48,320 --> 02:47:06,320
We comment a lady there made about what President Bush had said about the evil, whatever, and the axis and evil and so on, reinforces the view amongst certain people that there is a real danger and we need to protect ourselves.

1284
02:47:06,320 --> 02:47:18,320
When there is danger there is aggression, because if you are threatened with something you need to be prepared to defend yourself.

1285
02:47:18,320 --> 02:47:23,320
So if the danger is outside of you, the defense is aggression.

1286
02:47:23,320 --> 02:47:35,320
And I think what we are seeing is convincing people that there is a big danger and that we have to respond to it and the response inevitably has to be through aggression.

1287
02:47:35,320 --> 02:47:51,320
No question that some leaders have in the past as they are doing today take advantage of this mechanism to create groups to then create more terror and more sense of danger and therefore more aggression.

1288
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:54,320
Thank you.

1289
02:47:54,320 --> 02:48:03,320
Thank you as to conclude the panel and I finish. Do you have a panel?

1290
02:48:03,320 --> 02:48:10,320
I'm going to speak in a little bit.

1291
02:48:10,320 --> 02:48:22,320
First of all, I appreciate it very much your presentation also because you brought in the question of how to deal with the issue of nationalism.

1292
02:48:22,320 --> 02:48:27,320
And you were speaking about the introduction of new institutions.

1293
02:48:27,320 --> 02:48:30,320
I think that that's an important point that you underlined.

1294
02:48:30,320 --> 02:48:43,320
And I agree with you that very often in political reality the notion of nationalism, empatriotism overlaps and we have all sorts of examples of it.

1295
02:48:43,320 --> 02:49:02,320
Yet I still think that it's worth it to try to think a difference and appreciate very much what Charles and Marna introduced right now.

1296
02:49:02,320 --> 02:49:19,320
In relation to the ancestors, that is a relation bound on love rather as opposed to a relation of defense against what is other.

1297
02:49:19,320 --> 02:49:42,320
I think that there is something very crucial because one of the characteristics of the constitution of a nation, historically modern nation, is precisely the invention of the part of the people to create a certain historical background for themselves,

1298
02:49:42,320 --> 02:49:55,320
be it through actual facts or through legends. But that implies the integration of the same of their fathers.

1299
02:49:55,320 --> 02:50:03,320
Let's put it this way. In other words, a respect for Wanzan ancestry and a love for them.

1300
02:50:03,320 --> 02:50:19,320
That is to say, in a dadjo that we know so much stressed by Freud, you know, relating to Gote, what you inherited from your fathers, reconquered to make it yours.

1301
02:50:19,320 --> 02:50:33,320
This is a very difficult process because we know each of us as an allysant know how difficult this process is.

1302
02:50:33,320 --> 02:50:37,320
But it's a process that implies an act of love.

1303
02:50:37,320 --> 02:50:49,320
And I feel that this is something very specific about the vision. So the question of nationalism is there.

1304
02:50:49,320 --> 02:51:01,320
It seems to me that precisely what it brings about is the opposition to Wanzan difference because in patriotism,

1305
02:51:01,320 --> 02:51:12,320
you integrate within your history also the difference part, that are part of your own background.

1306
02:51:12,320 --> 02:51:18,320
Instead, the characteristic of nationalism is the exclusion of the difference.

1307
02:51:18,320 --> 02:51:25,320
So I think that here we have a very major point of difference. And I just want to say one final remark.

1308
02:51:25,320 --> 02:51:44,320
If I made that there is one piece that I think needs to be underlined about fundamentalism, that is the attack that exercised by fundamentalism against the symbolic universe of the other.

1309
02:51:44,320 --> 02:51:58,320
Because what we are talking about in terms of, for instance, of the elimination of certain historical artifacts or books, the writing,

1310
02:51:58,320 --> 02:52:08,320
it's an attack that is directed against the symbolic universe of the other.

1311
02:52:08,320 --> 02:52:19,320
That is to say, is ancestry and so on and so forth. And I think that we are not allowed to be able to do that.

1312
02:52:19,320 --> 02:52:22,320
Merci beaucoup. Leing on world.

1313
02:52:22,320 --> 02:52:39,320
In talking about nationalism, we've raised all these interesting intellectual issues and different issues regarding the symbolism.

1314
02:52:39,320 --> 02:52:54,320
And also, I wanted to end with stressing the more general underlying practical thread that runs through terrorism.

1315
02:52:54,320 --> 02:53:04,320
And Ed mentioned one similarity we find with these events is that people are acting out of fear and terrorism.

1316
02:53:04,320 --> 02:53:13,320
And something Pierre said too, the threat of poverty and lack of education. And what can we do?

1317
02:53:13,320 --> 02:53:21,320
The possibility of social programs in government. And that's all.

1318
02:53:21,320 --> 02:53:23,320
Thank you, Lin-Biel.

1319
02:53:23,320 --> 02:53:34,320
No, I'm very embarrassed to say anything new to what has been said. But I have a problem with illusions.

1320
02:53:34,320 --> 02:53:43,320
Because if we follow fraud, illusion are caused by helplessness and it deals with religious illusion.

1321
02:53:43,320 --> 02:53:55,320
But what he says about religious illusion could be said about ideological illusion, be they a nationalist or author.

1322
02:53:55,320 --> 02:54:12,320
So, for fraud, I think that the development of education, rationality and science might also attenuate the impact of the

1323
02:54:12,320 --> 02:54:17,320
illusion. Okay, we can follow him on this issue.

1324
02:54:17,320 --> 02:54:35,320
But illusion in a way are also necessary because we cannot have a link of solidarity among ourselves or inside a state without some form of illusion.

1325
02:54:35,320 --> 02:54:45,320
How to reconcile these two aspects of illusion. And illusions which are really dangerous.

1326
02:54:45,320 --> 02:54:49,320
And illusions which are necessary for continuing to live together.

1327
02:54:49,320 --> 02:54:55,320
Thank you. I have to conclude very, too brief, politic messages.

1328
02:54:55,320 --> 02:55:10,320
I want to provide that alex, sequentiality, association of America and from France to have briefly two politic messages and after an address to UN.

1329
02:55:10,320 --> 02:55:17,320
First, fraud was a Western thinker and universal.

1330
02:55:17,320 --> 02:55:26,320
I don't forget that I am coming from France but born as a Jew in an Arab country.

1331
02:55:26,320 --> 02:55:38,320
I think we need to have between America, France and Arab countries a dialogue.

1332
02:55:38,320 --> 02:55:44,320
We need to have a dialogue with Islam and not fundamentalism.

1333
02:55:44,320 --> 02:55:54,320
Remo Aron briefly said there is a difference between Nazism and communism.

1334
02:55:54,320 --> 02:55:58,320
Nazism was the murderous ideology.

1335
02:55:58,320 --> 02:56:06,320
Communism, the interpretation of this ideology was murderous.

1336
02:56:06,320 --> 02:56:18,320
We have this mourning, very interesting distinction between nationalism and patriotism. We need to have a distinction between Islam and Islamism.

1337
02:56:18,320 --> 02:56:28,320
And we have to work together to dialogue with Islam for the peace, notably in Middle East because we need this peace.

1338
02:56:28,320 --> 02:56:33,320
And I think we have to work together. This is the first political message.

1339
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:49,320
The second political message and I want that you were American with French while we want fraud inside UNESCO, not only like flour.

1340
02:56:49,320 --> 02:56:57,320
I know that America have reserved and critics vis-a-vis the UNESCO.

1341
02:56:57,320 --> 02:57:05,320
And personally, I think like you, UNESCO is more tear-moan-dist than universal.

1342
02:57:05,320 --> 02:57:14,320
But I think if we are able to put fraud inside UNESCO, UNESCO could be more cosmopolitan.

1343
02:57:14,320 --> 02:57:23,320
As it is a politic act to do it and I think together we could have this politic act.

1344
02:57:23,320 --> 02:57:33,320
And I want to conclude, I want to tell you Ed and the Edic Center, we have to tell you thanks for your generous hospitality.

1345
02:57:33,320 --> 02:57:44,320
You are generous hosts. I think that without you, the semina could not have heard here.

1346
02:57:44,320 --> 02:57:54,320
There is a Freudian address to the intellectual community of New York, but also with YouTube to all the world.

1347
02:57:54,320 --> 02:58:03,320
I know that New York is a big city. The birth of the world resonates here.

1348
02:58:03,320 --> 02:58:09,320
We know this. It's a place that is more profoundly cosmopolitan.

1349
02:58:09,320 --> 02:58:20,320
There is no other city, even Paris is not in the same capacity to be cosmopolitan and to resonate with what happened in the world.

1350
02:58:20,320 --> 02:58:27,320
We are seeking that together we could return to Freud.

1351
02:58:27,320 --> 02:58:37,320
And I think if we do this, we could help Europe to be against nationalism.

1352
02:58:37,320 --> 02:58:46,320
It's a prevention. Our work today here is a prevention that national is engrawing in New York.

1353
02:58:46,320 --> 02:58:54,320
Now you know the thinkers of the Middle of Europe and Freud was one of them.

1354
02:58:54,320 --> 02:59:06,320
And Freud, he prevented at this time he said you have to hurt and to be against the possessors of the world.

1355
02:59:06,320 --> 02:59:15,320
The possessors of delirium. We found them in every time. Today is Islamism and fundamentalism.

1356
02:59:15,320 --> 02:59:25,320
And he said this monstrous people impacted the history of humanity and often caused disasters.

1357
02:59:25,320 --> 02:59:37,320
We have also today in this time. And I think the co-analyst could be also politic for preventing all this thing.

1358
02:59:37,320 --> 02:59:44,320
This is the objective of the Freud Committee that was created in Paris.

1359
02:59:44,320 --> 02:59:51,320
I know as I finish with this thing, there is a Bible saying next year in Jerusalem,

1360
02:59:51,320 --> 03:00:01,320
we hope to meet you all of them next year in Paris for a new chapter. Thank you very much.

1361
03:00:01,320 --> 03:00:10,320
Thank you Emile. There is an English saying that it takes more than one to tango.

1362
03:00:10,320 --> 03:00:20,320
And this would not have been possible if the you and Marilia and Charles have not been influential in bringing this about.

1363
03:00:20,320 --> 03:00:26,320
And I want to thank all the French participants who have come all the way from Paris to participate in this meeting

1364
03:00:26,320 --> 03:00:33,320
and have made it meaningful by their presence. And I also of course want to thank our American participants,

1365
03:00:33,320 --> 03:00:41,320
Lin Ganwell, Professor Paul Fry and Henry Lothan whom I know for half a century. Thank you very much.

1366
03:00:41,320 --> 03:00:51,320
Thank you.

1367
03:01:11,320 --> 03:01:38,320
Thank you.

1368
03:01:41,320 --> 03:01:46,320
Thank you.
