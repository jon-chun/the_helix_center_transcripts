1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Hi, good afternoon everybody.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,200
Welcome to the Helix Center.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
My name is Jerry Herwitz.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,280
I'm one of the organizers here at the Helix.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,360
And I want to make a full-to brief introduction to our moderator today.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,240
And Marie Louvine is herself an artist, painter and poet.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,240
And she will moderate this panel discussion and introduce you to our distinguished panelists.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,240
Okay, thank you.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,240
My mic is off.

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,240
Oh, can you just...

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Yeah.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
My issues.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,240
I think we also...

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,240
Whoops.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,240
Good too much.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:02,240
I think we're also supposed to remind you that there's a conference on December 1st.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
The...

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Right?

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
I don't have the information...

20
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
The SciArt conference.

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,240
The SciArt conference, which you can see on the website.

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,240
It's fully explained.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,240
So today we're going to attempt to tell you about American poetry today.

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,240
It's only a beginning.

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:31,240
So to introduce the program, the American poet Ezra Pound proclaimed that poetry is news

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,440
that stays news.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,360
On a different note, his contemporary William Carlos Williams said that it is difficult

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,680
to get the news from poems, yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there.

29
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,160
Do modernist maxim such as these also define the ever-expanding range and diversity of

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,920
poetry today.

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,160
Which poets or groups are doing interesting or important work?

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,680
Who are the earlier poets that inspired them?

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,960
And what is the nature, role, appeal, and significance of contemporary poetry?

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,240
When it comes to grasping experiences and communicating their meaning, what does this art form provide?

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,320
What kind of subjects to poetry journals and other publications focus on?

36
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,960
How has the production and promotion and reception of poetry changed in the internet age?

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,920
It's very much about the internet age and the 21st century.

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,680
In response to questions such as these, around table of diverse and accomplished poets, we'll

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,760
discuss what's going on in the poetry world today.

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,200
They will explore the allure and value of contemporary poetry through different lenses

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,600
ranging from the formal to the linguistic to the conceptual to the psychological.

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,400
And in the second part of the program, we'll have our usual Q&A.

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,360
I'm going to introduce the participants in alphabetical order and ask you each to raise

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,280
your hands as I say your name so people will know who you are.

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,840
Patricia Carlin received her PhD from Princeton focusing on Shakespeare studies and poetry

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,200

Letters and Commentary.

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,240
And is this right, McSweeney's internet tendency, right?

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,840
And she co-edits the Poetry Journal Barrow Street.

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,760

She teaches literature and poetry writing at the New School where she has received the

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,000
University Distinguished Teaching Award.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,960
Can everybody hear me?

59
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Is this?

60
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
No.

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Slow.

62
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
OK.

63
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Amy Holman.

64
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:05,280
Amy Holman is a Pushcart Prize nominated poet and a literary consultant.

65
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,640
Her collection, Rin's Fly Through This Opened Window, was described by one reviewer as part

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,080
freak show, part searing insight.

67
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,640
She's also the author of four poetry chapbooks, including the prize-winning Wait for Me, I'm

68
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,040
Gone from Dream Horse Press.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,880
Archaeology Magazine, American Letters and Commentary, Barrow Street, Fail Better, I'll

71
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Stop.

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:46,280
But I'll end with the first anthology of TV poems and the best American poetry in 1999.

73
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,920
She teaches poetry workshops at the Hudson Valley Writers Center.

74
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,760
Paolo Javier.

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,640
This collaboration with Listening Center, David Mason, appeared as a limited edition

76
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
book cassette.

77
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,200
Oh, his name I cannot pronounce.

78
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,680
You have to help me.

79
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Earlier.

80
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
OK.

81
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:17,280
Published by Text and Town in early 2017, a featured artist in MoMA PS1's 2015 Greater New York

82
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Show.

83
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,400
He is the author of four full-length collections of poetry, including Court of the Dragon,

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,000
which Publishers Weekly calls a linguistic time machine.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,520
A new chapbook, Maybe the Sweet Honey Poor is forthcoming from Nion Editions.

86
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:43,360
And last but not least, Stephen Massamilla is a poet, scholar, professor and painter.

87
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,720
He holds an MFA in writing and PhD in English and comparative literature with a focus on

88
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,040
poetry from Columbia University.

89
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:59,000
His new multi-genre volume, Cooking with the Muse, won the Eric Hopper Book Award, the

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,800
National Indie Excellence Award and others.

91
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,760
His previous books include the award-winning poetry collections, The Plague, Doctor in

92
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:15,480
His Holeshape, TAT, Forty Floors from Yesterday, and later on Aia, as well as translations

93
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,800
of book length works by Neruda and a critical study of myth in modern poetry.

94
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,680
Massamilla has published recently in hundreds of journals and anthologies.

95
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,600
Again, the list is too long.

96
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,560
Agni-American literary review, Barrow Street, Colorado review, Denver, quarterly poet,

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,640
lower poet daily.

98
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,400
He teaches literature and writing at Columbia University and the new school.

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,760
Okay, that's it.

100
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,320
I guess I have to get my microphone back.

101
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:53,320
And yeah.

102
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:11,960
If it works, can you hear me?

103
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,760
I'm not going to talk much.

104
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,080
Yes, is this all right?

105
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,400
Okay.

106
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:27,520
So I'm going to ask Steven to say a few words to begin the program.

107
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,160
Very good.

108
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,600
I would like to thank Anne Marie for that gracious introduction and thank all the panelists for

109
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,200
being here today and thank everyone in the audience for joining us to share an afternoon

110
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,600
talking about poetry.

111
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,640
I've been tasked with the impossible mission of conveying to you the various strands of

112
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,400
modern contemporary poetry and to do so in just a few minutes when it would normally take

113
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
me about 400 hours.

114
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,720
So I better get started.

115
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,160
I thought I'd start by just pointing to something unusual.

116
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,040
This is counterintuitive, but this project that Anne Marie mentioned, cooking with the

117
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,440
muse, is a cookbook that's also a poetry book that contains hundreds of recipes and

118
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,000
hundreds of poems and some recipes that could be poems and that's the most avant-garde aspect

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
of it.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,280
But I just thought I would point out some poems in the book to show you that they look different.

121
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,840
These are all contemporary and some of them modern poems, but here's one called spice

122
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
reflection.

123
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,120
It's a sonnet, a love poem set in a restaurant.

124
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
I wrote this one myself.

125
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,800
Oh, by the way, this one's paired with a recipe for duck cohen feet, spice with coriander

126
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,880
and star anise, which is wonderful to make this time of year if you're not committed

127
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,120
to having turkey for Thanksgiving.

128
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,720
There are turkey recipes here too.

129
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,480
The poem it's like to write about swans.

130
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,520
The only problem with swan for Thanksgiving is that everybody fights over the neck.

131
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,680
Here's a recipe.

132
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,760
Here's another poem by Claude McKay, Harlem Renaissance Poet.

133
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,840
You see it's also a sonnet.

134
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,880
So without explaining what a sonnet is, you can see they look very much alike.

135
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,360
Here's another one by the contemporary poet, Vietnamese American poet, Manglan.

136
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,040
It's called love poem to spinach.

137
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:21,960
As you see, all the lines are scattered across the page and it looks very different.

138
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,000
And others might look more like, I mean, there are more sonnets by people from all

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
different.

140
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,560
A supermarketing California by Alan Ginsburg and the first line of the poem is what thoughts

141
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,000
I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, and it's written in long with manian lines.

142
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,680
So if these are all, and I write lines like that too, I don't just write sonnets.

143
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,960
So the point I wanted to make is there's not one form that writers are writing in today.

144
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,520
Some people may think that there's a 19th century way of writing that's all formalist

145
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,600
and then there's a modern way of writing that's all open.

146
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,880
But the terrain is much more complicated than that.

147
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,560
So I thought I'd just mention briefly that there is even a group of new formalist poets,

148
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,040
Dana Joya, Marilyn Hacker.

149
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,040
You could think of many Alfred Corn, right.

150
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,000
I mean, a lot of us can think of an example to a right almost exclusively in form.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,920
They write sonnets, they write villainels, and longer forms.

152
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,400
This is not so different from what, at the beginning of the 20th century and the mid

153
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,680
to late 20th century, many other poets were doing.

154
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
Robert Frost wrote this way.

155
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,240
McKay, the founding Harlem Renaissance poet, wrote this way, Auden.

156
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,840
So I'm just going to let you know that group exists.

157
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,760
But that's not what I'm going to focus on.

158
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,040
Because modernism is often seen as a break with the past.

159
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,520
Both a formal break, though I don't think it applies as much to that particular team.

160
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:50,880
But also a break in thematic, a break in subject matter, and a break in approach to theme,

161
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
both modality and theme.

162
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:00,000
So what we see in a lot of contemporary poems is radical subjectivity or radical objectivity

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,800
or fragmentation or an emphasis on alienation, displacement.

164
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,880
These are themes that define our era in poetry.

165
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,920
And in contrary distinction to that formalist school, I passed out a sheet that you can all look at.

166
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:24,760
And I have a poem by the founding American father of modern American poetry, William Carlos Williams.

167
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,040
When it emphasizes middle name is Carlos, he's a Puerto Rican American poet,

168
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,280
also partly a Basque background, a first-generation immigrant.

169
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,720
That's important to know that, to understanding his work, it's important to know that.

170
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,480
On the right I have a poem by Archie Ammons.

171
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,160
This is a contemporary poem.

172
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:47,440
And you can see right away that the contemporary poem owes something or a lot to the William Carlos Williams poem

173
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,840
of much earlier close to a century ago.

174
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,880
So this is the group.

175
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,720
I would put not only William Carlos Williams in this group, but also Gertrude Stein.

176
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,080
And I'm going to define this group as the local American modernist group,

177
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,640
as opposed to the formalist traditional group.

178
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,360
And I thought, just start us off, why don't I just start us off by having us look at these poems

179
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,760
so that we can get a feeling of understanding.

180
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,160
So a lot of you know this poem, the Red Wheelbarrow.

181
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,400
How many people have seen this before?

182
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,960
How many people have heard of it?

183
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,040
Okay, a lot of us have.

184
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,160
How many people are still baffled by it?

185
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,360
Don't necessarily understand it, right?

186
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,200
Let me read it to you.

187
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,760
The Red Wheelbarrow, and this is from a much larger work that is multi-genre

188
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,040
and contains a lot of prose and criticism as well, all mixed together.

189
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:49,520
So much depends upon a Red Wheelbarrow, glazed with rain, water,

190
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,160
beside the white chickens, end of poem.

191
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,720
And some people are perplexed by it nevertheless because it's not an exclamation.

192
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,600
So much depends upon ex exclamation point.

193
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,880
It's not a complex sentence that has a dependent clause in it.

194
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,040
So much depends upon ex that y.

195
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,440
It just says so much depends.

196
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,040
And that people find a little bit agrammatical or unusual or asymmetrical.

197
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,160
But Williams wants that effect.

198
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,600
You can't, he's not writing a grammatical sentence.

199
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,600
And he wants to do other things like separate the word wheel from the word barrow

200
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,800
so that every word gets equal democratic attention.

201
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,000
Similarly, if you look at the contemporary poem by Ammons on the right,

202
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,640
the spring in her step has turned to fall.

203
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,120
We just are watching a woman take a step.

204
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,960
And we are also watching the season turn from spring to fall.

205
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,440
And we land on fall.

206
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,160
That's where the foot comes down.

207
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,440
The poem is the action.

208
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,520
The poem steers us in the direction that it is going in.

209
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,840
And we could talk about it all day.

210
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,960
You have no idea how much is going on here.

211
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,040
But the point I want to state is that it's not in traditional form.

212
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,240
It's everyday data.

213
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,720
It's not a regular.

214
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
It's not a lusive or aerudite.

215
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,480
It's attuned to the immediate.

216
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,040
And the politics of the poet are liberal.

217
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,280
I could say that these are things that apply.

218
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,000
These are characteristics that often apply to members of this team.

219
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,640
And if we look back over the past century, who are some poets and some schools of poetry

220
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,880
that were inspired by the local American modernists,

221
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,640
I would say that includes the beat poets, such as Alan Ginsburg.

222
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,800
And Williams even included some of Ginsburg's letters in his epic Patterson.

223
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,760
It would include the New York School, Kenneth Koch, John Ashbury, who was a big,

224
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,880
just died recently a big influence on everyone on this panel, I believe.

225
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,040
Or at least on their friends, Frank O'Hara.

226
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,680
And for example, Kenneth Koch's one of his most favorite famous poems is entitled

227
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,240
Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams.

228
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,280
You can see the influence just by looking at the title.

229
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,600
And then there's Ted Berrigan and Ansem Berrigan, if you want a contemporary poet that's still

230
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,880
very much influenced by the New York School.

231
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Ergene Young.

232
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,000
There's also an objectivist group, Olson and Creeley, or the Black Mountain poets, they're

233
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,880
sometimes called, or the language poets.

234
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,400
And maybe we'll look in an example of language poetry in a few moments.

235
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,440
But that would include Charles Bernstein and Lynn Hagenian.

236
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,360
All of these poets claim that they love Williams.

237
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,560
They're not particularly fond, for instance, of T.S. Eliot, the next poet I want to talk

238
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,720
about.

239
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,960
But that Manglan poem I showed you with all the words scattered across the page, very

240
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
much influenced by Williams.

241
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,560
And so it doesn't really matter.

242
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,600
You can pick so many contemporary poets, Ellen Bass, Jane Hirschville, Manglan, they've

243
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,640
all been influenced by the local American modernists, William Carlos Williams and Gertrude Stein.

244
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,800
And their grandfather is Whitman.

245
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,000
So for a graphic for this talk, we're originally going to start with an image of Whitman as

246
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,120
the grandfather of American poetry.

247
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,320
But what he really is, is the grandfather of this strand of American poetry, which has

248
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,720
ramified this trunk that has ramified out and created many branches.

249
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,800
But Whitman wanted to break the back of the pentameter, and embrace people from all backgrounds

250
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,160
and all walks of life, and celebrate the flesh as much as the spirit.

251
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,760
But then there's another group, and maybe I'll mention just one or two more groups,

252
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,520
because I don't want to go on too long in this introduction.

253
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,880
And that would be the classical modernist group.

254
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,920
So how many people have heard of T.S. Eliot?

255
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,560
Okay, how many people can recite a T.S. Eliot poem by Hart?

256
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,600
That's a hard one.

257
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,120
It's hard to do.

258
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,680
It's harder to do than, but easier than to do with a Bernstein poem, for instance.

259
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,120
But if we were to look underneath what I have here at the Red Wheelbar, as a sample, Mr.

260
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,960
Eliot's Sunday morning service.

261
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:06,240
Without even reading the poem, you'll see the first word is polyphyloprogenitive.

262
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,640
No word is too difficult for Eliot.

263
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,800
In other words, it wants to make poetry difficult, and it's deliberate.

264
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,560
My students sometimes look for that word in Greek and Latin dictionaries, and they don't

265
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,680
find it, because it's not there.

266
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,640
Eliot made the word up.

267
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,720
It means something like loving to produce much offspring.

268
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,280
It has to do with the fertilization of eggs.

269
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,440
It has to do with chickens in this sense, and I think we could compare it to the chicken

270
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,960
poem by William Carlos Williams.

271
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,720
And without reading the entire poem, the sapient settlers of the Lord, those would be the learned

272
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,760
it sells people of religion.

273
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,560
In the beginning was the word, in the beginning was the word, superfitation of tohen.

274
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,640
That's a word in Greek that suddenly appears in the middle of his poem, and what he's talking

275
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,280
about is how the learned it sells people of religion, theologians like Origen mentioned

276
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,800
in the last line there who castrated himself to bring himself closer to God.

277
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,680
Their enterprise is completely futile, because their work, the proliferation of interpretations

278
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,840
they offer us, do not bring everyday people closer to the divine.

279
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,560
And in that sense, Eliot's frustrated that the erudition and subtlety of these great

280
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:27,760
thinkers is futile, and perhaps Eliot's own poem might be futile if he's trying to reach

281
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,400
a deeper truth.

282
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,640
And he was.

283
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,160
With Ezra Pound, he formed a group of classical modernists who did not like conservatism.

284
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,800
They did not necessarily want to preserve 19th century traditions.

285
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:47,520
They wanted to reach back to something more titanic than rationalism, or then market economies,

286
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,040
or then perfunctory practices of Christian rituals.

287
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:00,880
They wanted to reach back to a renaissance of the Renaissance, the rebirth of the great

288
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,160
rebirth of classical antiquity, and everything it signified for them.

289
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:14,200
So they set the bar at high in terms of their erudition, and what they were seeking spiritually.

290
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:22,440
And in their Eurocentric attitude that they were seeking to embody what is best in the

291
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,440
mind of Europe, they believed that Europe had a mind.

292
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,160
And Williams rejected all of this.

293
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,480
He felt the poetry is not sacred.

294
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,880
Poetry does not have a philosophical mission like this.

295
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,800
It's not a regular.

296
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,160
All those things I said about Williams, Williams hated Elliot.

297
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,320
Elliot did not think much of Williams.

298
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,040
Williams loved Stein, pounded Elliot work together.

299
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,640
And you would think that Elliot wouldn't have many incarnations today, but I gave an example

300
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,640
on the right of the contemporary poem Shiloh Church.

301
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,920
And you can see right in the second line we get, plan Vistas milky with Jehovah's Calm,

302
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,800
so an invocation of the biblical Lord.

303
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,080
And it ends with the line in deserts, drop the odd white turds of bone, which is not a

304
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,280
good omen.

305
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,560
And basically this poet is suggesting that even those who were sacrificing themselves

306
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,520
for the noble cause of ending slavery committed great slaughter and therefore believed that

307
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,320
they were unredeemable.

308
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,680
And so there's a great, or might not be redeemed or that they were sinful.

309
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,760
And there's the same sense of futility and historicism and high language in this poem

310
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,440
that we find in the Elliot poem.

311
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,520
But these are not the only heirs of Elliot.

312
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,600
And so what I want to suggest is that Elliot and Williams, if you put them together, if

313
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,280
you take Elliot's classicism or at least his architecture and you combine it with Williams'

314
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,920
local belief in local modernism, you get other groups of poets like the American Sublime,

315
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:54,080
the Heart Crane, Wallace Stevens group, or the Confessional Poets, the Lowell and Plath

316
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,640
and Sexton and Varyman, and I thought maybe I'd give you a couple of examples, one example

317
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,320
of a Confessional poem and then I would pretty much end the talk there.

318
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,240
But we have this one by Sylvia Plath, Lady Lazarus.

319
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,840
Actually put it next to this line from Elliot in Prufrock, I am Lazarus.

320
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,320
Come back from the dead.

321
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,640
Come back to tell you all.

322
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,280
I shall tell you all.

323
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,400
There's another side to Elliot to balance their tradition.

324
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,560
He often includes his own anguish or expressions of his own anguish in his work.

325
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,840
And Confessional poets like Elliot in the Wasteland in this moment describes under that his wife

326
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,640
having a nervous breakdown.

327
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,240
My nerves are bad tonight.

328
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
Yes, bad.

329
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Stay with me.

330
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Speak to me.

331
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,200
And that passage ends with I think we are in Rat's Alley where the dead men lost their

332
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
bones.

333
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,640
So you can see the influence on the hill poem, the contemporary poem, but you can also see

334
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,480
that Elliot is talking about a problem in his marriage, about a mental breakdown, about

335
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,560
his wife's nervous breakdown.

336
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,040
And she did end up in an asylum.

337
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,800
And Elliot finished the Wasteland while making clay pots in a sanatorium.

338
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,120
And he lets you know it in the poem.

339
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:10,480
That's why his influence is so great because a lot of poets in the late 20th century and

340
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,800
21st century are interested in revealing intimate details about themselves in their

341
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
poems.

342
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,240
So this poem by Sylvia Plath for example, in it she describes a suicide attempt or

343
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,160
multiple suicide attempts.

344
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,520
The second time I meant to last it out and not come back at all, I rocked shut as a seashell.

345
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,760
They had to call and call and pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.

346
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,320
Dying is an art like everything else.

347
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,640
I do it exceptionally well.

348
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,400
I do it so it feels like hell.

349
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,440
I do it so it feels real.

350
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,080
I guess you could say I have a call.

351
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,720
And then she did take her own life.

352
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,320
So she's revealing how she feels.

353
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,040
And Sexton took up poetry when her analyst suggested that it might be cathartic for her.

354
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,040
It might be a way for her to deal with her postpartum depression.

355
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,600
I also included here we don't have time to talk about it.

356
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,720
In the lower left corner of Franz Wright poem, contemporary poet writing in the Confessional

357
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
mode.

358
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,920
And on the next page poems by Tracy K. Smith and Ocean Bong, which I don't think are as

359
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:20,440
raw and intense as the Plath poem, but are still in the Confessional mode.

360
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,000
So Sharon Olds, there are many contemporary poets writing in this mode.

361
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,840
And other groups that I don't really have time to talk about right now would include

362
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,880
the postcolonial poets, Derek Walcott and Company.

363
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,400
Or what do you think, for instance, of erasure poems?

364
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,040
Is that a new kind of poetry?

365
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,400
Or is that just a tool or a technique that poets use to inspire them?

366
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,960
What about slam poetry, a new econ poetry?

367
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,160
Maybe some of you have heard of that.

368
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Heavily influenced by the beat poets, but that's another possible group we could talk

369
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
about.

370
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,760
What about what's happening on the internet today?

371
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,080
Tumbler poetry.

372
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,240
Is that a good enough platform for poetry?

373
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,320
What do people think about conceptual poetry?

374
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,360
Maybe Anne Marie or others on the panel could explain what that's about some more.

375
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,400
But the point I might end with is that I didn't really have time to talk about Walcott the

376
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,120
way I wanted to, but there is also a multicultural postcolonial strand.

377
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,200
And I want to suggest that poetry today is much more diverse.

378
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:28,080
So the few strands I gave you merge and some poets are hybrid and there are a lot more

379
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,320
women poets and there used to be a lot more openly gay poets and lesbian poets.

380
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:40,600
So poets from Whitman to Ashbury were gay, but they didn't always write about that directly.

381
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,960
A lot more recent immigrant poets or poets who write about their background and so forth

382
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
and so on.

383
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,440
So maybe that's one place to look for the difference.

384
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,640
And I thought I would just open this up to the panel.

385
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:58,680
Do people on the panel agree with this schema, with this map, or where do we want to take

386
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
it from here?

387
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
So.

388
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Yes.

389
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,120
And I'm going to supplement Stephen's remarks.

390
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,920
I'm going to give you the Twitter version of where we've come from and where we are

391
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
now.

392
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,120
And I'm very glad to look at these because these are examples of a lot of what's happened.

393
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,120
American poetry today, we are very lucky to be readers of it, which brings me to the question

394
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,880
and do not be embarrassed by this.

395
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,640
How many of you actually read poetry regularly?

396
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
Most people do not.

397
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,680
Oh, that's wonderful.

398
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,720
And a much bigger proportion than usual because usually today people remember poetry from

399
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,440
college or they'll see a couple of poems in the New Yorker.

400
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,280
They're not really conversant with it.

401
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,760
But American poetry is definitely the most diverse energetic poetry in the English-speaking

402
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,040
world today.

403
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,480
How did we get here?

404
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,240
That's what I'm going to talk about briefly.

405
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,360
American poetry has always been marked by improvisation and very idiosyncratic invention,

406
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,720
especially when we finally turn finally away from European models and from overvaluing

407
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,240
all things European in the arts.

408
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,480
In this century, the 21st, our poetry is fully, finally, triumphantly American.

409
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,040
What does that mean?

410
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,520
To better understand where we are now, we can look at where we've been.

411
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,840
And here comes the Twitter version of it.

412
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,360
American poetry has a forefather, Walt Whitman.

413
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,640
And it has a foremother, Emily Dickinson.

414
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,920
And in some sense, all later developments point to one or another of these wildly different,

415
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,080
wildly idiosyncratic poets.

416
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,520
They invented kinds of poetry the world hadn't seen before, which is still going on.

417
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,240
And they also invented themselves.

418
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,080
The invention of the self is a very American undertaking.

419
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,040
And I would argue at the heart of what's happening in poetry right now.

420
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,720
A good place to start in recent times, and this is supplementing or complimenting what

421
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:09,080
Stephen said, start with the 1950s, marked by beat poetry, Ginsburg, and a competing formalism,

422
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,720
very traditional poems, meter and rhyme.

423
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,480
Think of Alan Ginsburg, whom I'm sure most of you have heard of, and Richard Wilbur, who

424
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,840
really until 96, still going strong.

425
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,800
In the late 50s and the early 60s, confessional poetry dominated as the new thing.

426
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,120
And you notice this again as the self.

427
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,320
But I would want to say that even when it purports to be your actual self, talking about

428
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,640
what's going on in your life, it isn't.

429
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,880
It's a linguistic creation of a self that speaks in the poem.

430
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,840
Think of Ansexton, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, some of the people that Stephen mentioned.

431
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,320
Oh, well, I hope that's not the first time.

432
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:00,080
Here it is, in the late 60s and in the 1970s, language poetry arrives on the scene.

433
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,200
And this is an avant-garde movement that's generated instant heated controversy.

434
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:12,000
Traditionally, which I mean hundreds of years, a lyric poem was marked specifically by the

435
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,120
creation of a single, stable speaking voice, and a poem that was led by the author to a

436
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,960
certain conclusion, in other words, closure.

437
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,440
Practitioners and theorists of language poetry insisted no.

438
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,160
Language is speaking itself in any given poem.

439
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,560
There is no stable single self or speaker.

440
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,280
And a reader has to step in to create and make meaning out of a poem.

441
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,720
No one authorial voice controls meaning in a poem.

442
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,160
I think this is the most significant thing that happened in this very brief history.

443
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,160
This poem also raises closure, bringing you to the neat end you'll be familiar with in

444
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,080
any traditional poem.

445
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,080
Instead, a poem is a process and it stays open-ended.

446
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,200
These poetry wars raged for decades and they were heated.

447
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:11,840
Uptown mainstream traditional versus downtown, experimental, innovative, resisting belief

448
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,400
in a single self and in the authorial imposition of meaning.

449
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,520
And you can think of the movements really geographically as centered Uptown, 92nd Street

450
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,840
High, downtown, St. Mark's, and the poetry project.

451
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:32,280
But what happened is that where we are now is that gradually poets writing simply took

452
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:38,880
devices from every point on the poetic spectrum, a lot of which Stephen has touched on.

453
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,760
So what were once bitterly thought and contested ideological matters simply were co-opted as

454
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,960
techniques that a poet would deploy to expand his or her expressive range, which is very

455
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,160
much what I do and almost everyone I know does.

456
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:03,040
For example, collage, fragmentation, multiple voices speaking within a poem, disjunctive

457
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,560
development, great big leaps from one thing to another, and very quick shifts of tone

458
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,680
and speech registers.

459
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,000
The distinctivity of distinctions between high culture and popular culture.

460
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,120
So you could say no more Uptown or downtown, everybody's gone to Brooklyn, which is where

461
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,760
we are now geographically.

462
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,200
I'll say a couple more things.

463
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,080
External conditions have radically impacted poetry today and one very important development

464
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,640
in my opinion is the diminished influence of the gatekeepers.

465
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,560
I don't want to put a particular, what I'd say the last 10, 20 years, to get your poems

466
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:47,200
into publication you would pass through an elaborate series of people who put their imprement

467
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,120
to her on yes, this is worthy of publication.

468
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:56,640
But recently, journals and presses have proliferated and the web provides another very far-reaching

469
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,200
and very different means of disseminating poems, which I'm happy polo is going to talk about.

470
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,360
Which though certainly not all of the most interesting work in poetry is coming out of

471
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,880
small independent presses.

472
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,240
And there's no one kind of poetry that predobinates it, Stephen's also indicated.

473
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,240
An anecdote here a few years ago, the National Book Awards, the five finalists for poetry

474
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:28,800
were all from tiny little barely known presses, which understandably annoyed the more commercial

475
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,360
and mainstream presses who after all as they pointed out were funding these awards.

476
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,360
So that mistake got corrected in the next series of national poetry awards.

477
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:46,240
At this moment, I conclude there is no center in American poetry, but at any given moment,

478
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,720
one or another of these many strands you mentioned tend to be highlighted or spotlighted.

479
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,640
So right now for example, we're hearing more from traditionally underrepresented voices.

480
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,160
Here's an example.

481
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:05,240
Besides Frank B. Dar who won the National Poetry Award this year, two of the four finalists

482
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:11,200
drew on their experiences, African-Americans, and the third drew on her experience as a Lakota

483
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,040
Indian, Native American.

484
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,240
The other big thing that I notice and you'll all notice is as you'd expect there's an outpouring

485
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,640
of poems responding politically to the dire situation, the country and in fact the world

486
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,880
is finding itself in.

487
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:31,520
I'm struck by the melding of political response with intense lyricism, which is something new

488
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,280
in political or social response poetry.

489
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,560
Ocean Vuon, you have an example there, his new book, his only book, Night Sky with Exit

490
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,480
Wounds is an example of this.

491
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:50,880
He is a Vietnamese-born refugee, but there is no center now and no one kind or kinds of

492
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,320
poems that predominate.

493
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,000
It's good that there's no center.

494
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I agree.

495
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:08,280
One way in which you evaluate any country or any time period in literature is to go to

496
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,200
see who's publishing these particular writers.

497
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:19,360
For the poets especially, the literary journal, literary review, literary magazine however

498
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:30,480
you call it, whether in print or online and if online, whether it also involves audio,

499
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:38,000
that's there may be hundreds, probably more than a thousand literary journals and they're

500
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,720
not all doing the same thing.

501
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,000
There is going to be some overlap on what people consider to be good poetry.

502
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,280
It will, in what Patricia and Stephen have talked about, they will be representing certain

503
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:02,920
kinds of poetry, styles of poetry, certain modes, whether it's formal or not.

504
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,080
But I think there's a kind of poetry for every kind of person.

505
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:13,640
Unfortunately, schools where we get poetry from the beginning don't represent the wide

506
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:20,120
variety of poems available that people are writing.

507
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:29,120
Literary journals are the means by which poets get read.

508
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:36,400
There should be wider reading of the literary journals but online there's a wider readership.

509
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,960
It takes a long time to put together a collection of poetry as a book.

510
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,200
So the magazines support writers and give them readers.

511
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:53,360
They're stepping stones in some cases, some smaller magazines read the larger magazines.

512
00:34:53,360 --> 00:35:00,160
But one thing that they do represent is all the different subjects that you could be writing

513
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
about.

514
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:13,640
Surfing, beekeeping, art, science, math, money.

515
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:21,120
No matter who you are, if you have an ability to write about something in the form of a

516
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:30,880
poem, a poem can be a form of communication, a way to almost a different kind of language

517
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,000
by which to talk about something.

518
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,200
And it is also its own form.

519
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:47,200
But so while there are many general interest literary journals, Barrow Street would be

520
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,480
one, Kenyan review, Agni, all of those that are in essence interested in whatever you

521
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:01,440
may want to send them if you write in the way that they deem is good poetry.

522
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,240
There are lots of magazines that want very specific subjects.

523
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
I don't know.

524
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,600
That's an anthology on food.

525
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:20,640
But there's a specific magazine called Alimentum, who's the publisher is a chef and a poet.

526
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,080
And they take poetry and fiction and nonfiction about food.

527
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:30,880
But the food verse contest out of literal latte is also an option.

528
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:41,520
I have a huge number of my own poems in this book so we don't even know if it's an anthology

529
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,600
or a book of recipes.

530
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,000
But this is what we can do today.

531
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,160
There doesn't necessarily have to be.

532
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,600
The rules are there are lots of ways to blur boundaries.

533
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,480
And there are lots of points I could pick up but I'll let you finish.

534
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Yes.

535
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,120
And I would just want to mention that there's a poet laureate of the Union Square Green

536
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
Market.

537
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,440
There is a perfect example.

538
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:16,120
There's never anything that you can't write about or some post you can't have in poetry.

539
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,640
And for the time there are two off the bat that I can think of literary journals focused

540
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,680
on work and being out of work.

541
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,920
There's one called Draft Horse.

542
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,360
And there's one called Work.

543
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,720
That's an online magazine.

544
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,240
And they have a very nondescript white sort of background so that if you want to read

545
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,400
it at work and look like you're just looking at it, not looking at a magazine.

546
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,080
But these are like any kind of work, blue collar, white collar, pink collar, sex work,

547
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,480
volunteer, anything they say.

548
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,400
There's Jay Journal, which is out of the John Jay School of Criminal Justice.

549
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:04,760
And they want justice, just the letter J. There's the five two crime poetry weekly.

550
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:12,560
And there's politics and ends up in most successfully and everywhere.

551
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:21,760
But new verse news, the Boston Review, which is a magazine that doesn't have to take poetry

552
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:31,600
on politics but has a focus overall in the magazine on progressive politics.

553
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:39,480
There's pop culture and is wanted by many magazines, but it's all that barrel house

554
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
wants.

555
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,080
Everything, poetry fiction, nonfiction, if it doesn't have pop culture, send it elsewhere

556
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,240
they say.

557
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:53,760
But Gargoyle, they like history and subculture and culture and pop culture.

558
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:07,760
The largest areas now are the health injury illness death as represented in these magazines

559
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,160
that come out of medical universities by and large.

560
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:18,360
There's Bellevue Literary Review, which is actually out of NYU Medical.

561
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:24,440
These are edited by doctors and nurses who may also be writers as well as some writers

562
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,880
who are not in the medical fields.

563
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,800
They want, that magazine tends to, so they ushered in this idea, but there are now, that

564
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,960
I've counted 29 that come out of medical universities.

565
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:49,720
There's the Healing Muse up in one of the SUNY colleges bioethics.

566
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,000
They like a little more of a lyric poem than a narrative poem that Bellevue likes.

567
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,120
And then there's hospital drive down in Virginia.

568
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:03,480
There's one that's not associated with a medical program, Recovery, which is an online magazine.

569
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,440
They spell it rk.v.ry.

570
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,640
That's all for definition, well, among the, write something about, from one of the four

571
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:22,840
definitions of recovery, which can include also obtaining usable resources from unusable

572
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,680
sources, but it can also be recovery that isn't successful.

573
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:34,720
You can write along a wide range of health and injury related subjects.

574
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:42,840
And then the other big area is the nature environment ecology place.

575
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,280
And if you, if you just want to write about the pleasure of nature and human interaction,

576
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,000
Snowy Eagret is one, maybe eco tone.

577
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:01,800
And if you want to write about the ecology, there's poecology, there's a precipitate journal

578
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:11,320
and avel set and about place that are interested in the more environmental, the loss of nature

579
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:16,120
rather than the pleasures of nature.

580
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:22,400
And I don't know, there's step away magazine if you want to write about neighborhoods.

581
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
There's just everything out there.

582
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,960
That's a start.

583
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,880
There's so much more I would say.

584
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,960
But you know, and it goes into books, of course.

585
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,480
There's one of my favorite more recent books is by Nick Lance.

586
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,480
It's called We Don't Know We Don't Know.

587
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:49,480
And he uses either Pliny the Elder or Donald Rumsfeld quotes.

588
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,880
So the We Don't Know We Don't Know is a Donald Rumsfeld quote.

589
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,680
And he uses elliptical, elliptical quality of those statements in poems about very serious

590
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,800
things as well as humor.

591
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,200
So even if we're just talking about poems about nature and place, I can think of a few

592
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,120
more like terrain.org is just about the environment built or natural.

593
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,760
And there are others like Appalachia people are going camping and want to read a poem when

594
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,440
they're learning how to make a tent.

595
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,560
So what Amy's suggesting is just the diversity and the range of subject matter that is sometimes

596
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,280
a revelation to people.

597
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,880
But to also speak to a point that, and I think that Paolo's going to want to pick up a little

598
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,560
bit on the point about the homogenization in education or something like, no, okay,

599
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,560
not necessarily.

600
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:48,400
Okay, but I think I first want to pick up on the point that Patricia raised about

601
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,960
the fragmentation of voices in contemporary poetry.

602
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,480
And I was going to ask, how would we make a distinction then between, because there's

603
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,800
one thing that I tried to point out is that we can draw a line from poets earlier in the

604
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,680
modern era to poets who are contemporary.

605
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:13,160
It seems that as soon as this was happening, as soon as modernism cracked the egg, so to

606
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
speak.

607
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,640
And I was suggesting, kind of giving an answer, Elliot kind of wanted to put the chicken back

608
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,640
into the egg.

609
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,800
But he ends his wasteland with a pistiche of different languages.

610
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,320
And it's somewhat radical to a modern reader.

611
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,440
He called it classicism, but it can look like craziness.

612
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,000
The end of the wasteland goes like this.

613
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,960
Shall I set my lands in order?

614
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,680
And then the next slide is, por esas cosi ne que yafina cuando, fiam ootie keli down

615
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,480
oo swallow swallow.

616
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,520
And the plants that we tan ollato averi, these fragments I have short against my ruins.

617
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,320
London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down.

618
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,720
Why then I'll fit you.

619
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,960
Hirani Mo is mad again.

620
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,520
Datta, dham yatta, di yadvam.

621
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,040
Chantish, shantish, shantish.

622
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,320
So that's Elliot's version of classicism.

623
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,160
But to us it might sound like craziness.

624
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,120
More poets today in their embrace of different voices in different languages doing something

625
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,080
different from what Elliot is doing.

626
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,240
Well, I think what Elliot is doing in that sense is formal and technical.

627
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,080
It's a tissue of voices.

628
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:30,160
But I also want to suggest that Elliot had a pretense of objectivity in that he's writing

629
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,480
about a disarray and a dissolution of Western civilization.

630
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,840
But more and more when people read Elliot, it's pretty clear he's talking about his own

631
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,920
psyche.

632
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,320
And this is far more personal poetry than Elliot would ever have acknowledged.

633
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:50,440
In fact, almost all of Elliot's notes and essays, and he's not alone among poets in doing this.

634
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:57,680
Most poets develop anesthetics or a poetics that happens to be what they're doing.

635
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,600
And he was no exception to that.

636
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,680
In his view, you couldn't be subjective.

637
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,840
You had to be objective, but almost everything he does is subjective.

638
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,080
Here is what I would say about Elliot.

639
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:14,000
The difference between Elliot and what happened in what I consider to be current happens in

640
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,360
that fault line when you move to language poetry.

641
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,360
And it's very connected.

642
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,600
I don't know how many of you remember the 70s or have read about?

643
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,480
They're intensely theoretical.

644
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,360
That's where I may add importation mostly of European ideologies.

645
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,240
Again, it's not really American.

646
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:38,000
And that's what the cracking of the self is coming from.

647
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,240
And where I would draw the fault line is really in a self-conception of the self.

648
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,800
I think that what happened is people, both culturally and ideologically, lost the sense

649
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,760
that they were one person.

650
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,840
And now that doesn't mean there aren't people writing eye poems.

651
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Of course, there are.

652
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,840
It's a lyric.

653
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,840
I did this.

654
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,840
I love this one.

655
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,840
I feel this way.

656
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,920
But it's a constructed eye.

657
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,680
And a stable self has simply dropped out of the equation.

658
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,000
And that's where I would draw the distinction.

659
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,640
That wouldn't have been something that Elliot himself writing about would have acknowledged

660
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,000
or any of the other people.

661
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,600
So I would draw it.

662
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,880
Modernism is considered to be the cracking and destruction of the past.

663
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,000
Postmodernism is considered to be a return to that, but in an ironic way.

664
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,360
And I would want to suggest that what's happening now is really something different.

665
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,320
And then it's back to that conception and reinvention of a multiple self.

666
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,760
If you look, actually, if you think about yourself for a minute, aren't you kind of

667
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,440
one person on Monday at four and another person Thursday at seven?

668
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,000
And it's that sensibility that I think has crept across all of these different schools.

669
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,840
And the one other thing I want to say is I think that we are, which is helpful, all

670
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:58,120
of us, dividing poems and poets into schools and into movements.

671
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:03,320
But when you come right down to it, every strong poet is a school of one.

672
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:10,760
And these groups that we all do, that I did it myself, they're birds eye or schematic

673
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,760
maps.

674
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,520
But like a map, you know, if you get right down on the ground, an area that looks as

675
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,720
if you could group it.

676
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,840
No, there's a rock here.

677
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,800
There's a pond here.

678
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,280
And they are, in fact, quite individual and idiosyncratic.

679
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,880
That would be my long answer to your somewhat short question.

680
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,880
Right.

681
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,600
So we went from a time where people, especially those with a Eurocentric leaning, were having

682
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,760
a crisis of faith.

683
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,800
And they're representing a kind of trauma.

684
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,760
Also associated with, you know, became a kind of trauma that a lot more people could relate

685
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,840
to once World War I hit and so forth.

686
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:52,000
And, you know, people asked if civilization was moving backwards as we just developed

687
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
greater weapons and greater ways of creating mass destruction and so forth.

688
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,200
So there's a lot of trauma that underlies the fragmentation and even the fragmentation

689
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,200
of voices.

690
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,320
But what I think Patricia is saying is people, you know, across the modern era, writers and

691
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:15,000
artists learned to also embrace the fragmentation and to see it as an expression of just ones.

692
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,240
Well, think of it the way the Buddhists will say that there is no self that once fundamental

693
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,880
humanity depends on not being attached to that ego.

694
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:29,040
There's a tortured quality to some who let go of that ego and others celebrate that.

695
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,000
And I think the ones that celebrate it more are more influenced by that local American

696
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,200
modernist group.

697
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,640
The fragmentation in Williams is very different from the fragmentation in Eliot.

698
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,160
But I thought I'd give an example.

699
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,280
I have this poem by Charles Bernstein.

700
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,640
Just a fragment.

701
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:53,280
And again, you know, the, well, this is, he sometimes categorizes a language poet and

702
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,400
they trace their influence to new school poets who loved Williams.

703
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,080
But take this harrow off my chest.

704
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,040
I don't feel it anymore.

705
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,440
It's getting stark to stark to see.

706
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:11,800
I feel I'm barking at hell's spores, the new sentence.

707
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,160
What is the eye in that poem?

708
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,120
Is that the speaker or is that coming out of a Bob Dylan song?

709
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,800
Or have I just given too much away?

710
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:26,000
But you know, there's a way in which the part of the language is appropriated as earlier

711
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
modernists.

712
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,600
Eliot Pound appropriated a lot of foreign languages and even whole lines from other

713
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,920
texts into their work.

714
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,440
But here it's much more playful.

715
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,080
I don't think he's making some grand statement about civilization.

716
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,800
And it's a medium for play.

717
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,680
I'm barking at hell's spores, hell's spores, heaven's door.

718
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,760
The words correspond and yet we're almost saying the opposite.

719
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,560
But we're not really talking about hell the way a confessional poet would.

720
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:59,160
I wanted to say I think actually this poem is about language poetry.

721
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:06,000
The new sentence is a very influential book, criticism written by Ron Siliman.

722
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Yes.

723
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Right.

724
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,880
And Charles Bernstein is based in the East Coast and the term language poetry is an arbitrary

725
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:20,160
designation for a group of poets primarily in the Bay Area, some in the East Coast, who

726
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:28,640
were reading marks very deeply and considering capital and its relation to language.

727
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:34,480
And in the new sentence, Ron Siliman, he's exploring and I'm just generalizing here because

728
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,920
he explores a lot.

729
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,840
Parataxis, you have syntax where you have word order, right, determining meaning, then

730
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:49,520
you have hypotaxis, which is the kind of sentence that James Baldwin was great at, a lot of subordinate

731
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,520
clauses.

732
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:58,760
And they have parataxis, which I think ancient Greek is in, where you don't really know

733
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,520
every word isn't in its rightful order.

734
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,000
And so that opens up meaning.

735
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And Gertrude Stein is considered to be still even a limit for language writing and a goddess

736
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:22,400
and a god for language writers because her writing truly desenters, opens up the English

737
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:30,240
sentence and maybe open as a euphemism, right, destroys it, right?

738
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:38,240
And that has everything to do with her growing up hearing and speaking four languages, being

739
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:46,960
queer, Jewish and occupied France, living in France as an American, right?

740
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:53,880
And really writing at midnight till six in the morning, right, when everyone's asleep,

741
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,880
right?

742
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,120
And so your brain is not really paying much attention to word order at that time, right?

743
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,920
But she embraced that negative capability.

744
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,560
So I think also with Charles Bernstein, who I know personally, he's also interested in

745
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,960
the tradition of Jewish comics coming out of the Catskills.

746
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:19,600
And so there's a playfulness that is very specific to his work that you will not find

747
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,720
in other language poets.

748
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,720
But I'm so glad you mentioned playfulness, no quote.

749
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,720
And so did Stephen.

750
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,920
I didn't mean, please go on.

751
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,200
Oh, okay.

752
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,080
I just wanted to add my two cents.

753
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,360
I don't have an elaborate outline prepared.

754
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,120
I just want to say in terms of how I see poetry being different today, there's a lot more

755
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,360
diversity, right?

756
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:50,480
And by diversity, I mean, you have a lot of poets of color with first books, a lot of

757
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:57,520
well, the last 35 years, I think there have been more female poets being published.

758
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:03,760
But now you have a lot of poets of color, a lot more women poets, a lot of GLBT poets,

759
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,080
a lot of trans poets were not just coming out with collections, but gaining visibility

760
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:13,120
because their books are actually being given awards.

761
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:18,120
I think the first book of trans poetry came up, came out two years ago, published by Night

762
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:24,320
Poet Books, which published my last full collection.

763
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,200
And you actually see poetry bestsellers.

764
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:34,200
Claudia Rankine, who has a background in experimental poetry, she published Citizen, which has sold

765
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,720
an astonishing number of copies, right?

766
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,640
So maybe that also speaks to the moment that we're in that's unique, where we are dealing

767
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:49,360
with social, right, in a way that we haven't before because of the mediums that are disposal

768
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,160
to engage with it, right?

769
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:58,520
So you have Rupi Karr, I don't know if you've read Rupi Karr, K-A-U-R, she's from Toronto,

770
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,720
she's South Asian Canadian.

771
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:08,400
She was publishing her poetry on Tumblr, I believe, and a mass or Instagram, and a mass

772
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:16,640
like a following of two million followers, and she's published three books of poems that

773
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:22,120
are bestsellers, number one on Amazon, everywhere, right?

774
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:27,960
And you couldn't see more diverse aesthetics in these two best-selling poets, right?

775
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:34,520
They have a very popular populist poet and Rupi Karr, and then you have Claudia Rankine,

776
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,800
whose work is challenging, right?

777
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:47,240
I also wanted to say perhaps these sensations are also made possible because of social media.

778
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:55,480
I don't think Claudia Rankine has a very palpable digital footprint, but certainly her press

779
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,800
does.

780
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,920
Most poetry publishers, let's bear in mind, like most of us poets are published by small

781
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,720
presses, it's a gift economy, right?

782
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,880
But let me correct that by saying their poets were making a lot of money these days, and

783
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,720
they have careers, right?

784
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:18,680
But social media, you get on YouTube, you get on Instagram, you know, Lin-Manuel Miranda

785
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:24,560
was in the White House dropped that Hamilton piece, and that was it, right?

786
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,360
I mean, it's more than that, he worked his butt off for that and it was a build up, but

787
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:35,920
yeah, social media can really give you a visibility and then an agency that poets 10 years ago

788
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,720
couldn't enjoy, right?

789
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,440
Now having said that, and I mentioned poets have careers now, there's a professionalization

790
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,720
of poetry, right?

791
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,600
Like you have career tracks as a poet.

792
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,960
Poets have agents now, right?

793
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,800
They do, like they have agencies, there are three big agencies now.

794
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,480
If you want a book of poets, you got to talk to their agent, right?

795
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,720
That's relatively new, right?

796
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,760
They used to be exclusive to folks' big names, you know?

797
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:15,400
But now it's not so exclusive, folks with first books that make a mark digitally, they

798
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,320
had agents, right?

799
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:23,880
And that's also, I think, a phenomenon made possible because of rise in prominence and

800
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,560
prevalence of the MFA.

801
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,520
MFA programs, right?

802
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:35,640
That's a master of fine arts, so creative writing programs, which we're not nearly so

803
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,160
numerous even a few decades ago as they are now.

804
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,960
Now every university and community college has one, right?

805
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,760
So probably you seem to be saying that it's something of a mixed bag that there might

806
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:54,320
be poets that we've heard of like Rupi Kaur, but at the same time you're saying that

807
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:01,720
that getting known might depend on the internet or depend on how a press promotes the work.

808
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:07,960
And yet to take the Rupi Kaur example then to write in a way that's suitable for an

809
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:13,560
Instagram post, you have to write really short poems that would appeal to everyone, and you

810
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,800
might actually sell over a million books between one and two million books when you put them

811
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:24,960
together in a book, but is this really the way to construct the best poems, is online

812
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,960
construct?

813
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:30,200
Because I mean, poesis, the Greek word means a made thing.

814
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,480
Is there enough of an artifact there or enough agency on the part of the poet?

815
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:40,000
Or is it a matter of pursuing what's trending or a matter of pursuing the bigger audience

816
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,920
as you move?

817
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:47,360
And does that take us out of the creative space that a lot of poets would want to operate

818
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,360
in?

819
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,440
And that's a question that you might be raising.

820
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,360
Well, I guess in terms of, I mean, there's no questioning taste, and I'm always hesitant

821
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,360
to sort of qualify a poet's work.

822
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,480
I'm always mindful of Gertrude Stein's reception.

823
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,480
Right.

824
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,480
Right.

825
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:10,560
Look, now she's undeniably one of the greats and she's still influencing poets.

826
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:16,720
But what fascinates me about Rupi Kaur is the platform that enabled her success.

827
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,720
Right.

828
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,720
Instagram.

829
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,880
Which is also the platform, Instagram, Twitter, you got to have a Twitter handle.

830
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:28,120
You don't have to, but that's how a lot of poets coming up are thinking.

831
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:34,760
Like they feel that it's incumbent on their career that they have a digital presence or

832
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,760
digital citizenship.

833
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,920
Get an Twitter account.

834
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,240
You have a nice author photo that gives you traction.

835
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,240
Right.

836
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,720
But it makes you write very short poems.

837
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,240
Not necessarily.

838
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,640
I think what's interesting then maybe for me, my question would be, well, let's talk

839
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,640
about that.

840
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,880
Like these platforms that are enabling greater visibility for poets.

841
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,600
And then we can talk about the poetry after.

842
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,760
I always am mindful of the fact that myself personally, I've been Facebook free for eight

843
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,760
years.

844
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:06,760
12 point.

845
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:16,200
This is way before the fake news scandal.

846
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:21,560
But I was always very uncomfortable about it just because it was so distracting from writing

847
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,120
poem for me.

848
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:28,320
It's so hard to do that to begin with.

849
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:32,720
And so what I think my point is that you've got Tumblr, you've got Facebook, you've got

850
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,200
Instagram, Twitter, they're owned by billionaires.

851
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,200
Right.

852
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:48,880
So there's an inescapable matrix there of poetry and capital that is new but is not

853
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,200
discussed.

854
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,680
Right.

855
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:59,040
So I think as a poet, what you make your poems on now is definitely something that I think

856
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,360
about.

857
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,960
And who am I giving it to?

858
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,040
Not to be a paranoid or anything but I think about it because I'm going to be giving money

859
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:12,400
to, I don't want to get, you know, I can fight the power on Twitter but what's his name is

860
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,400
cashing it in?

861
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,360
A person who runs Twitter.

862
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:21,000
You're probably looking at the only two Facebook free poets in the country.

863
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,520
You're gathered right here.

864
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,000
Dead.

865
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,960
It's, you know, the professional, I'm thinking about it just in what's come up two things.

866
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,800
One is the professionalization of poetry which is actually an odd and rather modern thing.

867
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,320
There didn't used to be a career track but there absolutely is now complete with resumes

868
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,920
and credits in a mess.

869
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,480
That's partly because although there are some poets on the net and that's just going

870
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,600
to increase who can actually make money at this.

871
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,480
Most poets still cannot.

872
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,440
They're dependent on a day job and the day job has increasingly been in the university

873
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,800
which has also had an effect on the poetry.

874
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,560
It's a cyclical feedback kind of thing I think.

875
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:08,160
And then the second part of that that I wouldn't want to lose is play which you brought up

876
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,840
and which Paolo brought up.

877
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:16,200
You can forget about all of this that the purpose of poetry is pleasure and the way to

878
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:22,000
read a poem is to immerse yourself and experience the poem and you mentioned negative capability

879
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,600
and it was Keats thing about poetry is ruined for many people.

880
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,600
I'm happy that I read it way before I ever got any of it in school.

881
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:36,160
It's taken into school and what is this poem saying?

882
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,280
No, that's not what poems are doing.

883
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,840
What they're doing is setting forth something in a dance with the language that creates

884
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:47,840
pleasure, play and the meaning of the experience which you will only feel if you let yourself

885
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,320
experience it.

886
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:53,840
So as though we're trying to map it here we all know and you all know too that's really

887
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,440
not the poetry escapes that and it's not where it should be.

888
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,920
It's only a useful way of doing it.

889
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,480
I don't know what's going to happen.

890
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:06,720
I still don't, when you look at the history of poetry which I tend to take a long view

891
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:15,080
of, really a very long view of, going back actually a couple thousand years, what survives?

892
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:21,520
What survives of people's poems at the most is a handful of really good poems and I think

893
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,000
that's going to be the same thing.

894
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,800
That isn't to say that I don't have a negative or positive view of what's going on now.

895
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,760
It's one way of disseminating it.

896
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,800
Claudia ranking to me is a superb poet.

897
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,400
I really love her work.

898
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:42,520
And what she did in her book particularly called Don't Let Me Be Lonely is she put all

899
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:48,040
kinds of logos and things from newspapers and all kinds to give you the felt sense.

900
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,360
What is it like?

901
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,520
What does it feel like to be an American at this moment?

902
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:56,160
I really don't know any book that does it as well.

903
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,800
That's what poetry can do.

904
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:03,440
But the other thing I'd say is that Keats referred to poets as possessing negative capability

905
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:10,520
which is the ability to take something in without he said any irritable reaching after

906
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,520
reason.

907
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,880
I would want to suggest that that's not about poets.

908
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,840
That's about the way everybody should be reading poems.

909
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,080
You should look at your own response first.

910
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:23,720
And then you can say afterward, well what in this poem gave me that response?

911
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:28,360
And the last thing I'd say is about poetry always pulling two ways.

912
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:32,840
It's language so it may look more intellectual to people than it in fact is.

913
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,880
But it's words on a page and in one way they're pulling toward meaning but in the other way

914
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:43,120
they're pulling toward sheer play, tending toward music and that's where you see Stephen's

915
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,840
great examples.

916
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:49,400
Even look at the Bernstein, look what he's doing with rhyme in there.

917
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,400
W.H.

918
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:58,560
Auden when he was judging the Yale series, Younger Poets, he said and he also edited a book called

919
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:04,000
Good Bad Poetry which was just a whole lot of things, Ogden Nash kinds of things and

920
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,720
liberal kinds of things and he said, I have much more confidence in a poet who is just

921
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,080
playing around with everything.

922
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:17,280
Reverse of it than I do in anybody who is more purportedly serious.

923
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:22,960
So that would be my take on this phenomenon and I like Paolo have no idea what's going

924
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,480
to happen now that you can sell a million copies of something.

925
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,960
I still think a handful of poems are going to survive of anybody's.

926
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:37,280
Well, it is very hard to know the trajectory of something that's very big at one time

927
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,080
might not be so significant later.

928
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:46,080
To take an example from England, we went back a hundred years, the most renowned poet would

929
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:51,360
be Robert Bridges poet laureate of England and an unknown poet who he was actually aware

930
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:56,760
of but nobody knew who he was was, Dr. Anli Hopkins.

931
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:02,000
Hopkins was published, he died in his 40s, was published after his death and if you look

932
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,840
at anthologies, there is some point where Robert Bridges disappears and Hopkins becomes

933
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:13,320
because he invented his own language, becomes the forebear of a whole, you know, talk about

934
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,640
play, you know, a dappled, dawn drawn falcon.

935
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,920
Is that a falcon drawn by the dawn or is that a falcon drawn like a picture in the dawn

936
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,120
or is the dawn drawing the falcon?

937
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:28,720
He just created compound complex words that no one had ever seen before in language combinations

938
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:33,480
and I think there are poets now doing them just to talk about play so I'm segging into

939
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:40,000
this comment on play, you know, like Bill Nott who invented his own language or Joan

940
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,280
Houlahan, I mean, most people don't know who they are because people really want narrative

941
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,280
very often.

942
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:53,440
That's something they can get right into but those poets are not all that well known necessarily

943
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,440
but they might end up being much more important in the long run and so it takes a while for

944
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,160
all these things to sort out to talk about reception.

945
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:09,880
Well, I want to also add in about play and also about the platform and back to the editors,

946
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:16,960
the more curious and flexible editors of magazines is that if you do, there are Twitter, there

947
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:24,680
are a lot of magazine editors who are on Twitter and they, and so if you're a poet, you can

948
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:33,600
find out about things and they post when poems are published but they also have Twitter-specific

949
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,200
contests and little things.

950
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,040
So you're writing these tiny things.

951
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:42,920
So maybe it's not what you're going to do all the time but it's another way in which

952
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:50,600
to play and be confined by something and then to create within a form which is part of what

953
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:55,840
poetry does and other platforms are like that.

954
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,840
Well, Iku and perfect that.

955
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:04,480
Well, yes, they do have specific Iku ones but they also have other kinds of poems and

956
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:10,880
then you can also do it with us as we know a series of tweets can create a poem.

957
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,080
You don't have to, just like it can be a rant.

958
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:25,160
So I would say that the language is first, I agree, in a poem and just what that language

959
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:31,080
is matters to a whole lot of different people in a whole lot of different ways.

960
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,080
So, yes.

961
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:42,800
Well, one would think, I mean, Natasha Saye asked Campbell McGrath who does really interesting

962
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:51,280
work with pop culture and so forth but that makes political statements.

963
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,760
What do you think of Twitter approaches over?

964
01:07:52,760 --> 01:08:01,040
He said it seems like now because we have these short-form platforms that would be perfect

965
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:06,040
for haikus and everyone would be writing great haikus but that's not really happening and

966
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,760
perhaps because it's all disposable.

967
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,760
It's a disposable context and people don't really want to stop and think about a poem

968
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,640
all day, they want to keep swiping.

969
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:18,440
And poetry really requires sustained attention.

970
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:27,080
The play is play but it takes a while to sink in and it's a very kind of artful chaos even

971
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,960
when it looks chaotic.

972
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:33,480
For example, if we look at the Gertrude Steinpung which strikes me, I put it next to the Bernstein

973
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,080
poem because it's also based on music.

974
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:40,320
People will look at it and see sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet tea, Susie

975
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,840
Asato, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet tea, Susie Asato.

976
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:47,760
First of all, it sounds good so we're already, there are things we like to say like when

977
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:52,800
Wallace Stevens says, be, be, finale of scene, you just want to keep saying that and I think

978
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,040
that's part of the appeal.

979
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:59,400
So, I realize that Susie Asato is a flamenco dancer and she's imitating, I wouldn't say

980
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:04,520
imitating because she's not a representative poet, she's embodying the sound of the flamenco

981
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,520
dance.

982
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,600
And I wish I could stand up and dance a little bit but it's like, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,

983
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,440
sweet, tea, Susie Asato.

984
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:20,960
So the language is its own music and then if you look at the syntax, there's no one

985
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:27,720
more radical today, Susie Asato is a told trayshore, a lean on the shoe, this means slip slips

986
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:32,720
hers, it's completely ungrammatical but people will even look at told trayshore and they'll

987
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:37,520
see a tray there and maybe the tea could go on a tray and that would be domestic calm

988
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:43,360
that could contrast with the passion of the flamenco dancer or maybe trayshore is T.R.

989
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:48,480
E.S., S.U.R.E. like the French word Tleisue or maybe it's treasure like something we really

990
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,480
value.

991
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:55,000
And the opportunity to just play with words and associations is great and yet she didn't

992
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:01,760
want us to as say a confessional poet like Plath or a poet like Elliot might have wanted

993
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:06,120
to say, you know, I think we are in Vat Sali where the dead men lost their bones, you say

994
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:10,520
Vat Sali could be the trenches of World War I, you're comparing the breakup in your marriage

995
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:16,280
to world, to a battle and she didn't want to do that, she wanted to get the words clean,

996
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:22,680
to wipe them free of the associations with which you come to them and you know it's

997
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:27,720
striking to see how much the language poets can resemble a poet who really just founded

998
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:32,040
the movement you know much earlier in the modernist era.

999
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:37,040
So but Stein actually was trying to be a bestseller, right?

1000
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:43,360
She wrote books that she would like be on the way out of Vat Sali, to make money and be

1001
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,360
a bestseller.

1002
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,360
She became the bestseller.

1003
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,360
But she felt bad about it.

1004
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,640
She planned it right like this, but she couldn't get published.

1005
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:57,600
But you know what she never was accepted as much in the you know in the ivory tower and

1006
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,880
you can find this you know with the poet, there are those who are accepted more in that

1007
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:07,240
kind of, it's the way the beat poets had a hard time getting accepted as establishment

1008
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:13,680
writers, they were viewed as activists who just, the way perhaps their followers of the

1009
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,880
New Yorkan poets today and slam poetry.

1010
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:20,680
And some of it is not good, I mean we have to admit because it's poetry for everybody,

1011
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:25,600
but some of it you know is based on written poems that are actually, that's why I put

1012
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:31,800
a slam poem next to a Ginsburg poem so you can see the you know really it's obviously

1013
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,360
coming out of Ginsburg.

1014
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:37,600
But people are still writing like this, I'm not going to read it to you, but it's very

1015
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,520
political as Ginsburg was and as Whitman was.

1016
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,800
Different kinds of political you don't have to be, you know like the social issues are

1017
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:56,480
a political way of you could write about violence, you could write about not being able to find

1018
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:03,240
a job, you could write about all kinds of social issues and be in a in a in some way

1019
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:10,960
or have a social conscious without it being the upper politics of you know what's happening

1020
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,760
in the presidential office.

1021
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:17,320
There are all kinds of politics and then there's a and then you can have it almost

1022
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:26,160
back rounded in a poem, you can you know they're all different ways and again lots of bissat

1023
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:33,800
and you mention New Yorkan because another way in which poets are supported in by support

1024
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:40,440
not just you know being heard, having their poems heard is by giving readings or performances

1025
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:46,600
of their work and that's another, there's a set of people who are running regular reading

1026
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:55,440
series around any, around the country in any city and in suburbia to libraries, cafes,

1027
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:07,280
bars, universities, literary centers and those people are also flexible in who they present

1028
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:14,280
and it's up to the audiences just as it's up to the readers to help determine who should

1029
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:21,840
be, who should continue really being heard and part of what everybody loved Gertrude

1030
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,120
Stein was because she was so different, they liked that they didn't, she didn't make the

1031
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:29,280
ivory tower certainly once it came after.

1032
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,560
But they were just what they wanted.

1033
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,120
They wouldn't publish this stuff, they she had no idea.

1034
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,280
No, the later people loved her.

1035
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:43,480
But even so apparently in an archive of Yale there's a thousand pages of unclamat writing.

1036
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:46,960
I think how much poets loved her now.

1037
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,360
The poets based on self.

1038
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:54,680
We forget because we you know we edit when we look back at history, we forget how radical

1039
01:13:54,680 --> 01:14:00,120
and how maligned she might have been in certain circles and that's what I'm saying but it

1040
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:04,080
is tricky because there are, you know you go to some open night night and people are

1041
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:08,680
reading off you know cocktail napkins and a lot of it is just awful and that could be

1042
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:14,000
true of a lot of slam poetry but if it's a gateway drug that brings people into the art

1043
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,960
form maybe that's all that matters sometimes.

1044
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:21,840
But there are lots of people who believe that yes in performance writing that it really

1045
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,440
ought to work on the page or be more about this so you know there is good and bad in

1046
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:34,000
every yeah and we know that the more that we are immersed in our own field there's

1047
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,440
always the good and the bad.

1048
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,720
The poets used to have it all.

1049
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:40,880
I mean there was the Iliad and then you know two millennia later there was war in peace

1050
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:46,960
and it all the popular genre became the novel and so a lot of questions that what poet struggle

1051
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:52,400
with is how to reach that audience without you know because we don't want to say what

1052
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:57,840
reaches a bigger audience is better or that what's even what's more moral is better.

1053
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:03,360
I mean that seems desirable but you know maybe that's not possible maybe there could be you

1054
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:08,800
know just because it's well meaning it doesn't always mean that it works as great art but

1055
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,080
there is that challenge to try to reach out and at the same time preserve a certain amount

1056
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:21,440
of integrity and I think I don't know maybe I'm just free associating what do you think.

1057
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:27,080
So but at the same time I think these avant-garde movements even when they're a little bit rough

1058
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:32,480
around the edges often have much more to them than people recognize at the time.

1059
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,640
So people might have looked at that Richard Simon thought it was just drag.

1060
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:43,960
I mean and now I think a lot of people reject a lot of work because they think that it's

1061
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,840
not formal enough for them or but they also reject it because they think the opposite.

1062
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,960
You know maybe it's to ivory tower.

1063
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,520
So I think everything has to be taken on its own term.

1064
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,480
I'm not sure the ivory tower in that sense really exists anymore.

1065
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:02,120
I know exactly what you're talking about but that's what I meant by the gatekeepers

1066
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:07,560
are gone and that has also to do with the way MFA programs have moved into the universities.

1067
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,960
It's a feedback loop both ways.

1068
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:13,520
But isn't that a kind of gatekeeper system because there are all these programs where

1069
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,800
people are taught to write a certain way.

1070
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:20,480
They can't start with the spoken word the way writers of the Iliad did and then move

1071
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,480
on to something else.

1072
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:25,480
They have to start writing short poems that follow certain criteria.

1073
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,000
I don't really think that's true about MFA programs.

1074
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,760
I think they get a bad rap.

1075
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,960
I think it just depends who's teaching them.

1076
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:32,960
I understand what you mean.

1077
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,240
It does put a certain constraint around what's happening.

1078
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:40,240
You know the common thought about MFA programs is they're just producing a lot of people

1079
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:46,120
who are writing perfectly crafted poems, all of them a muchness and nothing really exciting.

1080
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:51,200
But you know in any age there's only ever been a couple of people who were any good

1081
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,200
and would last.

1082
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,040
All you have to do is look at the 16th century when the sonic comes along.

1083
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,160
I unfortunately have looked at these.

1084
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:04,000
There are hundreds of these utterly forgettable sonic sequences that were extremely popular

1085
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,560
in their own day.

1086
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,520
And I think that's the equivalent of what's happening now.

1087
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:12,800
You know we don't know till 50 or 100 years who the people are going to be that people

1088
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,800
will still be reading.

1089
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,000
We can't tell that now.

1090
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,880
But I think they're there.

1091
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:25,280
And I don't see formal academic rejection the way they're used to be.

1092
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:29,360
They're certainly what where you wouldn't let certain things in and you would just let

1093
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,480
the curriculum alone if you looked at it.

1094
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,600
It's broadened in a certain way that I don't know.

1095
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:41,560
I can think of a large number of poets though that talk a lot about how much rejection they're

1096
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,680
getting and so forth.

1097
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:50,400
So it's not as if there is I mean there are certain rules you're supposed to follow.

1098
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,400
Think even about poetry books.

1099
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,440
What if you tried to write a poetry book that you didn't put any blurbs on it and there

1100
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,160
was nothing on the cover.

1101
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,360
This would affect its reception.

1102
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,360
That's the perfect.

1103
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,360
That's the professionalization.

1104
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:07,200
At the same time I think Rope Rope Kord go back to her.

1105
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,520
She published herself.

1106
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:14,840
I think she self published and then it sold so many copies on Amazon and then a big press

1107
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,640
latched onto her.

1108
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,080
And that's what's happened now.

1109
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:26,960
So I do agree with you that the MFA is really powerful right now.

1110
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:35,120
The desire to write poetry and publish a poet feeling incumbent to enroll in the MFA.

1111
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:40,040
And unfortunately most MFA programs only admit 10 people per year.

1112
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:45,280
So there is gatekeeping that's happening and who gets to teach in these programs.

1113
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:52,280
It's sort of like connect the dots and the template for poetry that in the MFA programs

1114
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:56,760
is adopted is still the traditional lyric narrative poem.

1115
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,360
Which is a long tradition.

1116
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:08,360
And so if you are writing left of center, if you are exploring performance poetry, there

1117
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:11,720
are programs that would would over accept you.

1118
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:17,040
But you have to do a little bit of research and perhaps the great equalizer or the great

1119
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:23,200
Satan depending on who you ask is the internet where you're a reader I think you're at a

1120
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:29,440
very golden age for experiencing so many different types of poems and poets more so

1121
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,440
than ever before.

1122
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:33,800
And to your point that's it.

1123
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,720
There's another way now.

1124
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,640
It's another instance of gatekeeping.

1125
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:38,640
Gate's falling down.

1126
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,640
No gatekeepers there.

1127
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:42,240
On to the net.

1128
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,560
To go to performance poetry for a minute because that's so important.

1129
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,400
I mean poetry began obviously in the oral tradition.

1130
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,600
There are no cultures ever been without poetry.

1131
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,200
And really until very recently there were still cultures like in Yugoslavia when people

1132
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,040
wanted to know about Homer.

1133
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:01,640
They sent somebody to Yugoslavia where they were still repeating epics orally.

1134
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:06,400
The tradition it's gone now but only the last like 40 years something like that.

1135
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,400
But here's the thing about performance poetry.

1136
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,640
I agree with Amy.

1137
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,320
There is no kind of poetry that doesn't yield.

1138
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,160
I think we all agree with this.

1139
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,080
Really good instances of what it is.

1140
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,400
It's not the kind of thing you're doing.

1141
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,280
It's how well are you doing it.

1142
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:26,600
So for performance poetry the question is if you want to translate it you may take the

1143
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,960
position that you don't want to translate it to the printed page.

1144
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,840
You are only about the spoken word.

1145
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:37,080
But if you want to translate it then you have to put it on the printed page so that a reader

1146
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:41,480
who is unaccompanied by you reading it will hear what it ought to sound like.

1147
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:45,960
Which I think a number of performance poets are able to do to make that transition from

1148
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,960
one to the other.

1149
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,480
It's because there's also a lot of publishers publishing.

1150
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:55,360
A lot of performance poets who want to be published in book form.

1151
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,920
So it's not just that they want to remain in the performance.

1152
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,920
No, no, I'm saying that.

1153
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,840
Yes, I'm going along with that.

1154
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:13,200
So it is hard to regain the oral tradition but this might be one way in which we're reminded

1155
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:21,120
of it and that certain groups of poets are keeping the eye on what poems sound like when

1156
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,120
they are read out loud.

1157
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:28,960
And I think that really if a poem to be worth its salt it has to sound right.

1158
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:29,960
Yes.

1159
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,720
And Amy brought up readings which is a good thing.

1160
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:36,240
Buildings have proliferated, it's another way of disseminating it and I noticed just

1161
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:40,760
from when I used to go to readings when I was a lot younger poets read terribly.

1162
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:45,080
They were almost embarrassed to be reading as if it were something that took away from

1163
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:49,480
the sacredness of the page so they would read in a certain poetry voice to understand

1164
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:52,720
anybody which was over-inflated and pretentious.

1165
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:57,280
I opened the door to the twilight.

1166
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,160
It was unbearable.

1167
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:03,160
There's been a feedback loop where poets read much better, they write differently because

1168
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,480
they're reading to audiences.

1169
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,200
You know it works when you're reading a poem.

1170
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:09,960
My poem's got a lot better when I started doing a lot of reading because I understood

1171
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,960
what worked not just on a page in reading.

1172
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,960
So I would want to add that too.

1173
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:15,960
Yes.

1174
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,240
I want to say that I actually disagree.

1175
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:20,200
I think the oral tradition has never been more popular.

1176
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:25,680
In fact, I'd say the most popular poetry has never been more popular if we are going

1177
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,240
to keep an open mind and accept hip hop and rap.

1178
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,560
Oh, that's what I say.

1179
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:37,800
And it's because of hip hop and rap that we have seen tremendous diversity in terms of

1180
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:43,320
young people who are taking a chance at expressing themselves and instinctively going to the

1181
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,320
poem.

1182
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:48,720
But it's actually not instinctively because they've grown up listening to this very old

1183
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:56,400
tradition of poetry, oral poetry, which is, and rappers are great poets of our age.

1184
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,400
I know I agree with that.

1185
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,400
They're just not straight white nails.

1186
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:05,600
I'm not sure what made you think I was disagreeing with that.

1187
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,160
I'm saying the opposite.

1188
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:10,720
That readings are one of the most important ways that the oral stuff is disseminated.

1189
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:15,120
And I also would want to say if you look at a poem, I hope people go and read lots of

1190
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,120
poems.

1191
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:20,240
If you go look at a poem, it's ego that gets in the way when you're a grown up.

1192
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,760
When you're a kid you hear something.

1193
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,400
Think about the way kids parody a poem.

1194
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:33,480
Remember, like a match and watch the schoolhouse burn to ashes, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1195
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,480
sort of thing.

1196
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:39,160
They just look at a poem and they don't feel that they're challenged to understand it.

1197
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:43,400
And if you go back as an adult and you just read a poem, the best way to pick up your

1198
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:46,560
poem, it's just read it aloud and listen to yourself.

1199
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,840
And if you do that a couple times, you will understand what that poem means.

1200
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:53,560
It will come into you because that's where it is.

1201
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:59,520
But one thing about rap is that it is performed with instrumentation or with singing voices.

1202
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,360
And I think that it also has a lot more followers than poetry.

1203
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:08,000
I mean, we're talking the, you know, the, not just, I mean, I say it's unheard of to

1204
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,960
sell a million poetry books, but to sell rap music, I've heard out for a song to go platinum.

1205
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,720
It's no big deal, really.

1206
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:21,040
So the question the poet's always asking themselves is how, especially in this day and age where

1207
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:27,880
there are some poets just like conceptual poets that are using appropriated material and there

1208
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,080
is no political meaning to what they're doing.

1209
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,440
It's not about social engagement.

1210
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:38,120
And right next to that, we've got other writers.

1211
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,960
I think Powell mentioned the diversity of poetry today.

1212
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,840
I mean, I mentioned the Harlem Renaissance.

1213
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:47,680
We can draw a line from there to the Black Arts movement of Brooks and Baraka and how

1214
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,640
activist they were in their time.

1215
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:58,080
But, you know, if you go to St. Ross, you know, I don't know, Ross Gay's poem on Eric Garner,

1216
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:01,960
even if he makes an important statement or a sensitive statement about that, who will

1217
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,120
really see that?

1218
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,080
How, except other poets.

1219
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,320
And so it's a question we have to ask.

1220
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:12,240
Is there a way to, that poets can reach out, especially this time where so many poets want

1221
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,200
to be activists?

1222
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:21,280
And I don't know if we really have a platform for doing that because poetry requires that

1223
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:26,920
one not right propaganda that every line has to be, it's own, it has to undercut itself

1224
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,000
on so many levels when I hear politicians use lines out of poetry, they almost invariably

1225
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,720
use them incorrectly or demonstrate they don't understand the work.

1226
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:39,200
But I think right now it's a very challenging time for the poets who want to be socially

1227
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:44,920
engaged and want to convey their responsibility to make a difference.

1228
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:45,920
Go ahead, yes.

1229
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,120
I actually don't think so.

1230
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:54,080
I think poets have always been the first to respond with language in response situations.

1231
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:59,320
It's just in our culture in the United States, we don't really care as much about poets

1232
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:04,120
giving voice to what we're experiencing compared to Mexico, compared to South America, where

1233
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:08,880
poets actually have a voice in terms of expressing what's going on in current events.

1234
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:15,120
I would argue that a lot of publishers right now, when they're publishing poets, they want

1235
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,200
to look for poets who are engaged.

1236
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,200
Not I do.

1237
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:22,600
Yeah, but let's go back to 9-11, which is not that long ago.

1238
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,240
How did people grieve?

1239
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:29,400
Most people who don't really write poetry, their first instinct was to write poem.

1240
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:33,880
I went to Union Square, so many poems, Angel Island, right?

1241
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:39,560
The immigrants are denied immigration, the Chinese are non-European Americans.

1242
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,360
I mean, they wrote poems instinctively.

1243
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:50,520
I just think that it now seems to be there's greater agency for you to be a poet who is

1244
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:53,800
socially engaged.

1245
01:26:53,800 --> 01:27:02,040
Combination of social media, combination of the visibility of poetry, and combination

1246
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,640
of, I mean, hip-hop.

1247
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:10,000
Hip-hop rap has always been about what's going on in social realm.

1248
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,920
It seems that you also for a moment talked about poetry as therapy, which is because

1249
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,760
it goes back to what I said about sexten.

1250
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,760
Yeah.

1251
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,760
But it's interesting.

1252
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:21,160
On the other hand, I'm not sure that that always works because poetry and psychology

1253
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:26,960
is a very big theme, but for instance, when his father James Wright found out that he

1254
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:31,840
had become a poet, he said to his son, welcome to hell.

1255
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:39,160
I mean, I like the saying that I like to say that a sad poet is a happy poet, but really

1256
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:45,560
it is a whether poetry really works as a way to grieve.

1257
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:52,080
It seems like it should be cathartic, but it also can become an obsession or a dark obsession

1258
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,200
of sorts, and I don't know.

1259
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,600
It's about transformation, though, of what's dark.

1260
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,480
That's the difference, transformation through language.

1261
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,520
It's like opera, you ask yourself, why is this pleasurable?

1262
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,520
They're all deaf.

1263
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,520
Yeah.

1264
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,360
Or Shakespeare, but it is.

1265
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,880
And because it's been transformed through the art.

1266
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,040
The terrible view that is born.

1267
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,680
Well, yes.

1268
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:18,720
But the other thing is we're talking about terms of reaching people, which is important

1269
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:24,480
in all of us who love poetry, would like poems to reach more people, but they may never.

1270
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:28,440
And when you think about it in absolute numbers, they're probably because there are so many

1271
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,520
people alive.

1272
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:34,400
The tiny percentage here that are reading it or interested in it probably are more than

1273
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:38,640
people who've ever lived at any other time, and it doesn't ever have to be.

1274
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:39,640
Just about rap.

1275
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:44,120
You're bringing that up because I grew up in New York and they are street rhythms.

1276
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:47,640
And I was so struck by that I just saw Hamilton, and this is the thing.

1277
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:50,440
It was completely, it wasn't a gimmick.

1278
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:54,840
It was so appropriate because of the amount of, that's what I mean by American poetry,

1279
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:59,680
that it finally comes into its own in this century, partly through those responses.

1280
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:05,440
Because our revolution was a thrusting upward from the ground up and the city up of these

1281
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,160
energies that couldn't be contained.

1282
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:09,600
And that's what you hear in rap and hip hop.

1283
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:14,240
And it's wonderful because the second act of that is a really very sad act.

1284
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:17,640
It's devolved from that into politics as usual.

1285
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,640
But there it is.

1286
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:25,920
Shall we open it up?

1287
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:31,480
Well, does anyone have any questions?

1288
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:35,440
Good.

1289
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:38,040
I think the microphone works if you...

1290
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,040
Can I have people out speaking for you?

1291
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:43,040
Okay, people behind you won't hear you.

1292
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,040
Yeah.

1293
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:51,320
I am a singer and I live in an artist's building on the west side.

1294
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:56,720
And we have a group of people who have met for more than 10 years every other week, who

1295
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,560
get together and read poetry.

1296
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,040
We read what we've written.

1297
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,960
We read whatever interests us.

1298
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:08,120
And we always discuss it in terms of what can we know about the poet, what was going

1299
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:10,160
on at the time.

1300
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:17,440
And it's just been extraordinarily valuable for us as a venue for us to find out what's

1301
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,720
universal, where we are in our growth in 10 years.

1302
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:26,080
We have people in their 90s, two people in their 90s, one, two people in their 70s,

1303
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,960
people in their 60s, people in their 30s.

1304
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,920
We have about eight people that show up for this thing.

1305
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:36,600
And the growth that we've all had by reading aloud every week, and we read poems more than

1306
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:41,040
once and ask, and we're not area-dyed to say, I don't know what this means.

1307
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,040
What do you think this?

1308
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:46,200
No one's trying to be crazy about their ego with it.

1309
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,400
It's really there for an exploration.

1310
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:57,880
And I think it's the universal and necessary expression for us to experience intimacy through

1311
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:59,240
writing.

1312
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:06,440
And I think it's very exciting that the written word is happening on the Internet.

1313
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:14,560
I have a young niece in rural Massachusetts who reads a ruby car, and she's a young woman

1314
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,040
finding out about her own voice as a woman.

1315
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,880
And here's a great venue for her.

1316
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:24,200
And this is a kid who would never be exposed to poetry.

1317
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,680
So I think there's a lot of hope about what's going on.

1318
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,800
And I'm very happy to have listened.

1319
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,800
That's nice.

1320
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:35,520
So there are more avenues for people to share their work.

1321
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,520
Yeah.

1322
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,800
For published work to be accessible for longer to a greater number of people, there are a

1323
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,200
lot of advantages to the online presence of poetry.

1324
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,640
And it's 80 points out.

1325
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,840
Even though there are downsides, of course, yes.

1326
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,280
And Amy's pointing out those are only journals you can read, and for those of you who write,

1327
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:54,040
those are the journals you can send to.

1328
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:58,680
And many of them are web scenes, like the one I mentioned had a dot org at the end.

1329
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,160
And so, yes.

1330
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,160
Thank you.

1331
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:06,080
I was very interested to hear you talk about the pleasure and the pain in poetry.

1332
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:15,400
How much is known about the neurobiology of poetry, particularly in the developing brain

1333
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,360
and in the deteriorating brain?

1334
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,800
How much do we understand in this area?

1335
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:26,280
Young children, people with neurodegenerative disease.

1336
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:31,960
Well, we do know that I'm going to have very limited knowledge about this, but I do know

1337
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:37,920
that play makes a difference at both ends of that, that it's very important for people

1338
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:43,880
to engage and in play, not necessarily to worry about what they need to get done.

1339
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,800
And poetry provides that.

1340
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:51,280
It is a lifesaver for a lot of people who engage in that art, I think.

1341
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,120
Well I want to give two personal anecdotes about that.

1342
01:32:54,120 --> 01:33:01,240
One is my publisher, one of the fellow poets in the list, had a book out that was a really

1343
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:04,720
fine book of poems, but she was losing her mind.

1344
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,880
And she was unable to function in any other way.

1345
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,400
I don't know what this says about poets, it was a terrific book.

1346
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:15,440
And the second experience I had was in a public school in Queens.

1347
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:20,120
In April, the Poetry Society asked some of you have done it, I'm sure poets to go into

1348
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:23,440
the public schools and teach a few classes.

1349
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:27,600
So I was teaching sixth, seventh and eighth grade, which was a first.

1350
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,400
And the sixth graders were incredibly good.

1351
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:35,000
They had an instinctive sense of aesthetics, which is what may survive as in my colleague

1352
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,400
who were nothing much else survived.

1353
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,400
Manily.

1354
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,360
They were wonderful, they were moving.

1355
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:43,160
My husband Roy came along with me, he was struck by the same thing.

1356
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:48,120
At the end of it, the principal was debriefing and I said, well I take it the sixth grade

1357
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:53,400
was your advanced class and she said no, they were our special needs kids.

1358
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:57,440
They were so far ahead of the other classes.

1359
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:01,800
So you were probably the scientist and doctor, I leave that to you to figure out what that

1360
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:02,800
means.

1361
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:09,080
But I don't know if the study has been done about the effect on the synapses or if someone

1362
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:14,520
has been hooked up to a bunch of sensors and then reads a poem and what parts of the brain

1363
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,520
might have.

1364
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:22,040
There was a, I didn't end up getting very far in the reading and I put it off.

1365
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:29,400
But there was a book called The Midnight Disease written by a neurologist who was also a writer

1366
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:40,120
trying to evaluate the brain and she referenced more than just poets but perhaps that's the

1367
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:45,880
contained something of the answer.

1368
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:49,240
I guess you could ask the question about creativity in general.

1369
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:52,160
It doesn't have to be just language.

1370
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:56,920
I mean some people like deconing the painter.

1371
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:01,720
I think he has Alzheimer's or some form of dementia and I think he went right on painting

1372
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:05,280
good paintings to the end.

1373
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:11,160
They may have been affected by what happened to his brain but he was still a great painter.

1374
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:15,240
Things like that are interesting but I don't think we really know.

1375
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:26,360
I don't have anything to say about that question specifically although I suppose I should.

1376
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,360
I'm a psychiatrist.

1377
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:33,080
There's not that much research I think done on that particular topic but in general is

1378
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:39,760
interested in comparing languages that's used in let's say prose where, and we Patricia

1379
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:46,960
you touched on this a little bit at one point, the meaning of the message is sort of intended.

1380
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,640
And anyway the writer intends to intend it.

1381
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:51,600
They intend to make the meaning clear.

1382
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,600
They don't always.

1383
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,080
It sometimes spills out over.

1384
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:59,280
They have messages they intend to create but that's the point of prose.

1385
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:03,960
And then in poetry it seems there's an interest in pushing past, gushing past the limits of

1386
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,760
what the words are actually meaning on the surface.

1387
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:08,560
There's that sort of pushing past.

1388
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,080
I thought that's really interesting and it raises two questions.

1389
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:14,240
One relates to this gentleman's question.

1390
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:18,440
So playing is a little bit of, we know animals play, right?

1391
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:26,200
We know that they are rehearsing physical programs so they learn how to hunt and move

1392
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:31,240
in a certain way but they do exceed whatever is improvisational.

1393
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:36,800
So they're not practicing like someone might practice playing the piano where you feel

1394
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:40,040
you need to meet especially with classical let's say.

1395
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:42,200
Where you're trying to meet the particular notes.

1396
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:46,920
They're moving around but they're also exceeding, they're being inventive and improvisational

1397
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:52,440
and that's what play involves the sort of pushing past whatever the sort of the sheer

1398
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:57,240
formal aspect of what the brain seems to be doing.

1399
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:59,120
So that's one important thing.

1400
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:04,680
But the other was to bring up the question about poetry as being changing over time as

1401
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:08,680
being an evolution of the constraints on poetry.

1402
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:11,240
I thought that'd be an interesting topic that just touched on briefly.

1403
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:16,720
Because we talked about constraints like Twitter, somebody letters can be allowed or another

1404
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:22,000
constraints whether it's professionalized, capitalized, whatever is, that's another

1405
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,040
interesting way of looking at what's happened with poetry.

1406
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:30,760
Well I think poetry does require, for a poet to write a poem, certain restraints are required

1407
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:32,160
even if they're arbitrary.

1408
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:36,680
So it's helpful when writing a sonnet to know what the rules are and one can decide when

1409
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,520
to follow them, when not to.

1410
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:42,160
The same would be true if I would assume if one's writing on Twitter one is a certain

1411
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:46,000
number of characters and that might actually inspire creativity.

1412
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,720
But without some constraints we know how it's like Emily Dickinson gave themselves their

1413
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:54,320
own strange constraints and they invented their own rules.

1414
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:58,560
And I think all of us do that to a certain degree.

1415
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:02,280
And yes, I think the play starts very young.

1416
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:07,480
I remember being just a child and loving the word hippopotamus and wanting to say it over

1417
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:12,600
and over or showing the machine which sometimes came out as mass wing shine or whatever.

1418
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:20,040
But a lot of people start off as little gertrude stimes before they lose.

1419
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:27,520
Before they forget the wonder that is possible in the discovery of language whereas poets

1420
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,520
are always trying to discover it.

1421
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,520
And yes.

1422
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:37,680
And I do think constraints are at the center of everything that poets do and poetry does.

1423
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:40,280
Obviously in a traditional form somebody gives it to you.

1424
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:47,400
But I think all of us and people I know I teach a workshop of actually awfully good

1425
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:52,680
poets and what we're doing is setting ourselves our own constraints.

1426
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:56,840
We're learning how to give ourselves our own assignments and set a constraint.

1427
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:01,760
And it develops maybe as you write a poem but the constraint is what makes the poem.

1428
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,760
I think.

1429
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,400
I wanted to add to that.

1430
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:10,160
You have poets who are actually responding to these developments in terms of the new platforms

1431
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,960
that we're writing and poetry.

1432
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:13,960
You've got Tommy Pico, Morgan Parker.

1433
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:18,040
I mentioned to you, Morgan Parker has one book out.

1434
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,120
Tommy Pico has two books out.

1435
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:25,400
Tommy Pico's First Nations Native American Poet Queer came out with a book called IRL

1436
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:28,080
which is an Internet term.

1437
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:34,360
So he's actually embracing the language that he experiences daily.

1438
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:39,320
In real time on the Internet and that's actually changing how maybe not consciously but he's

1439
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:41,160
allowing it to enter into his poem.

1440
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:46,600
He wrote a book called it's based on the pastoral.

1441
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:51,720
But it's also like an anti-pastoral because he uses a lot of language that you don't

1442
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:55,240
typically consider would be pastoral worthy.

1443
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:58,560
You find on blogs, you find on Twitter.

1444
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,760
And he's very self-aware when he's writing this long poem on nature thinking about the

1445
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:03,760
pastoral.

1446
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:08,960
Then go back ten years ago you had Tom Lin who teaches at New Jersey.

1447
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,320
He came up with a, he's a conceptual poet.

1448
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:15,160
He came up with the idea of poetry as boredom.

1449
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:18,680
And boredom as actually being a pleasurable thing.

1450
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:22,840
So he published this book called Blips Soak O1 which is fantastic.

1451
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:26,880
And when you're reading his work, language is scattered all across the page like My

1452
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,400
Army.

1453
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,760
And he doesn't expect you to read it, read it.

1454
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,280
Like treat it ambient.

1455
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:33,920
He calls it ambient stylistics.

1456
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:37,520
Why can't you engage in poetry like you do music?

1457
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:43,120
You can do three chores at once while listening to Tchaikovsky and still appreciate Tchaikovsky.

1458
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:45,440
Why can't it be the same thing for poetry?

1459
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:50,280
So I understand if it's the poetry of boredom you're not even necessarily required to read

1460
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:51,400
the poem when you read it.

1461
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,400
You can skip a rounder.

1462
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:56,800
Well you are reading it but you've got three senses right?

1463
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,960
You've got sight, sound and then meaning.

1464
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:00,960
Yes.

1465
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,800
So you can look at the words and if you look at his book he's playing around with type

1466
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:09,280
face and but you don't have to read the whole poem.

1467
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,280
It's impossible.

1468
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:11,280
It's 300 pages long.

1469
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:16,600
But you can read bits of it and sip your coffee, go water the plants, take the dog out for

1470
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:23,840
a walk, go back to it and appreciate it as an ambient experience.

1471
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:27,800
But it's on the page.

1472
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:33,560
And that's I think a response to this oral and visual environment that we were finding

1473
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:38,240
ourselves immersed in 10 years ago before the success of YouTube.

1474
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:43,560
We're now like you have eight windows open on the internet and you're reading the times.

1475
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,800
I've been talking to Anne Marie too.

1476
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:50,680
There's something called visual poetry which is really a branch of concrete poetry where

1477
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:56,440
you arrange the words on the page to represent what your subject matters.

1478
01:41:56,440 --> 01:42:00,720
So I mean it actually has a long history but Anne Marie had an example of a poem about

1479
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,800
a dog shaped like a dog.

1480
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:07,280
There's one older one by E. Cummings called Grasshopper where the letters of the Grasshopper

1481
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:09,120
jump across the page.

1482
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:12,920
So it might seem a little gimmicky but this goes all the way back to Robert Herrick and

1483
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:15,000
Herbert's Easter Wings and so forth.

1484
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,080
There's a long tradition of representing the words visually.

1485
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:23,080
That said when there was this, because you mentioned Malarmé when there was a discussion

1486
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:26,200
with you Malarmé and Edward D'Agat.

1487
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:29,640
And D'Agat said you know I've been painting so much, I'd love to write poetry, I have

1488
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:35,000
so many ideas and Malarmé said to him my dear D'Agat poems are not made out of ideas,

1489
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,080
poems are made out of words.

1490
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:42,280
So but then if you can arrange the words in pictures maybe poems are made out of images.

1491
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:48,160
I mean images in two senses of the word, go on, yes.

1492
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:53,880
I think of Borden as a kind of repressed anxiety so if it can be transformed into pleasure

1493
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:55,640
that's very interesting.

1494
01:42:55,640 --> 01:43:00,840
I have a question.

1495
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:07,400
One number of things I've been puzzling over in the course of your presentations, one in

1496
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:15,840
particular and that is well wider and wider dissemination through more and more channels

1497
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:27,120
and venues, engagement in social and political activity, performance in a number of ways,

1498
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:32,160
and even intimacy, all phenomena of the present moment.

1499
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:40,680
And at the same time Patricia you were mentioned at least twice, maybe three times, the notion

1500
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:49,360
that only a handful of poems perhaps in any given era tend to last, to endure.

1501
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:54,600
And I'm wondering about the sort of dialectic between these two things.

1502
01:43:54,600 --> 01:44:03,120
Because for example if you read, as I tend to do, a lot of poetry reviews, you often

1503
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:09,320
hear the phrase so and so is the greatest poet writing in English at the present time.

1504
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:15,440
Or so and so is the greatest American poet of the end of the 20th century.

1505
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:25,160
Now if that's more than sure to move books at Farra Stralster Norton in these reviews,

1506
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:31,360
what does that have to do with this more and more what seems like democratization of

1507
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:38,240
poetry, huge diversity of poetry, and then what's the meaning of the greatest poet writing

1508
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:41,760
in whatever language?

1509
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,880
There's a clash there that I can't quite recognize.

1510
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:46,200
You may well wonder about that.

1511
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:51,440
I can listen to you, I'm thinking if we just collected all the blurbs on the back of poetry

1512
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:52,920
books.

1513
01:44:52,920 --> 01:45:00,480
But here's the real situation as opposed to even 20 years ago maybe.

1514
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:05,120
You would ask a list of people interested in poetry, well give me a list of the 10 most

1515
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:07,720
important poets writing now.

1516
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:10,240
And most of the net, there'd be a lot of overlap.

1517
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:15,720
You did that now with even 10 or 20 names, there might be no overlap or maybe two or three

1518
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:18,480
names.

1519
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,480
I don't think there's exactly a contradiction in what you're saying.

1520
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:25,960
I think it's again the winnowing effects of time.

1521
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:29,760
I think reading the blurbs could skew that in your mind.

1522
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:34,440
I think the best things reviewers can do, I really think most poetry reviews, first of

1523
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:37,200
all they're hardly any which is really sad.

1524
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:41,840
And secondly, the best of them don't really talk that much about poetry.

1525
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,560
They'll give you enough of a selection from the book under review so you can judge for

1526
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,320
yourself what you think of this book.

1527
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:49,840
But most of them don't as you probably realized.

1528
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,200
They'll talk about it.

1529
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,200
I don't know if that answers your question.

1530
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,920
Well the point is it is a subjective claim no matter how we look at it.

1531
01:45:56,920 --> 01:46:02,080
If someone says this is the greatest writer, the greatest writer according to whom and

1532
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:09,800
according to what standards, what is the, and I think that's the place to start.

1533
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:15,640
The Herrick who I mentioned has worked in visual forms.

1534
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:17,680
The reception of poets can be so odd.

1535
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:24,120
He was completely unknown during his time and then was discovered, which is centuries

1536
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:26,800
ago and then was discovered in the 19th century.

1537
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,200
So that's a really odd one.

1538
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:31,960
Sometimes people die and then they become really big after that like Emily Dickinson.

1539
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:35,160
But here's someone who just lay underground for centuries.

1540
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:42,240
I mean there's every kind of, and others who like Oscar Wilde who did write some poems,

1541
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:45,360
very popular in his time, very popular afterwards.

1542
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,680
It's very hard to know.

1543
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:47,680
We can't know.

1544
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:53,960
I think that it's important that you have, there are going to be those who last through

1545
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:54,960
time.

1546
01:46:54,960 --> 01:47:01,920
In the meantime we're living now and it's who we are interested in as individuals.

1547
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,600
And that's important.

1548
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:13,440
It's important to living life who we are interested in seeing and watching and reading everything,

1549
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,440
who we are.

1550
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:22,280
This is now and these are various, you know, any used bookstore in a small town will make

1551
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:27,480
you sad because you'll become across books that were published, major publishing houses

1552
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:29,640
and you don't know who these people are.

1553
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:33,960
So greatest can only be temporal really.

1554
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:37,720
And if you know the future you don't have one anyway.

1555
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:40,040
It's not just.

1556
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:45,320
The fact of every strong poet being the school of one, but every reader is also a school of

1557
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:46,320
one.

1558
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:49,280
And I think what Amy's saying is just look at what appeals to you.

1559
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,280
That's the only important thing.

1560
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:55,440
And the word greatest is a superlative which means it can only be one.

1561
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:01,560
And if many, many people are saying so and so is the greatest, then it can only mean

1562
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:03,480
I like this where it speaks to me.

1563
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:06,040
Yeah, I think great should be a word.

1564
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:08,680
There should be a list of little words you can't use in poetry.

1565
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:11,720
It's great would certainly be one of them.

1566
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:13,920
It says absolutely nothing.

1567
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:20,240
But you touch on the connection to capital in that statement, right?

1568
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:22,400
Like you talk about the industry.

1569
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:27,000
And you can't ignore thinking about great and greatest because every year we've got

1570
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,800
every month we have a new award that is going to somebody.

1571
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:35,280
Which requires qualifications and all that.

1572
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:37,800
We need to combine greatest and scarcity.

1573
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,800
For Americans.

1574
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:40,800
Yeah.

1575
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:44,520
American blurbs are especially hyperbolic actually.

1576
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:49,040
If you would just compare American blurbs to Irish blurbs or English blurbs or others

1577
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,720
in the poetry speaking world, it's pretty striking.

1578
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:56,640
Look at a list of who won Pulitzer Prizes or something all the way back in fiction and

1579
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:57,640
poetry.

1580
01:48:57,640 --> 01:49:01,960
You'll see a lot of names that nobody knows or writers that nobody reads anymore.

1581
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:02,960
It's astounding, right?

1582
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,920
And that's a relatively new prize, the Pulitzer Prize.

1583
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:10,560
If there were something that went back to the thousands of years, we can only imagine

1584
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:12,600
what would be on that list.

1585
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:16,560
Robert Bridges did write at least one great poem, Arrow's Tearinos.

1586
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,800
I feel that actually Arrow's the one that begins.

1587
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:21,800
Arrow's Tearinos.

1588
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:22,800
Yeah, that's the problem.

1589
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:23,800
That's the problem.

1590
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:24,800
That's the problem.

1591
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:25,800
That's the problem.

1592
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:26,800
That's the problem.

1593
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:27,800
That's the problem.

1594
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:28,800
That's a great poem.

1595
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,400
There's an example of a great poem, whatever else you want.

1596
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:34,360
That's all you need to do.

1597
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:39,600
I'm told that we need to wrap up.

1598
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,800
I'm really glad to have to stop things.

1599
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:44,240
It means everyone's so interested.

1600
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:45,240
Thank you.

1601
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:50,240
Thank you very much.
