1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,080
Okay, we're going to get started.

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,600
Welcome to the Helix Center for Interdisciplinary Investigation of the New York Psychoanalyx

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Society Institute.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,840
I'm Rob Penzer, associate director of the center.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,120
Before I turn the program over to Beth Hayes to introduce this, the last Helix roundtable

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,440
for this calendar year, I wish to entice you and entreat you.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,720

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,440
and next year's poetry, music and film events too.

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,920

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,000
Now I'd like to turn things over to Beth Hayes of our executive committee who deserves great

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,440
thanks today for developing and single-handedly organizing today's roundtable on animal language.

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:59,440
Thanks Beth.

26
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,120
Okay, this is the best I can do.

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,240
This is Chris Clark here on my lab.

28
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,960
Chris is the director of the bioacoustics research program at Cornell's lab of ornithology

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,240
and is a senior scientist in the department of neurobiology at Cornell.

30
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,560
He works at the interface of science, applied engineering, industry regulation and NGOs.

31
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,520
Dr. Clark's work includes monitoring of large whale distributions and other oceanographic

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,000
studies using passive acoustic detection and aerial surveys and genetic and photo ID data.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,040
He and his staff have developed a suite of analytic procedures and metrics for understanding

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,880
the acoustics of ocean ecosystems and they're launched through human interference and he

35
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,960
uses these collaboratively with other research departments and institutes also.

36
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,080
And then over here we have Dr. Ray Doherty, associate professor of linguistics at NYU.

37
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Dr. Doherty completed his PhD combining electrical engineering work at MIT with studies of coordinate

38
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:39,180
structures and recursion in language at the linguistics department at NYU under N

39
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,880
which is on the use of Chomsky's universal grammar to represent English, French and German

40
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,800
in a prologue computer language.

41
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,800
And most recently he's been working on the evolutionary biology of the inner ear using

42
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,880
some mathematical representations and analog digital converter models to understand human

43
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,800
sound processing and how it's evolved over millions of years.

44
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,480
Over here we have Dr. James Fuller.

45
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,800
He's now Dr. James Fuller as of a few weeks ago who recently defended his doctoral dissertation

46
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,200
in Columbia.

47
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,680
His research focused on the evolution and expansion of vocal signal repertoire focusing on the

48
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,480
communication systems of blue monkeys.

49
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,200
He has also lectured on the evolution and usage of communication systems in birds and

50
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,600
mammals and the sensory systems of vertebrates.

51
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,480
And then we have Dr. James Higum over there.

52
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,280
He is an assistant professor of biological anthropology at NYU.

53
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Is it Higum or Ohio?

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
I am.

55
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
It's okay.

56
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
I am.

57
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
My professor.

58
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,160
His research interest is sexual selection and communication and primate signaling behavior.

59
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,120
From a variety of perspectives that he uses, genetic, neuroendocrine, behavioral and morphologic.

60
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,920
He studies everything from the cocks, baboons and guanons.

61
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Guanons?

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Guanons, yeah.

63
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,920
To a game theory signaling models and computational models of primate perception.

64
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,360
He's author of a number of dozen publications and the guest editor of a number of journals

65
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,880
on primate signaling, primate coloration and multimodal animal communication.

66
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,920
And then finally we have Dr. Diana Reese who is a cognitive psychologist and professor

67
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,840
in the department of psychology at Hunter and the department of biopsychology and behavioral

68
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,000
neuroscience at the graduate center of CUNY.

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,320
And Dr. Reese develops and directs the Dolphin Cognition program at the National Aquarium

70
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,440
in Baltimore and studies elephant cognition at the Smithsonian National Zoo.

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,440
I had the great good fortune when my kids were little of having a special backstage dolphin

72
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,600
tour with her at the New York Aquarium where she was then the director of the marine mammal

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,040
program.

74
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,480
And so in addition to her scholarship in cetacean and animal cognition and the evolution of

75
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,480
intelligence including pioneering work in the investigation of dolphin abilities through

76
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,720
underwater key birds and responses to the mirror.

77
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,240
Dr. Reese is known for her protection of dolphins in the tuna industry and the rescuing of stranded

78
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,880
marine animals everywhere such as Humphrey the whale.

79
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,160
Her most recent book is the Dolphin in the Mirror.

80
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,440
So those are our panelists and I will just route to the question of what do we mean when

81
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,360
we say animals communicate and let you guys go from there.

82
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,840
Maybe a good way to start off is to sort of define the word communication and in the essence.

83
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,520
I mean there are many different definitions but it really comes from the Latin word meaning

84
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
to share.

85
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
It's exchange and share signals.

86
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,760
And I think we all agree pretty much that's a real basic as low as we can go sharing signals.

87
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,520
And I think the one thing that I'd like to throw out there today is that we used to think

88
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,560
that we were the only communicating species.

89
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
We really did.

90
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,640
We thought we were the only species certainly with language and for a long time we thought

91
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,880
that we were the only species that could think and or could communicate in any meaningful

92
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
way.

93
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:58,120
So I think one of the things that is a big idea is that all animals communicate in some

94
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,720
way so maybe we can take it from the other.

95
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:11,360
So a caveat to that is the notion that the communication is intentional as opposed to

96
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,960
a deer is not communicating as it rustles leaves as it runs through the forest.

97
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,960
You can't hear me.

98
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,200
Is that louder?

99
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,640
And the great rustling begins.

100
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,560
Yes, the sweet beans.

101
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,120
So I was saying that one of the components of this notion of communication is that it's

102
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
intentional.

103
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,560
It's not some byproduct of an action.

104
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,320
But there's a difference between evolutionary intentionality and cognitive intentionality

105
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
and the way that we use it.

106
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,160
I wouldn't say most animal communication is intentional.

107
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:57,160
I give a baboon has a large sexual swelling or a little insect flashes a light to another

108
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:07,440
that, speaking of communication, I mean, evolution has acted for signaling to occur over evolutionary

109
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
time.

110
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,760
It's not that a female baboon is thinking I'm going to grow that morphology on my hind

111
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,840
quarters so that I can indicate my ovulation.

112
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,400
But there's still clearly communication going on there.

113
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,600
So I wouldn't say, I mean, there's a difference between signals which have, I think there's

114
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
two different issues.

115
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,440
If you're talking about a deer rustling in the forest, you could argue that that's a

116
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,320
cue rather than a signal and there's the whole cue signal debate.

117
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,440
But then there's a separate argument, I think, about the difference between signals that

118
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:52,000
have been selected for over evolutionary time and what goes on in here when animal signal.

119
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So you brought up something very interesting.

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,760
It's a signaling right here.

121
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,040
It's going to happen every few minutes.

122
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,280
Only when very good points are made.

123
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:08,240
I think one of the points actually that Diana said is that people, I think what you said

124
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,680
was that people didn't realize or didn't at least accept that animals, that non-human

125
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,280
animals communicate until relatively recently.

126
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,880
But I think one of the problems with communication is how difficult it is to talk about it.

127
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,920
In that the word humans are an inherently linguistic species.

128
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,920
We use language, we think linguistically, we communicate linguistically.

129
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,000
Just about every example we ever give has a linguistic framework to it.

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,080
So we can't imagine any other way of communicating.

131
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,800
And so when we find that non-humans animals are communicating in non-linguistic paradigms

132
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,880
or non-linguistic frameworks, we can't make sense of it and therefore we dismiss it.

133
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,360
And I think what James may, well, we don't because we're learned at scholars.

134
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,280
But I think a lot of people have a tendency to dismiss it and I think what James was referring

135
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,920
to was the fact that from an evolutionary perspective, there's a lot of communication

136
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,960
behavior that takes place on many, many different levels.

137
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,000
And I would assume that very few of them reach the cognitive complexity of human language

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,600
or human communication.

139
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,720
But that doesn't make them any less or more fascinating or evolutionary important.

140
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,440
No, I would throw out this idea again.

141
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,160
I'm throwing out ideas here that we don't know.

142
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,520
I mean, we often say it's not as complex as what we do.

143
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:38,360
But I think there's this vast sort of ignorance about what we really know about the content

144
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,840
of the signals, what it's actually conveying.

145
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
And I'll give you a good example.

146
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,680
When I was in graduate school, I was actually a linguistics major.

147
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,840
I was really interested in studying communication in humans and other animals and how they use

148
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,200
these signals.

149
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,000
And I found that there was a man named René G. Bismell who had been studying the human-wistled

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,520
languages in the world.

151
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,600
Now these are languages where people send whistles back and forth, much like you hear

152
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,640
birds' bird whistles or dolphin whistles.

153
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,600
But it's based on the spoken language.

154
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,840
So in that very nice way, we know what the content of those whistles are.

155
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,680
And you hear sounds like, now if I heard that coming from a dolphin or a bird, I might

156
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,520
just think, that's really simple because what can you put in a whistle?

157
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,560
But when you look at these whistle languages, they're conveying the words that we whistle.

158
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,720
And that was a real lesson, I think, and a humbling that you can pack a lot of information

159
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,640
into what looks like perhaps a very simple set of signals, three whistles.

160
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,480
And those are actually words and sentences.

161
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,800
So I actually would argue that we simply don't know in many cases what's encoded in those

162
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
whistles.

163
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:55,280
So do we assume that to qualify as having language or linguistics that it has to follow

164
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,280
the syntactical and grammatical rules of these?

165
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
And so...

166
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Do you want to do more distinctions made now or later?

167
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Now we'll probably do this.

168
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Sure.

169
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:18,840
I'm going to guess we're not going to actually solve anything.

170
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,800
That's just my prediction for the day.

171
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,560
He just came out of his PhD.

172
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:31,560
No, I think that what I was saying earlier that one of the inherent challenges in studying

173
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,440
communication is terminology and specificity in what we mean by it.

174
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,640
I mean, I actually got about halfway through a book before, and I won't mention who it

175
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,080
is in case they're here, on language and whether or not apes have language or the capacity

176
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,640
for language and not once in at least 150 pages before I threw it away, did he define

177
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
language?

178
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Correct.

179
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,800
I find that fascinating that we can actually question whether or not a species or even

180
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,560
a group of organisms has the capacity for something without actually defining what the

181
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,200
criteria of that are.

182
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:12,280
And so I've read very, very, very simple, simplistic definitions of language that speak

183
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,280
to referential, semanticism, syntactic capacities.

184
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,280
And if that's the case, then we may have some evidence of non-humans using it.

185
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,200
But I don't believe that that's the case.

186
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:31,560
So to answer your question again, to readdress it, the whole world of semiotics and zoosymatics,

187
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,400
the study of signs and symbols.

188
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:39,800
So let's take the case of an animal that has a swollen rear and it's red.

189
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:47,400
That could serve as a signal that's been selected for to attract a mate, a certain time, a signal.

190
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,040
If we think about or assign perhaps.

191
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,440
If we think about a symbol and the way symbols are defined, if we all agree, is it something

192
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,400
that represents something else?

193
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,000
I think we have evidence in the animal world, at least, that certain animals can be taught

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,640
to use symbols.

195
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:12,120
It may not qualify as language the way we define it, but certainly we've seen with dolphins

196
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,240
in training at the University of Hawaii and there's some evidence in some of the work

197
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,480
I've done, although I haven't called them symbols.

198
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,400
And in Alex the African Ray Parrot, work that's been done to train him on functional communication

199
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,320
skills and some of the chimp language studies and the chimp communication studies, those

200
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,400
animals under double blind conditions without any cueing from the people who work with them

201
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,240
can use the word symbolically.

202
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,720
So I think we have some evidence for that.

203
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,400
And it doesn't mean we know how they use it in their own world or if they do use it symbolically,

204
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,000
but they seem to have this capacity.

205
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,480
I think that's an important finding.

206
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,720
So I hope that helps.

207
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,720
I mean, the classic functionally referential example in animal communication is the chaney

208
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,600
and so forth vervet monkey alarm calls, where vervet monkeys respond in one specific way

209
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,840
to see in a snake and a different specific way to seeing an eagle and a different specific

210
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,520
way to seeing a leopard.

211
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:13,680
And individuals then, everybody else, has a specific response in response to the specific

212
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,160
call that's an appropriate anti-predator response to that predator.

213
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,360
Now that's the standard like when that first came out, that was in a science paper in

214
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,720
1980 and it was a big brahuhar at the time.

215
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,440
And when that first came out, it was called referential communication.

216
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,520
And then it got switched to functionally referential communication because they weren't sure they

217
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,400
didn't want to imply so much about the cognition of the vervet monkeys and they were saying

218
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,200
they're scared, sorry, heaven forbid.

219
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:50,240
So they wanted to say more that look, as long as the monkey is, I guess they switched

220
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,840
the emphasis from the signaler and what the signaler meant to the receiver, the perceiver,

221
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:02,240
the second individual, what they could infer as a perceiver.

222
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,480
And therefore, if you're walking through the forest as a vervet monkey and you see a snake

223
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,000
and that makes you give a certain call because it arouses you to a certain level.

224
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,040
As long as there's a statistical association with you giving that call and there being

225
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,360
a snake such that whenever you hear that call as a perceiver, it always means there's a

226
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,000
snake, you as a perceiver can create the referentiality.

227
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,360
It doesn't have to be a construct of the signaler.

228
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
It doesn't have to be that the vervet monkey sees the snake and thinks snake.

229
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,280
So vervet monkey can just be aroused to a certain type of call by that stimulus and

230
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,720
the perceiver as long as that level of arousal is always associated with the snake, it doesn't

231
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,080
really matter what goes on the first vervet monkey's head.

232
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,600
The second vervet monkey is able to infer snake regardless.

233
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,560
So it became a more, it shifted towards a more kind of referential view to a more functionally

234
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
referential.

235
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:03,280
And all the discussion you have in communication is pretty much between adults with some internal

236
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,440
mental structure of some sort.

237
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,720
Almost all the work I've done just is on signal structures.

238
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,360
For instance, I think there's a lot of things that couldn't be explained using that kind

239
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
of a model.

240
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,840
For instance, the very first cochlea that was in an inner ear was a very tiny little thing

241
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,560
the size of a disc and it was kind of brittle.

242
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,880
And then it gradually turned into a cylinder and that's what dinosaurs had.

243
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,560
And then that stayed with the mammals, millions, hundreds of millions of years, until about

244
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,320
200 million years ago.

245
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,440
And then you got the double helix, which the human beings have, which is a spiral.

246
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,160
And I told people I would work in the word helix.

247
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,760
So there it is, that's one already.

248
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:52,680
But in any event, if you try to account for why it evolved in these different ways, first

249
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,920
it's hard to do.

250
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,320
But the cylinder is still what birds have.

251
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,880
And now when it broke off from the cylinder and became a helix, what happened was there's

252
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,200
an animal called the tenrec, T-E-N-R-E-C.

253
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,560
It's worth looking up.

254
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,000
It's a crazy little thing.

255
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,160
It lives in Madagascar.

256
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,280
And the mother has 22 children.

257
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,960
It's at the bottom of the food chain.

258
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,000
It looks like a small porcupine.

259
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,280
But that's the first mammal there probably was.

260
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,880
The second one was something along the lines of a platypus.

261
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,680
Now, the tenrec evolved a cochlear that's enormously big.

262
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,920
Wars is two and a half turns.

263
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,600
This one's six and a half turns because it could hear an enormously high frequency.

264
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,120
And the big problem was predation from lizards and snakes or something that could hear that

265
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,800
high frequency like a bird.

266
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,800
The way they communicated was not orally, they have porcupine things, and they flick

267
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
their quills.

268
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,780
And it goes, and the mother can immediately locate where the child is, and the child can

269
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,240
call to the mother, since they're mammals, they must nurse, so the children must call

270
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
to the mother.

271
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
And the mother must be in close contact.

272
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
This is not adult.

273
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,400
I think a large amount of evolution of the internal organs of the body that are responsible

274
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,760
for many of the speech phenomenon in fact comes from things like mother-child interaction.

275
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,240
Now the platypus, which is my favorite animal, I think.

276
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,240
I didn't know there were so many that were all over the place, apparently, in Australia.

277
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,560
The platypus is a lizard-like animal, and it lays an egg, and then the mother hatches

278
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,880
the egg, and the baby has a little egg tooth, and then nurses it.

279
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,640
But the mother does not have breasts.

280
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,000
The milk oozes directly out from her fur and her skin, and the little animal licks it off.

281
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,320
Now they also have the bird cochlea.

282
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,160
Now why did the platypus not need to evolve a very big cochlea to nurse the babies?

283
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,000
Well, it's poisonous.

284
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,360
Everything that crawls into a platypus nest becomes dinner.

285
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
It's not going to eat something.

286
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
It's going to be eaten.

287
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,840
If it eats, I don't want to eat sound or any way.

288
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,440
But it's a funny thing, that this kind of thing happens.

289
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,600
And also if you just look at various complex signal communications, I've worked a lot

290
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,960
with insects because they're somewhat different.

291
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,400
And the reason I studied the insects is because the bird cochlea evolved to hear a very highly

292
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,640
specific sound, and in fact it's the sound made by insects.

293
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,120
So let me just give you one example, and then I'll be quiet.

294
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,000
As you look at crickets, and I've started studying crickets for any number of reasons,

295
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
but it was in Santa Domingo.

296
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,880
There's more crickets there than you can believe.

297
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,920
If a cricket puts one wing up like this and puts another wing out to the side, and there's

298
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,840
another cricket over there doing the same thing, if this cricket wiggles this wing, the other

299
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,600
one this wing wiggles.

300
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,360
And if it wiggles this wing, then this wiggles.

301
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,680
And if it wiggles both of them, then both of them wiggle on the other cricket.

302
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,400
A cricket can send three completely different signals to another cricket across the room,

303
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,120
but you will just hear it as brrr, brrr, brrr.

304
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,840
They have extremely complicated communication systems.

305
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,760
And when you think he's only got 80,000 neurons in his head, and he is processing signals

306
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,640
that are beyond the human capacity to process, there's something going on here.

307
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,840
Evolution must have, I mean I sort of agree with many of the people that say evolution

308
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
goes and jumps.

309
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,600
In fact that's my main work.

310
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,120
I mean just with the thing I told you about the cochlea, to transform from a cylinder cochlea

311
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,880
to a triple concentric helical spiral, working the second time he likes, has to have happened

312
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,280
overnight.

313
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,400
It couldn't be that it took 20 million years because the ear wouldn't work.

314
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,080
It had to work and that's, it had to work overnight.

315
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,760
And in fact, I can show it to you a little later on.

316
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,080
I don't get too boring, too fast.

317
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,640
The distance in a mathematical space from a cylinder to a helix is trivial.

318
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,880
One tiny little thing away.

319
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,120
So what happened was something instead of growing this way, grew that way.

320
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,640
And it's an interesting sort of seed to see how these signal complexities grew.

321
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,400
And the other thing that's kind of explicable is not only mother child for human beings,

322
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,560
that's very crucial because we're all mammals.

323
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,480
But the human ear is almost identical to that of a cat apparently.

324
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,880
The cats were the greatest predators of human beings in the early days apparently.

325
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,120
And I don't know how they do this, but archaeologists, anthropologists, flossed at the teeth of

326
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,640
the old, I don't know, saber-doot tigers, and find there's a human remains between them.

327
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,360
It could very well be that the earliest predator, the human ear, tuned itself to hear exactly

328
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,880
like what the cat's here.

329
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,760
And it's my understanding of the doctors that do operations on ears practice on cats.

330
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,880
So it's pretty close.

331
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,880
It's not the case that all animals, or all animals, have the same kind of frequency response,

332
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,560
but the cats do.

333
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,720
And in fact, if you look at the way the human being responds to a specific kind of sound

334
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,880
variation, which is called frequency modulation, which would be if I took a rubber band and

335
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,600
twanged it and then went back and forth like that, that would essentially be the kind of

336
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,560
sound your ear is particularly tuned to.

337
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,200
And that's particularly the kind of noise that would be for a lion with a roar.

338
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,000
But actually, big cats have now been shown to have a very special adaptation for Inpersonic.

339
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
For what?

340
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Inpersonic.

341
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah, could well be.

342
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
No, it's...

343
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh, yeah, it's...

344
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,400
And that's actually pretty bad, as big cats.

345
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Yeah, yeah.

346
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Well, yeah.

347
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,600
But human ear probably just heard what it did.

348
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,800
You know, it could localize cats in space.

349
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,160
I mean, it gets very complicated mathematically because if you have something with a constant

350
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,440
frequency coming at you, the frequency goes up.

351
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,280
So if a cat were roaring and running away from you, the frequency wouldn't go up and

352
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,440
you might think he's standing still.

353
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
But our ear is not fooled by that.

354
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
See, it's a funny sort of thing.

355
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,640
I think it's a little complicated.

356
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,880
I don't want to get into it, but there's no simple example I can think of.

357
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,960
But suppose I had just a rubber band who was twanging it and going back and forth like

358
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
that.

359
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,760
And now suppose I had a tuning fork and moved it back and forth like that.

360
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,760
The frequency would sound like it was going up when I moved the tuning fork towards you

361
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,880
and low when it was going away.

362
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,000
And it would sound like the frequency was going up when I pulled the rubber band apart

363
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,960
and down when I pushed it together.

364
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,000
Are those two sounds distinguishable by all animals?

365
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,760
And the answer is no, they're not.

366
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,680
They're very different to some.

367
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,240
And some human beings hear the big difference other ones don't.

368
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,040
And I think that's why this people, I don't know this at all.

369
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,080
They have perfect pitch and some people have really phenomenal sense.

370
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,360
They don't like the sound of the hall because there's too many reverberations or something

371
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,440
like that where someone like me would walk in and wouldn't even know there was any difference.

372
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:41,600
I mean, I think we see matching of sensory systems to signals very broadly across the

373
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
animal kingdom.

374
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:50,760
You know, all sensory systems are matched and there's a lot of talk about whether the

375
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:57,760
use of certain types of colors, certain types of sounds, et cetera are sort of hidden channels

376
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,680
are targeted at specific species.

377
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,840
So for example, birds, so humans are trichromats.

378
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,880
So we're able to see we have three cone classes in our eye, medium wave and short wave, red

379
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,400
green, blue vision.

380
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,720
But of course birds have an extra super, super short cone.

381
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,240
And either a UV cone or an SUV cone.

382
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:28,080
And they also signal using a lot of ultraviolet colors, a lot of UV coloration.

383
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,680
And a lot of people in the bird literature have discussed whether that UV might be a

384
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,640
hidden channel, right?

385
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,680
For non-human primates, catterines and propoys is a whole host of red coloration news.

386
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,680
Since we evolved trichromacy and we can actually distinguish reds from greens, from baboons

387
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:52,360
to gelada to mandrels to vervet monkeys to the Gwenons.

388
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,160
All these anthropologies are a lot of red coloration.

389
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:02,640
And of course, for their dichromatic mammalian predators, you can't distinguish red from

390
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
green.

391
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:10,520
So maybe it's a particularly good color to use because it's detectable to other catterine

392
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
primates.

393
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,880
It's detectable to bird predators, but not to other mammalian predators, not to large

394
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
cats, some things like that.

395
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,440
They just wouldn't be able to see a bright red face in a green tree.

396
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,760
It would just be all the same color.

397
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,760
So you know another thing that we tend to not think about is the subtleties in our

398
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
non-vocal signaling.

399
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,400
I mean, we're talking about colors and different kinds of visual signals.

400
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,600
But for many of you in this room, if you're working with people and watching their behaviors,

401
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,480
speaking to you, you're paying a lot of attention to what they're doing.

402
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,320
I mean, we know that about between 70% and 90% of what we communicate is non-verbal,

403
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,880
from micro-momentary movements to the tone in which we say something so I can say, Chris,

404
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,000
really nice shoes.

405
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,600
We hear the words, we hear the order, we get the basic idea, but what's the meaning of

406
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
that message?

407
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,600
And you're looking at how I'm looking at you and really nice shoes, Chris.

408
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
You've got a pretty strong affect there.

409
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:18,280
And to me, that is the perfect example of the difference between communication in terms

410
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:25,240
of signaling system that's evolved and language that has meaning, that has a shared cultural

411
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,840
elaboration on an understanding.

412
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,360
And maybe I oversimplify it, but I see that as if you had written down Chris and I shoes

413
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,920
and handed it to him, he'd probably not be as annoyed with you.

414
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,400
I really mean I like your shoes.

415
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,600
Because the meaning in language is based on a shared understanding of this symbolically

416
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:57,400
referential constructs, whereas what we like to call body language, but your gestural,

417
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:04,600
chemical, visual signaling is intrinsic, is it's our species to some.

418
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
There are cultural variations on this.

419
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,760
But it's still contextual.

420
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,560
Even in non-humans, it's contextual.

421
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,040
If you show a racist monkey, a female racist monkey during the birth season compared to

422
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,280
the mate's season, he treats it differently.

423
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:26,360
If you show an ambiguous face that could be interpreted as being a positive face, it

424
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,560
could be interpreted as being a negative face.

425
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,280
If you showed that to the same animal, when the animal has just had a vet check versus

426
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,640
when the animal hasn't had a vet check, they treat it differently.

427
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,040
Because it makes sense.

428
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,800
It's a form of cognitive bias, right?

429
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,400
It's a emotion mediating attention.

430
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,280
If bad things are happening to you and you see something that could be good or bad, if

431
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,440
lots of bad things have been happening, maybe it's best to assume this will also be a bad

432
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
thing.

433
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,280
And if lots and lots of good things have been happening and you see something that could

434
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,560
be good or bad, maybe it's safe to assume it's probably going to be good.

435
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,800
So there's an awful lot of context that goes on.

436
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,880
I don't think we're the only ones that add a lot of context to this.

437
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,240
You can see the same signal given to the same individual and depending on recent experience,

438
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,960
depending on things like this, it can be interpreted very differently.

439
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,160
But I imagine, and I fully accept that.

440
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:24,520
I think though that there are certain examples where there's probably very little variation.

441
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:30,080
Alarm calls, indications of extreme aggression, things like that, where there probably isn't

442
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,880
so much where selection wouldn't favor variation in response, where selection would favor high

443
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,680
specificity in response.

444
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,960
So it doesn't, I am sure there are examples, but selection wouldn't favor one to spend

445
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,640
a lot of time thinking about what just happened when you hear a predator alarm call.

446
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,920
Selection would favor an instant and immediate response.

447
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,880
Whether there's any, and it's interesting because the term mental construct or mental

448
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,600
cognitive awareness gets tossed around a lot.

449
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,440
And in my work, I don't actually need to know what the animals are thinking, to know

450
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,160
that they're responding.

451
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:10,040
And from an evolutionary perspective, what the animals are thinking might be the mechanism

452
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,760
by which they respond.

453
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,400
But for the trait to be favored, they just need to respond in a way that's beneficial.

454
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,520
So if an alarm call is given and animals come raining out of the trees and that keeps them

455
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,640
from being eaten, that's going to get passed on.

456
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,360
Whether they think that there's an eagle or whether they think that trees have suddenly

457
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,560
become uninhabitable is a secondary question.

458
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,600
I have a question about that.

459
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,880
I saw a movie once.

460
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,680
My wife's father was a movie maker and I saw a lot of documentaries in my life.

461
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,640
And my wife's father was a movie maker and I've seen loads of documentaries and there's

462
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,800
this gigantic tree in Africa, I think it is.

463
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,880
And the monkeys, whatever they are at the top, could see the eagles first.

464
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,400
And the ones in the middle see the pythons first and the ones at the bottom see the black

465
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,880
cat.

466
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,720
Now each one had a different call.

467
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,400
And so the guy at the top goes yelling in German, let's say.

468
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,720
And then the guy in the middle speaks French and the guy at the bottom is English.

469
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,840
So they recognize each other's calls and you hear them all yelling but each one is their

470
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
own thing.

471
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
They are like a trilingual monkeys.

472
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:22,240
Well, there's a whole, like particularly in West Africa.

473
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,200
There are these kind of communication networks.

474
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,880
So actually not even just monkeys, a range of monkey species and monkeys on the ground

475
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
and various of it.

476
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,360
So you get monkeys and some, I think it's mangebiz on the ground at the various.

477
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,440
You share each other's lines.

478
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,040
And basically every single species.

479
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,520
So they have a different call for a leopard from an eagle from a snake.

480
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,920
And every single species recognizes every single of the species specific calls.

481
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,160
So if a Diana monkey gives a leopard call, then you'll hear the black and white collar

482
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,080
bus monkey start to give it a leopard call.

483
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,600
Then you'll hear that the all start to give a little call.

484
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,520
So they all recognize all of them.

485
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,960
What do they come up with a common word?

486
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,560
When I was doing playback experiments.

487
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
Same thing happens.

488
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
It happens.

489
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Right?

490
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:17,320
And actually that's an even more interesting and bigger leap is when hugely diverged taxes

491
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:23,080
such as primates and birds can actually respond to the alarm calls of the other.

492
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,160
And I'm not familiar enough with the literature to know if anyone has any great opinions on

493
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,920
whether or not those are learned responses or whether they're evolved responses.

494
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,200
But either way it's a pretty impressive.

495
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,400
They're learned responses.

496
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,240
So if you look through development, individuals are very, very poor when they're young.

497
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,480
And they show perceptual narrowing as they get older.

498
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,040
So if you take a young vervet monkey, they're given a legal call to any bird.

499
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Right.

500
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,360
Yeah, but they are predisposed to this.

501
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,920
They're predisposed to do it.

502
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
But they're terrible at it.

503
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,520
But it's that's perceptual narrowing.

504
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,480
And you can see the range of.

505
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,440
We can say the same about our taste buds.

506
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,920
We can say the same about our taste buds.

507
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,280
There's perceptual narrowing that isn't necessarily based on learning.

508
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,960
There's ontogeny is involved in it.

509
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:14,160
But I'm not necessarily convinced that we can distinguish clearly that these are all learned

510
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,200
behaviors versus they're innate behaviors.

511
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,160
And probably like almost everything, there's a combination of the two.

512
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:26,640
Where you've got an innate predisposition that is then affixed through ontogeny.

513
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,280
As a little monkey grows up and is making wrong calls.

514
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Everyone ignores them.

515
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,040
No, but they were like a day and they all say, I think he's not pulling our leg.

516
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,120
Or is it a slow thing?

517
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
They just show maybe.

518
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,960
They just narrow in through development.

519
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,640
And they do tend to go from all birds to all large birds to all large birds.

520
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,480
But when the rest of the people decide to fall out of the tree, because if this guy's

521
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,400
calling bird every other day.

522
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,800
They're calling people.

523
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
They just ignore them when they're doing it.

524
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,800
They tend to ignore the jouve and all of the jouve and all of the other things.

525
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,520
And then they'll look at the juvenile and they'll go back to feeding.

526
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,920
But one of the interesting things we're talking about, the heterospecific responses, I do

527
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,320
playback experiments in the species that I study to look at responses.

528
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:16,520
And one of the hardest thing I had was that I would playback the eagle call of blue monkeys

529
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,480
to a group of blue monkeys to look at their response.

530
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,960
And then every other species in the forest would start responding.

531
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,200
It would just throw everything off.

532
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,000
It was really interesting, but I wasn't looking at their responses.

533
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,240
I mean, animals are going to live or die by the information they can take in.

534
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,160
I mean, the way animals have to learn what to eat.

535
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,920
I mean, they're going to learn fast.

536
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,840
And whether it's learned or somehow there's some hardwiring that it's been selected for.

537
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:44,480
I mean, you've got to figure out what information, you know, what the contingencies are basically.

538
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,320
And I think one of the things that was very compelling about some of the work we heard

539
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,880
in vervet monkeys was something called the audience effect.

540
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,600
Where, you know, you might argue, well, the vervet is hardwired or she's hardwired.

541
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,880
There's a martial eagle up there and it's going to just do this emotive call because

542
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,400
first people thought it was just these were just emotive react responses.

543
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,240
They weren't what's actually they didn't call them referentical.

544
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,960
They called them semantic signals, meaningful signals.

545
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,200
So they weren't fixed action patterns at least, right?

546
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Right.

547
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Right.

548
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
So yeah, exactly.

549
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,880
And there was some control, which is a big thing to think about that animals can control

550
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,480
what they're doing.

551
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,200
And so the vervets, if it's an ice, if it's a single vervet and that martial eagle is there,

552
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,840
that snake is there, they don't call.

553
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,560
They only call it there's an audience if there are other vervets around.

554
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,880
So that's interesting and very important when you think about it.

555
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,640
But it could just be that they're only aroused to that level when there are other individuals

556
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
around too.

557
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,760
I mean, you can always send, I mean, it's Morgan's canon, right?

558
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,200
You can always sort of up your cats.

559
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Yeah.

560
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
What about the cute?

561
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,720
Well, some of their alarm calling their sentinels and they stand up and they have jobs and they,

562
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
you know.

563
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Right.

564
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:02,000
I think I recently sat in a room full of people who looked at animal communication from a psychological

565
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,480
perspective.

566
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,240
And I sat there and discussed my work from an evolutionary perspective.

567
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,480
And there was a lot of confusion.

568
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
But we worked it all out.

569
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,520
But I think that that's one of the things that from an evolutionary perspective, we

570
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,920
look so much at is this behavioral pattern or is this trait adaptive in any way.

571
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,320
And the mechanism by which it becomes adaptive isn't necessarily part of the equation in

572
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,760
terms of is it adaptive.

573
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:41,080
And I personally, when I read some of the literature, I see a lot of people wanting to make cognitive,

574
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,200
draw cognitive conclusions based on behavior.

575
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,800
And so when that, and I think that was, I mean to their credit, Cyfarth and Chaney actually,

576
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,680
you know, pulled back and the whole functionally referential took over for semantic.

577
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,760
But the very first thing anyone thought when they said, oh, they use a different call for

578
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,200
eagle and snake.

579
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,880
And the animals respond as if there's an eagle or a snake when they hear that call in the

580
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,840
absence of the predator.

581
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,560
We immediately went to a linguistic cognitive explanation.

582
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:16,560
And I think what James was alluding to is that there are so many more parsimonious evolutionary

583
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,000
explanations that don't demand that degree of cognitive awareness.

584
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,320
It's not saying that they aren't there.

585
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,680
And I think people have heard me say things like this, suggesting, well, there is no

586
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,680
animal.

587
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,880
Absolutely not.

588
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,440
I just don't think we've necessarily proved it simply by seeing, when an animal does

589
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:39,960
something, we can't necessarily assign the same mental state that we would have when

590
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,360
we did the same behavior.

591
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,520
We just say they did it and we'll have to try to figure out what they're thinking.

592
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,120
Have any of you ever watched hunting spiders?

593
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
Mm-hmm.

594
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,040
Like Porsche or something like Porsche?

595
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,400
You watch this animal which you typically would want to step on.

596
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Watch it hunt.

597
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,360
So these are animals that actually hunt other spiders.

598
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:05,600
When you look at what their actions are and they're basically figuring out where from

599
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,720
what position they're going to jump onto their prey, how they're going to do it, and

600
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,680
you watch them and you're going, wait a minute.

601
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,000
They use acoustic camouflage.

602
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,120
They'll wait till there's wind blowing and it'll shake the web of their prey so that

603
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,040
the prey can't necessarily detect them on the web.

604
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,840
And you're going, this is a spider.

605
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Is a spider thinking?

606
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
Right.

607
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,600
It's the same with, I mean, some of the most complicated communication at all occurs in

608
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
the social insights.

609
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
Yeah, bee dances.

610
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,640
The honeybee wiggle dances are phenomenally complex where depending on how they, when

611
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:47,640
the honeybee gets back to the nest after finding a food source, depending on how they dance

612
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,840
in the nest, the angle and for how long it tells exactly the distance, the angle you

613
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,760
should fly with respect to the sun and for how.

614
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,520
So do we agree that that's language?

615
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Absolutely.

616
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
You do?

617
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,520
I don't.

618
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,480
And one reason I will say it's fundamentally different.

619
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,240
Well, again, I would just want for the record, we still have not defined language.

620
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,880
So I can say it's not language, but I won't tell you what I think language is.

621
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:18,400
But one of the big differences is that you can raise a bee in isolation or novice bee,

622
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,640
a juvenile bee that reaches maturity and stick it in with the hive and it will do the dance

623
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,640
the same way as its fellows.

624
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Not right away.

625
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
Are you sure?

626
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,640
All right.

627
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,880
I will bow to your experience then.

628
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,880
My reading of it was that they were...

629
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,880
You know that bees go through a whole series of changes in their lives to adapt to different

630
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,880
roles in the hive?

631
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
No, absolutely.

632
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,160
There's take any old bee and stick it in there and it's going to do what you want it

633
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
to do.

634
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
True.

635
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,760
My reading of it was that novice bees were still capable of both interpreting and producing

636
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,400
the correct waggle dance, the correct nectar dance.

637
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,240
They've been put into the right state of mind.

638
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
But whereas...

639
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
I'm challenging.

640
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,240
Bring it.

641
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,880
But there's no...

642
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,160
But I'm not aware of any human that has ever been raised in isolation that no matter what

643
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,600
his state of mind could ever start speaking a language that they had not been taught.

644
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
So the...

645
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,760
And this goes back to your friend Nom Chomsky.

646
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,360
I mean, the capacity for language is very different from the language.

647
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,920
I might wrap you up to the bee hive.

648
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,920
You wouldn't do too well.

649
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,120
You would do a very poor job of...

650
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,120
At most things, actually.

651
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,120
Yes.

652
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:36,080
But I think one of the things that really distinguishes at least my view of language

653
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:47,000
versus inherent or involved or inherited communication modalities of communication is that language...

654
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,200
Not language the capacity, but language the...

655
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,000
Is there another word?

656
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,120
What would we call French, an example of a language rather than language capacity?

657
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,200
Well, language in the field I'm in is very specific, defined thing.

658
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,360
And all these concepts of meaning play no role.

659
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,360
Right.

660
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
All these concepts are what?

661
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Meaning.

662
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,760
There's no particular reason to assume it has meaning.

663
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,360
But it happens to when we use it.

664
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:15,160
But in the theory of Chomsky, that communication is a secondary role for language.

665
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,760
And in fact, what it is, it's a series.

666
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:23,040
It's just a very complicated series of strings of symbols that people recognize and they

667
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,520
know some of them are good and some of them are bad.

668
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,640
You know, when you stop to think about what a person knows, these are standard examples.

669
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,440
If you went to a major library in New York City and opened up any book, I don't care

670
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,000
what it is, and put your finger on a page and took that sentence and wrote it down, how

671
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,880
many more books in the library would you have to read till you came to that very same sentence

672
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
again?

673
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,960
And the answer is, it's not in any other book.

674
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,600
If it's 20 words long, it's not in any other book.

675
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:58,120
Now where in the world is there anything that human beings can do that they can immediately

676
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:04,360
recognize a 20 word sentence and tell you whether it's grammatical English or not when

677
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,720
there's a bazillion trillion gadillion of them?

678
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,880
And the thing is it's a very odd capacity.

679
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,720
It's probably related to the concepts of numbers.

680
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,760
And it turns out every human being is a prodigy for that particular kind of symbolic logic.

681
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:25,000
But the people that are particularly good at this unfortunately tend not to be articulate.

682
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,640
And in particular Alan Turing and people, you know, it's very difficult to understand what

683
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,640
they have.

684
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,920
But it is very odd to see that human beings have this odd ability all around the world

685
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
with no particular instruction.

686
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:44,160
Look, suppose I say, I don't want to give you too many linguistic things, but suppose

687
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,880
I say he is tall, he is not tall, he isn't tall.

688
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,160
And I can say, you are tall, you are not tall, you aren't tall.

689
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,200
And I can say, I am tall, I am not tall, I am not tall.

690
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,480
Now none of you is going to go home and say, well, he's a professor and he said ampeh.

691
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,360
So I'm going to start saying, I am tall.

692
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,680
It's not going to work.

693
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,760
Ampeh became ain't in English.

694
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,760
Why?

695
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,400
Nobody has any idea.

696
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,520
But why don't people use ampeh?

697
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,960
Nothing wrong with it.

698
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,680
And why did they pick up ain't?

699
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,880
And then once they picked up I ain't, they would say you ain't and he ain't and they

700
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,160
put it everywhere.

701
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,600
And then in some dialects you can say, I have not a book, you can say I ain't a book.

702
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,560
So it moved from to be to have.

703
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,840
There's very strange generalities.

704
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:33,080
If you take the word himself, John saw himself.

705
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,080
Everybody knows what it means.

706
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,240
Shakespeare never used any reflexives.

707
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,760
This came in in 1600.

708
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,760
You can date it precisely.

709
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,400
But then you said she likes herself and two dialects came off.

710
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,760
One said, I like myself and the other one, I like me self.

711
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,760
See since himself was the first one, you don't say his self, circularly.

712
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,240
Well you should say, I like me self, but you don't.

713
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,240
Why?

714
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
I don't know.

715
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,240
It's just strange.

716
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,080
There was nobody saying you should say this and not say this.

717
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,180
There were huge, I mean in the United States there were huge arguments as to whose dictionary

718
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,160
was the best dictionary.

719
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,440
And the Miriam Webster won because he gave a free copy to every editor of every newspaper

720
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
in the United States.

721
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
That's actually not it.

722
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,520
And nothing to do with academia.

723
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,720
And the other went to Columbia, didn't give anything away so nobody uses the Columbia spellings

724
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,720
or anything.

725
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,720
They all think it's weird.

726
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,720
I mean, it's not a spell.

727
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,480
They didn't know how to make money, that's what they do.

728
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,520
But it's a funny sort of thing.

729
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,520
But language is a very formal kind of thing when you stop to think of what you know.

730
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,400
If I gave you a big long sentence, everybody could correct it and everybody has razor-sharp

731
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,200
intuitions about these things.

732
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,360
And take a word like eke out.

733
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,680
I can say I have a student that just barely ekes out of living and I can't say, but he's

734
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,680
been ekeing for years.

735
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,720
He's eke for 30 years and now he's trying to work it out.

736
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,520
Now how in the world do you know that you can't say eke?

737
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,120
You can say eke out.

738
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,280
Your mother didn't tell you, come on.

739
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,920
Nobody said always say eke out, kids, if you're saying eke.

740
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
It's just something.

741
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,200
It's some pattern to English that has nothing to do with that sound, right?

742
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,200
I'm right.

743
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,200
You're saying that somehow there's inherent rejection of the phonetic...

744
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,520
Yes, inherent pattern to English.

745
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,520
We don't know what it is.

746
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,520
It's not acceptable.

747
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:21,440
So if you raised someone in a cage in Borneo and taught them this, but then they'd never

748
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
heard the word eke.

749
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,440
And if they heard ekeing, they would say...

750
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,960
Well, the good problem with teaching the eke, man, it's up to gels.

751
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,960
But take the...

752
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,200
Go back to the one that's really hard, the amped.

753
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,200
No, I don't think.

754
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,800
If I used amped and told everybody it'd be a dollar if you use it too, it's not going

755
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,800
to catch on.

756
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
Well, not now because it's not socially acceptable.

757
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,120
That's not as much more than it's not socially acceptable.

758
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,120
It's not a pattern.

759
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,480
You've got to remember you sent the syntax.

760
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,320
It's some syntactic pattern.

761
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,000
Look, I'm not tall.

762
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,920
And I can say, I am...

763
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:56,840
You aren't tall and you're not tall, but I can't say you're tall and do a double contraction.

764
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,200
I bet you could say that if that became socially acceptable, it'd be fine.

765
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,360
You do that all the time.

766
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,360
We develop new...

767
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,360
Look at rap.

768
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,360
I'm from North Carolina.

769
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,360
You should hear what I'm talking about.

770
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,400
You could make up anything you want and sell people that you're going to have to use it.

771
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
But you think language is deterministic?

772
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,000
Well, I think it's like mathematics.

773
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,160
I think nobody's going to come up and tell me there's a new integer between three and

774
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,640
four and nobody's ever seen before.

775
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,360
It's not going to happen.

776
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,520
And language is very much like that.

777
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,760
I think I'm not sure that I fully agree with you, but I do think there are rhythms in...

778
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,480
I mean, human language has this bimodal rhythm.

779
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:38,280
This bimodal rhythm and all human languages have a rhythm of between three and eight hertz,

780
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,280
which is the...

781
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,280
The...

782
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,280
The...

783
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,280
The...

784
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,280
The...

785
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,280
The...

786
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,280
The...

787
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,280
The...

788
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,280
The...

789
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,280
The...

790
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,280
The...

791
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,280
The...

792
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,280
The...

793
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,280
The...

794
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,280
The...

795
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,280
The...

796
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,280
The...

797
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,280
The...

798
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,640
That's very, very unique like nonhuman primates don't show that bimodal rhythm in any type

799
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,640
of...

800
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,640
So that doesn't mean that they can...

801
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,640
In your language?

802
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,640
Right.

803
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,640
No, no.

804
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,640
But I'm...

805
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,360
I'm just saying that whether I agree with that or not, I do agree that there are rhythms

806
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
to human...

807
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,360
Oh, yeah.

808
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,360
It's a human.

809
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,360
It's a human...

810
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,360
Well, there's a...

811
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,360
There's a Macaque study.

812
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,300
So since you shot down my v-argument, I'll bring up Macaque study and hopefully you haven't

813
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,460
read that too.

814
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,320
You're down to challenge that...

815
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,800
There was a Macaque study that...

816
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,760
that I'm one of those people who really get very uncomfortable

817
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,960
when people start talking about captive studies,

818
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,440
because I do all field work.

819
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,240
But I'm really glad that the information is available to us.

820
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,160
But they raised macaques in captivity

821
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,600
without ever, I think they took them from their birth mother

822
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,040
at one hour old.

823
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,640
And they were never exposed to the vocalizations

824
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,640
of their own species.

825
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,400
And by adulthood, they had developed the entire,

826
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,880
we already discussed, repertoire, whether or not

827
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,480
it was a real thing.

828
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,760
But they had developed the entire vocalizations

829
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,120
and used all the vocal signals.

830
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,960
I'm not sure if they tested whether or not

831
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,400
they used them in appropriate context.

832
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,720
But they used them all.

833
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,560
And again, to go back to your friend

834
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,000
in Borneo in the cage, there's no human that

835
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,440
could ever develop any of the known living languages

836
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,120
without ever being exposed to them.

837
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,560
They are fundamentally different things.

838
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,520
But I think where things get interesting is that.

839
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,600
Try birds.

840
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,880
Well, Ocines.

841
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,960
There are different taxa that show different degrees

842
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,040
of learned versus not learned and having these windows

843
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,040
and all these different things.

844
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,120
But I think one of the things that's really interesting

845
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:37,680
is that my understanding, which is extremely limited

846
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,400
about human linguistics, is that, and this may be

847
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,400
a horrible simplification, is that language, the spoken

848
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,800
language, or the written language,

849
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,240
or any sort of symbolic language that we use as a species,

850
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,840
reflects our cognition.

851
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,760
We have this inherent, maybe it's not inherent,

852
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,680
but we have thoughts in our head for one of a better term.

853
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,680
And then language is a way we use to express that.

854
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,520
And I think that as a result, when

855
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,400
we look at non-humans when they vocalize or gesture

856
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,840
or any other way, we assume that there

857
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,880
must be something similar going on.

858
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,200
And I don't know if that's true or not.

859
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,800
I don't have an opinion that's not.

860
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,080
But I think Diana does.

861
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,080
I think I do.

862
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,800
I want to jump in here.

863
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,720
Because this is one of my favorite subjects right now.

864
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,760
Because, again, you go back to ancient times.

865
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,880
And the idea was that language and speech

866
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,720
was inextricably linked.

867
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,360
Ratio and ratio is what they talked about.

868
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,960
And that because we thought that no other animals

869
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,760
were communicating, or they didn't do anything

870
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,840
that we could recognize as anything like our speech,

871
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,440
even though birds are singing and dolphins are doing things

872
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,680
and bees are doing it, we didn't know enough about that.

873
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,080
We made the assumption, and it's continued to be an assumption

874
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,960
that other species are devoid of thought.

875
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,120
So I think one of the things that's really important

876
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,800
to realize is that the brains of most animals

877
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,240
are composed of the same building blocks.

878
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,680
There's nothing that different about it.

879
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,760
The organization may be really different

880
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,800
than the number of neurons, even the cell bodies,

881
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,800
may be different sizes.

882
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,320
Elephants and dolphins actually have bigger neuronal bodies

883
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,040
than do many other animals.

884
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,600
And we don't really know very much about even our brains now.

885
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,280
But we've tended to make this assumption.

886
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,640
It's almost like a religious or cosmological assumption

887
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,880
that we are different from the rest of the animal world.

888
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,640
We're at the top of the pinnacle, and everybody's below us.

889
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,280
And nobody else is thinking, we're

890
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,120
the only ones who think we're the only ones who

891
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,320
communicate using language.

892
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,200
And language, the word language, comes from the tongue.

893
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:41,760
We have a tongue.

894
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,760
We think about speech more than any other body language,

895
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,400
as we said before.

896
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,480
And as we're finding more and more

897
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,120
details, as we're discovering more details

898
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,800
about other animal systems, we see that there

899
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,400
is more going on than we ever thought before,

900
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,400
behaviorally, acoustically, in terms of sensory systems.

901
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,680
And I just think we're kind of pompous at assuming

902
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,560
that nobody else is out there thinking.

903
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,360
The question used to be, do other animals think?

904
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,120
And I think the question has shifted.

905
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,240
And I think it's no longer a question do they think.

906
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,320
It's how do they think?

907
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,000
How do they think?

908
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah.

909
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,440
Or how do they communicate?

910
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,720
One thing on that.

911
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,400
Most of the, I mean, I've worked in a lot of this stuff

912
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,800
long before I got into linguistics.

913
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,320
And most of the people that worked with chimpanzees

914
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,840
and things treated them very nicely.

915
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,480
The Georgia Institute of Technology one time decided

916
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,280
they would put a monkey in an overwhelmingly

917
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,840
deprived situation.

918
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,320
And instead of giving it a banana, if it got the right answer,

919
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,880
it would loosen the cage or open a window

920
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,680
or let it breathe a little bit.

921
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,440
And they tried, like crazy, to teach

922
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,800
the animal what's called grammatical relations.

923
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,360
No animal, apparently, can differentiate.

924
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,280
John touched Mary from Mary touched John.

925
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,400
This is also across the board in all web browsers.

926
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,800
You could be rich if you could figure out a way for a web

927
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,240
browser to do what's called thematic relations.

928
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,600
And you can't.

929
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,600
You can do it for trivial cases, but it doesn't work in most

930
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,960
in all cases.

931
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,720
And so what happens is they were never

932
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,200
able to teach an animal to differentiate John

933
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,440
kissed Mary from Mary kissed John.

934
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,960
And they did it by having a, Mary was a triangle and John

935
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,320
was a square or something.

936
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,360
And they would try to get it so that they would put the things

937
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:24,840
up.

938
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,840
Now some animals could learn verbs,

939
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,640
like chimpanzees could learn verbs,

940
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,560
like kiss, touch, and things like that.

941
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,520
Most animals can't learn a sign for verb for a verb.

942
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,840
But every child in the world, immediately,

943
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,720
from the time they're born, knows it's not his fault.

944
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,880
And it's somebody else's fault.

945
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,840
And they use grammatical relations all the time.

946
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,040
He hit me.

947
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,760
I didn't hit him.

948
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,000
He hit me first.

949
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,640
And the thing is, no animal, even with all the attempts

950
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,680
they do to teach them grammatical relations,

951
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,000
it doesn't work.

952
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,440
And this is a huge thing right now,

953
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,840
because I don't know if this is true,

954
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,120
but it seems to be the entire web is going to be English.

955
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,320
And they're going to have, when you put a question in in

956
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,040
Spanish, it'll translate it into English and answer it.

957
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,440
But in English, if you say, John took Mary the book.

958
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,680
Mary has the book.

959
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,280
But in German, if you say, Johann Haakmaritas Booked

960
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,920
in Omen, it means he took it away from her.

961
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,400
So now, when you're doing translations from one language

962
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,040
to another, you have to know all the grammatical relations

963
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,360
in all of these languages.

964
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,360
She gets to be very passionate.

965
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,720
They have to challenge you on that one.

966
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,720
Yeah.

967
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,520
It's important for the other.

968
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,000
Thinking about this idea of translation,

969
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,160
and then in school, are you not a writer?

970
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,040
And then, what you did was you decided

971
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,360
to then multiply the English system work

972
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,240
to study the language that was traditionally

973
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,280
the model language of from my culture,

974
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,280
the language that they were drawn to by my parents.

975
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,280
Yeah.

976
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,120
Speak that language, learn about the language at the top.

977
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,980
So at the age of six people, I said,

978
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,440
well, let me see what that level one was just to say.

979
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,240
And it was a word.

980
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,480
I thought that I would go to English, these are two completely

981
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,520
different concepts.

982
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,840
But in that language, this model language of mine

983
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,840
is the same word.

984
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,480
What is that word?

985
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,000
Pray and rest it.

986
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,040
So I said, oh, so that's what they're doing when they're

987
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,960
crying.

988
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:22,320
And the idea of the passive resting,

989
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,520
and I said, it wasn't really active.

990
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,320
If I tell them, go out on the other hand,

991
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,720
get something done, I'd go to that.

992
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,640
And then this breakthrough in terms

993
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,040
of understanding my culture.

994
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,520
And the activity and the identity

995
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,480
help things get done.

996
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,920
And to me, as a writer, I'm interested

997
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,140
in the organization of my thoughts

998
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,120
and how, what's that next word?

999
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,240
What's that next word?

1000
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,080
What's that next thing that we're writing?

1001
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,800
That the most exciting thing that we're writing is

1002
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,320
the next question.

1003
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,200
It's the most important one.

1004
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,720
The most important thing is the most

1005
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,640
important kind of direction.

1006
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,640
But what's interesting is, here now, looking at the language,

1007
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,320
the mother of the tongue is now giving ideas

1008
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,240
that are seen to be very contradictory,

1009
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,680
resting and praying.

1010
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,160
But it's a wonderful, kind of great thing to me as a writer

1011
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,440
to start looking at other languages.

1012
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,960
But who is about where you go?

1013
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,800
Well, each language has its own little city of synchronies

1014
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,840
to be much more mundane than prayer and resting.

1015
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:31,880
But suppose you want to ask, we're interested in painting something.

1016
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,920
We're interested in painting a wall.

1017
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,560
The web browsers will soon have dialogues with you

1018
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,320
rather than tell you.

1019
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,160
So if I said I want to paint a wall,

1020
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,840
I suppose I could go into a paint store here

1021
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,200
and they'd give me wall paint.

1022
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,640
But if in German, the word for von,

1023
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,040
here that's a von and a mower is outside of the house.

1024
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,480
But the word wall in English is both of them.

1025
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,240
So it could very well be, if I'm dealing with some German guy,

1026
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,280
he'd say, is the wall inside the house or outside the house?

1027
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,480
Which is not something he might ask me down here

1028
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,920
because he'd give me a different paint,

1029
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,120
but it doesn't make any sense to ask, I want to paint a wall.

1030
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,520
And there's words in different languages

1031
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,000
that they'd have to ask you a lot of context.

1032
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,520
I mean, the farthest out one I know of,

1033
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,400
some American Indian languages,

1034
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,760
most languages make a difference between I, you and me

1035
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,240
and the singular and the plural.

1036
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,400
But some American Indian languages make a difference

1037
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,320
to whether you're standing up or sitting down

1038
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,640
when you talk to me.

1039
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,960
And that's because the chiefs,

1040
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,000
I don't know what it's all about,

1041
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,840
were something like this.

1042
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,200
The chiefs never ate until everybody else ate.

1043
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,520
And so if I'm standing up and talking to you,

1044
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,400
that means I'm higher than you in the social order.

1045
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,080
And so I can imagine somebody would say,

1046
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,280
John said to Mary, what time is it?

1047
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,880
The guy'd say, was John standing up?

1048
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,200
What was Mary standing up or sitting down?

1049
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,200
And this is going to happen to you in the future

1050
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,520
as Google tries to get data out of other kinds of things

1051
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,160
because in some, we have a student from a,

1052
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,640
I won't mention the culture,

1053
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,840
but it's a culture where he cannot come in and just say,

1054
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,720
Ray, would you please sign this?

1055
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,840
He has to say, how's your wife?

1056
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,680
How's your dog?

1057
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,560
How's your child?

1058
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,160
How, what are you going to do later?

1059
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,520
And I say, what do you want?

1060
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,440
But they have to ask all these questions about your family

1061
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,080
before you can get down to things.

1062
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,960
And it's very interesting because that's a cultural thing.

1063
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,800
It's learned.

1064
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,840
That's certainly learned, I should think.

1065
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,680
Ray just said something, though.

1066
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,680
I just want to set a record straight here

1067
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,400
because I don't think that this idea

1068
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,880
that no other animal can learn anything grammatical

1069
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,120
through training, they may not use grammatical structures.

1070
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,320
We don't know enough to say they do where they don't.

1071
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,240
But the study I think you're referring to

1072
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,280
was by Dwayne Rumbaugh, one glosser filed,

1073
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,600
and Gil, is that the one?

1074
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,240
He'll be mentored, so long as I'm doing it.

1075
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,560
Yeah, and that, as the study actually I'm pretty familiar with.

1076
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,280
And what they did is they took a chimpanzee named Lana

1077
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,200
and they trained her to use an interactive computer system.

1078
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,360
And she was trained to order,

1079
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,040
to either accept or not accept grammatical sentences.

1080
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,920
And they were either grammatical

1081
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,480
or non grammatical, she actually could do it.

1082
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,480
That's black, she came up with it.

1083
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,600
Yeah, it's lexigrams, and she actually did it.

1084
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,960
She was trained to do it and to reject non grammatical.

1085
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,360
It was a science paper.

1086
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,880
And then she actually used it in some novel ways

1087
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,680
to manipulate and get one of the trainers

1088
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,480
into this very sterile environment

1089
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,120
that you described as extremely sterile.

1090
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:10,200
And then years later, Lou Herman out the University of Hawaii,

1091
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,040
and again, it was a fairly rigid system,

1092
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,560
but he actually trained dolphins using food

1093
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,200
to respond to a set of rules.

1094
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:25,720
And they were take hoop to window or take ball to hoop.

1095
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,680
And they had to do the correct behavior.

1096
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,600
So animals can be trained to do it.

1097
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,040
We don't know if they do that in their own forms,

1098
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,920
but they have that capacity.

1099
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,280
So I think, I don't think it's completely accurate

1100
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,960
to say that no other animal shows it.

1101
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,600
And then the other point I just want to make,

1102
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,560
since we're talking about animal communication,

1103
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:45,440
and language is that we used Chomsky and others

1104
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,880
have argued that we have these special syntactic structures,

1105
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,560
some module in our brain, and that propels us

1106
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,680
to learn language with very little effort,

1107
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,000
and that no other animals do it.

1108
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,280
So if you're a human, very young children

1109
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,600
can distinguish between paw and paw and paw,

1110
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,720
and well, that was evidence that we

1111
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,000
have these special structures.

1112
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,160
But guess what?

1113
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,760
Other animals do the same thing.

1114
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,880
You can play birds, and you can play gerbils,

1115
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,440
and other animals, paw, paw and paw.

1116
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,160
And they can distinguish those sounds too.

1117
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,520
So the view has moved, I think, in my world, at least,

1118
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,760
what I've learned, that we certainly

1119
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,880
have varniki and broca's area in the brain

1120
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,640
for production and comprehension.

1121
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,040
But this idea of processing sounds

1122
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,160
that happen to be language sounds

1123
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,800
may be much more due to general mechanisms

1124
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,160
for acoustic perception.

1125
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,120
But they're also very speechless.

1126
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,320
And a lot of the studies, if you did the reverse of that,

1127
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:45,560
I always have a quizzical opinion of tests

1128
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:50,560
of non-human animal cognition when they give them animal tests.

1129
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,280
Because I saw the study where they had this puzzle,

1130
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,520
and they got a four-year-old human girl,

1131
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,720
and they said, how long will it take her to do the puzzle?

1132
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,760
And she figured out the puzzle, and she got the treat out of it.

1133
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,480
And then they got a bunch of chimpanzees through,

1134
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,880
and eventually they did that.

1135
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,480
And they said, ah-ha, we figured out

1136
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,640
that chimpanzees are about as intelligent as a four-year-old

1137
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,480
human girl.

1138
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,360
And I said, stick that four-year-old human girl out

1139
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,040
in the forest and see how intelligent she looks

1140
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,640
in a chimpanzee context.

1141
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,720
And I think that's, so for example,

1142
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,360
we've done the same studies with non-human primates

1143
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,120
in terms of their ability to distinguish

1144
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:27,360
what are acoustically, practically identical.

1145
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,920
Green did a study on the cacks where he kept seeing

1146
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,200
these different responses to what he thought was the same call.

1147
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,360
And then using spectrographic analysis,

1148
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,800
he found that there was this minute difference

1149
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,160
that we couldn't perceive acoustically,

1150
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,520
but that the macaques were responding to categorically.

1151
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:48,360
And so in the same way that people, even among humans,

1152
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,360
people have a heart that lived in Thailand for a while,

1153
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,960
and people, it's tonal language.

1154
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,720
And I never could understand the difference,

1155
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,440
but to them it was very categorical.

1156
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,600
We're in the same species.

1157
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:02,920
So imagine the differences, how each species is genetically

1158
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,200
and physiologically tuned to the specificity

1159
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,880
of their own communication system.

1160
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,000
And when tests are fairer and more appropriate,

1161
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,320
they typically do much better.

1162
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:19,360
So there was a whole host of studies in research monkeys

1163
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,960
that looked at pointing as a gesture,

1164
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,440
where the human observer pointed towards something,

1165
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:29,320
and then they tried to see whether the research monkey would

1166
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:33,160
look, was capable of following the attention

1167
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,920
of another individual.

1168
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,520
And they didn't get any results, of course.

1169
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,160
But of course, research macaques don't point with their arms.

1170
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,880
And actually when they started doing it with gaze and with heads

1171
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,800
and things, then they started to do much, much better.

1172
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,800
Because they are actually interested

1173
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,560
in where other research macaques are looking.

1174
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:54,160
But of course, it's not a very fair test to show how they point.

1175
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,080
Just to come back to your point on the brain mechanisms

1176
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,040
of some of these things, I think I broadly agree

1177
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,520
that a lot of the central structures are the same.

1178
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,640
There are some of the, and this comes back

1179
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:09,600
to what you were just saying before, some of the properties

1180
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,800
of human language that we do understand,

1181
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,960
like the bi-modal rhythm and stuff.

1182
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,320
We do understand kind of the mechanisms

1183
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,640
that that's a coupled oscillation between neurons

1184
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,280
and the brain line.

1185
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,440
And that's pretty much a unique human thing

1186
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,600
as far as you're aware of which.

1187
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:30,880
And that gives human language that unique rhythm cognitively.

1188
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,680
I'd like to come back to what you said.

1189
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,880
Yeah, you said the poor monkeys in the cages,

1190
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,800
but they weren't feeding them very well.

1191
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,200
And they had to do with a minimal thing

1192
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,760
to even get some water.

1193
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,280
It wasn't that they just did grammatical sentences.

1194
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,840
They were trying to teach them the difference

1195
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,600
between John Kist, Mary, and Mary Kist John.

1196
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,440
But in children, very young ones, even,

1197
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,280
that extends far beyond that.

1198
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,880
For instance, suppose there was a big ink stain on the floor

1199
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,200
and somebody comes in and says, who put it there?

1200
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,280
I can't say I confess he did it.

1201
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,600
I can say, it doesn't make any sense.

1202
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,760
I can say I confess I did it.

1203
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,400
I can accuse him.

1204
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,440
I can say I confess he did it.

1205
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,760
But now suppose it's in my class and the dean

1206
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,360
comes in and says, professor, who put that ink stain?

1207
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,000
I can say I confess it was one of my students.

1208
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,880
Then I can point to him.

1209
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,680
Now suppose the president of the college comes in.

1210
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,440
And he says, who put that ink stain there?

1211
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,200
I can say I confess the dean did it.

1212
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,120
See, as long as there's a hierarchy of people,

1213
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,960
you can confess for all sorts of people

1214
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,120
if you're vaguely related to them.

1215
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,040
Now take something else.

1216
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,000
Suppose I walk out of the building here

1217
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,240
and some woman comes up and says,

1218
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,040
I just want to van Klyburne competition and piano.

1219
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,520
I can't say I'm very proud of you

1220
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,960
because I don't have anything to do with it.

1221
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,720
Now if she had been one of my students years ago

1222
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,400
and I'd say, oh, why don't you pick up the piano?

1223
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,080
Linguistics is dead.

1224
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,040
And she went to the piano.

1225
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,720
Then I can say I'm very proud of you.

1226
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,000
But I can't be proud of somebody.

1227
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,120
I don't even know who they are.

1228
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,600
And I can't confess for a large number of people.

1229
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,560
But in every, I don't know if this is true,

1230
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,800
but we tried it out on dozens of languages.

1231
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,200
The word confess is the same in every language of the world.

1232
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,040
That's what it tells you.

1233
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,760
There's something about who did it.

1234
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,080
And the other thing is there's a word for blame

1235
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,480
because the concept of agency to a child

1236
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,200
is supposed to be your kid and you still live on the floor.

1237
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,400
You said, who did it?

1238
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,360
The kid will say, I did it, but he made me do it.

1239
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,080
So it's not his fault.

1240
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,600
It's transference of agency or something.

1241
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,760
But very concrete.

1242
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,440
This is after a certain age, up to their three or four,

1243
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,480
they're not even capable of having

1244
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,560
very mental states at all.

1245
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,240
Yeah, it's a belief test.

1246
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,720
But it's one of the very first things

1247
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,840
that's emergent in an intelligent brain.

1248
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,600
And it's not in any computer.

1249
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,600
You can't program this.

1250
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,920
It's impossible to even think of how you program it.

1251
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,280
And it doesn't seem to happen in any animals.

1252
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,960
We don't know what's happening in the brains

1253
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,720
of other animals, though, because we have no way to know.

1254
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,520
Yes, it's like bugs.

1255
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,200
What can do is observe behavior.

1256
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,840
So you can look at some of the work that Franz Zivall

1257
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:03,160
has done with primates and look at this idea of inequity

1258
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,840
and think about what's fair.

1259
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:08,120
I mean, you can do two tasks.

1260
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:12,840
And if Chris has those two tasks,

1261
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,640
and he gives you a cappuccino for doing that.

1262
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,040
And I get that crappy glass of water.

1263
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,480
I'm going to be pretty ticked off

1264
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,360
that I didn't get the cappuccino.

1265
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,800
And you can see primates will also feel that way.

1266
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,880
So the Great Apes will.

1267
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,840
The monkeys may not, but the Great Will Monkeys do as well.

1268
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,120
So they have a sense of inequity.

1269
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,040
They're animals that seem to show empathy.

1270
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,280
They don't talk about it like we do in a way

1271
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,200
that we can understand.

1272
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,600
Maybe they do communicate it some ways,

1273
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,040
but we don't understand that it gets us to the point of us

1274
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,520
being blind and deaf to what these other animals are doing.

1275
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,960
Because we can talk all about what we're doing here

1276
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,800
is we're still talking about human language.

1277
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,120
We understand human language.

1278
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,120
We're humans.

1279
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,280
We're talking about animal community, other animal systems.

1280
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,720
What do we really know about those systems

1281
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,480
when we can decode them?

1282
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,520
And I think that's why putting in an adaptive framework

1283
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,000
is a good place to start.

1284
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,840
Even if the ultimate objective is to understand cognition,

1285
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,400
understand the way of thinking, I think

1286
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,320
putting in an adaptive framework first

1287
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,720
sort of levels the field.

1288
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,040
Because again, to go back to that poor little girl

1289
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,040
that I wanted to throw in the forest with the chimpanzees

1290
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:23,800
to prove that that intelligence equation wasn't appropriate

1291
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:28,960
is that animals evolve within the social and ecological context

1292
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,720
of their species, or sorry, species

1293
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,760
of all within their ecological and social niches.

1294
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:39,240
And so if a particular trait wasn't beneficial

1295
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,920
or wasn't adaptive, we have this sort of hierarchy.

1296
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,240
I think humans have this sort of sense of, well,

1297
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,400
we say words like intelligence in where humans have superior

1298
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,160
or inferior intelligence.

1299
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,480
And I just think we have species that

1300
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,000
have adapted appropriate strategies

1301
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,120
for dealing with their ecosystems and their social context.

1302
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:03,040
And if language or the ability to communicate

1303
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:06,840
through complex and tactical structures

1304
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:11,560
was never necessitated or was never selected for,

1305
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,960
we would likely see its absence.

1306
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,520
And I think one of the things, just because I'm

1307
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,080
talking about keep going.

1308
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,960
One of the things I noticed that we haven't mentioned

1309
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,880
is that when we tend to distinguish

1310
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,120
between human communication and we call it

1311
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,800
and we say language, and non-human communication,

1312
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,480
which we, you know, vocalization, whatever.

1313
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,440
But what about crying and screaming and laughing

1314
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,320
and smiling and all the innate blushing?

1315
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:34,760
That's true.

1316
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,280
It's right up James's alley.

1317
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,960
He studies coloration in his face.

1318
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,560
It's not that he blushes his life.

1319
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,160
He might blushing.

1320
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:41,760
Now he's blushing.

1321
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,120
He's blushing.

1322
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,120
Yeah.

1323
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,400
But a lot of communication, but no words.

1324
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:46,900
Right.

1325
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,320
There's an enormous amount of what

1326
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:56,000
I consider non-linguistic communication evolved

1327
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,960
inherited traits in terms of human communication that

1328
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:04,080
is utterly outside of the scope of linguistics and language.

1329
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,680
And when I look at non-human communication systems,

1330
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,480
they tend to appear to me a lot more similar to things

1331
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,640
like laughing and crying and screaming

1332
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,080
and smiling and blushing.

1333
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,280
Then they do to Shakespeare.

1334
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,000
So you said something before that made an assumption

1335
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,480
about why we're sitting here and that

1336
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,680
was they were interested in cognition?

1337
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,040
I thought because Beth and I did us.

1338
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,080
But I thought we were talking about animal communication.

1339
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,360
Well, and actually, it's, well, I think that's,

1340
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,600
and maybe I'm creating a strong man here,

1341
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,480
but I think that a lot of the communication literature

1342
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,240
that I've read and I tend to be very

1343
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,440
focused on communication from an evolutionary perspective.

1344
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:50,720
I think there is a tendency to inappropriately and often

1345
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:56,920
unintentionally conflate a cognitive mechanism for a major

1346
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,000
or evolutionary explanation.

1347
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,400
But I think it's, so I think that that happens a lot.

1348
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,720
But I think another thing that happens

1349
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,880
is that people who are interested in cognition

1350
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,960
look at communication.

1351
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:14,040
So in the same way that humans infer the cognition of fellow

1352
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,960
humans based on self-reporting.

1353
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,600
So we use communication to understand

1354
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,440
what one another is thinking.

1355
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,360
I think part of it's a terminology problem

1356
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:25,080
because people in animal communication

1357
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,120
talk about signalism receivers.

1358
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,440
So you have some sort of signal or sender.

1359
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:30,560
Senders and receivers.

1360
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,960
You have a sender and a receiver.

1361
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,280
And you communicate between the sender of receiver

1362
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,720
and then the receiver somehow changes their behavior.

1363
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,920
So as soon as you have senders, you

1364
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,680
have a message that the sender has constructed,

1365
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,720
packaged up, and sent to the receiver.

1366
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,840
So there's this informational package

1367
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,800
somehow that's a product of the sender.

1368
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,920
Now I'm happy with informational constructs

1369
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,080
in animal communication, but I think

1370
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:59,080
there are products of receivers, not a product of senders.

1371
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:05,120
So if an individual, if I do anything right now,

1372
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,040
what it communicates depends on you.

1373
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,640
It depends on what you extract and perceive

1374
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,920
from what I'm doing.

1375
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,320
I can say all the words I like.

1376
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,720
I can make all the gestures I want.

1377
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,920
I can do everything I want now.

1378
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,480
But the information that's in my communication that

1379
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:25,160
goes to you as the receiver is not a construct of me at all.

1380
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,120
It's a construct of you.

1381
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,560
So I think that the whole, I'm happy with information

1382
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,120
being an extractive amount of more communication,

1383
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,080
but I think it needs to be as long as we're talking about it

1384
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,640
as a construct of receivers rather than.

1385
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,400
So I think senders and signalers and words like this

1386
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:45,360
are unhelpful, because they give the idea that somehow the message

1387
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,320
is a product of me rather than a product of you.

1388
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,440
And the mistake I think that people

1389
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,480
make without study communication theories,

1390
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,440
that there's some inherent meaning in the message is what

1391
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,360
you're saying.

1392
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,880
There's nothing in the message itself.

1393
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,880
It's how it's perceived.

1394
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:57,600
It's in the meaning.

1395
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,240
It's in the sense what you're saying.

1396
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,200
But a message can be extracted from it.

1397
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,760
That's it to the receiver.

1398
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,480
But there's not an inherent message there

1399
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,480
that you can objectively look at.

1400
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,520
It's in them.

1401
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,120
So because of that, some people would

1402
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,560
argue that, therefore, we should just

1403
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:14,720
cut information as a concept out of communication.

1404
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:19,080
Look, information isn't really.

1405
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,960
Don't talk to me.

1406
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,840
They just want to talk to me out here.

1407
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,000
They're in the round up.

1408
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,880
The information can't be contained within animal communication

1409
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:31,200
because it's not a thing that's packaged up by senders.

1410
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,080
But for me, as long as the perceiver

1411
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,120
is able to extract something from something

1412
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,560
that they've observed and have a reduction in uncertainty

1413
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,840
about the state of the world, which

1414
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,160
is a true definition of information.

1415
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,000
I can understand an weaver type definition.

1416
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,240
Then I don't see how can they not have been informed

1417
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,720
in some way as a perceiver?

1418
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:57,480
Because I, well, it's going to get long.

1419
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,360
But I think one of them is recently.

1420
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,680
But I failed miserably then.

1421
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,680
I don't expect to do any better now.

1422
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,480
But I actually had to pull that out of my introduction

1423
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,560
chapter, my whole diatribe against the information theory

1424
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,400
and animal communication.

1425
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,000
It's a question of interpretation.

1426
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,880
And I think there's different uses of the word information.

1427
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,880
I think most lay people use it as sort of synonymous with data.

1428
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,240
So you're wearing a blue shirt.

1429
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,640
Well, that's a piece of information.

1430
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,720
And then mathematics and linguistics.

1431
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,220
Right.

1432
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,240
Well, that's a function of view.

1433
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,600
Because if you can't see blue, then you don't know.

1434
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,280
So there's nothing to do with me.

1435
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:31,780
Right.

1436
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,760
There's nothing inherent in it.

1437
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,760
But if you weren't wearing a blue shirt, I know.

1438
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,800
We wouldn't be talking about.

1439
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,720
But interesting that you talk about the reduction

1440
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,600
of uncertainty, which is an inherent, I take to believe

1441
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,280
and I was wrapped on the knuckles for this firmly.

1442
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:50,480
But I still take to be a cognitive state

1443
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:55,480
that uncertainty is a state of awareness to some degree.

1444
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:58,320
And so information theory in a way

1445
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,400
that's used in communication is really

1446
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,880
talking about a predictability or a state.

1447
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,240
And I think a lot of communication doesn't necessarily

1448
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,040
have anything to do with predictability or state.

1449
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,800
So you wouldn't think that a B drone that's

1450
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,800
just seen a waggle dance is now capable of totally flying

1451
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,400
straight to a food source that they were completely unaware

1452
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,360
of previously has obtained any information about the state

1453
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,600
of the world from the waggle dance.

1454
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,880
It depends on how we construe the term information.

1455
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,320
So I mean, what narratives?

1456
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,920
You really don't think that gained information.

1457
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,880
I know.

1458
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,760
I told you, I would lose this fight.

1459
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,600
I would keep fighting it in one of these days.

1460
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,240
I'll figure out how to articulate it.

1461
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,720
So what's the word we use other than information?

1462
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,000
If you would like to look at this after my dissertation

1463
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,360
that I pulled out, I've said that signal content actually

1464
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,760
is a useful construct.

1465
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,640
And the way I define it, and some would say

1466
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,000
that there's really no difference.

1467
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,520
And I use a rather sophomoric example.

1468
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,800
But if a tree falls in the woods and no one's there

1469
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,680
to hear it, does it make a sound?

1470
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,080
Absolutely it makes a sound.

1471
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,400
The laws of physics say it makes a sound.

1472
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,360
And the weight of the tree, the angle of its trajectory,

1473
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,760
how hard it hits the ground, what's

1474
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,800
on the ground underneath it, will determine characteristics

1475
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,880
of that sound, how the amplitude, the frequency,

1476
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,680
the degree of crackle, or whatever you want,

1477
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,720
however you want to describe that sound.

1478
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,840
If no one's there to hear it, there's

1479
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,160
no information gained.

1480
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,600
There's no uncertainty changed.

1481
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,160
But there is content in that, just

1482
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,240
to use the analogy of a signal, the sound that that tree makes,

1483
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:36,280
has characteristics that relate to the event.

1484
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:39,640
So in the same way, my voice has in heron

1485
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:43,200
as indexical properties about my body size.

1486
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,240
So if I hollow out, there will be

1487
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,480
formants and all sorts of things you can measure,

1488
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,560
and it will relate to my skeletal length.

1489
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,720
But if none of you are here to hear it,

1490
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:57,200
there's no difference in your understanding of my body size.

1491
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,360
But it doesn't take away from the fact that that signal is.

1492
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,560
But we can distinguish potential information

1493
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,720
from perceived information.

1494
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:02,720
Of course.

1495
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:03,640
I mean, it's fine.

1496
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,320
I think it's the same.

1497
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,920
That's what we talked about.

1498
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,480
But then to go just to push that a little bit further,

1499
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:12,760
if in a linguistic model, if I were to say to you,

1500
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:17,000
there's a person outside with a birthday cake just for you,

1501
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,200
that would be information.

1502
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,200
It'd be pretty much.

1503
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,240
I think it's afternoon before camera time.

1504
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,600
I've been told that before.

1505
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:31,000
I think it's very important that we have an audience with information.

1506
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,320
But we really want to hold that question.

1507
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,320
Oh.

1508
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:41,320
We're going to go for about another five-time.

1509
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,800
We should probably not end on information theory,

1510
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,520
because everyone will end saying that James' character really

1511
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,080
just lost it there at the end.

1512
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,360
But the one thing I would distinguish, I think,

1513
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,240
is that I have softened my objection to this somewhat.

1514
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,960
I think the distinguishing characteristic

1515
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:03,120
is that from a human linguistic and cognitive framework,

1516
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,560
we process information very specifically.

1517
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,600
We think there's a birthday cake out there,

1518
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,040
and that will change.

1519
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,760
Now I'm no longer uncertain as to what's waiting for me.

1520
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:18,000
And now my behavior will be based on my conscious awareness

1521
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,960
of that outside thing.

1522
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:25,200
When we look at non-human responses,

1523
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,800
there can be evolved responses that

1524
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,640
have absolutely nothing to do with a conscious awareness of anything

1525
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,080
that was related to the signal itself.

1526
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,880
And so I think probably, as you said earlier,

1527
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,480
one of the problems is terminology.

1528
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:42,160
So depending on how we want to define information,

1529
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,640
I don't necessarily have a problem with it.

1530
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,960
But what I have a problem with it is the assumption

1531
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,880
that animal responses have to be based on some sort of awareness,

1532
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,280
necessarily, of the quote, information in the signal.

1533
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,520
I actually don't think most people start there,

1534
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,040
because I'm a cognitive psychologist.

1535
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:01,560
I think we look at animal signals and try to look at,

1536
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,320
when we talk about, you can look at communication

1537
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,200
from the order in which the signals occur,

1538
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,520
the structure of the signals, how they're used

1539
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,360
pragmatically in terms of how do they function.

1540
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,000
And then when you look at those things,

1541
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,640
there are times at which you say,

1542
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,240
I think I'm seeing something systematic here.

1543
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:23,440
And then you can then design an experiment to test it further.

1544
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,320
But I don't really know that many scientists who

1545
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,200
have looked at signals that animals produce and say,

1546
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:33,800
oh, there's some heavy-duty cognitive underlying thought

1547
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,600
there without doing some pretty hard studies.

1548
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,520
I mean, people may stay.

1549
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,840
There's too much in the alarm call.

1550
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,400
Yeah, you should read the primary people.

1551
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,400
The primary people.

1552
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,200
The bystander in search.

1553
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,720
They get worked up about it in the primary.

1554
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,520
The alarm calls.

1555
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,040
But I'm talking about the other.

1556
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,520
I'm talking about outside of that.

1557
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,000
With the birds song.

1558
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
With whale song.

1559
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,440
I don't think people are really putting all that heavy

1560
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,560
cognitive stuff in there.

1561
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,080
I think that's one of the problems here,

1562
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:00,320
is that when you were before describing

1563
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,200
this whole movement or the distinguishing

1564
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,400
between communication and cognition,

1565
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,640
I think one of the problems is that, first of all,

1566
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,760
I think some of these arguments are basically

1567
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:15,160
cul-de-sacs, they're going nowhere.

1568
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,200
They're infatuations with our own self.

1569
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,720
And cognition is a projection of our own abilities

1570
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,360
onto these other systems.

1571
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,680
And so you're never going to find it because we'll always

1572
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,320
argue about whether it is or it isn't.

1573
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,280
We'll come up with new terms and whatnot.

1574
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:33,480
So the question is, what are we talking about?

1575
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:37,040
Are we talking about do animals communicate?

1576
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,880
What level, what depths do they communicate?

1577
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,240
I think we impose a value system

1578
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:48,560
so that a Porsche, when Stem Wilcox actually

1579
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,320
shows these animals look like they're thinking,

1580
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,400
and they are anticipating what's going to happen

1581
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,720
in the future in the past, we go, oh, but it's a spider.

1582
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,760
But if we have a non-human primate,

1583
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:04,080
we go through all these elaborate expectations,

1584
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:04,720
et cetera, et cetera.

1585
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,840
So we impose a value system on it.

1586
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,560
If it has cognition, it must be greater value.

1587
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:13,600
Wales, primates, greater value.

1588
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,200
And I think that is a really false paradigm

1589
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,720
for looking at life.

1590
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,880
Because any way you look on this planet,

1591
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,240
there are just amazing things going on

1592
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:25,600
that have gone through the evolutionary process

1593
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,640
that we can't really explain.

1594
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:31,280
How can you, any of us here, understand,

1595
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,280
imagine being in a system where the animals are working

1596
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,160
over 100,000 hertz bandwidth.

1597
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:41,120
They have three simultaneous sound production mechanisms.

1598
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,560
They can perceive sound through multiple channels

1599
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,120
at the same time.

1600
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,960
You and I can't even appreciate it.

1601
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,520
And yet we're trying to make a distinction

1602
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,680
of whether it has cognition or doesn't have cognition.

1603
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,640
Do you mean different sensory systems?

1604
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,000
Hmm?

1605
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:53,640
No.

1606
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,440
Within the same sensory system.

1607
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:56,840
Auditorium.

1608
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,120
Sitations will be receiving signals

1609
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:03,200
through multiple places in their heads.

1610
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,480
But then is it all, does it all feed in through the same kind

1611
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,040
of sensory system or such?

1612
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,360
Well, eventually, presumably it ends up somewhere

1613
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,560
in auditory cortex.

1614
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,760
I'm asking because there's, I think there's interesting

1615
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,920
questions here about what we consider to be universities

1616
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,760
multisensory in communication.

1617
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:25,280
Because we have quite specific, we have quite specific sensory

1618
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,040
systems.

1619
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,320
So if I see you and I hear you talking at the same time,

1620
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,480
I have my auditory and visual cortex, et cetera, et cetera.

1621
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,600
So there's plenty of animals, insects, for example,

1622
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:44,120
have a completely separate system for detecting the same chemical

1623
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:48,800
signal that was sent through the air, then contacts came out

1624
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,000
reception, right?

1625
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,040
So then do we define a signaling modality

1626
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,840
on the basis of its production?

1627
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,960
I get some vocal signal that's sent through the C.

1628
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,800
Or if there's more completely separate multiple sensory

1629
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,800
systems for detecting it, does that then become a multisensory

1630
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,520
signal?

1631
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,840
Here's my question.

1632
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,360
But in the incitations, it sounds like that.

1633
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:16,080
So they have, it's just actually one sensory system,

1634
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,360
but just multiple ways of detecting it.

1635
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:22,120
They have basically receptors into the physical entity

1636
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,320
called their body.

1637
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,280
They are coming through different parts of their skull.

1638
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:31,120
And I almost want to, this is sort of challenging,

1639
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,640
but I almost want to say, well, does it really matter

1640
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,360
if we define that they have a multisensory system?

1641
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,320
I think it does matter, yeah.

1642
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,120
Why does that matter?

1643
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,920
Because multisensory communication is different.

1644
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,600
Well, who cares if it's different?

1645
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,960
I think it's different cognitively, functionally,

1646
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,040
it evolves differently.

1647
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,840
So does that mean we place a different value

1648
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,880
on that system that has multisensory?

1649
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,200
No, but I think of it somehow inflates ourselves

1650
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,720
and says, oh, wow, we found something that's

1651
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,120
more complicated than us?

1652
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,120
Why can't you just enjoy the fact that there's

1653
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:07,120
an animal that works up to 220 kilohertz, right,

1654
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,040
that has received through its jaw,

1655
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,120
receives through the back of the head, receives through it, right?

1656
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,800
I mean, I can appreciate that from a static sense,

1657
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,480
but as a scientist, I'm also interested in studying it

1658
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,680
and asking questions or something.

1659
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,600
But also, they're visual, they're tactile.

1660
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,920
They should, the general, if we are.

1661
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,000
And actually, we've had a lot of communications.

1662
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,320
Stations aren't very visual.

1663
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,320
They are.

1664
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:26,720
Yeah, yeah.

1665
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,280
They change their positions.

1666
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,480
They have a visual phobia that works in the air

1667
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,480
and in the water.

1668
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,280
Nice to see you.

1669
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,960
We've talked a lot today about human language, for example,

1670
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,320
and you started touching on gesture.

1671
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,760
But actually, human language is completely

1672
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,320
multisensory from the start.

1673
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,480
It's impossible to make the words that we make

1674
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,240
without concomitant movements of the lips.

1675
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,640
And this, from looking at people,

1676
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,960
we get a much, much better understanding of what they're saying.

1677
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,240
Even if you can only see the lips,

1678
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,520
if you cut the rest of the head off,

1679
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,200
everything, if you just see their lips,

1680
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,760
you get a much better understanding.

1681
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:05,120
And this visual signal, following the lips,

1682
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,040
is not something that's piggyback to on,

1683
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:11,280
that humans have evolved a vocal communication system.

1684
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,200
And then we've added on a bit of visual signal.

1685
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,880
It's right from the start.

1686
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,920
The visual signal of watching the lips

1687
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,360
and the vocal signal coming into the ears

1688
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:23,040
are integrated at the very, very first step

1689
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,840
of cortical processing.

1690
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,000
And it's the same in non-human primates,

1691
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,440
as well as in humans.

1692
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:34,120
And your dolphins don't have any facial gestures, right?

1693
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,640
No, but they have body positions.

1694
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,240
They have body positions.

1695
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,320
But most of them can't even see each other

1696
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,240
when the community can see this.

1697
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,240
Right.

1698
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:45,320
Well, that's a species I study.

1699
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,720
They have a series of what are called loud calls,

1700
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,520
which I think is rather uninformative.

1701
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,880
They have calls that can be heard almost a kilometer away.

1702
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,880
And then they have calls that can barely be heard

1703
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,760
more than a few meters away.

1704
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,440
And they use them in different contexts

1705
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,880
and presumably selection has favored them

1706
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:03,920
for having different functions.

1707
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,320
So there are, I think, so what James was saying there.

1708
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,440
And clearly with the whales, we're

1709
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:12,840
looking over 1,000 kilometers of the ability

1710
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,360
to communicate, the ability to produce and perceive

1711
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:21,040
a signal with no other, with no additional information,

1712
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,200
no other modality to accompany it,

1713
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,520
no other visual or gestural or chemical, et cetera.

1714
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,040
And then we have others that are

1715
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:31,960
evolved within this very close multi-dimensional or multi-modality

1716
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:32,880
space.

1717
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,000
And I just think that selection favors them

1718
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,560
for different reasons in different ways.

1719
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:41,760
But they're probably built on some fundamental underlying

1720
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,880
foundation of perception and reception

1721
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,640
and then diverged over time.

1722
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:48,140
Great.

1723
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:50,640
Thank you guys for just a few minutes.

1724
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:51,640
I don't know.

1725
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,640
I don't know.

1726
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:55,640
I'm not going to be honest.

1727
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,240
I was asking John and Dwight, who

1728
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,160
would have been asking to rock for us to be the first to speak?

1729
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:05,660
Really?

1730
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:08,280
Because I think he's going to yell at me.

1731
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,000
You might be yelling at me.

1732
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,320
Now he's the young vervet that needs to be.

1733
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,640
I'm going to try to yell at him.

1734
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:19,640
What I wanted to clarify was this.

1735
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:25,760
You said that the understanding is created in the receiver.

1736
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,280
Well, that's true unless the sender and the receiver

1737
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:33,480
have previously agreed a set of signals.

1738
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,680
If the sender and the receiver have previously

1739
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:38,800
agreed what the various signals mean,

1740
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,240
then it's the sender who constructs the semantics

1741
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,320
and not the receiver.

1742
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,440
So if I have a very simple system,

1743
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:48,480
which is to tell you to turn on a light switch or turn it off,

1744
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:52,080
and we agree before that when I raise my arm like this,

1745
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,240
you turn it off.

1746
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,160
And when I do this, you turn it off.

1747
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:58,640
Then I'm the one who's giving meaning to the signal.

1748
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:03,840
Now that's important because we may fallaciously

1749
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,640
have assumed that built into each of us

1750
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:10,840
is some standard set, which is biologically determined.

1751
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:14,120
And therefore we have agreement built into us before.

1752
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:18,120
And therefore when an animal sends out a signal,

1753
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:21,200
it's the sender who is generating the information

1754
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:25,960
and not the receiver, namely if we're all hardwired,

1755
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:30,520
if animals were hardwired to respond to it when the tail goes up,

1756
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,760
there is something hardwired in an animal

1757
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,160
to say, I know what that means, not

1758
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:38,360
know in the cognitive sense, but to know the response.

1759
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,120
Then indeed it would be the reverse of what you were saying.

1760
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,440
So I just wanted us to be careful about the fact

1761
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,680
that we're giving up on information theory

1762
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,880
as it was originally created by Shannon,

1763
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,520
was exactly this notion to have this prearranged set of signals

1764
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,480
from which you are choosing.

1765
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,760
And so if you're going to use the word information theory,

1766
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,720
that does presuppose this.

1767
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:05,320
And so I think you do need to worry about that.

1768
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,320
That's right.

1769
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:10,560
No, I was just going to say, so if you look at basic communication

1770
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,080
books for human communication, you see these diagrams.

1771
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,360
And we talk about a transactional model.

1772
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,200
So you've got sender, receiver, both being both,

1773
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,120
because it's a highly dynamic system.

1774
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:22,280
You're sender, receiver at the same time.

1775
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,120
And then the meaning, the sender has an understanding,

1776
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,400
like you're saying, they have an idea of what this message is

1777
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,440
in their head.

1778
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,800
And the receiver has an idea.

1779
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,360
But there's not an absolute message.

1780
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,000
They both have a meaning in their heads

1781
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,200
in terms of the information that's going up.

1782
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,440
But it may not be the same.

1783
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,560
That's why there's no inherent meaning in any one message.

1784
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,920
It's what they both perceive.

1785
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,920
Here's an animal communicating.

1786
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,440
Perfect.

1787
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,720
This is what we needed.

1788
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,680
And there it goes.

1789
01:27:54,680 --> 01:28:00,520
I have an interesting, I'm not sure that it's all gone.

1790
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,480
You bring a cute puppy in, and it's all,

1791
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,040
I should have brought a cute puppy to my defense

1792
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,840
and would have gone a lot faster.

1793
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:10,600
But how would you, I mean, this is all for behavioral signals.

1794
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:14,360
But most animal communication, a lot of animal communication

1795
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,000
is not about behavior.

1796
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,640
I mean, how would you consider the bright red sexual swelling

1797
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:24,160
of an olive baboon, say, something that grows?

1798
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,440
And arouses the male.

1799
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:30,120
And because it's associated with fertility and blah,

1800
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:32,480
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, we can, you know,

1801
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,480
the male gets excited and they send that on the other

1802
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,800
and he copulates and blah, blah.

1803
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,920
And from the male's perspective, it

1804
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:43,600
may be that he has some idea about that in terms of where

1805
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,720
it's going, maybe it doesn't.

1806
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,880
But then certainly, there's nothing

1807
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,200
going on in the female's head, right?

1808
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,560
It's just a morphological grip.

1809
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,480
A combination.

1810
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:51,960
Right, right.

1811
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,160
And I said, if any of you do a combination of simply

1812
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:59,120
to understand that you have acquired into us

1813
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,560
some standard actions that are common just

1814
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:04,360
from my genetics, then there are

1815
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:07,280
these information that you have in ones that you have heard,

1816
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:10,280
which is valid and clear.

1817
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:13,720
And these are not subjects of all this.

1818
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:14,800
We don't know what's going on.

1819
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,480
It's like that.

1820
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,960
That's the point that it makes you lose.

1821
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,040
Right, but the precise information

1822
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,680
that the receiver would take from it

1823
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,880
will always depend on the receiver.

1824
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:29,320
On their ability to perceive it, their sensory systems,

1825
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:32,080
their experience, all these things

1826
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,560
are going to nuance how they're going

1827
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,000
to interpret the signal.

1828
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Not much of that.

1829
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Take the ability to do that in more ways

1830
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,600
and really impact the same thing

1831
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,200
when you get the signal.

1832
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,560
I think it can be, but I think a lot of animal communication

1833
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:45,240
is not like that.

1834
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:45,760
I am.

1835
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:46,760
You are the expert.

1836
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:47,760
I'm not the expert.

1837
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:48,760
I'm the expert.

1838
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,040
It's not important.

1839
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:51,880
Yes.

1840
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,680
I always thought that what did say

1841
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,840
which is language and other forms of communication,

1842
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:59,840
that the language has an underlying grammar.

1843
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,440
And I was just wondering, is it true that all human languages

1844
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:04,120
have an underlying grammar?

1845
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:07,120
And that if anyone sounds underlying grammar

1846
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,280
for any form of animal communication,

1847
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,960
and it's not as anybody even looking into that?

1848
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:13,920
Well, we talked a little bit about the animal communication

1849
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,680
stuff earlier with chimps and teaching them simple.

1850
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,320
Are there any grammar?

1851
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,880
Are there any grammar?

1852
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,280
Let's go to the human language stuff.

1853
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,520
A very interesting thing to read is this fellow Jimmy Button.

1854
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,120
I don't know if you've ever heard of him,

1855
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:27,160
but he was a whenever the Darwin put down on the beagle.

1856
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,320
They kidnapped Jimmy Button, the young boy about 10,

1857
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,400
and took him to England and taught him everything.

1858
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,840
He went to Cambridge, you name it.

1859
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,680
And they taught him all sorts of foreign languages

1860
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,840
and everything else.

1861
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,720
So one of the things that was very popular in the United

1862
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,640
States also in the 1600s was to kidnap an Indian

1863
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,400
and bring them to Europe and teach them all sorts

1864
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,600
of different languages.

1865
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,520
The most famous one was Samuel Occam,

1866
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:53,200
who apparently was a genius of all imaginable sizes.

1867
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,520
And he's the one that actually scared up the money

1868
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,000
for all the Ivy League colleges.

1869
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,640
Because they said, if you can do that with an Indian,

1870
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,000
what's next?

1871
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,040
So apparently any human being from anywhere in the world

1872
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:07,680
can learn any language anywhere with no trouble at all.

1873
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:10,120
The most complicated language, most linguists agree,

1874
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,120
is a language called Wahlperi, which

1875
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:14,480
is spoken at Ayers Rock in Australia.

1876
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:18,080
It has cases beyond anybody's imagination for what cases

1877
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,120
could be.

1878
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,880
Children learn it flawlessly with no effort whatsoever.

1879
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,760
Adults have one hell of a time.

1880
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,480
There are two people that I met in my life

1881
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,720
that can learn both deceased now.

1882
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:30,080
But they can learn any human language on exposure

1883
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,360
for about a year and be totally fluent.

1884
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,800
This ability usually disappears in most people,

1885
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,560
but it doesn't in all.

1886
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,120
So it seems to be the case that there's

1887
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,640
an inherent thing in people's heads

1888
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:42,320
that enables them to learn languages that are really

1889
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,920
honest to God spoken by other human beings.

1890
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,880
Now, when it comes down to animals,

1891
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,360
we were talking about this earlier,

1892
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,760
what kinds of symbol systems can they use?

1893
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,080
And can they use mathematics?

1894
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,440
And can they use symbols for different sorts of things?

1895
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,880
Just offhand, to my own feeling on this,

1896
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,600
is they don't tend to symbolize their activities.

1897
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,360
It's no particular reason why they should

1898
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:03,840
symbolize their activities.

1899
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,600
I think with all the things you're talking about,

1900
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,400
they do gestural sorts of things and interpret

1901
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,680
each other's gestures rather than noises.

1902
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:13,960
And human beings tend to be visual creatures that like sounds.

1903
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:18,480
And so I mean, I've seen movies of animals

1904
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,920
that watched people do things, and then they started doing them

1905
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:24,920
too, and maybe they learn that kind of a system.

1906
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,320
But there's something very unusual about the human being

1907
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:30,120
that it's a total symbol using creature.

1908
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,080
And in fact, we talk about the messages

1909
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,000
and the message content.

1910
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,720
In Shannon's thing, there's no message content at all.

1911
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,000
In fact, he has a sentence in there

1912
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,480
that gets many people mad.

1913
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,600
He says, I don't even care if there are messages.

1914
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,600
He just wants to know how many tell of,

1915
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,440
if you have your cell phone breaks,

1916
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,520
and you take it to the dealer, he's not going to say,

1917
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,040
what do you talk about?

1918
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:50,720
You don't care.

1919
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,800
And he's not going to say, what language do you use?

1920
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,640
He doesn't care.

1921
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:55,120
He's going to plug a bunch of gizmos in

1922
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,400
and get it back working.

1923
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,080
If your TV breaks, the guy's not going to say,

1924
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:58,560
what do you watch?

1925
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,120
John Wayne movies?

1926
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,480
It doesn't make any difference.

1927
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:04,360
He's going to put a bunch of signals through that thing

1928
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,880
that are going to be jagged lines, big round balls,

1929
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,200
crazy colors.

1930
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,440
And if it absorbs all of those weirdo things,

1931
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,880
then it works perfectly.

1932
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,160
And that's what most syntax and Chomsky type stuff is.

1933
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:19,520
It's finding those structures that define the boundaries,

1934
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,200
the outer boundaries of human language structures,

1935
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:25,080
independent of what the meanings might be.

1936
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,960
So are any little structures down the language

1937
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:29,160
from the outer line?

1938
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,960
Well, there's a huge, as you can see,

1939
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,960
there's huge amounts of debate about this stuff.

1940
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:37,200
So maybe the closest thing is the puttino's guenan.

1941
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:40,200
You say you're going to bring up a super dealer?

1942
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:41,640
Unfortunately.

1943
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:45,480
So the puttino's guenan has a system.

1944
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:47,760
I mean, we just start into it's body systems, right?

1945
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,640
But they have a system where they use one particular

1946
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:54,920
called a piao call for a leopard or ground-based predator,

1947
01:33:54,920 --> 01:34:00,680
at least, and a hack call, which they use for aerial threats.

1948
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:03,760
So they're two different predator type responses.

1949
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:08,160
And then they combine those two calls in specific form

1950
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:10,880
when they want to travel.

1951
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,640
So they use some combination of between two and five piao

1952
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,360
calls, followed by some combination

1953
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:19,600
between two and five hack calls in a sequence.

1954
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:25,200
They go piao, piao, hack, hack, and then they all move out.

1955
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,320
So that's quite interesting-ish.

1956
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:30,400
But quite exactly what's going on in those kind of systems.

1957
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,080
I guess we have no idea.

1958
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,560
But the vocalizations themselves

1959
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:38,160
seem to be sort of at least some sort of functional

1960
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,680
referentiality in what they do.

1961
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:42,440
And then they're also combined in other contexts.

1962
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:44,360
I think we've made a mistake here today

1963
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:50,360
that we were confusing in my terminology language and speech.

1964
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:51,360
Well, that's a speech.

1965
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,960
Speech is what humans do.

1966
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,200
Bees have language.

1967
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,200
Other species have language.

1968
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,520
Can we define language?

1969
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,120
No, you said you couldn't do it.

1970
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,120
I couldn't do it, but you know.

1971
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:05,360
I think what the question there was about was speech.

1972
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,360
No, grammar.

1973
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:07,440
Is that grammar?

1974
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,800
Grammar.

1975
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,840
So bees don't have language.

1976
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,040
I don't know how would you define language?

1977
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:18,080
If I might interject.

1978
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,720
So now what you've done is you've invented definitions

1979
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,520
that exclude anything by humans.

1980
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:22,960
Exactly.

1981
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:25,080
So that's a useless concept.

1982
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:30,360
But I have an excellent evolutionary behavioral ecology

1983
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,120
definition of communication.

1984
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:34,160
But I don't have the definition of language.

1985
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,960
But people have talked about language

1986
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,840
as a set of agreed upon symbols that are used conventionally.

1987
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:42,480
And people like Hawkett and others have listed,

1988
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:46,160
based on human language, certain design features

1989
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:49,280
that we do, such as grammar, such as productivity,

1990
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:52,640
such as using symbolic forms, such as arbitrariness.

1991
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,960
I mean, they're like 18 things.

1992
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,640
Just as an example, just to say, how can we

1993
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:02,920
compare what other species do with what we call language?

1994
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:05,880
Do other species show any of the properties of human language

1995
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,480
not forcing it into a language game,

1996
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:08,640
but just say this is how we do it.

1997
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:10,480
So we do have metrics like that.

1998
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:14,400
And many animals do show many of those design features.

1999
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,720
Again, if we just throw out the word language,

2000
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,880
just throw out the word language and say, that's what we do.

2001
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:22,400
And other animals may use, and that's

2002
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,800
our kind of communication system.

2003
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,560
And it could be nonverbal or verbal.

2004
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,320
And then we've got other animal communication systems.

2005
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,760
And we can call that x, y, and z.

2006
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:31,560
It's not better or worse.

2007
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,400
They're just different.

2008
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,400
Certainly not high-level.

2009
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,960
That would be a little bit more of your blank thing.

2010
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,880
But would you distinguish the dialogue

2011
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,360
that we've been carrying on here, which

2012
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:43,440
is through the modality of speech and the almost universal

2013
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,640
awe sound that went out when the puppy came in?

2014
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,640
I would distinguish between those two.

2015
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:53,120
I would consider one a vocal communication, a vocal signal

2016
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:57,120
that is probably, to some degree, inherent or inherited.

2017
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:58,000
Arousal-based.

2018
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,040
Arousal-based and reflexive and inherited

2019
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,080
and therefore probably has an evolutionary tract,

2020
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,880
whereas the words that are coming out of my mouth

2021
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:07,440
have to be learned.

2022
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,400
So we have a mode of signals.

2023
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:13,000
And we have something that's not a mode of signaling.

2024
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,480
But it doesn't have to be speech.

2025
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,720
It doesn't have to be acoustic.

2026
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:17,560
It doesn't have to be.

2027
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,720
A mode of could be non-intentional.

2028
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:20,240
Blushing.

2029
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,240
You have an emotion.

2030
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,080
You blush.

2031
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,920
So there's this realm of all these signals.

2032
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,600
But I think we're still stuck with this idea that what we do

2033
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,200
is that we call language.

2034
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,200
No other animal can have it.

2035
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:33,880
It's Chris is saying we're a priorially saying that this

2036
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:36,760
is language is better and no other animal can really do it.

2037
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:39,120
Because we've already said what it is.

2038
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:39,640
We're letting them.

2039
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:41,240
And we do this with all sorts of things.

2040
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:42,520
It's quite a circular.

2041
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:43,040
Yeah.

2042
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,240
And I never put language on any sort of hierarchy

2043
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,760
to say it's better or worse.

2044
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:50,360
But just an ability to somehow distinguish it,

2045
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:51,960
which is why I continue to bring up

2046
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:56,840
the inhuman non-linguistic communication of crying

2047
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,320
and laughing and things like that, which are evolved traits

2048
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:01,480
that have a communicative function.

2049
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:05,840
And I would have no difficulty distinguishing those

2050
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:11,800
from spoken or written or sign language that is learned.

2051
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:14,520
And there's based on a shared understanding of these symbols.

2052
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:18,120
So since I don't find that difficult to distinguish

2053
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:21,760
between crying and laughing and the use of written

2054
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,600
or spoken language, I'm not sure why

2055
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,720
then we'd have such a hard time distinguishing human language

2056
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:33,680
from non-linguistic forms in other species.

2057
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:34,680
Please.

2058
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:41,560
I would like to make a comment on complexity

2059
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,000
of their communication systems.

2060
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:51,160
And I happen to know a guy who was saved by dolphins.

2061
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:54,240
So I'm never going to tell about this.

2062
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:59,680
So the friends they have a boat, sometimes they

2063
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:03,400
go to a particular island in front of the put boat there

2064
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:09,040
and swim to the smaller island where there is very good beach.

2065
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:13,160
And a lot of dolphins also nearby.

2066
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:20,200
Once he stayed by himself to long on this smaller island

2067
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,760
and suddenly where they changed.

2068
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:29,120
And he decided to go as fast as possible to the boat.

2069
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:34,280
But in the middle waves became bigger and wind became bigger

2070
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:38,320
and he got the panic attack.

2071
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:43,280
And he did not know where to go back to the small island

2072
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:46,200
to be saved to the boat because it was something

2073
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:46,840
in the middle.

2074
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:56,760
And suddenly he felt something above him, below him.

2075
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:00,640
And it was dolphins who created the whale.

2076
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,680
They didn't attach him.

2077
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,400
They created the whale.

2078
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:06,960
And very fast moved him to the boat.

2079
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,400
So this panic attack was like a message for them.

2080
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:13,200
And they know where to go.

2081
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,960
They understood where he wants to go.

2082
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:19,200
Although he already was in the doubt.

2083
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:25,400
So when they brought him to the boat, they just left.

2084
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,000
And that was it.

2085
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,800
And I don't know how and actually I

2086
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:35,400
could give anyone the contact information of this guy.

2087
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:39,600
So you could know he had by himself.

2088
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:51,440
So and this event telling us about that there

2089
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:54,560
is a very complex system of communication.

2090
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:58,000
It was a complex message for them, this panic attack.

2091
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,880
They understood what's going on, what they could do,

2092
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:08,160
and where this whatever creature it is should go and why.

2093
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:11,880
They did not help him as they probably

2094
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:20,440
help their own members of their own species.

2095
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:27,440
So one of the questions may be our languages that

2096
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:30,200
we can see, they're very complex.

2097
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:36,280
And they actually help us to develop very complex technology.

2098
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:41,840
That, for example, improve only one hour function

2099
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:46,400
to like iPhone.

2100
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:52,800
Maybe they much more primitive that would actually

2101
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,440
animals using in their communications.

2102
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:58,440
And actually one of my other friends

2103
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:03,400
saying that animals don't need to develop this simple

2104
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:07,040
and political religious because they don't need them.

2105
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:10,200
They just don't need it because their life is much more

2106
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,320
complex than ours.

2107
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:15,320
We're sitting here without anything around except only

2108
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:16,440
humans.

2109
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:20,400
And we're using these our languages

2110
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,960
that we're creating complex technology, which

2111
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:26,160
is destroying environment.

2112
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:29,520
And actually it's not very smart.

2113
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:33,400
So there's the question, what is more complex?

2114
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:37,240
And what is their living and we are sitting in a token?

2115
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:40,360
And I'm not saying that I'm like,

2116
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:43,280
I don't this distinction myself.

2117
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:46,600
I'm also choosing to live in city,

2118
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:50,880
northern, in ancient, whatever it could be said about this.

2119
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,520
But anyway, what's their system of communications

2120
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,800
and more complex?

2121
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,960
Well, I'd like to respond to that real quickly.

2122
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,480
Because historically there have been

2123
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,560
reports of dolphins saving people, even, again,

2124
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:06,800
back in Greek times, awry, airy and being rescued by the dolphin.

2125
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:10,320
And I get a lot of letters from people who say they've been rescued.

2126
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,360
One of the things we've seen in not just dolphins,

2127
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:16,600
but in other animals like elephants and certainly primates,

2128
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:21,040
where a child will fall into an enclosure at a zoo.

2129
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:25,000
And it was, I think, a gorilla that held this child

2130
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,160
till the keepers could get out.

2131
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,240
Franz Duval, who's a well-known primatologist,

2132
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:30,560
was just giving a talk this weekend about this.

2133
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,040
And it seems that whether it's communication, per se,

2134
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:36,400
it may not be communication, but there's some awareness

2135
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:40,480
on the part of the animal, perhaps, of the plight of that organism.

2136
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,240
And, well, you're gone.

2137
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,160
Well, let me get.

2138
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:47,120
Wild dogs just did to that kid in the zoo.

2139
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:47,640
That's a very different.

2140
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,000
But those are wild hunting dogs.

2141
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,560
Those are predators.

2142
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,400
These, OK, so that may be different.

2143
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,240
It may not be all animals are the same.

2144
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:57,760
But nevertheless, there are several animal species

2145
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,760
that show helping, caregiving behavior that's not hardwired.

2146
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:06,880
Our colleague Ken Norris has shown that with dolphins and whales,

2147
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,280
their behavior is flexible.

2148
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:12,440
If you, one could argue that a dolphin that's

2149
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:15,160
an air-breathing animal, it could have been selected

2150
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:17,840
for that they would hold up anything that's air-breathing

2151
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,640
at the surface, because that would save an organism

2152
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,760
that they're related to or another dolphin.

2153
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:23,520
So it's hardwired.

2154
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:24,200
But they don't do it.

2155
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:25,280
It's not hardwired.

2156
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,720
You can see them not holding up all flailing animals.

2157
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,200
I mean, we've all watched that.

2158
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:31,360
So there's some selection there.

2159
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,040
I don't know what that selection is,

2160
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,000
but you do hear about it.

2161
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,280
So I just want to argue that I think

2162
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:38,040
there is something that may not be based on communication,

2163
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:41,040
but on perception or the plight of another that we

2164
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,040
would call empathy.

2165
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:44,080
And I think there's a high degree of learning there, too,

2166
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:48,120
because I think the examples where non-humans step in

2167
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:51,880
and are somehow protective or indicate

2168
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:55,880
some sort of protection response to human infants

2169
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:59,200
tend to be very highly publicized.

2170
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,600
They also tend to be in zoos or with captive or trade animals.

2171
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:02,640
It's not with wild dolphins.

2172
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:03,400
That's not the case.

2173
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:06,080
There are many cases, and I have a whole collection of them,

2174
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,640
of wild dolphins.

2175
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,680
We don't know their whole history of their wild,

2176
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:12,440
but have done this kind of little Ilion Gonzales.

2177
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:13,600
Name is case.

2178
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,480
He was hanging on that inner tube,

2179
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,920
and he told a colleague of mine who was with him,

2180
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,800
and Diane Sawyer in an interview,

2181
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,440
that as he slid off the inner tube,

2182
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,480
dolphins pushed him, much like you were saying,

2183
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,880
back up into the inner tube.

2184
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:27,920
So of course, the skeptic in all of us

2185
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,960
says the kid's hallucinating.

2186
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:32,200
He's been out there, the whole thing.

2187
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:35,160
But the fisherman who came on the rescue boat

2188
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:38,000
saw the dolphins, and they left when he approached.

2189
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,120
Interesting.

2190
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:41,560
So let's not jump too fast.

2191
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:44,040
No, certainly not.

2192
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:53,320
My question is related to whether studying these orders

2193
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:58,320
in animals could help us to learn about their communication

2194
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,880
or language.

2195
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:05,080
I just remembered how some people were suggesting

2196
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:07,240
that it's helpful to understand schizophrenia

2197
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:10,080
as a disorder of language, for example,

2198
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:14,640
and how many things that we understand

2199
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:17,040
in the field of psychiatry or neurology,

2200
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:22,360
we reach there by seeing what doesn't work, actually,

2201
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,280
not what works.

2202
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:27,920
So my question is, how is this applied

2203
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,480
into the animal communication, and what

2204
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:33,480
are, is there limitations for this one?

2205
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:34,600
Thank you.

2206
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:37,400
I think there's loads of different ways.

2207
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:40,480
I mean, you mentioned kind of mental disorders,

2208
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,840
but there's also a lot of sensory disorders.

2209
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:45,480
So people are interested in sort of color blindness

2210
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:48,440
and mechanics and understanding sensory perception,

2211
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:51,120
according to the question.

2212
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:52,640
Yeah.

2213
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:53,640
Really?

2214
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:55,200
According to things like this, I think

2215
01:46:55,200 --> 01:47:00,640
there's people that are interested in individuals

2216
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:05,880
with sensory defects and trying to understand communication

2217
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,080
from those perspectives.

2218
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,720
And that's quite interesting, particularly in vision,

2219
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:14,880
because the way our luminance and color vision works,

2220
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,240
which I'm not going to go into in great amount of detail.

2221
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:22,320
But basically, we have a sort of corruption of how light and dark

2222
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:25,480
we can detect things as a consequence of our evolution

2223
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:26,320
of trigromacy.

2224
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:31,640
So dichromats, dichromatic anthropoids,

2225
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:34,680
and darkromatic humans supposedly have better kind

2226
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:36,760
of depth perception and various other things.

2227
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:39,240
In the Second World War, the RAF used

2228
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:43,320
to have a colorblind man in every squadron,

2229
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:45,360
apocryphal, possibly.

2230
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:48,960
The, in terms of kind of, I mean, I

2231
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:54,000
think there's a lot of models of depression,

2232
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,800
negativity bias, things like that,

2233
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:57,480
where people are interested in understanding

2234
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,560
the animal communication.

2235
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:03,720
So they're looking at mice and rats,

2236
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:07,240
but also in non-human primates, rearing individuals

2237
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:10,840
that have had different types of upbringing

2238
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:12,880
than can get.

2239
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:15,600
You can see types of effects that we would classify as being

2240
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:16,120
depression.

2241
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:19,120
So you show depressed individuals are characterized

2242
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:21,800
by negativity biases, essentially.

2243
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:24,360
Like when you show them things that they should be happy about,

2244
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:27,360
they still think it's really, really bad regardless.

2245
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:29,920
And you can get similar effects.

2246
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:36,200
You get very, very similar effects in non-human animals,

2247
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:37,800
depending on their prior experience.

2248
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,840
And I think they're used to touch the Earth.

2249
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,640
So non-human primates of some of the new world monkeys,

2250
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:45,000
they look at stress and they monitor

2251
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,160
the vocal modifications.

2252
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,160
Right.

2253
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,960
And I know that's what sort of the one

2254
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:53,160
that's saying your mind's a good question.

2255
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:53,680
OK.

2256
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:54,160
Yes.

2257
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:58,040
I mean, in general, because some people were saying that,

2258
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:01,400
I think that animals can now ask to bring, for example,

2259
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:03,480
that this was a kind of baseball game,

2260
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:08,320
because they're like, they don't have our language.

2261
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,520
And it's bringing this sort of language.

2262
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:16,520
So crazy animals are not our parts of the effects.

2263
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:17,880
So I was just saying.

2264
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:19,360
I mean, they could step.

2265
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,320
I mean, they use it extensively as models of things

2266
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:24,160
like anxiety and depression and things certainly.

2267
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:28,280
And it's important, I think, for our own studies

2268
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:32,400
that we understand these things for our own communication,

2269
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:35,080
but also for kind of human medicine.

2270
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:41,280
Like, we often try and test in drugs on rats and mice and things

2271
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,640
that are actually not normal mice and rats,

2272
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:46,240
like depending on how they've been read,

2273
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:48,440
will rare it's completely different.

2274
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:51,200
So the same kind of the same medicine, right?

2275
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:52,960
Or if they're males or females?

2276
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,520
Because of time, I'm sorry, these three gentlemen

2277
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:59,120
are going to have to be our last question.

2278
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:00,600
We'll be more succinct.

2279
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:06,160
I've been treated many years ago myself being

2280
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:08,480
not involved much with animals.

2281
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:14,440
I found myself running a mental hospital in a rural area.

2282
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:19,080
And they provided a house for me to live in.

2283
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:22,240
Somebody gave me a pet.

2284
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:23,240
It was a bird.

2285
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:26,080
It was a cockatiel.

2286
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:30,640
And I had no real relationship to this bird.

2287
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:33,640
It flew around this big, gold place.

2288
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:35,560
And I sort of sat around, wondering

2289
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:36,920
what the hell I'm doing there.

2290
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:39,120
And there was this bird.

2291
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:41,360
One day it snowed.

2292
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:44,640
Now, apparently this bird had come from Brazil,

2293
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:48,360
or some jungle area where there was no snow.

2294
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:52,280
And I was a city kid and always fascinated

2295
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:55,480
the concept that snow was covering everything up.

2296
01:50:55,480 --> 01:51:00,440
So I look out the window, and everything

2297
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:02,760
was covered in white.

2298
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:07,160
All the fields, all the campus, everything, trees and white.

2299
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:10,240
Just looking at this.

2300
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:17,320
And suddenly, right beside me perched on a little bookshelf,

2301
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:22,600
Irma, the bird, is also looking at this.

2302
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:26,560
I didn't know Irma was looking at this.

2303
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,360
So I looked at Irma.

2304
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,880
And Irma looked at me.

2305
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:36,040
And we both knew that we were seeing something very interesting

2306
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:37,960
that we had not seen before.

2307
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:41,680
And not only did we know that, we

2308
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:44,760
were seeing something that we had not seen before,

2309
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:47,800
but we suddenly knew that each of us

2310
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:51,680
was knowing that we knew each of us were knowing that.

2311
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:53,320
And we were shocked.

2312
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:54,200
And so was Irma.

2313
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:55,200
I bet she was.

2314
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:59,640
And so did she realize that I understood what she was seeing,

2315
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:01,560
and she understood what I was seeing,

2316
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:05,000
and that we both understood what either of us was seeing.

2317
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:09,240
She flew away in panic to the next floor of this place.

2318
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:10,520
I was living.

2319
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:18,720
Now, to me, a terribly emotional experience.

2320
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:26,160
I had never, never conceived that an animal would look

2321
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:28,840
at something the way I was looking at it

2322
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:32,360
and knew and know that I was looking at my whole view

2323
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:35,600
of animals changed in that momentary flesh.

2324
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:42,240
So I would ask this then, a comic about receivers and centers.

2325
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:46,040
Are there any experiments in which animals perceived

2326
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:50,760
something and communicate this to humans in such a way

2327
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:53,680
that there's a mutual understanding going on?

2328
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:56,040
And has this documented?

2329
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:57,760
Is any of this documented?

2330
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:58,840
How many of us have gone wrong?

2331
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:01,520
I hope you know what to get to for birds.

2332
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,880
I mean, it's too much time, I think.

2333
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,600
I mean, there's plenty of examples

2334
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:08,480
of humans and birds having a communication system.

2335
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:11,200
Again, what goes on in their head is unclear.

2336
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:14,960
So the really classic example is the honeygoid?

2337
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,120
You know, the honeygoid?

2338
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:22,120
It's the type of African bird that it finds honey.

2339
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:24,800
And when it finds honey, it flies to the village.

2340
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,440
And it does a little song that means I've found that people

2341
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,840
interpret it to mean it's found honey.

2342
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:33,200
The people from the village, they come out and the bird flies

2343
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:35,840
and it stops on a branch and it keeps doing the call

2344
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,040
and then people move towards it.

2345
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:41,040
And it leads them to the honey because the bird is not capable

2346
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:42,960
of getting the honey out of the beesness.

2347
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,440
It needs people to smoke the bees out.

2348
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:48,520
The people then smoke out the bees.

2349
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:50,480
They get all the honey out of the nest.

2350
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:53,440
They take most of the honey and then they leave a big comb.

2351
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:56,320
And then the bird comes straight down and eats all the comb.

2352
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:00,320
So it's an amazing kind of inter-specific communication.

2353
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,320
But what's actually going on in the bird's head

2354
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,640
is quite another matter.

2355
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:07,720
I mean, you can't know that, but I think it's worthy

2356
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:09,120
of exploration as always.

2357
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:10,040
Sure.

2358
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:11,080
Can I take one second time?

2359
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:11,840
Really, first story.

2360
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,680
I tell this in my book.

2361
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:13,680
It's called The Time Out.

2362
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:16,240
I was working with the dolphin in the south of France,

2363
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:17,800
part of my PhD thesis.

2364
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:20,600
And I was using a technique the trainers will often use.

2365
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:23,560
I was training her to stay in front of me and eat fish

2366
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:27,360
that had been frosted and thawed and cut into three pieces.

2367
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,600
And she was a fairly young dolphin.

2368
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:30,800
She didn't have much experience.

2369
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:32,200
Her name was Cersei.

2370
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:34,560
And she learned very quickly within a day

2371
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:35,600
to stay in front of me.

2372
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:38,160
But when she did so, I'd put the bucket up.

2373
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:40,200
And if she was there, I'd give her a fish.

2374
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:42,600
If she swam away, I gave her a time out,

2375
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:45,080
which meant walking away about 10 feet away from the pool

2376
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:48,200
and just standing vertical and breaking the social contact.

2377
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:49,840
So I was cutting the fish into heads,

2378
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,680
middles, and tails, because it was big macro.

2379
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:53,080
And she wasn't eating the whole macro.

2380
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:53,720
She ate the heads.

2381
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:54,720
She ate the middles.

2382
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:55,960
She was spitting out the tails.

2383
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:59,560
So I cut the tails so that they no longer had the fins.

2384
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:02,440
So now she's learned to stay by me using the time out

2385
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:04,040
as a correction mechanism.

2386
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:08,200
And I was standing at the tank after she had been doing this

2387
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:08,680
pretty long.

2388
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:11,320
And she wasn't leaving the pool, the position.

2389
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:14,600
And by accident, I threw her an uncut tail.

2390
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:17,120
And she went to the other side of the pool,

2391
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,760
looked up at me, spit out the tail,

2392
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:20,000
went to the other side of the pool,

2393
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,800
and took a vertical position.

2394
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:23,520
And I'm, you're laughing.

2395
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,680
This is, I was laughing too.

2396
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:26,160
And I thought she couldn't possibly

2397
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:27,760
have just given me a time out.

2398
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:31,040
Now, that's an anecdote.

2399
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:33,040
But as a scientist, I could never report that.

2400
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:34,840
So then I turned it into an experiment,

2401
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:37,760
which was the unplanned experiment as part of my doctoral

2402
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:38,160
thesis.

2403
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:41,080
I was doing visual discrimination and dolphins at all.

2404
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:42,040
So I waited.

2405
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:43,680
And now I'm feeding her the next day.

2406
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:46,400
I'm giving her all the properly cut fish.

2407
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:47,240
And she stays.

2408
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:49,000
And then the next day, on purpose,

2409
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,240
I gave her another uncut tail.

2410
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:52,520
And Bunch goes across the pool, does it again.

2411
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,000
So I think that's a beautiful example

2412
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,480
of how we synchronize our patterns of behavior.

2413
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:58,320
And perhaps there is more joint attention

2414
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,760
and mutual understanding in how other animals can do it.

2415
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:01,760
So that, I just thought I'd.

2416
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:02,760
That's it.

2417
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:03,760
Go ahead.

2418
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:04,760
Yeah.

2419
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:07,600
Was my understanding growing up when I read these texts about animal

2420
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:11,320
behavior, that intelligence was defined as your ability

2421
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:12,200
to learn.

2422
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:15,680
And if that takes whatever they learn from the experience,

2423
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:18,120
which is based on chance, their current,

2424
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:21,720
it's been actively used to solve problems.

2425
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:25,600
That was generally the accepted definition of intelligence.

2426
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:28,640
And also, relationship with communication and language,

2427
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:29,920
I think was that, I guess you'd say

2428
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:31,440
that language is a form of communication.

2429
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,200
Not all communication is language.

2430
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:36,040
But it's, yeah, a lot of cases where

2431
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:38,520
language is used to discourage communication.

2432
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:41,400
So we all know instances of that.

2433
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:43,600
And we say, we're also getting to it

2434
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:47,680
is that the ability of animals learning from each other

2435
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:49,760
is, I can think of the Japanese monkeys,

2436
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:52,000
Makako, from Scotty, that they would,

2437
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,400
it comes from when there was a,

2438
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:56,520
that's taking the sweet potato dipping in salt water

2439
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,480
and running from the dirt and also

2440
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:01,080
would make it a tasteier for them.

2441
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:06,080
And the other thing is, giving them hands full of rice

2442
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:08,360
to make sure it's sand and they figure it,

2443
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:11,280
wouldn't figure it out, that if you drop it in water,

2444
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,520
the rice will pull to the surface and sand will sink.

2445
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,080
And the other monkeys start to pick,

2446
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:16,960
and they've been able to communicate

2447
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:19,000
just to each other how to do that.

2448
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
And with, here's what the mechanism was,

2449
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,080
the muzzle there, which is just boiled down

2450
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:25,400
to the old phrase monkey, see monkey do.

2451
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:28,760
That's what we go for that?

2452
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:31,200
I think it probably is monkey, see monkey do.

2453
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:36,120
There's teaching as far as we know

2454
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:38,920
is not very commonly observed really.

2455
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:41,000
I mean, it depends on how you define it,

2456
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,280
but there's no real good proof of teaching

2457
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:46,760
as opposed to just kind of observational evidence

2458
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,440
and repetition and things like this.

2459
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,000
And actually, it's quite interesting,

2460
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:50,840
because when you...

2461
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:53,640
The definition between teaching and repetition.

2462
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:58,480
The individual undertaking the behavior

2463
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,520
is doing it specifically with the aim

2464
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:03,520
of the other individual learning how to do it.

2465
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,360
And there's...

2466
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:05,760
Rather than just doing it and other individuals

2467
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:06,600
can be...

2468
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:07,440
There's non-optimal repetition.

2469
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:11,200
So, for example, in the famous Gombe chimps

2470
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,800
with the kitty determinates,

2471
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:16,080
people will watch the adult female will sit there for hours

2472
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:19,480
and stick the stick in and pull the termites out.

2473
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:22,840
And the young ones will sit then watch very intently.

2474
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:26,000
And people, first sort of casually say,

2475
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,360
oh, well, they're teaching the mothers teaching the young ones

2476
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:30,600
because eventually the older one learns how to do it.

2477
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:32,160
And they go through a lot of trial and error

2478
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:33,720
and they do it very poorly.

2479
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:35,840
The distinguishing characteristics is that

2480
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:37,800
if there were actual teaching going on,

2481
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:40,640
the mother would be, or the adult female in that situation,

2482
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:42,800
would be doing it non-optimal.

2483
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,200
She wouldn't simply be optimizing her own ability

2484
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:46,040
to get the termites.

2485
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:46,960
She would be doing it slower.

2486
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,880
She would be changing her body position.

2487
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,760
She would be correcting the young one.

2488
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:51,600
So they're right.

2489
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:52,440
When she's finished.

2490
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:55,200
Thousands of examples in humans that we call teaching

2491
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:57,520
that go right with your second definition.

2492
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:00,120
So we call it teaching, but it's not teaching.

2493
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:02,280
If it's not intentional, if we're,

2494
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:05,520
I mean, I learned how to change a tire watching my dad

2495
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:07,520
before he actually took the time to teach you.

2496
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:10,120
So when I watch a wild killer whale parent

2497
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:12,840
go and grab a seal off the beach

2498
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:16,160
and then take it and put it in front of their offspring

2499
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:18,120
and give it to the offspring.

2500
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:20,040
And the offspring sort of plays with it.

2501
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:22,360
And the seal ones where the mother goes and gets it again

2502
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,880
and puts it back in front of the baby.

2503
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:27,760
And that she is, isn't she teaching?

2504
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:28,680
I just think one of our points is

2505
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:30,640
I can mention that we're not running cat family.

2506
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:31,480
But don't.

2507
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:32,480
Right.

2508
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:33,480
I was like, yeah.

2509
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:35,400
Well, sometimes the mother would disable it

2510
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:37,920
so he can escape and set the stage to learning

2511
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,520
so that the young figure out how to sell

2512
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,880
hadn't just tear it in the environment.

2513
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:44,680
Like, you know, they said to stage the work.

2514
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:46,520
It just like first, that we learn to fly

2515
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,360
and that parents, the parents just kind of

2516
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:50,360
set the stage out and get encouraged by them.

2517
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:52,400
And I think that's the big distinguishing characteristic

2518
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:55,240
because in both of, it gets nuanced.

2519
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:56,720
And I don't like all the terminology

2520
01:59:56,720 --> 02:00:00,560
between teaching and learning and experiential opportunities.

2521
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:03,240
But the situations that you described and also with the cats

2522
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:06,400
is they didn't actually teach them to do the kill.

2523
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,040
They provided opportunities for them

2524
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:09,520
to practice the skills that were innate.

2525
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:14,720
So what do you call a woman teaching 10-year-olds in a school?

2526
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:16,400
You don't call it teaching?

2527
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:18,000
I call it a stereotype.

2528
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:18,520
Sorry.

2529
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,040
What are we talking about?

2530
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:26,760
So what you just described is a perfect description

2531
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:29,720
of what many humans do to other humans,

2532
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:30,760
and we call it teaching.

2533
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:33,920
But you just said it's not teaching.

2534
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:35,080
I'm not sure I follow you.

2535
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:35,600
OK.

2536
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:36,760
Just go through your definition.

2537
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:37,800
Go through that example again.

2538
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,040
You just describe teaching.

2539
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:45,680
Right?

2540
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:48,960
I think when it gets to some of these,

2541
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:49,960
it gets very close.

2542
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:51,960
And I think, again, there's a bit.

2543
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:55,960
And I think it should be done over glasses of whiskey.

2544
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:57,960
Since we're running out of time,

2545
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:00,960
I was just listening to me some interest in this whole animal

2546
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,960
saving human thing.

2547
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:04,960
And there's not really any need to go to zoos

2548
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:06,960
or even talk about saving humans,

2549
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:10,960
because there's endless examples of animals saving other animals

2550
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,960
of completely different species.

2551
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,960
There are lions that have saved,

2552
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:18,960
maybe Angelo, there are lions that have saved,

2553
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:22,960
and pour off the other lions to protect the kid that fell into the zoo.

2554
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,960
I mean, there's just countless examples.

2555
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,960
So there's no need to distinguish predator

2556
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:28,960
or predator or zoo or non-zoos.

2557
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,960
There's a lot of them.

2558
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:31,960
Thank you.

2559
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:32,960
Thank you.

2560
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:33,960
