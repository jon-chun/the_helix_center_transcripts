Please make sure that if you did receive one of the evaluations for today's program that

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,120
you fill it out and hand it back to someone from the helix center.

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,720
We depend on your feedback greatly for the fulfillment of our Templeton grant.

18

Association.

65
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,000
Nicholas Schiff is Gerald Katz, professor of neurology and neuroscience as well as director

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,280
of the Laboratory for Cognitive Neuro-Modulation at Weill Cornell Medical College.

67
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,680
His research focuses on recovery of consciousness following brain injuries.

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,200
He and his research group have contributed several landmark advances including the first

69
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,160
demonstrations of brain structural alterations occurring in the setting of very late recovery

70
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,160
from severe brain injury.

71
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,720
He received the 2007 research award for innovation in neuroscience from the Society for Neuroscience

72
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,680
for his research on arousal regulation and deep brain's electrical stimulation demonstrating

73
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,400
that long lasting severe cognitive disability may be influenced by electrical stimulation

74
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:40,360
of the human central thalamus and now to our roundtable.

75
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:47,600
I thought I'd get you started by saying that two weeks ago we showed the movie Particle

76
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,440
Fever here and the documentary and then we had a roundtable afterwards and as you know

77
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,120
that was about detecting the Higgs boson.

78
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,720
So my question to you is if we can detect Higgs boson why are we having so much trouble

79
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,720
with consciousness?

80
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Sure.

81
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:21,280
I guess there's a lot of things that make consciousness distinctive and difficult.

82
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,240
This is supposed to be objective but consciousness is this quintessentially subjective

83
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
phenomenon.

84
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,600
It's defined as subjective experience, this subjective experience of the mind and of

85
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
the world.

86
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,400
We want to explain everything in terms of objective mechanisms.

87
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,520
That's what we do in science and there seems to be this potential gap in the explanation

88
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,080
between the level of objective mechanisms, how one thing causes another thing and this

89
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,480
billiard ball causation in the universe and consciousness.

90
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,240
How is it that this giant network of neurons we have in the head objectively hooked up

91
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
bring about consciousness?

92
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,800
Now this doesn't mean you can't do science on it.

93
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:14,640
One of the wonderful things that's happened in the last 20 or years now has been an exploding

94
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,880
science of consciousness.

95
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,680
The neuroscientists have been studying it making all kinds of progress on finding the

96
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,320
bits of the brain that go along with bits of consciousness.

97
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,080
But it is for now a science of correlation.

98
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,400
We know that some bits of the brain go along with some bits of consciousness.

99
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,800
We're still working on the part which is about explanation and I think it's these issues

100
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,560
about explanation that really make the study of consciousness difficult.

101
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,560
I'll take a stab at following that up.

102
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,680
I think the evolution and the maturity of theory in physical science is just so vastly

103
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,120
beyond what it is in biological science to give you an idea of what consciousness, what

104
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,280
the rules of the game might be for causal creation of consciousness in a central nervous

105
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
system.

106
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,640
And the measurements that we have that we can link correlationally are few and far

107
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,240
between so we're just very far behind the curve of anything like what got you to a

108
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,280
Higgs boson, a theory predicting a particular phenomena in the physical structure of the

109
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
brain that's linked to consciousness.

110
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,120
It's very hard actually to know if somebody can't show you any response whether they're

111
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
conscious.

112
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,360
That's a large operational part of what we do at the interface of clinical medicine

113
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,040
and research to try to understand retained consciousness in a structurally injured brain

114
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,560
because we don't have rules that say, okay, you know, if you have these parts of the

115
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,520
brain in there and these states, you definitely have consciousness.

116
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:50,160
Another problem with trying to explain consciousness is that sort of like other phenomenon

117
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,080
science, when you observe them, you don't necessarily expect them to change fundamentally

118
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,600
upon observation but the nature of consciousness is that the observer in the observed are the

119
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
same thing.

120
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,680
What it is to have a conscious mind is to be an observer, to have a point of view.

121
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,040
And so, I mean, the physicists are familiar with this phenomenon.

122
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,800
You know, if you're looking at a conscious state or a conscious process, in virtue of

123
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,560
looking at it, have you artificially changed the thing, the very thing you're supposed

124
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,720
to be explaining?

125
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,720
And so how do you get behind being the observer in focus on the real phenomenon as it's

126
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
happening?

127
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,240
So I'd also agree with these reasons for why this is a difficult problem to try to understand

128
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
consciousness.

129
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,480
But I think it's nice that David came up with this catchphrase of the hard problem of consciousness

130
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,240
because note that he didn't decide to talk about the impossible problem of consciousness.

131
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,480
He didn't say it was that difficult as to be impossible.

132
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,280
There is a science of consciousness and that's moving forward as he mentioned and will continue

133
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
to move forward.

134
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,080
So we admit to it being a difficult problem, but I'm not sure if we think it's impossible.

135
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,080
That's the spirit.

136
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Yeah?

137
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:15,160
Was this going to follow up on the observer aspect?

138
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,400
I mean, it may be that that aspect of the problem is the thing that makes it hard.

139
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,960
I mean, that's the question, question-wise, it's so hard.

140
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,640
If you follow Richard Feynman that if I want to understand something, I have to be able

141
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,040
to model it.

142
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,800
What you're asking of an understanding of consciousness is the ability to model myself.

143
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,840
And I think there's something fundamentally impossible about a system that can model

144
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,200
itself because it has to represent itself.

145
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,320
And so if it does that, it has to represent that representation and that infinitum.

146
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,400
So there may be something deeply problematic and deeply hard about the brain modeling

147
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,640
itself which is not an aspect of modeling the Higgs boson.

148
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,200
It's very interesting for me to hear your example of the Higgs boson.

149
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,800
Since about 40 years ago, I started my graduate studies, it's hard to imagine 40 years, but

150
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,120
what I did was to compute, to make computations of the Higgs boson.

151
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,160
And I had many different interests.

152
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:25,360
It was hard to choose, so I tried to do a double PhD in particle physics in astronomy,

153
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,240
the very largest and the very smallest because they are the simplest.

154
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,200
This scale is the most difficult to understand.

155
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,320
And by the time I got my PhD, I got a feeling that it might take a while for the Higgs boson

156
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,800
to be discovered.

157
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,840
So I decided to become a astrophysicist rather than a Higgs boson specialist.

158
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:48,960
And I'm glad I did because most of my career, I would have to turtle my thumbs.

159
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:59,200
What you said about physics, so being so different from other brain studies, I think

160
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,760
there are three big problems in all of science, the three biggest problems.

161
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,640
Where does matter come from?

162
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,280
Where does life come from?

163
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,640
Where does consciousness come from?

164
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,880
And the where is really a why question.

165
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
Why is there a matter?

166
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Why is there a life?

167
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
Why is there a consciousness?

168
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,560
If you would have nothing at all, you would never expect that to be something.

169
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,520
Forget about who is asking the questions but in principle.

170
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,960
So big surprise, there is something at all.

171
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,920
And then if you have physics and chemistry, who would have guessed a living cell, so complicated,

172
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,640
big surprise, and giving simple life, who would have guessed consciousness?

173
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,840
So the three questions can also be formulated.

174
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,600
Why is there a matter?

175
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,360
Why is there life?

176
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,160
Why is there the ability to ask?

177
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,640
Why is there life?

178
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,400
Why is there consciousness?

179
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,000
And that is that feedback loop.

180
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,960
But Dave, you think there are some hard problems that can't be solved.

181
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,360
So you think there is an impossible problem with consciousness?

182
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,080
Oh, I think we have a scientific theory of consciousness and I've been very invested

183
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,520
in the movement to work towards such a science.

184
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,000
I think some theories will be good theories and some theories will be bad theories.

185
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,560
So for example, some people out there would like to just reduce consciousness to a process

186
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,400
in the brain and say, oh, there is to consciousness is some neurophysiological process and we

187
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:38,960
can give a complete explanation of consciousness in terms of a bunch of neural firings in the

188
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
brain.

189
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,360
I think that kind of theory, although it's a great thing to aim for, but I think that

190
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,000
kind of theory isn't going to work.

191
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,720
Any explanation that's wholly in terms of the neurophysiology of the brain is basically

192
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,760
going to explain a bunch of the things we do, you know, ability to get around in the world

193
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,280
and to respond and so on.

194
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,920
But it's always going to leave out the subjective experience.

195
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,960
So I've argued that we need a different kind of theory when that takes consciousness as

196
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,520
something fundamental in the world and connects it to all of these other things.

197
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,960
But I would still see that as a solution to the hard problem.

198
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,040
The hard problem is explaining how is it that consciousness arises from the processes in

199
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
the brain.

200
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,800
It's just I think you need, you know, you need to, the standard methods we've developed

201
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,520
so far in neuroscience and they go so far and I think a lot of people agree we need new

202
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
methods.

203
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,520
The question is what are those new methods and new theories?

204
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,960
What are those new methods?

205
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,160
Why would you need new theories?

206
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,000
Why not just figure out the way, I mean you know what brings about consciousness, don't

207
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,400
you?

208
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,160
You said firing of millions or billions of neurons.

209
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,600
So you know what brings it about.

210
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Coffee.

211
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Coffee.

212
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Yes.

213
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,600
But how does coffee bring about consciousness?

214
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,240
I don't think that we do know that.

215
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:17,040
I think what we have are very good understandings of state correlations and brain state and likelihood

216
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
of consciousness.

217
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,360
And that's better than nothing.

218
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,200
And it gives us a clue about what aspects of neuronal function are more or less important

219
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,760
to wafer consciousness for example.

220
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,200
And that's I think probably where our best correlational data are right now.

221
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,200
But it's actually not good enough for you to just get the brain data and to make a reasonable

222
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,600
or fiducial inference about whether somebody actually is conscious.

223
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,080
You can make a pretty good risk assessment I think and an increasingly good risk assessment

224
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,200
and that's different.

225
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,520
If you wanted to do this partition of problem.

226
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:02,040
If there was a problem of how does consciousness arise from neuronal processes, that presumably

227
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:08,240
is easier than the reverse question is how does consciousness affect or influence or

228
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,000
nuance neural processing.

229
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Absolutely.

230
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,800
So your job in terms of detecting conscious level I think is a testament to the fact that

231
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,760
there's an enormous amount of progress made in mapping from the biophysics to the conscious

232
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
level.

233
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,000
I thought the deeper problem is getting back again.

234
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,680
But I think quite frankly it's a very sort of humbling job because you're often left

235
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,640
with a very wide variance of uncertainty.

236
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,560
And as you say I mean once you get to the idea that consciousness might have some emerging

237
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,000
effects like a dynamic element that on top of the brain then has causal effect on the

238
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
structure.

239
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,120
We don't have a model that gets us even close to those sorts of questions yet.

240
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,560
So I mean from my point of view but that's maybe a limited understanding.

241
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,160
But do you see that margin of uncertainty decreasing through the years?

242
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,400
Yeah no I mean I think we're making a lot of progress.

243
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,560
It's just that we're not anywhere near a standard model which would produce something like a

244
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,040
prediction about something from theory that we might then go measure in the brain and say

245
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,680
aha this model is right and that's sort of the amazing thing about the big suppose I

246
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
think.

247
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,080
But Dave is making the assumption that no physiological theory will ever be.

248
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:31,520
He's sufficient he prefers a theory with consciousness as a primitive which is a fine alternative

249
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,960
for theory but your assumption that a neurophysiological theory is going to come up short is really

250
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,640
based on our current understanding of consciousness.

251
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,800
And you're projecting about future theories of consciousness that haven't been presented

252
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
yet.

253
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
So how do we.

254
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,000
Well one thing why should the rest of us I don't know if the rest of us are convinced

255
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,720
but why should the rest of us be convinced that none of those future theories are going

256
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,800
to provide what you say you don't think is possible.

257
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,280
Well I think it depends I mean different people are going to get off the bus at different

258
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
points.

259
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,400
First of all is to make a point about current theories I mean is what current theories

260
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,800
gives us basically of a level of correlation.

261
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:19,480
I mean what we are getting is this connection from this mapping I think as Kyle was putting

262
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:26,560
it from neuro processes to consciousness and it's slow and slow progress two steps forward

263
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,240
and one step back but we're getting somewhere in the mapping but it's still of a level of

264
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,920
you know of mappings or correlations there's nothing analogous say to what you got Pete

265
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,440
mentioned the case of life so let's take one central element to the explanation of life

266
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,440
the explanation of the genetic processes in terms of DNA.

267
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,120
What's done Craig didn't do was we discovered that whenever there's life there's DNA look

268
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:58,280
at this amazing correlation rather they found a mechanism potential mechanism at least in

269
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,080
the structure of the DNA molecule and they told you know at the beginnings of a potential

270
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,880
story about how this could explain the things that we want the gene to explain like the

271
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,960
transmission of characteristics from one generation to the next.

272
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,720
It's of nothing like that kind of story right now in the neuroscience of consciousness even

273
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,480
though we've got we're developing some nice correlations and then the question is why

274
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,720
is that is it just is it just something about the structure of our current theories or is

275
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,760
it something about the character of what you get from these neurobiological explanations

276
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,880
I think the more you look at it the more it starts to look as if it's not just something

277
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,280
about the contingent character of the neurobiological theories we've caught with so far it's rather

278
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,880
something about their mechanistic nature it's all about you know you've got a bunch of objective

279
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,320
mechanisms which are here performing certain functions doing certain things but you can

280
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,040
always raise the further question why does all that give you subjective experience why

281
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,920
should it be why should it feel like something from the inside so either it looks like either

282
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,880
what you've got to do is add some ingredient to that explanation to put some extra thing

283
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,040
in the base or the alternative and it's a important alternative is to somehow deflate

284
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,280
the phenomenon of consciousness either say neurobiology is something more than we thought

285
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,160
it was or consciousness is something less something less than we thought it was some

286
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,320
people have tried to take that move somebody like Daniel Dennett for example has said

287
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,480
so much of consciousness is an illusion my view is that if you want to try and explain

288
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,960
consciousness wholly in terms of these objective mechanisms in the brain you may have to deflate

289
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,600
consciousness to some considerable extent.

290
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,600
But it seems still that the jump you're taking is from our current the current shortcomings

291
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,040
of theories of consciousness to project that then all future theories have that same short

292
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
coming.

293
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,800
I think certain time and and and not like there's a million different theories of consciousness

294
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,040
and some of them are I'm totally on board with the question is reductionist theories

295
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,880
of consciousness in terms of neuroscience the question is what resources does neuroscience

296
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,280
give you and the reduction of the explanatory base in neuroscience the stuff we explain

297
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,000
everything in terms of is a bunch of mechanisms which come down to certain structures playing

298
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,840
certain dynamical roles which is fantastic for explaining how it is that the brain does

299
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,640
certain things produces certain behaviors and certain responses but for any explanation

300
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:34,280
of that kind you can always ask the further question why does all this objective functioning

301
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,520
give you consciousness.

302
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,880
So any theory my view is any theory caused purely in terms of objective structure and

303
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,760
function we'll leave that gap maybe there are other kinds of theories.

304
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,880
Is there a deepest intuition about what would what would resist deflation from your point

305
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,920
of view is there you know what aspect of subjectivity do you see hardest to fit in principle against

306
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,440
the kind of models that exist or could evolve from those that exist.

307
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,560
I would say you know it's the fact that it feels like something from the inside I mean

308
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,080
there's this classic philosophical thought experiment of a Mary the scientist in a black

309
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:13,360
and white room who knows everything about color processes in the brain and about the

310
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,200
wavelengths that bring them about and about the the retinal and the neurophysiological

311
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,520
responses and about the words we associate with these things but she is herself colorblind

312
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,800
maybe she grew up in a black and white room so she knows all about the brain processes

313
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,240
associated with seeing red which is never had the experience of seeing red and it looks

314
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,760
like okay she knows all the brain stuff but she doesn't know the central thing about

315
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,360
seeing red and then what it's like from the inside that's the subjective experience.

316
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:52,000
So so so imagine a fast forward of existing measurements and theories where you have

317
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,120
and take a fanciful example of an MRI that can map the column space of the color area

318
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,680
and before or something like that and you look and you see that people who can resolve

319
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:09,920
certain collections of perceptions that include one that she doesn't have partition activity

320
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,520
and to five dimensions or something and she does it in four and then you have some manipulation

321
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,640
where she suddenly partitions it into five and tells you aha now I see this.

322
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,040
So is an explanation like that what's an identification of something you might measure with the idea

323
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,640
that there's a quality associated with it not count as a at least a possible explanation

324
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,880
not an explanation but enough of enough of a model to kind of say well maybe this is enough.

325
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,600
I agree it's a model and I agree there's a kind of explanation you get from this kind

326
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,000
of work of building up it's basically building up systematic correlations between these things

327
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,400
you know the brain processes and the experiences such that for example one could make some

328
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,680
predictions if somebody has a certain novel kind of brain process here David Hume talked

329
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,560
about the missing shade of blue the one he had never experienced.

330
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,360
So maybe we could predict that if you had a certain neurophysiological process there

331
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,120
in between the other shades of blue then you'd get that experience.

332
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,560
All of the missing shade of blue that's predictive that is to a certain extent explanatory but

333
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,760
what it's not is a full reductive explanation of the experience.

334
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,960
One example that does exist that sort of this reminds me of right away is the difference

335
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,400
between natural naturally deaf signers and people who have acquired deafness and signing

336
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,400
and the use of physical space and I think it's Ursula Luge or somebody who's done a lot of

337
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,920
work on this and they find that the auditory cortex takes over visual functions and there's

338
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,240
a fluency difference and so people who are natural signers will know if somebody's truly

339
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,960
fluent because of the way they use space in front of them in their hands and place things

340
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:56,400
and there's a whole visual motor component to their language effectively that's not auditory

341
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,880
and there's a neural representation that's novel.

342
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,400
So you know, I mean that's proof that this is all in the brain or that this is an argument

343
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,440
against the philosophical standpoint but there are these kinds of things like this and they

344
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,520
give us a sense that the identifications get larger.

345
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,320
This is what we're getting from the science of consciousness over the last 20 years.

346
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,440
A beautiful set of isomorphisms from processes in consciousness to psychological processes,

347
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,640
some computational processes and some gradually developing some brain level processes.

348
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,480
There's nothing here I think that answers the fundamental question why does all that

349
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,520
brain stuff give you consciousness in the first place rather this science takes the

350
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,120
existence of consciousness for granted as a kind of datum.

351
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,900
It's given that we have it, what does it correlate with and we're getting a very nice

352
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:47,340
science from that but that's why people always want to put it as if by opposing the reduction

353
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,120
of this explanation of consciousness you're opposing science completely but no in fact

354
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,720
the science has been tremendously productive, it's been predictive and some of it's even

355
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,400
becoming useful in treating patients in clinical settings where we've taken stuff we know about

356
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:07,760
the correlates of consciousness and put it to practical purposes but it does leave the

357
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,760
fundamental philosophical question open.

358
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,720
I should say I'm curious, we can focus all day on the things that make consciousness

359
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,000
difficult but we've got people here who are speaking in an optimistic tone of voice about

360
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,200
the wonderful theories that might be just around the corners.

361
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,680
I'm curious to hear what some people think are the other places where they see we're

362
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:35,280
actually likely to be making progress over the next 10, 20, 30 years and what kind of

363
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,760
theories might be the ones that will have some promise.

364
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,520
Gabrielle, do you?

365
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:49,640
I'm still sort of hung up on this sort of question of what the it is when you say we

366
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,960
can explain all the, we can find out more and more about the brain processes and the

367
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,280
complex dynamic systems that are implemented in the brain but we still haven't explained

368
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
consciousness.

369
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,080
I'm just sort of interested in what we think we're trying to explain.

370
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,400
Is it, so we're all sitting in this room and there's this background hum of the air coming

371
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,200
into the room and there's this kind of dispersed consciousness that maybe we're aware of that

372
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,040
and then there's this sort of focused consciousness that brought your attention to the sound of

373
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,800
the air coming into the room so surely we're conscious of that because I've now brought

374
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,040
your attention to it but that's attentional consciousness which is different than dispersed

375
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,160
consciousness that might be just happening in the background and I'm sort of curious

376
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,160
actually to ask the scientists too, so when you're sitting in the lab and you're devising

377
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:41,160
an experiment about memory or what we're experiencing when we're asleep in dreaming

378
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:48,600
states, how do you know that we're studying a conscious state unless there's someone reporting

379
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,840
on it saying that I'm conscious of this thing.

380
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,200
Of course once they've reported on it then you're talking about a particular kind of

381
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
consciousness.

382
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,480
The consciousness that requires access, attention.

383
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:06,120
So what is the clever workaround that the scientists here are using to sort of get at that

384
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
problem?

385
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,560
Yeah, I think we don't have a workaround for understanding awareness during sleep.

386
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,160
Aside from maybe lucid dreaming we know very little about that and I think maybe if we

387
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,880
get somewhere it will be with some brain measures that have a type correlation but we're not

388
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:28,680
there yet but back to the other idea of memory I think one of the perhaps answers to your

389
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,200
point is in a number of fields in my field in memory research one of the approaches is

390
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,760
to contrast different types of memory and so we have a widely agreed upon contrast between

391
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,440
implicit memory and explicit memory and so we understand the brain mechanisms of these

392
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,080
types of memory and how they differ from each other and the interesting part of that is

393
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:55,080
that with explicit memory you can do mental time travel and you can relive a past event

394
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,640
you can have a conscious experience of something from the past with implicit memory you don't

395
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
have that.

396
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,480
Now both types of memory are very complex so we can look in the brain and ask well what's

397
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:12,120
happening to allow those memory and phenomena to go forward and then how do they differ?

398
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,760
What fundamental differences are there between those two types?

399
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:22,040
So that's again not a solution it's not the answer but it's one of the avenues of which

400
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:29,000
there are many to try to pinpoint the essential features that are happening in the brain

401
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,720
and then my thought is as we pursue that we might have some new ideas about what it is

402
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:44,680
that's special about the aware memories compared to the unaware memories is one example.

403
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:50,320
Can you tell us a few questions about the progress that you've been talking about?

404
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,240
I think the progress will come from posing the problem.

405
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:59,320
I mean you asked a very good question you gave an excellent answer.

406
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,440
I wonder whether just looking at the brain as a scientist might hold the clue to the

407
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,200
hardness of it.

408
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,560
So you've been talking about inferring through correlations through statistical regularities

409
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:19,640
and mappings that this is a conscious brain that's making its own own sensory input but

410
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,880
if it is the case that the brain is a scientist in the game of trying to infer the causes of

411
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,240
the sensory information then we come back to this fundamental problem.

412
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,040
The brain is actually trying to make inferences about itself and that's not the same as you

413
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:45,520
try to infer whether this subject is conscious or not or whether somebody is having some

414
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,080
perceptual adventure in a dream during sleep or trying to impute whether they are conscious

415
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,320
when they're not allowed to verbally report.

416
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,920
So all of these issues I think do detract from the fundamental thing it's my inference

417
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,560
and how do I infer that I am making an inference when the machinery I'm using to do it is the

418
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,800
thing that's making the inference means I can sit on top of it.

419
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,680
How about if we make a deal all model you, new model range?

420
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,880
They would have to merge or ego boundaries and they will be all be happy with it.

421
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,600
Because in fact our modeling is a group.

422
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,880
The science endeavors a group process it's not each of us on our own.

423
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:33,280
Can I ask what you say about changing understanding of existing notions?

424
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:39,400
It is very much true in my field as a physicist that our understanding of matter over the last

425
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,040
200 years has changed enormously.

426
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:49,200
So if people tell me I'm a materialist I ask them well do you mean like in 1800 or 1905

427
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:56,760
or 1925 or maybe you are a string theorist do you see the world in terms of strings?

428
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:03,560
I mean the same word matter has evolved from something inert and something objectively

429
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:09,800
existing to something which you can only probe by taking a chance a stance of how you measure

430
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,840
it and something which on a smaller scale can even have completely different properties

431
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,640
maybe even live in a different number of dimensions.

432
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,440
So it may very well be that gradually over time our understanding of the brain mind connection

433
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:34,040
will also move on and what you sometimes call panpsychism that everything has a conscious

434
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,320
component.

435
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,200
The first time we hear that we think about the physics world and then within the physics

436
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,360
world some sort of spooky fluid field or medium whatever which is in consciousness but that

437
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,680
would be as strange as learning relativity theory and saying there is matter and there

438
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:56,760
is energy and somehow the two interpenetrate each other it's so mysterious.

439
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:02,360
Actually there is one thing and sometimes it condenses into matter and sometimes it

440
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:08,560
shows itself as energy and it's not two different things which interpenetrate or interact with

441
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,680
each other.

442
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:17,840
The way William James said it I really like about matter and mind he said if two lines

443
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,640
intersect there is one point where they cross not two different points there is one point

444
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,680
lying on two lines.

445
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:33,200
So mind and matter I can look at this as a physical object but this is also an experience

446
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,040
in my mind that he experienced a bottle and physical bottle for me that are not two bottles

447
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:48,800
which somehow have to be pushed together it's the intersection of both.

448
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,520
I use the word coupling makes a mindful of that nice example about an understanding

449
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:59,520
of DNA and how it causes us to be here as phenotypes and how good phenotypes propagate

450
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:05,320
through their genes in that there is a circular causality which does I think bridge different

451
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,200
levels of explanation.

452
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,120
So the difference between the physical bottle and your inference that that is a bottle causing

453
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:20,200
the sensations caused by physical bottles that's one example of closing that circular causality

454
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,320
that I think does bridge the levels.

455
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,880
So I think the deflationary expressions are unsatisfactory because they deny the challenge

456
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,440
of coupling the levels of explanation into experiences and beliefs which basically means

457
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:42,040
that neuroscience has to have a formal machinery to explain quantify and write down beliefs.

458
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:47,280
It's as simple as that and once you've done that you can then work out how neuronal firing

459
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,280
causes beliefs and then you can work out how beliefs change neural firing.

460
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:58,160
In this case to your state example which is a very it's not a theoretical example for

461
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,360
me it's an example that kind of enlarges in many of the cases that we see because almost

462
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,440
all of them are like your neuroscientists in a room when they're hard if there's no

463
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,400
output and you start to have correlations that get you close to states that look like

464
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,600
states when that person doesn't have a motor problem they can talk to you and do lots of

465
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,840
things but then you have this kind of limited set of measurements to try and you might not

466
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,840
get a response that's expected.

467
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,320
In other words they seem to have the right parts of the brain they should be able to

468
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,840
if they were just awake and conscious and in the state that you were I were in and do

469
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,600
a few things that you could measure and reliably get the result and you don't.

470
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,040
So then is it is at their point of view are they in a lucid dreaming like state are they

471
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,320
in some other you know altered consciousness because we don't have a model that says you

472
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,760
know you get represent representational stuff with subjectivity when all this happens in

473
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,600
the brain and if you're missing this aspect of it you kind of don't or actually it's

474
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,160
as if you know you're there but you're not really aware so you're not taking in the sensory

475
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,280
information and processing it the way you would be if you were kind of admitting to

476
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,480
the world around you being real.

477
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,120
I mean they're just an endless number of variations on it that you could sit there and kind of

478
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:17,360
wonder is that what I'm looking at.

479
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:27,040
I am assuming that you can in your lab say this person is conscious this person is comatose

480
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,160
and this person is dead.

481
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Well okay let's start with the last two.

482
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,800
Okay okay because no because I think you know that's that's meaningful so we know when

483
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,680
someone's dead okay and that's actually and that's the most unambiguous and not present

484
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:55,080
with uncertainty and determination that we can make given all of our available tools

485
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:00,520
and so the only time that that becomes an issue of uncertainty is that sometimes we're relying

486
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,240
on a subset of those tools because it's not practical to make every possible measurement

487
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,560
to determine that every person dead person is dead okay but it is it is possible to unambiguously

488
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,280
unequivocally figure out if somebody is dead that we understand.

489
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:22,360
Coma is also a state that has not too much ambiguity somebody who's comatose with the

490
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:28,960
right reasons to be comatose in terms of medical problems the correlational data that goes

491
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,800
along with being in a deep coma doesn't have a lot of variation doesn't have a lot of variance

492
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,040
and I would actually say that we shouldn't have a problem identifying with somebody's

493
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,680
in a coma but that's the best that you know this is this is the left hand if we put it

494
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,560
on a linear scale that's the extreme left and the extreme right would be full consciousness

495
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,560
and when you move from coma the next level up would be people who appear to be comatose

496
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,280
in terms of not responding to you in any way but for periods of time their eyes open their

497
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,680
eyes closed that's that's sort of definitionally with vegetative status now vegetative state

498
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:07,000
should be defined or identified by a whole biological context in which the brain is very

499
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,160
severely injured and that eye opening and eye closure is just reflecting a remnant of

500
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,680
arousal the brain stem and activity above the brain stem not being present but then things

501
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,680
get more complicated because that measurement isn't always that that assessment isn't always

502
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,280
followed up with measurements that would verify that underlying model and you hear stories

503
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,840
about people who are diagnosed as vegetative with high level cognition and that we just

504
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,960
had a whole conference on this about six months ago that's just a contradiction and just a

505
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,640
mistake and those are patients who are misdiagnosed as vegetative and there should be lots of

506
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,360
correlational data that tell you that that's probably bad as an assumption and working

507
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,480
that out as a field and I think everybody's kind of getting to that point but then the

508
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,320
next level up is that you start to show some sign of consciousness you may give a thumbs

509
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,920
up you may give some very limited response but you can't communicate so you can't go

510
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,280
and say well what's inside of this person's subjective response and actually what's their

511
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,600
status of consciousness compared to you and me when we can tell you about it and give

512
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,960
you metaphors and speak in sentences about it and then the grading as you go up gets

513
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,200
more complicated in their elements of memory or orientation or self-awareness and things

514
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,160
like that that don't come back and then finally you get into a range of normative conscious

515
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,560
experience which is really pretty wide because once you get to be near normal then things

516
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:29,160
are highly multivariate so it's actually the answer is no we can't do that.

517
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:38,000
You cannot detect what changes in the brain as the person from the vegetative state moves

518
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,400
towards the conscious.

519
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,000
No that I didn't say.

520
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,080
No that's why I'm asking.

521
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
That's different.

522
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,320
You can in a coarse grain of fashion do that and increasingly well and that's the engine

523
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,800
underneath our science.

524
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,800
So you can draw a rough line.

525
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,000
You can draw a rough line with some coarse graded points on the grid and that's how

526
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,040
this game is getting played and it's increasingly getting more predictive.

527
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:08,840
I think it's a great it's moving towards a great science of the correlations between

528
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:13,640
what brain areas, what brain criteria there are for being conscious and for not being

529
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,120
conscious so that even as a science of correlations I think it has to be said it's fairly primitive

530
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,120
in some respects.

531
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,600
At the moment we've got some clear cases where we think okay there's very good reasons for

532
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:31,040
thinking these people are conscious and we know the beginning to know something about

533
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,400
the brain processes that go along with that.

534
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,320
As you move away from the clear cases it gets very difficult you know there are cases where

535
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,160
people aren't responding and I always want to ask the question well how do you know there's

536
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,160
not some residual consciousness there that's not showing up in their actions and their

537
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,160
responses.

538
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,200
Just a question of what instrument you are producing to detect and if you could have

539
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,000
instruments that detect those differences then that would be interesting.

540
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,880
This would all be so much easier if we had the famous consciousness meter.

541
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,160
Just wave this instrument at Niko's head and get a read out of his consciousness up on

542
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,160
the screen.

543
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:14,920
It could be from instruments that detect the activity of the brain that you say is now

544
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,920
detectable.

545
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,720
I can tell you that in practice and this is going to be reduced to an operational set

546
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,240
of problems and I can think of really great cases.

547
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,600
The boundary question that you're posing is what about minimally conscious versus vegetative.

548
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,840
Where you know if you have somebody who has some level of brain activity or some very

549
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:39,560
low level response you measure when is it conscious versus when is it really like coma.

550
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,360
The answer is we don't know how to do that and there's some very interesting stuff when

551
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:48,000
you start trying to make sense of some of the things you might measure or observe and

552
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,880
correlate with neuronal function but we don't have a model that says this kind of brain

553
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:58,640
activity creates a representational, subjective internal state and you can make a few probes

554
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,360
at it and say well it at least has this content.

555
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
There's nothing like that.

556
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,760
I have a question about this.

557
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,880
If you find somebody who can have a minimal reaction like a yes or no then in principle

558
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,280
you would think it can take a very long time but in principle you could can the sentence

559
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,320
out of the person by asking is it A, is it B or whatever in a tree.

560
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:30,080
Yes, you're right in the game and so we have examples on every edge of that.

561
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:36,320
We have patients who we first detect that they can follow a command to move their eye.

562
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:41,200
One woman we saw after two years even her family had never seen any response.

563
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,040
Once that was discovered then a huge effort was made to connect with her and she can

564
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:52,840
inconsistently communicate but she doesn't yet have any way with existing technology to

565
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,480
turn that into a successful communication system.

566
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,040
So we believe she's conscious when there are windows of time when she's aware enough that

567
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,320
she can use that eye.

568
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,520
We know that that state is one in which she has awareness and some of the problems of

569
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,560
memory and things like that that she may have because she's injured medial temporal structures

570
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,240
can kind of be suggested by things she does answer right and things she doesn't answer

571
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,240
right.

572
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,200
We have other examples of patients who have these very narrow communication channels where

573
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,560
you start to get a flavor for it.

574
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,720
But then we have patients who have every correlation in fact examples where their brains look

575
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,600
better than all these patients where we have absolutely nothing.

576
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,320
Now that, there's like the ultimate urgency to kind of figure this out because some of

577
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,080
these people are very young and they're otherwise healthy.

578
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,960
Their problem is just brain injury.

579
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,720
But yeah, so we see that and then we have examples where people transitioned.

580
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,640
So we had one man who came to us who all but one person who saw them thought they were

581
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,520
conscious but the one person who figured out they were conscious worked out a head movement

582
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,080
system so that they could spell very slowly out and it was clear that they were conscious

583
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,280
and then they were given various tools and they harnessed them over time.

584
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,640
Now that patient sent us emails and came back after five years and the great email saying

585
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,040
I'm looking forward to coming so I can show you what I can do now.

586
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:18,160
And you know and over time had evolved a much more full and complete communication system

587
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,520
so that we could see through his writing, through the book he was writing his interest.

588
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,520
He wanted to go to cooking school.

589
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,360
You know the fullness of his consciousness was there and actually his brain was more

590
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,400
structurally injured than the other five people like this that we've been following.

591
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,440
So you know it's true but it's not trivial.

592
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:42,640
So is it possible that you've got this case of someone who only responds by a head movement

593
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,200
or maybe by blinking their eyes or something.

594
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,520
That's the only way they can express their consciousness.

595
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,320
This raises the question well couldn't there be someone who didn't have the ability to

596
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,320
make the head movement.

597
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
And to pick their eyes but nonetheless.

598
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,600
And so we have full questions that we've studied who I worry very much about that and

599
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,640
we think the data give us the probability that that's the way they are.

600
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,400
But you know we don't have the tools to say that it is the way they are.

601
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,160
Do you think they're probably conscious?

602
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,880
Yeah absolutely and the question is what do we do about it.

603
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:20,360
But know that you can measure their brains you can ask them to use the way of thinking

604
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,480
to use the blood flow in the brain effectively instead of the head movement.

605
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,400
So this is where this gets into the heart, the absolute core of the issue here.

606
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,480
Measurement isn't that easy.

607
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,920
It's not often those measurements aren't super reliable even in normals.

608
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,840
But once you start introducing issues of brain injury state variations because of brain injury.

609
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:47,320
So that they may have the material there to do a mental imagery response but their arousal

610
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,440
function or their level of their quality of consciousness over their wakeful periods of

611
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,400
time varies dramatically.

612
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,960
You start getting into complexities about not having a reliable model that says this is

613
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,680
what has to happen this is the state it has to be and it has to be held constant in this

614
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,120
way and you know and this is how you're going to get reliable communication.

615
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:11,520
So you know again these are more practical issues but they make it then hard when you

616
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,960
don't have the communication to make an assessment of where they are subjectively because again

617
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,480
it's an assessment of what's their subjective state that needs some kind of readout from

618
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,960
them to you to make an estimate of it.

619
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,000
And your practical problem is actually twofold because you want to know what their current

620
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,480
state of awareness is and you want to know what the future holds.

621
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,280
Well also how to move them so that they can get better and become part of the world or

622
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,280
interactive with the world.

623
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,480
They're part of the world but to be barbed the community.

624
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,920
That's right and so that's exactly why I think we're pretty close to where the predictive

625
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,600
models tell us what we can do because we would have a consequence if they were better.

626
00:46:51,600 --> 00:47:00,360
So what you're saying now sounds like that depending on from patient to patient even

627
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:06,320
what could be a marker for activity in the brain is different and this actually reminds

628
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,600
me of another thing that William James says when he talks about consciousness he says

629
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:15,520
something like I'm going to misquote total pluralism absolute insularity and of course

630
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,600
he's talking about how consciousness is personal and for every person in the room there's a

631
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:24,320
different consciousness but also it sounds like even scientifically for every brain injured

632
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,960
patient that comes in there's a different potentially different measure that you're going

633
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,200
to need to figure out whether these patients are aware.

634
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,480
In the heart of modern medicine this is the ultimate personalized medicine.

635
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,480
Yeah.

636
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,880
But that doesn't mean there won't be a general model but not brain works.

637
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,680
And in all these different cases if there's for every different possible case there's

638
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,920
a different mechanism that you're looking at then in the normal case.

639
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,280
Well, but this is I mean that's a theory with a lot of disjuncts.

640
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,640
Right now but I mean at some point there should be some simplicity.

641
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,640
Right.

642
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,640
Right.

643
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,920
Like there's brains got parts and they're in the right state and we could be clever about

644
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,640
you know working around brain lesions and the rest of it but you know it is it does come

645
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,400
down to the biology of it so something like coma you know things are very uniform and

646
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,880
how the brain activity appears everywhere.

647
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,760
And once you start getting minimal signs of consciousness then things get much more

648
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,880
complex and they start looking a lot like normal depending on which you know measure

649
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,360
you're looking at and then it's the same problem like what are the correlations that

650
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,360
are meaningful.

651
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:28,280
Consciousness seems very like almost like leaky or something like it sort of goes like

652
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,600
it can sort of go to like one kind of process and that's going to be the one that's correlated

653
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,080
with consciousness or it can leak into some other area depending on what person.

654
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,400
Well, this is why I like to have a model that said you know if you have a subjective state

655
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,320
that has you know that's a correlate with this belief or that I'm dreaming versus I believe

656
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,040
I'm in the world that you know they're both conscious but what's the what's the what's

657
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,680
the measure that's associated with it.

658
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,680
We just don't have that.

659
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,280
The pluralism here is more about the way that you access or you infer that there is some

660
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,280
inference going on.

661
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,280
Right.

662
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,920
I get the impression that any modality will do whether it's a pill or a response or a

663
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,800
symptom of a thing as long as there's some embodied expression of it which can be very

664
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:13,280
different and very individual but implicitly that underneath you think that there is something

665
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,040
canonical about the conscious brain you need to demonstrate.

666
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,560
Can we map to your question though?

667
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:24,280
If you could never demonstrate it would you say that that person was no longer consciousness

668
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,280
conscious?

669
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,280
Well, okay.

670
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,160
So I mean let's go canonical right.

671
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,720
So it's the stuff that the brain is made of is very stereotyped right.

672
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,960
So you know we have certain I mean there's complexity on complexity but we think of consciousness

673
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,160
is in the corticothlamic system right and corticothlamic system has conservation of motifs.

674
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,000
I mean the cells are different they have all sorts of interesting differences but you

675
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,880
know if we had a whole hemisphere we had these rules from clinical neurology and it's only

676
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,480
an issue when it's only an issue when the motor system is out of the game right because

677
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:01,040
if the motor system is in the game and we have you know that's there's some fine print

678
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,120
there if I can hear my colleagues jumping up is it inside the motor system in terms of

679
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:09,520
will to action and other things there might be things that stop you from showing conscious

680
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,880
behaviors even though you have a connection to your skeletal muscle system.

681
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:20,160
But let's just say that you know the issue is you know is this person in a conscious brain

682
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,120
stable but there are some correlations we have if you have one hemisphere you can be

683
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,920
conscious and if you had enough thalmicortical cells and they were in the right state you

684
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,240
know we kind of think that you should be conscious and if you're not then then it's just

685
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,200
because there's something we don't understand.

686
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,520
So you're saying that I mean it doesn't have to be the strident muscle system it could

687
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,120
be your autonomic system.

688
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,120
Sure I could show a cardiac cellaration or a blush.

689
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,800
So the key thing is acting on the world part of being embodied it's somehow I have to change

690
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:55,040
the world in order to express my consciousness or not on that.

691
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,480
Yeah practically speaking but are you saying I mean I guess it's a little bit like the

692
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,760
question can you be a scientist if you can never do an experiment.

693
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,000
You can certainly have scientific aspirations and you can certainly have glorious ideas

694
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,560
about all the data other scientists are generating but are you truly a scientist if for the

695
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,720
rest of your life you can never acquire any more data.

696
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:22,120
Actually that reminds me of my profession of as a physicist the latest cosmology theories

697
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:29,800
have not one universe but a multiverse multiple universes and the best theories we have predicted

698
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,120
that we know that we cannot check it.

699
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,680
So is that empirical science?

700
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,360
No is it science?

701
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:41,240
Well it's a consequence of empirical sciences but it's a similar gray area.

702
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,560
Sounds like the situation you're in that.

703
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,200
That's right it's actually not that different.

704
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,280
Right I mean it's because we don't even have the theory that predicts these things we just

705
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,880
have the observations that you know there are different states that look like they could

706
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,000
be supporting consciousness.

707
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,800
So people are trying to come up with unified models of consciousness.

708
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:04,040
One of the one of the interesting things that's happened recently is people trying to develop

709
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,360
systematic quantitative theories of consciousness that might have some application to these

710
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,360
cases.

711
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,880
There's this Giulio Tiononi's integrated information theory where he basically says consciousness

712
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:22,880
goes along with the amount of information that's being integrated in the brain or in some other

713
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,960
process and he measures this with a quantity he calls phi.

714
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,280
So you have a lot of phi you've got a lot of consciousness you've got less phi you've

715
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,640
got less consciousness and actually the conference we had one of the more interesting presentations

716
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:42,200
with someone trying to apply that to the case of people diagnosed with vegetative state

717
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,000
and related conditions.

718
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,880
I mean this thing phi is actually very hard to measure in the brain but people find surrogates

719
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,560
for it that might at least approximate it.

720
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,560
Protebational complexity.

721
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,840
And so one of the things that evolved there was that it's very very good at the dichotomization

722
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,080
of not conscious and conscious.

723
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,400
So it helps you find people who are vegetative proxies that do the Marchal and that's how

724
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,400
many of these work.

725
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:08,160
So it's very nice to separate people who are in coma, anesthetic coma or vegetative state

726
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,680
from wakefulness but once you start getting into these conditions of minimally conscious,

727
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:18,840
confusional behavior on your way up to normative conscious behavior, there's no fine line and

728
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,200
there's no separation.

729
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,440
So that it doesn't mean there aren't other measures and there isn't a model but it's

730
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,760
just that that's where we're lacking, we're lacking something that gives us an insight

731
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,440
into the dynamics that are really informative about qualitative subjective consciousness.

732
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:37,560
And even within these models, nobody knows, you get this number out of it, but phi could

733
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,640
be one or ten or a hundred or a thousand.

734
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,200
Nobody knows which where on this line corresponds to no consciousness.

735
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,560
I mean I think to know in his own view is that even if there's a tiny amount of information

736
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,360
integrating, there's a tiny amount of consciousness but that's in a way philosophical speculation

737
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:02,120
is a counter-

738
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,120
Yeah that would be, that would convince me.

739
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:15,200
Was this any different than before you knew that cirrhosis of the liver caused ichters?

740
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:20,120
And so you saw yellow people and you didn't know why they were yellow but you knew they

741
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,120
were yellow.

742
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:25,480
Then you discovered that it was because the liver was sick.

743
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:33,200
So why is the manifestation of the organs so different and so difficult?

744
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,960
It's the number of times you said we don't have the tools, we don't have the tools.

745
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,360
Is it just a question of tools?

746
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,800
Well the tools and the theory and they go together I think.

747
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:51,040
I mean you can invent all sorts of models which I think Taunonia has one of them.

748
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:56,840
But and I'm sure in the old days people invented various theories by someone was yellow so

749
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,920
there were many models.

750
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,680
But eventually you discovered why in fact they were yellow and then you even refined

751
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,360
that further and further and further to the chemical level.

752
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:13,920
So why is that kind of thinking not applicable to the issue of consciousness?

753
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,040
Well it could be that it is and we're just not clever enough to see how existing tools

754
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,600
and models could be used to kind of account for it.

755
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,480
But I think it's qualitatively distinct.

756
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:27,480
So if you had other people turning other diseases turning people other colors and there were

757
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:35,080
different substances which there are and I can't remember the history of where it still

758
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,880
pictures came in with all that.

759
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,000
But the I think the feeling is and I think what you're hearing is that none of the models

760
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,760
none of the measurement tools even in principle give a satisfying flavor that they could give

761
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:54,080
you an account of how there's a subjective internally representational state occurring

762
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,040
with neural activity of any pattern.

763
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,360
One answer though.

764
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:05,080
I mean you spoke about that I'm a cortical interaction so my guess is you do actually

765
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,920
have an understanding of the functional anatomy of consciousness you know just being a bit

766
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,920
modest.

767
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,080
Of course.

768
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:19,560
I think the difference between jawless and the liver is that there is it's an easy problem

769
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:25,840
because you know you don't have to explain how being yellow causes liver disease.

770
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:32,800
I think that there's a much deeper issue when it comes to this levels of description and

771
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,960
the circular causality.

772
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:40,200
So what the question is for the brain that might be disconnected from the world is there

773
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,040
sufficient evidence of self-organization by which there is coupling between different

774
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:49,440
scales if you like the scales of neural firing and the scales of belief that might be reflected

775
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,320
in fire or it might not be.

776
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,840
I think you don't need to apply the notion of self-organization to understand the physiology

777
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:01,280
of jawless but you do need to understand it to find out what is quintessential about

778
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,920
the conscious brain even if it can't tell you it's conscious.

779
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:12,160
And I'm sure that's in the sort of hierarchy and in that separation of spatial and temporal

780
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:20,160
scales that clearly you in your head believe is crucially tied ethlaminic orally interactions

781
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:25,320
and possibly bits of the brain which you might say the prefrontal cortex and I'm sure you'd

782
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,720
have something to say about self-organization as something which is you know to crack that

783
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,760
I think you're in much closer to cracking the concept.

784
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,760
It's not totally open.

785
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:40,160
There is a lawful set of correlations and they're increasingly available but yeah I agree.

786
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,720
What you said about Feynman and making something.

787
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:52,200
Only when we knew how to make a pump could we understand the heart and only after making

788
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,960
sonar could we understand bets.

789
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,000
So we are not yet at the point that we can make an artificial brain our computers are

790
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,840
so much worse the hardware and software combined so much worse it's dealing with everyday

791
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,840
life than our brains are.

792
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:15,720
So by the time we can make an artificially intelligent robot either physically or in

793
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:21,080
a computer program ideally physically moving around if that robot can really behave like

794
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,280
a human.

795
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:28,440
I think we will be much much closer to answering the question how hard a heart problem is and

796
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:34,040
until we are close to that these questions of what is consciousness and what is not even

797
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:38,680
on the level of information processing it would be like trying to understand the heart

798
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,680
without knowing much about pumps.

799
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:45,240
My impression is that it doesn't agree with that.

800
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:50,000
With the robot that will become increasingly self-aware.

801
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,400
I don't see any difference in principle between robots and biological brains.

802
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,760
I think it's very difficult to see how all this silicon inside a robot should give you

803
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,560
consciousness but it's equally difficult to see how a bunch of neurons inside a brain

804
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:11,200
should give you consciousness but somehow the neurons in the brain go along with consciousness.

805
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,640
I don't see why silicon should be any worse than principle.

806
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:20,360
I suspect that everything we know about the brain and thinking about cognition in general

807
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:25,920
seems to suggest that what matters is the information processing and the representation

808
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,480
of the world and so on.

809
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:33,440
I don't think that's got a lot specifically to do with neurons as opposed to silicon.

810
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,880
I think for example if you replace my neurons my neurons start wearing out and you replace

811
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,120
them with prosthetic neurons made of silicon one at a time and the question is what's going

812
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,840
to happen to my consciousness?

813
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:49,680
As long as those prosthetic neurons are doing their job right and connecting up to the other

814
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,760
neurons I'm at least going to keep responding the same way.

815
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,840
Is there any reason to think my consciousness is going to fade out or suddenly disappear?

816
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,400
I don't see why not.

817
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,640
I guess I'm inclined to agree with Pete that if we had the robot that was functioning as

818
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:11,880
if it was conscious it would probably be conscious but that alone doesn't tell us, doesn't solve

819
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,880
the harm problem.

820
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,400
We're a complete blueprint of Pete's brain right now and that wouldn't necessarily solve

821
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,400
the harm problem.

822
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:24,040
I would say the harm problem will remain equally hard but our chances to deal with it will become

823
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,040
better.

824
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:30,400
We have not only one example of biological consciousness but if we get more than one example

825
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:36,280
then we can approach the harm problem from different angles and maybe deal with it better.

826
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:41,360
But I suppose David's point about that is if we have a conscious robot David would say

827
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:47,680
perhaps we can't understand how it's conscious just by understanding how the silicon works.

828
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,680
We'd have to invoke a primitive of consciousness to understand it.

829
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:57,840
So you're speculating about our theory about any kind of consciousness that it's silicon

830
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,440
even though you built it.

831
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,800
I guess you would say even though we built this conscious robot we don't know how it

832
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,480
works just by thinking about silicon.

833
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:10,200
We have to invoke something else and that's what I'm not really to take that point.

834
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,400
I don't know how we're going to have to explain that theory later and maybe we will be able

835
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,640
to explain it by thinking about how the silicon works.

836
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,600
But David already knows that that's not going to be sufficient.

837
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:26,240
One thing that is likely true, once we can produce these computational bases for consciousness

838
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:31,960
and robots we'll have the room to do a whole bunch of experiments like come up with variations

839
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:37,080
on the computational system and take this part away and take this part away and see what

840
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:41,800
matters in producing the consciousness associated responses that might actually give us a whole

841
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,800
bunch of relevant data.

842
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:50,320
I don't know about the ethics of this, producing new conscious robots with impaired consciousness

843
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:55,880
but I'm principle of what the basic asthma problem is.

844
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:01,640
In Ryan's movie, what you said earlier about the matter state, because maybe at some point

845
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,880
there are aspects of the matter state that once you get to the descriptors that are important

846
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:12,440
in the brain, our material to what we associate with consciousness and then it becomes a problem

847
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:17,880
that makes contact with things like strength theory or whatever that become important to

848
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:18,880
the work you do.

849
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,080
Do you have any intuitions about that?

850
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,080
Absolutely.

851
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:30,920
The history of physics when Maxwell discovered the right equations, he posited an ether

852
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:37,800
in which the equations were vibrations and it was just a too bitch leap to imagine that

853
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,360
vibrations without a carrier.

854
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:45,600
But now we have accepted and children learning in school or as undergraduates and we sort

855
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:49,920
of say of how it is and nobody talks about an ether anymore.

856
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:55,920
So I think the notion of on-psychism or any of that, I think that it's an intermediate

857
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:02,960
guidance towards a direction of where to go and what an ether less or a pen, a psychism

858
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,880
less theory will be.

859
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:05,880
Nobody can know.

860
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:14,280
We have to get more data and the beauty of natural science is that if you get more data

861
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:19,240
you can sharpen your theory which tells you how to look for better data and that sharpen

862
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,240
your theory.

863
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,480
It really, it's never that the one gives the other.

864
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,480
It is interplay.

865
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,880
That's my guess too.

866
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,200
The measurements are going to drive this and we just don't have a lot of them right now.

867
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:37,040
But I think what is important to realize here is that until we study consciousness, whether

868
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:42,960
it's origin of matter or of life, anything in biology or physics, you all can start with

869
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,840
space and time and the distribution of matter.

870
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:51,440
Even the origin of life, it's a rearrangement of molecules in space and time.

871
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:57,680
If once you start about consciousness, then our understanding of space and time and molecules

872
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,280
is generated in our consciousness.

873
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:08,000
So certainly we have to really question, can we do the type of reductionism in which we

874
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,760
start with the stage of space and time and then in that stage we find the rules of the

875
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,760
game.

876
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:19,560
But for the first time the stage is produced in the phenomena we want to study.

877
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:24,720
So it's a little bit, again, sorry to go back to physics, but I know that many physicists

878
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,680
are arrogant and they want to explain everything as physics.

879
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:33,360
I try not to be that way, but I use the metaphors of my trade, like everybody tends to do.

880
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:39,040
Within physics, special relativity tells you what happens if you go at fast at very high

881
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,720
speed and how time and space change.

882
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,000
But it's different from general relativity.

883
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,840
General relativity tells you how matter, warps and curves space and the curved space

884
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,840
influences matter.

885
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,560
That is a circle.

886
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:58,280
So general relativity is much more difficult on a technical level than special relativity

887
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,520
and also much more interesting.

888
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:06,840
It can generate black holes, it can explain the big bang because you have the gravity

889
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,600
influence, influencing space and time and space and time and influence and gravity.

890
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:16,480
And I think that is a reasonable metaphor, only as a metaphor, I'm not trying to explain

891
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,040
anything, metaphor for the mind-world problem.

892
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:24,480
Use your mind to understand the world and in the world you have brains which somehow

893
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,640
are connected with the mind.

894
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:43,560
You ready to take questions from the audience?

895
01:05:43,560 --> 01:06:08,480
A while ago, a young guy who was minimally conscious was given something like ambient

896
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,640
by his mother and he was suddenly alert after a long time.

897
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,640
And that's been duplicated with a few others.

898
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,640
What's going on?

899
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:25,040
So if you're interested you can type in Zolta them which is the trade name for ambient in

900
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:31,400
eLife, E-L-I-F-E and the first Google hit will be a paper that we published on three

901
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,400
patients like this.

902
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:37,000
And we have an idea about what we think is going on.

903
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:44,000
But in very short description, what's going on is that in the patients who respond, that

904
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:52,720
drug is creating an activation in an interesting way like other drugs that are sedating like

905
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,120
anesthetic drugs.

906
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:59,200
There's an early phase where the brain has an excitation before it goes down.

907
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:05,320
And when you give ambient or other medications like it to produce these effects, it's in

908
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,760
a low dose, they call it a subsetitive dose.

909
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,760
And it sort of creates this wave of excitation.

910
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:15,440
What we think is happening is these patients are living on the edge of being able to catch

911
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,880
a right on that wave and become active.

912
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,440
And the measurements in the paper and the theory and its elaborate.

913
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:27,840
It says why we think the cells in the thalmo cortical system are poised on the edge of

914
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:31,920
being able to catch that wave and then ride with it for a few hours.

915
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,600
And then over time, this allows the brain to be much more active in an expressed behavior.

916
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,880
And it can be very dramatic and this is all free on the web.

917
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:44,040
You can see the videos of one of the patients where the effect is very clear.

918
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,400
So these are the effects that you're seeing?

919
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:51,280
Well so it's an effect across the whole system of the brain.

920
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,920
But we think that the primary effect is in the central thalamus and the frontal cortex

921
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,680
and that the rest of the system follows the changes there.

922
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,040
But that's the theoretical part.

923
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,240
The measurements are the measurements and they're very lawful.

924
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,720
You can see the paper.

925
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,240
So this is the fancy version of coffee.

926
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:13,360
It's the fancy version of coffee with a lot more bells and whistles and much more effective

927
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,360
at least in these contexts.

928
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:18,040
Most of the time we put it, you took it, we would go to sleep.

929
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,040
So I see.

930
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:25,440
Within the limits of what's ethical to test, are any of you taking an evolutionary view

931
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:30,200
and looking at consciousness in other animals or are you starting from the assumption that

932
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,440
we're the only conscious animal?

933
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:37,480
I don't think any of us make that assumption.

934
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:42,760
However, it is through the primary data that each of us has about consciousness comes from

935
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:43,760
the first person case.

936
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,600
It's because of my own consciousness that I believe there's consciousness at all.

937
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,400
So the only thing I'm certain of with respect to consciousness is that I have it, maybe

938
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,040
that humans have it.

939
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:58,920
Beyond that it's got to be an extension and the speculation that said, I think a lot

940
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:03,880
of people are making interesting models of consciousness in non-human animals.

941
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,600
I don't know if that applies to anybody here.

942
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,840
I would agree with what you said.

943
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:13,480
I mean, ultimately the problem we have is that if we want to know somebody's conscious,

944
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,080
we need some way for them to let us report it.

945
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,680
And so I mean, I agree with David.

946
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,840
I mean, a lot of animals are conscious, but I can't communicate with them.

947
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:31,960
So the human communication problem sets the operational criteria for us right now.

948
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,760
And you're born baby.

949
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,760
Great question.

950
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,760
Yeah.

951
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,760
Same issue arises.

952
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,760
Same issue arises.

953
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,480
I think you have an inference of continuity.

954
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:47,640
I'm trying to puzzle things out.

955
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:59,880
You know, in my mind, a kind of a continuum, if we interject mind, so brain mind and consciousness

956
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:07,160
in an attempt to distill this, I'm thinking there are these experiments in which a problem

957
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,360
is presented to the subject.

958
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:16,840
And in one of them, somebody just makes this, there's a window shade with a thing hanging

959
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,240
down and they take their finger and it make it swing.

960
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:25,280
And in trying to solve, it has no relationship to the problem, which is to bring two, to

961
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,560
tie something together.

962
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,000
And they solve, they come up with a solution.

963
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,480
However, when asked about the solution, they never mentioned that they saw, what would

964
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:42,400
you call, you know, hanging from the shade, this thing coming down.

965
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:48,800
They never mentioned that they observed this thing swinging and made an association that

966
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,760
brought about the solution to the problem.

967
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,240
In my mind, that's a narrative.

968
01:10:55,240 --> 01:11:01,880
So theoretically, it might be possible to, if you have the brain hooked up, to find out

969
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:07,160
what parts of the brain are involved in this process.

970
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:13,680
So we might be able to distill mind to some extent in relationship to brain through the

971
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,840
measure as neuroscientists are doing.

972
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:24,480
On the other hand, to the extent that anybody believes in psychic research, there seems to

973
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:33,400
be some evidence of psychic phenomenon if you accept that this is a science at all, the

974
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:40,000
statistics that show more than a random or an accidental, you know, number of times that

975
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,080
somebody comes up with something.

976
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:48,440
That strikes me like the multi-universe, that you have a string theory, and you can't

977
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:52,800
test for it at the other end of the extreme.

978
01:11:52,800 --> 01:12:00,600
So what I'm asking is, is this somewhere in that an approach where you might distill

979
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:08,160
consciousness separate from mind in relationship to brain in an attempt to apprehend the name

980
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:14,640
of this discussion, apprehending consciousness, in an attempt to apprehend consciousness as

981
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:19,080
distinct from brain or distinct from mind's relationship to brain?

982
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,760
Does that make any sense?

983
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:30,560
I would say the difference between string theory and multi-first is that a string theory

984
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:36,760
is probably testable, but we don't have the tools yet.

985
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:43,760
So either in the future, it could be 10, 20 years, it could be a thousand years, we were

986
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:50,440
likely to find, to develop some sort of tool to test string theory, and if somebody is

987
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:56,040
very clever, they may suddenly realize that among their physical observations, cosmic

988
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,000
rays, neutrinos, whatever, there is already a test of string theory.

989
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,160
In some ways, we are close, so it may happen.

990
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:08,560
Multiverse, on the other hand, if you have other universes which are causally disconnected,

991
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,440
then in principle, you cannot make connection with them.

992
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,280
So that's a very different type of ignorance.

993
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,800
There are levels of ignorance which are different.

994
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:25,120
So if somebody would say there may be consciousness not connected with matter, and if the theory

995
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,960
would postulate that there is no interaction between them, then as an empirical scientist,

996
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,000
it doesn't make a difference.

997
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:38,160
It's like saying there are elementary particles more weakly interacting than neutrinos, so

998
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,280
weakly that there is no interaction at all.

999
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:44,320
Oh yeah, there may be those particles, but they are not part of physics because they

1000
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,200
don't make a difference.

1001
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:56,920
But I'm saying, can you, if with the experiments between brain and mind in neuroscience, can

1002
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:05,800
one get to a point maybe similar to that where we can see in some way that there is something

1003
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:11,040
like consciousness, but we can't identify it, the situation that you are saying with

1004
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:17,240
strength theory and relationship to multiverse, we're not in a place yet to identify consciousness

1005
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:25,840
where we're at, but we can see that it's separate from the reductionist mind-grained business.

1006
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:31,120
You know, in other words, experiment with mind and brain and neuroscience will bring us closer

1007
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:37,280
to that correlation, but we're still left with some X.

1008
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:43,360
I think what you're saying, some X possibly being there that we're not yet close enough

1009
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:51,200
to have a system for, but we can be more certain that there's a distinction now between brain

1010
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:58,440
and mind, and we have an alternative to a reductionist being left simply with that.

1011
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:03,040
I mean, my view is there's something missing in our theories that need to be added, for

1012
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:07,640
example, to the ontology of physics to give you an explanation of consciousness.

1013
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,320
And the question is whether that's just adding, you said X, so the question is whether X

1014
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:15,720
just equals consciousness, whether that's the extra thing you need to add a peat and

1015
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:20,520
a paper 20 years ago said, well, maybe it could be something else, it needn't be consciousness.

1016
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,480
For example, I think his analogy was explaining motion in terms of space.

1017
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:29,640
Well, you can't quite do it, you go to add something, but you add motion or you add time,

1018
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:33,760
or you add time to space and you get motion, maybe there's something else, X.

1019
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,240
We add that to physics, we get consciousness.

1020
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,840
It's just to say that's an open possibility to it.

1021
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:42,600
Well, I could also add to the beginning part of your question another neuroscience approach

1022
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:48,040
to think of when we're dealing with intuitive problem solving is, and your example is that

1023
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:53,480
we can make intuitive decisions, is something we study in neuroscience, and the intuitive

1024
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:57,120
decisions we think about as being driven by implicit learning.

1025
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:02,320
So in other words, their decisions made with information we don't know we have.

1026
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:07,400
And so there's nothing we don't need to postulate some extra process there.

1027
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:12,200
We understand that sometimes we make strategic decisions, and sometimes we come up with an

1028
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:19,240
answer, some insight that's coming out of our implicit knowledge, information we've acquired,

1029
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:23,600
and so we can understand how those two types of memory interact.

1030
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:30,480
And so this is another approach that is not open to saying there's something missing.

1031
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:35,720
We think we have a story there about how these decisions are being made.

1032
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,400
Yeah, I'm not jumping to the metaphysics, but I'm asking,

1033
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:45,040
do you have to say, well, the intuitive, can you find it in the mind brain, like neuroscience?

1034
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,720
We can find implicit learning in the brain.

1035
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,560
Yes.

1036
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,000
And from the dualness of the whole system?

1037
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,440
Well, a couple of things you mentioned, and also to the previous question about sort of

1038
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,880
how far at the evolutionary scale would you go before you thought consciousness of the

1039
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,880
sort we're talking about emerges.

1040
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:05,760
In my little world, the X is inference.

1041
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,720
So in my simple world, consciousness means inference.

1042
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:15,920
And talking about narratives, talking about strategy immediately tells you that you have

1043
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:22,800
the equipment to make inferences about counterfactuals, about things that have not yet occurred.

1044
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,320
The discussion we're having about hierarchies immediately tells me that the model I have

1045
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:33,480
of the world is a hierarchical model, and that immediately puts certain formal constraints

1046
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:41,040
on or differences, distinctions between animates or organisms that have deep hierarchical models

1047
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,720
and shallow hierarchical models.

1048
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,960
So a virus, from my point of view, does do inference and has a very primitive form of

1049
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,960
consciousness.

1050
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:51,120
But by virtue of the fact it doesn't have a deep hierarchical model.

1051
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,120
It doesn't have the depth.

1052
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,720
It doesn't have the self-reflection.

1053
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,440
It can never represent its representations.

1054
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:00,360
I think what you're talking about when you talk about narratives and strategy, again,

1055
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:05,080
coming back to the brain as a scientist, the ability to plan an experiment and choose

1056
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:11,160
amongst different experiments or different ways of sampling the world is somewhat unique

1057
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,160
to higher organisms.

1058
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:20,680
I think that in terms of building sub-organised robots that show conscious-like behaviour,

1059
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:27,320
it is that prospective, both a deep hierarchical model, with the ability to free oneself from

1060
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,320
time.

1061
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:32,640
So you now have a representation of the world, not just now, but in the future.

1062
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,640
I think that's a...

1063
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:40,280
So is that almost like an add-on in your mind, like a world-free object as popper and an

1064
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:45,040
echos would have put it, you know, inference and our deep hierarchical model in addition

1065
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,040
to the basic laws of physics or is it...

1066
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:51,640
I would actually have the basic laws of physics without reflection of that deep inference.

1067
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:52,640
I have a good idea.

1068
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,640
My deal list is over here.

1069
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:54,640
And Brian comes first in the world.

1070
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,640
I have a question for you, quickly.

1071
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,400
So you've mentioned implicit memories and tacit problem solving.

1072
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,400
Do you think that there's something it's like to be a human?

1073
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,400
I think that there's something that's not a problem solving.

1074
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:14,760
Do you think that there's something it's like to be an organism that can only perform

1075
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,280
implicit problem solving and have implicit memories?

1076
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:21,520
So you're asking me the zombie question.

1077
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,280
I mean, sort of, although, I mean, I'm just curious what your answer is.

1078
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,280
So are these...

1079
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,360
Is this like a different kind of consciousness you're talking about?

1080
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,360
Or is there the light...

1081
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,000
I mean, yeah, is it the zombie question, but yeah, are the lights on or off when someone

1082
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
is...

1083
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,960
Well, I think we have to be a little tentative the same way we are with the coma patients.

1084
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:44,960
So when someone demonstrates some knowledge that they're not aware of, you're asking,

1085
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,880
are they a little bit aware of it?

1086
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,400
Or is there nothing?

1087
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,360
And so, is that...

1088
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,640
So it seems that there's nothing that it's like to...

1089
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,200
Actually, you can ask the same question of perception, right?

1090
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:05,640
So if I show you something subliminally and your behavior betrays that that information

1091
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,320
was processed, do you have some awareness of that?

1092
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,320
And I would say, well, no.

1093
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,680
That's how we're defining it.

1094
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:18,120
That's how we're understanding it, that you were influenced by the subliminal information,

1095
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,680
but not aware of it.

1096
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,680
Is that your question?

1097
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:28,400
I think most of our...

1098
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:34,000
Maybe it's just me, but I think most of my life goes on sort of in that sort of implicit

1099
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,160
tacit way of mode of being.

1100
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,680
And so the question of consciousness for me becomes the question of when the system is

1101
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,400
trying to access itself.

1102
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,400
That's right.

1103
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:50,640
So I think most neuroscientists would say that most of what the brain is doing, we're

1104
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,640
not aware of.

1105
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,640
Right.

1106
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:57,440
But even if I speak one sentence, when I begin to leave the sentence, I don't know yet how

1107
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:58,920
it ends.

1108
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,200
So each sentence is a mystery and an adventure.

1109
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,360
EEM force.

1110
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:09,360
It's translational stuff.

1111
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:13,560
It sounds like, you know, people are talking in different languages, and I'm not sure that

1112
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:18,480
I'm getting what everybody is saying, and maybe I'm just being redundant with my question.

1113
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:23,640
But I've been trying to think of this.

1114
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:28,600
Consciousness seems to be graded, you know, and so that when we have, you know, most of

1115
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,920
the time we're running on a habitual mode.

1116
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:37,720
And then if we're doing some kind of pattern matching, and that pattern that we're being

1117
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:44,080
exposed to doesn't fit what we're our expectations, in order to make safe predictions about the

1118
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,080
future.

1119
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:53,920
And then suddenly we up the ante in terms of the amount of brain that we are synchronizing.

1120
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,560
It seems like that reward system, stuff like that is actually part of some kind of switch

1121
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:11,040
that actually enhances the access or the prefrontal cortex to amplify a more granular approach

1122
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:19,760
to a pattern matching that allows for more elementary particles to start to be recomposed

1123
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:24,840
into a pattern that may be more fresh than UVO.

1124
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:33,280
And it is that in that, in this discussion of consciousness, you know, is about this

1125
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:42,800
synchronization process and accessing a broader network that includes more self-awareness

1126
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:50,920
so that we can get some sense of who we are in relationship to this thing that we're,

1127
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,440
you know, which doesn't fit our expectations.

1128
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,280
And so we're doing that pattern optimization thing.

1129
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:05,360
And then that leads to utilizing a different pattern to drive our behavior.

1130
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:09,760
Does that make sense?

1131
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,640
I think it does.

1132
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:15,920
It strikes me again a notion of hierarchy quite gracefully, it conveys all these issues.

1133
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:20,960
So Helmholtz's unconscious influence was right at the level of the visual cortex, and you're

1134
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,960
not aware of that.

1135
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:29,320
As you say, we go around using our vision all the time, you talk about patterns, patterns

1136
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:35,320
by definition are relationships amongst elements, therefore you're naturally invoking hierarchy.

1137
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:41,440
You're talking about speech that has a temporal extent that an instant doesn't have.

1138
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,200
Again, you're invoking a temporal hierarchy of separation and temporal scales.

1139
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:50,640
I think nearly everything that everybody has said in some way speaks to the notion of

1140
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:56,160
modeling upon modeling upon modeling in a hierarchical sense to give you a deep hierarchy.

1141
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:01,200
And for free, well not for free, but almost inevitably, again, this comes back to what

1142
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,160
we understand by the physics of self-organization.

1143
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:12,840
The deeper, the more global, the more fiesque you get in the hierarchy, the greater the temporal

1144
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:18,400
extent of your, of the things that are brought together or subsumed under the patterns.

1145
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:25,280
So a sentence or a narrative by definition is deep, deep, deep in the hierarchy that sees

1146
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:30,520
all the stuff on the surface and in the deep past and possibly in the deep future.

1147
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:35,480
So I think that you can relax a lot of the distinction between unaware and unaware or

1148
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:40,440
aware of being aware or aware of being aware of being aware of being aware and so on, within

1149
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,080
a hierarchical, within a hierarchical sense of perspective.

1150
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,080
Very expensive.

1151
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:49,640
So I think that we try to conserve our energies and we continue to use this habitual system

1152
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:56,000
and then only when our predictions are not going to be met because there's not a good

1153
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,440
fit with the current expectation, the current pattern that's being used.

1154
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:05,200
That's when we access this, the prefrontal cortex and then do this more granulosizing

1155
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:10,920
and may even make a new assignment in terms of a new attractor net, you know, with a higher

1156
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:20,560
node that instantiates a novel pattern that responds to this, this current situation that

1157
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:27,800
we're in that didn't meet, you know, previous patterns.

1158
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:43,480
I am new into philosophy, so right now I'm very confused and divisible and I have a question

1159
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:46,520
but it's more related to pansecism.

1160
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:52,760
I was reading that is the view that is consciousness, that everything has consciousness.

1161
01:25:52,760 --> 01:26:00,320
So a person can show you that he's conscious, blinking their eyes, a dog can show you consciousness

1162
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,960
rolling around but how a chair can show me consciousness.

1163
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:07,280
I don't understand that.

1164
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:12,920
Well, one of the issues with consciousness is it's very hard to know decisively whether

1165
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:15,640
any other system is conscious.

1166
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:20,400
The flip side of that is very hard to know decisively that any other system is unconscious.

1167
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:24,800
The one really good case, as Diko mentioned, is with people because they can at least

1168
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:31,480
tell us what they're conscious of and you can even raise questions about that but most

1169
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:35,440
of us are happy to go along with that, verbal report when it's present.

1170
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:39,840
But when it's not present then we no longer have that materials for those materials for

1171
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,840
inference.

1172
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:48,480
So monkeys and dogs and mice, well some people are prepared to say there's enough analogs

1173
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:52,880
of what's present in humans to ascribe consciousness.

1174
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,240
But as that disappears then we're left more in the dark.

1175
01:26:56,240 --> 01:27:00,000
But that doesn't mean that, you might say, well in those cases we should say it's not

1176
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,520
conscious once you get down to a bacteria or a virus or a quark.

1177
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,720
But I think that would be, you might say that's an overreaction.

1178
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:17,280
There's an absence of evidence for consciousness but there's not evidence of the absence of

1179
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,280
consciousness.

1180
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:21,040
We must separate those two things.

1181
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,680
You might say, well going in we should just say we're agnostic.

1182
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:27,200
So the question is two possibilities.

1183
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,440
The quark is conscious or it's not.

1184
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,560
Now you might say on antecedent grounds it's awfully unlikely that a quark should be conscious

1185
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:36,040
and fair enough that's an intuition.

1186
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:41,360
But there are also philosophical systems that want to say that some precursor of consciousness

1187
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:47,560
is present at this bottom level of reality and there are even scientific theories like

1188
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:52,320
Chanones that tend to at least give some motivation for ascribing consciousness to simple systems.

1189
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:58,400
I think the basic answer is there's no direct evidence of consciousness in systems or a

1190
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,400
long way from the paradigmatic human cases.

1191
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:06,520
At best we've got to work with, but there's likewise no direct evidence of unconsciousness.

1192
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:10,600
So we're left in this difficult philosophical situations of having to make indirect inferences

1193
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:14,040
which may always remain somewhat speculative.

1194
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:28,320
Okay, so I might just be like a presumptuous undergrad student right here.

1195
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:37,640
So I'm affected all the time by people's consciousnesses all around the world in this

1196
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:44,760
social consciousness because I have this social media and kind of connection to people

1197
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:49,080
pass in this room or pass in my direct world.

1198
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:55,360
And so I'm kind of wondering is there that social consciousness is that different than

1199
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:01,280
what we've ever seen before because we have so much more connection than any time before.

1200
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:06,580
And then kind of past that we've talked a lot about consciousness in time and space.

1201
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:11,680
And if we do have that social consciousness is it outside of any sort of time and space

1202
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:17,360
than we've ever worked in before especially because we can travel across time zones so

1203
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:22,720
easily and then pass that with our mental time travel we can go into predicted future

1204
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:26,240
and then also absolute archived past.

1205
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,560
And so we know through that.

1206
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:34,360
And so I'm kind of wondering how is that affecting the immediate research and what we're thinking

1207
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,600
about versus our social consciousness.

1208
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,920
Tonight we're all going to time travel one hour into the future.

1209
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:46,920
So but does that mean that like we don't we don't kind of think about our new social

1210
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:52,200
consciousness that I've kind of termed all of a sudden in a system of time and space

1211
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:56,440
that we've ever thought about it before is that true or am I just kind of going too

1212
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:58,440
far out there.

1213
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:11,240
It's funny because being a physicist I claim I own space and time and you are all visiting

1214
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:14,840
me in space and time.

1215
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:18,800
But seriously it's an extremely interesting question.

1216
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:25,760
I mean I'm a multi-cell organism as you are and none of you cells as far as we know are

1217
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,880
conscious but you have this different consciousness.

1218
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,520
So now we have this internet with billions of people being connected.

1219
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:35,480
Is there a kind of consciousness which we are not aware of?

1220
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:39,120
It's an extremely interesting question and I don't have any answer.

1221
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,120
Does anybody?

1222
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,120
This is a good question.

1223
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,120
Thank you.

1224
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,120
Yeah.

1225
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:58,040
So I noticed that there aren't any historians on this panel.

1226
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,040
Yes.

1227
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,040
Used to be.

1228
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:08,200
And so I won't infer any insult.

1229
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:12,240
I wonder if you think there's anything that the history of the neuroscience is or maybe

1230
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:15,400
the history of ideas can offer to this conversation.

1231
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,400
Sure.

1232
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,400
I'll take that.

1233
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,400
I used to be.

1234
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:22,640
I did a history in philosophy of science degree a long time ago.

1235
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:24,840
I think it does.

1236
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:31,760
There's a lot of very interesting rich information and in my field and the subfield of thinking

1237
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:36,200
about thalmicortical mechanisms underlying consciousness.

1238
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:41,160
There's a lot that I learned from going back to work that was done in the 40s, 50s and

1239
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,160
60s.

1240
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,160
And into the 70s.

1241
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:46,960
Some of the work that was done there is very contemporary.

1242
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:52,320
It's just sort of been lost because of interesting historical shifts and how things were funded

1243
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:55,880
through study sections and through grant applications.

1244
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:59,040
And there's quite a lot.

1245
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:04,640
And whenever you get into fields like physiology where the experiments are hard and there's

1246
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:10,520
a lot of detail in them, there's always something to learn if you go back and read good experimental

1247
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,920
work where all the details were taken down.

1248
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:18,520
So I mean I could fill that in with lots of examples but I think the answer is yes.

1249
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:22,040
There are points in history where people were actually much more sophisticated about consciousness

1250
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,040
in some respects than we are.

1251
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:29,400
I mean even the history of psychophysics, history of psychology in the mid-19th century

1252
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:34,680
was really conceived as the study of consciousness and that was the primary data.

1253
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:38,960
In many respects it was there was certain kinds of sophistication that have since been

1254
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,800
lost in philosophy.

1255
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,560
Well there's the phenomenological tradition say from the early 20th century.

1256
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:49,800
I've been recently trying to, you know, talking a lot to people who study Buddhist philosophy

1257
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:54,040
where there's a tradition of really meditating on consciousness from the inside.

1258
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:59,120
I think even if you don't take on board all the metaphysical or theoretical conclusions

1259
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:03,120
that went along with these worldviews, we've a lot to learn by studying their methods for

1260
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:07,160
gathering the data of consciousness from a subjective perspective.

1261
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:11,760
And I think there is a parallel in both physics and chemistry.

1262
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:17,960
Physics started with the observation of the motion of the planets and the data from the

1263
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:20,960
motion of the planets came from the Babylonians.

1264
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:25,960
And the Babylonians saw the planets as gods moving around and having a good time or a bad

1265
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,360
time fighting each other.

1266
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:33,880
But then the Greeks took the data from the Babylonians and stripped off the mythological

1267
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:37,840
they had their own mythology, the Babylonian mythology.

1268
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:43,560
And they made the mathematical framework and that ultimately helped us to get science

1269
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:44,560
of the ground.

1270
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:51,400
There is in physics and in chemistry the alchemy, most of the alchemy books were absolutely

1271
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:55,760
full of allegorical connections with this and that and the other thing.

1272
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:01,360
And then chemistry came from the distillation of the factual knowledge inside of all of

1273
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,360
that.

1274
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:06,080
So it would have been very difficult to start physics without the Babylonians.

1275
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:11,840
It would have been very difficult to start chemistry without using the alchemy database.

1276
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:16,000
And similarly I think if you don't use the Buddhist database at the very least and I

1277
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:22,200
don't say that in this respect, I say that in complete respect for all the observations

1278
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:26,680
that have been made and all the inferences, it would be a shame if we wouldn't use that

1279
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:30,880
and it would be very different from the physics and chemistry history.

1280
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,120
That makes a lot of sense.

1281
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:35,120
Hi.

1282
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,120
Hello.

1283
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,120
Hi.

1284
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:42,120
Firstly, thank you so much for your contributions today.

1285
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:43,200
It was excellent.

1286
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,240
My question is about beliefs.

1287
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:53,240
So I was wondering if there are any new findings or exciting research on how our beliefs when

1288
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:59,520
reinforced health firmer versus held more loosely, how, you know, what the relationship

1289
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:05,760
with that is with the flow, the speed, the very nature of consciousness.

1290
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:12,520
Perhaps I can address that from the point of view, Bayesian beliefs.

1291
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:21,920
So there's in the past decades, only two decades, there's a theme in neuroscience loosely summarized

1292
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,640
as the Bayesian brain.

1293
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:28,520
Comes along in different guys' predictive processing or predictive coding.

1294
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:35,160
So the idea is that the brain is a statistical organ that's generating explanations for its

1295
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:41,520
sensory imports according to Bayesian principles.

1296
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:47,240
And in that sense, that Bayesian framework does actually give you a formalism in which

1297
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:54,040
you can write down and quantify beliefs, Bayesian beliefs that are probability distributions.

1298
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:58,480
And those ideas can be traced back to Helmholtz and unconscious inference and write back to

1299
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:03,400
the students of Plato just getting a historical twist into the answer.

1300
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:11,520
So much of what I was saying in terms of inference and consciousness presupposes that the understanding

1301
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,200
of the brain's function can be described at the level of beliefs.

1302
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:21,280
And what I meant by beliefs was simply probability distributions over fictive constructs that

1303
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:25,120
explain the data that I am sampling from the world.

1304
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:29,880
But there might be beliefs that are not as well formed as...

1305
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,720
So we say the word belief and we have the belief that it's Saturday and that we're sitting

1306
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,720
in this room.

1307
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:38,040
But presumably there's lots of other kinds of beliefs that would fit this model that don't

1308
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:44,120
have that strict kind of formal, articulate, transferable structure.

1309
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:48,920
Just thinking about the beliefs, the proto beliefs that an infant might have or an animal,

1310
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:54,920
tacit beliefs that sort of work to sort of form and structure our behavior but that we

1311
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:59,720
never entertain consciously but they still have some, they might still have shared this

1312
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:02,720
kind of Bayesian structure.

1313
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:06,600
So there's also the question that the philosopher always asks is like, what do you mean by belief

1314
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:12,600
and then there's these different kinds and they might all fit into the sort of topic

1315
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:18,040
of consciousness but they all might also play different roles.

1316
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:26,160
Thank you.

1317
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:35,720
I wanted to contribute something to the different states of consciousness as a self-report and

1318
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:38,120
have you respond to it.

1319
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:43,040
At 14 I had a concussion playing football.

1320
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:53,360
I was aware of events immediately after the concussion and then out of awareness for an

1321
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:59,080
extended period of time then back in awareness.

1322
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:08,440
About eight years ago I had an experience of transient amnesia which is fairly common

1323
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:13,720
to football players as they age.

1324
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:21,000
During the period of transient amnesia I talked the EMS squad out of taking me to the

1325
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:27,200
hospital and have no memory of it.

1326
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,800
I was driven to Long Island Jewish Hospital.

1327
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:36,360
I recognized the road to the hospital.

1328
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:41,880
I was then out of awareness for about 18 hours.

1329
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:48,760
I came to arguing with a psychiatrist that they weren't doing anything for me.

1330
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:58,160
At which point I was fully aware and quite angry at the hospital that nobody was paying

1331
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:09,160
attention to me which apparently I was aware of though I wasn't aware of.

1332
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:15,080
During this period I experienced and I had to have you react to it.

1333
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:22,640
Different states of awareness that were both physical and implied a great deal about memory

1334
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:32,480
because when I came back to myself as I say it I was aware of who I was.

1335
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:40,760
In the other states though I was reactive to the environment and reactive to other people

1336
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:47,760
I wasn't aware of who I am which implies a different state of consciousness involving

1337
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:56,760
some self-awareness and memory or identity which I didn't hear expressed here at all.

1338
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:01,760
That we have in consciousness a sense of identity.

1339
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:09,600
I'm sure we both have comments on this because I've been on the other side of your experience

1340
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,240
interacting with people having transient global amnesia.

1341
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,920
I took it in.

1342
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:17,560
I took it one more step which I'd like to give you.

1343
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:20,040
I've had a brain scan.

1344
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:21,840
I've had an EEG scan.

1345
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:28,400
I had a brain scan for medical reasons not associated with the original concussion.

1346
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:36,120
I followed this stuff on the NFL and high school football injuries very closely.

1347
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:42,760
When I had the amnesia I contacted the people doing the NFL studies when I found out that

1348
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:49,560
all players after 65 have these transient amnesia states.

1349
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:58,600
But I also had an EEG recently which in fact might have showed me the area that was originally

1350
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:05,400
damaged in the concussion and the compensations if it is to be believed.

1351
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:10,920
The question I have is about identity being part of consciousness.

1352
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:16,120
I'll start because I think you'll have more to say about this.

1353
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:19,280
I've been on the other side of this talking to people.

1354
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:22,280
I obviously wasn't there talking to you.

1355
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:28,720
With global amnesia you may not know a lot of things.

1356
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:31,960
There may be aspects of your autobiographical memory.

1357
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:35,040
Certainly where you are and why you are there goes away.

1358
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,160
But you can be very conscious.

1359
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:42,480
It is a question of what you can access in memory and what you remember about what happened.

1360
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:46,960
And I think there are all these different memory systems and perhaps more labored ads

1361
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,440
will follow.

1362
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:54,560
But I suspect that it's just another example of how you can take components out of the

1363
01:41:54,560 --> 01:42:00,680
integrated experience of normative consciousness and remove them but still have very much a

1364
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:02,360
conscious mental state.

1365
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:08,960
That's why it's highly multivariate when you start looking at what normal consciousness

1366
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,960
provides you with in terms of awareness.

1367
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,640
Because if you are trained to observe certain things you are aware of some things that other

1368
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:20,160
people aren't trained to listen to music or look at a picture or pick up on nuances

1369
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:23,000
of facial expressions aren't aware of.

1370
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,680
That's sort of a small version of the larger theme.

1371
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:33,400
If you start losing parts of your memory or types of your memory things are very weird.

1372
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:37,240
If you go under anesthesia and you are given an amnestic you will talk to the surgeons

1373
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,240
and you will be fine.

1374
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:42,400
You won't remember any of that discourse or any of that period.

1375
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:45,080
But you haven't actually lost a component of your memory.

1376
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:50,360
You just had something that sets you up to wipe out the memory trace for later.

1377
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:53,360
There are a lot of games you can play.

1378
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:58,080
So you're right the fact that you remember nothing after that anesthesia doesn't mean

1379
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,480
you weren't fully aware at that moment.

1380
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:04,840
I think it's interesting the other point you made about these separate components.

1381
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:11,200
Of course our own awareness a really important part is our self-consciousness and our complex

1382
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,920
concepts that brings in.

1383
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:17,960
But you can put that aside and we could take language and put that aside and still have

1384
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:23,360
a quite rich subjective experience to try to understand.

1385
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:27,120
So these are in a sense optional parts.

1386
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:31,080
There may be very interesting parts to examine and important parts.

1387
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:34,640
But we can also study consciousness with those aside and try to understand them.

1388
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:37,080
So there are many studies of amnesia.

1389
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:41,960
Some with chronic amnesia where you can see that people can't lay down memories of their

1390
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,480
experiences.

1391
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:46,960
But they seem to be quite with it in the moment.

1392
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:51,520
So it's possible to be fully conscious and not lay down memories.

1393
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:57,600
So that doesn't mean your consciousness was completely distorted but different in some

1394
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,800
very interesting ways.

1395
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,160
And your observation I think is extremely interesting and is listening very carefully

1396
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:11,040
to kind of what you experience the continuity of your assessment of the neglect in the

1397
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,960
ER which is a very common theme.

1398
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:15,520
I'm sure everybody's experienced that in the modern day.

1399
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:23,040
And then, you know, so that's the clue that there was something that was kind of gradually

1400
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:26,720
making its way back and had continuity between the two states for you.

1401
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:27,720
And that's also interesting.

1402
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:30,320
And maybe it's because it has a limbic balance.

1403
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:40,160
And this is that I heard the discussion of consciousness without the concept of identity.

1404
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:49,040
But is there a sense of oneself and consciousness or is there periods of time in which I was

1405
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:51,720
reactive to the environment?

1406
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:59,840
I argued to not be taken to the hospital, though I should have been taken to the hospital.

1407
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,000
But I have no awareness of it.

1408
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:09,160
Would the concept of self or identity be implicit in this?

1409
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:11,720
Some ways in the idea of consciousness.

1410
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:17,120
People often distinguish consciousness, primary consciousness, consciousness of the world

1411
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:19,920
from self-consciousness.

1412
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:25,960
I would think of self-consciousness as one variety of consciousness and especially important

1413
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:30,920
variety, but certainly not as exhausting all of consciousness.

1414
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:36,920
And it might even be on this view that, for example, a dog or a mouse might have primary

1415
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:42,120
consciousness without consciousness of itself.

1416
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:49,040
And one take on what was happening in your situation is that there was consciousness of

1417
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:53,560
the world without a whole lot of self-consciousness, of consciousness of your identity.

1418
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,560
I'm not sure.

1419
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,560
That's the right diagnosis.

1420
01:45:55,560 --> 01:46:00,080
It could be that you had some consciousness of yourself and you weren't laying down memories.

1421
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:02,160
But there are good examples of this.

1422
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:06,880
So there are developmental stages where self-consciousness becomes more evident and easy

1423
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:07,800
to measure.

1424
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:14,800
And then in other types of brain injury, there are slower, more slowly evolving recoveries

1425
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:18,440
of self-awareness as a stage of recovery.

1426
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:20,880
So you can dissociate these things.

1427
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,320
And there are people who have studied this very precisely.

1428
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:26,240
There are two selves to talk about, too.

1429
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:30,200
There's the sort of self that seems connected to experience, even if it's a very kind of

1430
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:37,360
loose sense of identity just in an instant or a kind of self-identity that persists over

1431
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:41,160
time for which we experience it as relatively continuous.

1432
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:46,120
But when you have an injury or you black out, then you sort of, there's a discontinuous

1433
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:47,560
personal identity over time.

1434
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:53,720
So then there are philosophers who do think that any experience of consciousness sort

1435
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:57,160
of has to have that at center of gravity, a self.

1436
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:00,160
And then there are others who don't.

1437
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:09,120
I wanted to bring up an aspect of consciousness that seems pretty important to me, but I don't

1438
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:15,160
think anyone's really raised this, but the moral implications of consciousness.

1439
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:20,440
I mean, I think all of us think that it's probably wrong to hurt other human beings,

1440
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:25,480
but it's probably not wrong maybe to pull the plug on someone who's already like in a

1441
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:31,040
maybe comatose state or something, but then many people believe because animals have

1442
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:36,440
some little consciousness, it's wrong to torture them or harm them.

1443
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:40,920
But then if we think that maybe consciousness has something to do with the integration of

1444
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:47,480
information, then should we worry about things like unplugging the internet or if somebody

1445
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:53,720
develops an artificial intelligence, if we're not sure if it's conscious, should we give

1446
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:58,000
things the benefit of it out or what's your attitude about that?

1447
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,960
That's a good question.

1448
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:03,920
If you start becoming sympathetic to panpsychism, there's some consciousness everywhere, then

1449
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:05,440
you really have to worry.

1450
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:11,560
I mean, some people think they shouldn't eat anything, which is conscious, but well,

1451
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:15,560
maybe we're going to have to draw the line somewhere else if consciousness is very extensive.

1452
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:19,360
I mean, that kind of, you know, there is this intuition that consciousness is what matters

1453
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:25,440
because morally, but as you start thinking about degrees of consciousness getting lower

1454
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:31,840
and lower, I mean, simpler and simpler systems, you also start to think about matters might

1455
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:33,720
be the kind of consciousness.

1456
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:37,200
Maybe there are kinds of consciousness that matter more than others, you know, suffering,

1457
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:43,320
for example, my carrier, the special moral way to maybe beings with the capacity for

1458
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:47,720
a conscious thought and reflection that carries a lot more weight than beings with simply

1459
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:50,800
the capacity to sense hot and cold.

1460
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:54,400
I do agree with you that consciousness is the ultimate ground, I think, of our moral

1461
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,440
concern for other beings.

1462
01:48:56,440 --> 01:49:01,560
So that's got to be somehow where it starts, but you know, exactly what kinds of consciousness

1463
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,560
matter.

1464
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:09,400
And with respect to human consciousness, that's how most of the law and most of the moral

1465
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:18,240
intuitions have evolved around whether, so the, you know, the, on the medical ethics side,

1466
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:22,320
the negative right to withhold medical treatment or have medical with treatment withheld was

1467
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:28,280
founded on the lack of a potential for recovery of cognition and consciousness.

1468
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:34,160
And I think, you know, what's evolving now is, of course, as we understand the recovery

1469
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:39,040
of consciousness and the variations of potential, then there's a lot of questions about how

1470
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:44,200
we, how we start to look at the opportunities that are for people to become more conscious

1471
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:47,200
and the moral obligations to them to become more conscious.

1472
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:53,200
My colleague Joseph Fins is a book coming out in July called Rights Come to Mind, which

1473
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:58,360
is a full exploration of these issues, lived through the experience of people taking care

1474
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:01,240
of patients with disorders of consciousness.

1475
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:08,240
And you know, most of these issues are unsolved in our system from a legal and a medical point

1476
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:09,240
of view.

1477
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:14,120
So it's, you know, I think you're right to pinpoint consciousness as the, as David said,

1478
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:21,280
just the core, you know, issue around moral warrants and, you know, getting into this

1479
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,280
space.

1480
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,280
Thank you.

1481
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:24,280
Great conversation this afternoon.

1482
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:35,600
Wondering if whether you think it's accurate to grade consciousness from an external perspective,

1483
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:42,000
when consciousness is such an internal experience, i.e. the quality of experience, this whether

1484
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,480
you're a human animal, non-human animal, or an individual who experiences a cognitive

1485
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:53,840
disability question, has research been able to determine a consistent experience of consciousness

1486
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:58,280
between those with and without cognitive dysfunction?

1487
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:05,040
And if so, what does this imply in terms of the ability to provide a universally accepted

1488
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:08,800
definition of consciousness, except in the most general sense?

1489
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:15,040
Of course, we could use neurons, for example, to explain consciousness, but only in the

1490
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:19,280
most rudimentary sense of what consciousness is.

1491
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:24,440
I would say research has not provided a clear and distinct set of measurements to categorize

1492
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:25,440
things that way.

1493
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,440
It might want to go.

1494
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:36,440
Well, so we do our best if you're asking a person to make a decision, we understand that

1495
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:40,440
someone with dementia may not be capable of making a good decision.

1496
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:47,120
They're legal precedents for how to deal with those situations and form consent and so forth.

1497
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:50,440
So we have some operational ways to proceed.

1498
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:53,920
That's the behavior and sort of speech acts.

1499
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,400
I was thinking in terms of measurement.

1500
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:58,400
That's what I'm thinking.

1501
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:02,640
I'm thinking in terms of measurement, too, or an outside evaluation of what it has to

1502
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:03,640
do.

1503
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:08,160
I think a lot of questions circulate around the issues of experiencing a disability and how

1504
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:16,640
we rate an individual and who does not experience this life in the same way we think they should

1505
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:20,800
experience that life and from our own perspective.

1506
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:29,520
And even the idea of dogs and babies and this kind of hierarchy that we are kind of creating

1507
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:35,240
a definition of consciousness and what's of great value and perhaps what is a lesser

1508
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:41,800
human experience if we put in the realm of just the human experience.

1509
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:46,920
There are some really interesting studies of consciousness in schizophrenic patients compared

1510
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:51,560
to in normal patients using a beeper methodology.

1511
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:59,440
They get people to carry around beepers that go off at a certain point during the day and

1512
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:02,960
at that point patients are asked to write down in their logbook what were you conscious

1513
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:07,960
of at that moment when the beeper went off.

1514
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:13,360
And it's extremely interesting even for normal patients but Russ Holbert who's pioneered

1515
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:17,440
this method has done it with schizophrenic patients as well and has found certain really

1516
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:25,320
clear systematic differences between the consciousness in these patients and in ordinary unimpaired

1517
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:27,360
subjects.

1518
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:32,720
This is in a way it's a methodology to take something external, the beeper and the records

1519
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:38,880
in a logbook, numberless use it as a guide to what's going on internally.

1520
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:42,360
Thank you.

1521
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:48,400
My understanding is we have sensory perceptions.

1522
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:55,680
All right we have eyes, we can see things to varying degrees and we have hearing which

1523
01:53:55,680 --> 01:54:03,480
we use to communicate and that I think does affect our consciousness.

1524
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:11,720
So the question is then is what about someone like say Helen Keller who was born both deaf

1525
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,960
and blind.

1526
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:24,720
So what can we say about her awareness or her experience, her consciousness of the world

1527
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:31,960
since she has lacked these two different perceptions or these two sensory perceptions?

1528
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:36,440
That's a great example and actually it's one that got my interest a long time but the

1529
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:39,520
best way to find out is to read her perceptions of it.

1530
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:46,960
And so there's a fabulous account of her early years before Anne Macey Sullivan was her teacher

1531
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:52,080
who came to work with her and to establish her ability to communicate and to start to

1532
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:55,400
learn and she describes herself.

1533
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:58,400
She actually doesn't, it's very interesting, she doesn't even describe herself with her

1534
01:54:58,400 --> 01:54:59,600
own name.

1535
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:07,120
She calls herself phantom and her memories of being pre-cognitive.

1536
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:15,080
She describes them as being reactive to an external world that just she had experiences

1537
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:21,480
with and most of them were limbic and she just, her memory is thrashing out at things coming

1538
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:24,440
into her peripersonal space effectively.

1539
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:29,200
And there's a small section in the book teacher that she wrote where she talks about this.

1540
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:34,800
But you know, you get the sense there's something primitive, you know, awareness but it was

1541
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,720
very unstructured.

1542
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:41,960
It wasn't structured by language, it wasn't structured by concept and it wasn't very much

1543
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:44,280
fun for sure.

1544
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:48,480
But then you get the sense that by the time that she's an adult and you know she's giving

1545
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:57,240
lectures at Harvard and she's a fully educated woman, she has a very full normal human consciousness

1546
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:04,160
with a very unique perspective, you know, everybody has an identity but it's not as alien as a

1547
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:09,240
conscious state as what she describes herself as before.

1548
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:11,400
She had some way of connecting with the human community.

1549
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:15,560
It's very interesting but I think that's the place to go look is what she had to say about

1550
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:18,560
herself.

1551
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:26,680
Thank you for this discussion.

1552
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:31,760
One sees how many complex aspects they are to consciousness and I'm going to speak now

1553
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:38,800
as an artist where the idea of consciousness is since at least the middle of the 20th century

1554
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:46,000
very complicated because a whole series of determinology came about automatic writing.

1555
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,680
You ask an artist what did you mean when you did this and they said I don't know I was

1556
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:57,920
unconscious and one realizes now that that word no longer is valid even for an artist

1557
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:02,720
to say they were unconscious because there are so many layers as we can see as we're

1558
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:05,000
speaking about what consciousness is.

1559
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,400
So if an artist says I don't know what I was doing we know that they were very conscious

1560
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:14,760
on many different planes and levels and so I'm sort of interested in the idea of people

1561
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:20,800
speaking about conscious and unconscious and automatic writing or things that are how do

1562
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:23,320
you see the connective points that way.

1563
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:33,720
You see it now as one uniform level of consciousness with many facets and planes.

1564
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:44,360
Well, so my brother is an artist and he considers his painting to be very intuitive style so

1565
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:50,480
he has a lot of expertise in the media he uses but he goes after a process that happens

1566
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:58,240
on the canvas and he considers it very intuitive so I consider that part of implicit memory

1567
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:07,120
and part of his mental capacity is to do that without designing it as an explicit painting

1568
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:09,080
that he is conceiving it.

1569
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:12,320
It's a process that unfolds so is that connected with what you're saying.

1570
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,800
Well, there's another word intuitive.

1571
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,120
Do we have to redefine intuitive?

1572
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:21,640
I mean, in other words, I think there are redefinitions that become necessary because they

1573
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:26,800
once were put into categories and I see it as a more fluid aspect.

1574
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:33,560
You know, without all these divisions that characterize what's rational, what's irrational,

1575
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:35,560
what's spontaneous.

1576
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:39,880
Well, you know, we have all these divisions because that's how we try to understand things

1577
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:43,640
in science and we divide them up and then we try to understand how they fit together and

1578
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:44,640
how they interact.

1579
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:49,920
Yes, it's very fluid but we take some steps to divide them up because that's how we're

1580
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:55,760
going to understand the parts and then put them back together.

1581
01:58:55,760 --> 01:59:04,760
So, a very selfish question.

1582
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:12,200
What are the easy problems of consciousness or to be more concrete, I guess, what are

1583
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:15,960
you telling your graduate students to do?

1584
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:23,360
Well, back in the original article I wrote on the heart of the easy problems of consciousness

1585
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:29,720
20 years ago, the easy problems of consciousness were basically ones about behavior and functioning.

1586
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:36,040
So how does the brain perceptually respond to a certain stimuli?

1587
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:42,120
How, for example, can we be made to control our behavior in a way that depends on what

1588
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:43,120
it's out there?

1589
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:47,400
How does the brain monitor its own processes and issue verbal reports?

1590
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:52,360
Basically, the easy problems on this definition, the ones all about objective functioning,

1591
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:55,000
the kind that can easily be measured from the outside.

1592
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,720
Whereas the hard problem is about how does all that stuff give you subjective experience?

1593
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:03,080
And for the most part, I take it when the neuroscientists are giving their graduate student

1594
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:09,200
problems, they're very often at least about those easy problems, explaining the responses,

1595
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:10,880
the behaviors and so on.

1596
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:14,480
Another class of easy problems though is finding, quote, easy problems because none of these

1597
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:21,520
are really easy, is the correlation issue, finding the brain process that goes along

1598
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:23,960
with certain kinds of subjective experience.

1599
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:29,400
And that's something which is also being proven to be a subject where you can make tractable,

1600
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:33,040
incremental progress in the lab year over year.

1601
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:37,680
But then there's a whole hierarchy of tractable, more and less tractable problems, so maybe

1602
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:39,120
other people can throw in there.

1603
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:42,440
You never give any hard problem to a student?

1604
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:43,680
In philosophy all the time.

1605
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:45,920
It's only hard problems in philosophy.

1606
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:48,280
That's a way to do that.

1607
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:52,640
So philosophers can do the hard problem and the scientists will chip away at it by working

1608
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:53,640
on the easy problems.

1609
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:54,640
Yeah.

1610
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:55,640
Thanks for your question.

1611
02:00:55,640 --> 02:01:04,120
I mean, a lot of you have been talking about the fact that when we are conscious, we have

1612
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:09,480
a feeling inside that we have an experience inside and then we use other metaphor to be

1613
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:14,720
a conscious, like to be in an inner world or to be intrinsic or whatever.

1614
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:17,080
So my question is inside what?

1615
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:21,680
Because if we say that conscious experience is inside the mind, it's kind of circular

1616
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:27,880
definition because just the thing, so it cannot be literally inside the head.

1617
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:31,560
We do not expect to find consciousness like we find sugar in the blood.

1618
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:35,000
So I just wanted to ask, inside what?

1619
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,440
Well, something we haven't really talked at all about, which I guess we'll wait until

1620
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:46,640
the last minute to throw it out there, is that consciousness is, as far as we know, embodied.

1621
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:52,280
When I stub my toe, I feel pain in my toe, not in my brain, and I don't feel it in the

1622
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:54,680
rock that I stubbed my toe against.

1623
02:01:54,680 --> 02:02:00,960
There seems to be this deep interface of consciousness that blends into the body, even though we've

1624
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:03,040
been talking about it being situated in the brain.

1625
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:06,200
And so when you ask the question, we've been talking about consciousness being inside

1626
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:07,320
what?

1627
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:10,800
The first thing I think of is it's inside the body.

1628
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:12,960
And that gets us out of that immediate circularity.

1629
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:16,160
And then you can say, well, what is the consciousness, the embodied consciousness inside of?

1630
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:17,960
And then that's a different question.

1631
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:18,960
Yeah.

1632
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:24,000
Just to follow up, when I feel that pain in my toe, it's in my body.

1633
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:31,360
But when I see the sound, is consciousness embodied in the sand, too, for the same reason?

1634
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:34,720
When I'm driving my car on the road, I think I'm filling that consciousness in the car

1635
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:37,040
and filling the wheels of the road directly.

1636
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:39,600
It's like the person with the cane.

1637
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:43,040
So the body doesn't, the body is at least something which is very flexible here.

1638
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,800
The boundary is very flexible.

1639
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:49,000
If you have the right relation to the tool, then you feel the person with the cane feels

1640
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:53,440
the strike of the ground, not in their hand, but in the tip of the tool.

1641
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:56,040
I totally feel a lot of my consciousness in the self-love.

1642
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,040
Your tacit memory.

1643
02:02:58,040 --> 02:03:04,560
The difference in you would be the last question.

1644
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:08,480
Hi.

1645
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:16,560
We briefly had a conversation about the morality of consciousness.

1646
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:24,120
And I'm a moral nihilist.

1647
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:34,240
I was wondering, and that is that you don't inherently believe that there are any reasons

1648
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:38,800
to make moral judgments on anything.

1649
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:43,920
And so I was wondering if we're trying to make or if we're trying to contrive these moral

1650
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:50,040
judgments about consciousness, are we just choosing to ignore that it's a very real

1651
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:55,240
possibility that we live in a moral reality?

1652
02:03:55,240 --> 02:04:00,280
Well, that sounds like a philosophy question.

1653
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:04,400
Well, who's to know where morality comes from?

1654
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:08,640
Maybe there's no absolute fundamental morality in the universe.

1655
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:12,200
If you go that way, you can say at the very least what we have is something like moral

1656
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:17,800
preferences, there are some outcomes that we prefer to other ones on reflection and moral

1657
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:18,800
respects.

1658
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:22,160
Maybe there's no deep absolute grounding for that as if it came from a God.

1659
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:25,320
Maybe all there is is what we've been evolutionarily programmed with.

1660
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:31,920
We can still make the distinction between the outcomes that we want, that we think are better

1661
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:35,160
morally for society and for other people on reflection.

1662
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:41,240
And it's going to turn into a question about our fundamental values, which may be contingent

1663
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:46,040
and biological, but we can still make these distinctions.

1664
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:52,200
And it could well be that, well, here's the thing which is what we contingently value,

1665
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:53,200
consciousness.

1666
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:56,120
That's the thing which makes our lives worth living.

1667
02:04:56,120 --> 02:05:00,840
And we all have a great preference for being conscious and that we care about the consciousness

1668
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:02,680
of other people around us.

1669
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:07,120
I'd like to think that even a moral nihilist in some ways could recast some of these questions

1670
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:12,800
in terms of what we value and what we prefer.

1671
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:14,600
Thank you.

1672
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:22,360
I'm a clinical neurologist, one time I was interested in brain evolution.

1673
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:29,040
And I learned that there were four basic stages of vertebrate brain evolution.

1674
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:35,720
The most primitive is the fish brain and the reptile brain and the paleo and neo mammalian

1675
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:38,160
brains.

1676
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:44,240
And in my clinical neurology experience, I also have had the experience of patients

1677
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:50,240
presenting with acute stroke syndromes, which are rare, but that affect the midbrain reticular

1678
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:53,480
formation, which is part of the fish brain.

1679
02:05:53,480 --> 02:06:00,520
And if a part of the brain that controls a certain function in humans exists in other

1680
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:08,360
animals and causes alterations of consciousness, would it be reasonable to assume that a fish

1681
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:13,800
is conscious if it shares that structure?

1682
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:14,800
Yes.

1683
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:24,080
It turns out there are some structures that fish share with us and some that they don't.

1684
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:27,960
They actually read a debate in the journal Fish and Fisheries about whether fish feel

1685
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:34,080
pain and one person was saying, yes, fish feel pain because they have this element of pain

1686
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:36,880
processing and the other one was saying, no, they don't because they don't have this

1687
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:38,320
element of pain processing.

1688
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:43,000
So it just pushes the question back, which is the thing in the brain that matters?

1689
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Yeah.

1690
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:52,640
Well, another point about meditation, experience of people with mastered meditation, you know,

1691
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:59,520
each methods of really turning off the more recent brain structures and getting into a

1692
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:10,000
state which is really like focusing on breathing and getting into your brain stem, I guess.

1693
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,080
It's not so clear though.

1694
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:15,280
If you look at the data, it's actually very interesting.

1695
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:18,800
The states that experience meditators get into are high energy states.

1696
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:27,640
The dynamics are different, but they resemble more wafer brain activity than they resemble

1697
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:31,200
comatose brain activity.

1698
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:36,360
So again, it's another one of these examples where we don't have a great idea about how

1699
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:40,840
to go from what is a conscious brain state that's a little different than your wafer

1700
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:47,600
state and its dynamics to where consciousness is and that and what the changes and the representational

1701
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:54,600
aspects of it are because we never model it.
