I'm Ed Nursecien, Director of the Helix Center.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,040
Today's program is on autism.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,200
And the participants are Andrew Gerber,

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,720
could you raise?

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,720
Andrew Gerber, who's Medical Director

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,880

00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,200
He's Professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,920
at the Drexel School of Public Health.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,240
He's the founding director of the AJ Autism Institute

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,920
at the Drexel University.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,520
Jeremy Vistra van der Wig, sitting here

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,600

He's a child and adolescent psychiatrist

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,280
who uses molecular and transitional neuroscience research

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,000
tools and applies them to find new treatments for autism

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,360
and other genetic disorders.

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,160
Martha Welsh is Associate Professor of Psychiatry

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,840
at the Department of Pediatrics and Pathology

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,240
and Cell Biology at Columbia University.

in Developmental Neuroscience.

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,520
Thank you.

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,520
The form that he's who wants to start starts.

33
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,520
Oh, cool.

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Hey Andrew.

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
No.

36
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,520
I was flattered to be invited because Dr. Versesian

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,520
is a former supervisor of mine and I was trained in Cornell.

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,120
And one of the things that I've always loved about this field,

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,400
an autism seems to me an example of that,

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,080
is how science, basic science and clinical science

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,440
and the art of being a clinician all come together.

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,600
So I think we're all some combination of those things

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,440
here which makes it interesting not things all of all.

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:42,440
So maybe I'll help out a bit in the beginning.

45
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,440
When I was in residency training, we had, I think, one course,

46
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,440
maybe it was two hours on autism.

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
This is early 70s.

48
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,440
And now autism is a very big subject.

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,440
So maybe we could start by you telling me and telling everyone

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
what happened.

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,440
OK, I could start in the 70s.

52
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
OK.

53
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Probably the only one here other than you.

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,440
In the 70s, I began my training in child psychiatry.

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,440
And we were studying ethology.

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Jane Goodall's chimps in Tinbergen.

57
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,440
I learned from Goodall that high nurture mothers raised

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,440
the most successful chimps.

59
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,520
And I learned from Tinbergen that animals and conflicts showed

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,720
equal portions of approach and avoidance behaviors

61
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,720
when they were feeling threatened or in conflict of any kind.

62
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,120
So I'm putting it when I entered an autism nursery.

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,400
And by the way, I had never seen autistic children

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,600
till medical school wasn't common way to do so.

65
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,200
And so I went in there and I said,

66
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,680
oh, why did they send me into this nursery to treat children

67
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,240
when there's no treatment for this

68
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,680
and is supposed to be a hopeless neurological disorder?

69
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,880
But then I started thinking, I'm seeing

70
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,960
approach avoidance behavior.

71
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,320
High nurture could eliminate avoidance behavior

72
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,760
and turn it into approach behavior.

73
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,440
And I set out to test that.

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,840
And that was accounted for about 25 years of my practice.

75
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,160
I started a nonprofit for that and teamed up

76
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,840
with Nico Tinbergen.

77
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,280
In the meantime, got the Nobel Prize for his work.

78
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,400
And I saw that I wasn't making any progress with my ideas

79
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,400
because, indeed, high nurture did overcome avoidance behavior

80
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,960
and autistic children and liberated them

81
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,840
for normal development.

82
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,720
So this was a big piece of information.

83
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,640
Then I started treating orphans from the world's orphanages

84
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,040
who also couldn't accept nurture and use it for development

85
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,920
in a normal way.

86
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,960
And I found out when the high nurture and dimension

87
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,680
got both groups on a normal path of development

88
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,320
and cured what they both had in common gut problems

89
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,200
that, ah, peptides of nurture.

90
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,520
So I left my dear practice, went to Columbia

91
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,960
to investigate peptides of nurture.

92
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,800
Of course, people thought I was nuts.

93
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,080
What did the gut have to do with autism?

94
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,320
Now we know it's a very big problem in autistic children.

95
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,400
And they stopped laughing at me when

96
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,720
I got a patent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel

97
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,480
disease.

98
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,280
In the meantime, I was trying to study

99
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,840
what exactly was happening.

100
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,200
And we've been looking at the biological

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,400
undependents of nurture as well as what's happening in actual patients.

102
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,720
And we just completed a randomized control trial

103
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,120
using my theory of autonomic co-conditioning.

104
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,520
The difference between me and most of psychiatry

105
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,920
is psychiatrists aimed at helping children, even babies,

106
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,160
to self-regulate.

107
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,040
That's the big goal.

108
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,680
No.

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,680
It's a misunderstanding of mammalian biology

110
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,440
co-regulation at the autonomic level, get the mother and the baby

111
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,880
to co-regulate a man that liberates the brain

112
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,280
for normal development.

113
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,800
And indeed, what I found in these autistic children

114
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,040
then was normal development and not even normal superior.

115
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,080
So at my nurture science program, we're

116
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,640
moving up the age range.

117
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,680
Now we've done two to four-year-olds, the same kinds of results.

118
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,760
And interestingly, in our preemie group,

119
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,800
there's a high risk of autism and premature infants.

120
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,880
And just on the autism screen 18 months,

121
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,400
we've reduced it from one out of four to one out of 10 testing positive.

122
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,000
So it's very exciting.

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,120
And other people are finding, yes, some of these children

124
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,320
can be set on a normal path of development.

125
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,160
So that's what's happened since 1970.

126
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,320
And what do you think?

127
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,280
No, that's very interesting.

128
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,360
But you say, I'm coming from, I was trained in Switzerland

129
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,080
and in the French-speaking Switzerland.

130
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:26,920
So there we learn that autism is a psychiatric disease

131
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,520
that is inflicted by bad mothers to the kids.

132
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,600
And it's crazy that it is still like that today

133
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,360
and that people are still, I mean, I had parents coming to,

134
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,760
because at some point I was doing research both in Switzerland and here.

135
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,640
And in Switzerland, I had parents coming to my office

136
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,880
and telling me horror stories of, first of all, they would not diagnose

137
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,160
their child because you don't want to label a child.

138
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,240
And then when eventually they got a diagnosis and a dialogue,

139
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,520
the question was, did you really desire this child?

140
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,320
And then he was going on and on.

141
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,560
And I think it's important that we today hear in this place,

142
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,320
which is the Psychonality Institute, we state high and loud

143
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,560
that bad mothering has nothing to do with autism

144
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,440
and that it's neurodevelopment disorder that has to do with a brain

145
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,120
that is not developing normally for many different reasons.

146
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,000
No matter what the cause is, it doesn't mean that it can't be overcome.

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,720
Absolutely.

148
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,480
I totally agree with most of the identified causes,

149
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,080
underlying cause of autism, are on stress pathways.

150
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,640
And so an anti-stress modality has a good chance to intervene.

151
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,640
But no, mother shouldn't be blamed at all.

152
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
And in fact, she's powerful, powerful.

153
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,560
And my insights about the gut in autism came from treating many,

154
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,120
many children from Paris with autism.

155
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,120
So I think I can't comment on the 70s.

156
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
I guess I was alive then.

157
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,120
I don't remember much of it.

158
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,120
But I first started working in a lab,

159
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,120
working with the child psychiatrist in 1994 or so.

160
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,120
And at that point, we were still talking about autism as something in 10,000,

161
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,120
which is quite different from the way we describe numbers.

162
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
And that's changed quite a lot.

163
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,120
I think there also is a fairly radical shift in terms of societal awareness

164
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,120
and how much conversation happens around autism.

165
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,120
I think that they're also even prior to the 90s has been a shift

166
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,120
from thinking about this as a psychological disorder to thinking about this

167
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,120
as a brain disorder, something that is happening.

168
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,120
I think over the course of this discussion,

169
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,120
we can talk about what that might mean or not mean.

170
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
But from my perspective, that increase to a large extent

171
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,120
is about learning to see something that we didn't see before.

172
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,120
In some way, being in this place, it's like before Freud described the unconscious.

173
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
That seemed like such a foreign concept.

174
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,120
And once you hear it, like, oh, yeah, of course.

175
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,120
And I think in a lot of ways, that's the experience now for clinicians, certainly,

176
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,120
but I think for a broader society around autism, particularly milder kids

177
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,120
with autism spectrum disorder, where they wouldn't have been seen before.

178
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,120
So when I was in elementary school, we certainly had a child in my class

179
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,120
who had what we would describe now as autism spectrum disorder.

180
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,120
How was that treated? Essentially, she was picked on.

181
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,120
And that was about it, at least from what I know.

182
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,120
And that probably wouldn't happen today.

183
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,120
Today, we would have a way to describe what she was dealing with.

184
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:02,120
So I think that's most of the increase in terms of awareness,

185
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,120
seeing something we didn't use to see.

186
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
I think that there is also likely a real increase,

187
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,120
but it's really hard to measure and to know whether that represents something

188
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,120
beyond better screening, better awareness, different diagnostic tools,

189
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,120
different diagnostic criteria.

190
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,120
But there are risk factors that we know about that have certainly increased in society.

191
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,120
And I think it's reasonable to expect that there is an increase we would measure

192
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,120
if we use the same methods that we apply today back in 1970 or 1940, whatever.

193
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,120
What was hard for you?

194
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,120
So, yeah, I think we have other folks who can talk more about it.

195
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,120
But there are robust ones. Go ahead.

196
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Well, in fact, if we talk a little bit more about the prevalence trend

197
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,120
and the increase that we observe, I think that, you know,

198
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,120
obviously what's root, what's driving the attention in society around autism

199
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,120
is this awareness that it's much more common than we thought.

200
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,120
So the question of why is a challenge.

201
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,120
I'm an epidemiologist, so we study the distribution of disease and population.

202
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,120
So I'm the guy who, in theory, is supposed to be able to figure this out.

203
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,120
And it is for a number of reasons very challenging with respect to autism

204
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,120
because of a lot of the factors that Jeremy alluded to.

205
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,120
In the U.S. of my history, an autism goes back about 15 years,

206
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,120
and it really extends back to the time when public health people and epidemiologists

207
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,120
thought that it might make sense to pay attention to autism.

208
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,120
It really wasn't on the radar screen of public health at all.

209
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,120
Clinicians were aware of it. Of course, it was considered a very rare condition,

210
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,120
not likely to have a major population health burden.

211
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,120
But, you know, 15 years ago, it was obvious that more children were being diagnosed with autism.

212
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,120
And in the United States, we had very little tools to measure the prevalence of autism in the population.

213
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:08,120
So the CDC started conducting surveillance for autism in 2002, was the first year.

214
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,120
And it's a complicated approach. It's far from perfect.

215
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,120
But what it is, is it is measuring prevalence the same way in sequential two-year periods.

216
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,120
And we've seen prevalence continue to increase.

217
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,120
When we first started measuring that in 2002, prevalence was 1 in 1,10.

218
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,120
In 2012, the prevalence is 1 in 68.

219
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,120
So we've seen what's still been over 10 years and measured prevalence according to the CDC adapted.

220
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,120
You know, still a fairly substantial increase.

221
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,120
From 2010 to 2012, it's the first time we've seen a plateau.

222
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,120
So what does that mean?

223
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Just because we measure the same way, you know, from 2002 to 2010,

224
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,120
doesn't mean that that increase that we saw was real.

225
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Because there's still awareness factors going on in the community.

226
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,120
And in fact, in the CDC system, there are some things that we can do to track that.

227
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,120
We can look at different areas in the country where prevalence is higher

228
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,120
and see things like the children who are counted in the surveillance system,

229
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,120
many more developmental assessments than in areas where the prevalence is lower.

230
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,120
So this idea that if you're looking harder, you know, you're going to see things more clearly is born out

231
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
in some of this population data.

232
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:40,120
So to Jeremy's point, the idea of trying to parse out what's driving this is very hard.

233
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,120
And there have been empirical studies that you try to look at individual factors that you can measure.

234
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,120
You can see if maybe if you're estimating prevalence at age 5, right,

235
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,120
and nothing really is changing with real risk, but a certain proportion of children every year are getting detected at an earlier age,

236
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,120
that can introduce what looks like an increase in prevalence at 5, even though real risk isn't changing.

237
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,120
And people have looked at that and that's going on to some extent.

238
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Our colleagues in Scandinavia, where they have very well-developed registries,

239
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,120
have been tracking autism prevalence, and they've been able to estimate things like the shift from DSM-3 to DSM-4,

240
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,120
and how much of the prevalence increase that has accounted for.

241
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
And that's accounted for some.

242
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Not all.

243
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,120
When you look at these diagnostic-related factors and you try to quantify them,

244
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,120
these things that we can measure easily, shifting age, shifting a diagnostic system, they account for a chunk.

245
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,120
But we don't have a good way to measure just this general increased awareness

246
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,120
and how much the fact that nursery school teachers and kindergarten teachers are more aware of this

247
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
and are alerting parents and parents are more.

248
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,120
We have no way of measuring that.

249
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,120
So it still is an unanswered question and a very important one about whether or not

250
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,120
how much of this increase is due to real risk.

251
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,120
I sort of fall on the same catamasked bed as I, you know, to give an opinion.

252
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:03,120
I think a majority of it is diagnostic-related, but I think some of it is due to changing risk factors.

253
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
And we can...

254
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,120
There is more asthma than there was before.

255
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
Right.

256
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
For sure.

257
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,120
And that's not something that you would diagnose, you know, because you look for it more.

258
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
Right.

259
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,120
So I think there are things in the environment that are producing things that might increase risks

260
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
for different things.

261
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,120
I'm not saying that it's the same for autism, but there are things changing in the environment

262
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
that is changing the health of kids.

263
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,120
I wanted to pose to another piece of this, which I want to make sure we don't skip over,

264
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:37,120
which is the question of what point does or is autism a unitary thing?

265
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Never.

266
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,120
And because it's so easy to slip, because it's such a hard discussion to have, we slip into

267
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,120
the discussion of autism or not.

268
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,120
And I'll tell you with the perspective that I brought to this, you know, we are in the

269
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,120
psychoanalytic institute, and I think it's unfortunate that probably the best-known heritage

270
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:04,120
of the psychoanalytic field is this travesty of having autism thought of as a parent-induced

271
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
disorder.

272
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,120
But there's something, to me, much more valuable of the psychoanalytic perspective has always

273
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
had to offer.

274
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,120
And that is this notion that the way we construct our worlds, the way we symbolize, the way we

275
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,120
name things, then affects the way we see them and interact with them.

276
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:27,120
And so there's something about this story of autism where it meant one thing to Leo

277
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,120
Canner, and it means something entirely different to us now, and how we got from one to the

278
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,120
other, that, all right, it's largely different now.

279
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,120
And it's not from one to the other.

280
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Using the same word is such a complex thing.

281
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,120
I mean, I don't know how many times I've had colleagues outside of Chatsukhaitra or autism

282
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,120
say to me, oh, I believe in autism.

283
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,120
But this person you diagnosed with autism, that you shouldn't call that autism.

284
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,120
And I don't know how many debates I was part of in various places.

285
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,120
And people get into these arguments about this is or isn't autism.

286
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,120
And when you strip out what they're arguing about, it's not actually about a different

287
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
behavior.

288
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,120
It's about some construct that they're coming up with that isn't, that is not designed in

289
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,120
nature, at least to my view, as neatly in this category versus the other.

290
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,120
Now, it's certainly not the only thing in Chatsukhaitra or in other fields like that, right?

291
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Why do we call hypertension over 160 systolic?

292
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Why do we call ADHD over some arbitrary score on a certain test?

293
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,120
It's not because we don't think there are people with attentional difficulties or that

294
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,120
it isn't risky to have higher blood pressure, but because we have continuous and then we

295
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
make some kind of a line.

296
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,120
We draw some line because it serves a function.

297
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,120
And I worry that that's not, we don't talk about that enough.

298
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Or it's perceived, if you talk about it, it's perceived as you're somehow against the

299
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
public health problem of autism.

300
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Whereas I don't think we all agree on it.

301
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,120
I mean, the last thing I'll say on that for now is there's this great study that Kathy

302
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Lord, who Jeremy works with and I worked with at one point, published from the

303
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,120
Simon Simplex collection, you know the study, I'm sure better than I do Jeremy, but where

304
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:31,120
they looked at what predicts across, I think, was 14 sites, all very impressive places.

305
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,120
Harvard Yale, you know, Vanderbilt, Michigan, Columbia, et cetera, what predicts who got

306
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:44,120
called by expert clinicians autistic, this was in DSM four days, pervasive developmental

307
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,120
disorder, Asperger's.

308
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,120
And there was only one thing that predicted it to my recollection, which was site.

309
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,120
In other words, there were cultures within the sites that used terms in certain ways, but

310
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,120
it wasn't consensus.

311
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Now there's a lot of work to correct that, but we need to still talk about it.

312
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Yeah, that's why we don't have those categories anymore.

313
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Kathy's description, I don't know, it's her term originally, but it's carving meatloaf

314
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
at the joints.

315
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:18,120
So you don't have lines between things, and I think we would all acknowledge that it's

316
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,120
really difficult to say for kids who are sort of on the bubble, whether they truly have

317
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,120
autism spectrum disorder or they don't, and a lot of it was driving those cultural differences

318
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,120
between sites was actually not something specific about those clinicians.

319
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,120
It was the services available in their state, depending on diagnosis.

320
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,120
And by the way, this is also what drives some of the differences between states for the

321
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:50,120
CDC epidemiology, where it seems like it's this really clean thing, but it's quite dependent

322
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,120
on school records and clinicians making judgments that determine whether a child gets no services

323
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:03,120
in the school or gets sometimes quite exquisite services that are specifically for autism

324
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,120
and wouldn't pertain if you said that the child has intellectual disability plus mixed

325
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:17,120
receptive expressive language disorder plus ADHD, that wouldn't necessarily generate any

326
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,120
services for that child, whereas autism and the child may have a lot of those features

327
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,120
will get considerable help.

328
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,120
And I think that's part of the challenge.

329
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:34,120
The way I think about autism is it's a final common outcome, but that doesn't mean that

330
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,120
the primary problem is a social deficit.

331
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:47,120
Social interaction is just about the most complex thing that we do as humans, and so you can

332
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
have sensory problems that lead in that direction.

333
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:55,120
We know that children who have visual deficits or auditory deficits are at higher risk of

334
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,120
autism spectrum disorder, what we don't know is it's because of the sensory deficit, but

335
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,120
we also know that those deficits are really common, sensory difficulties are really common

336
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
in kids with ASD.

337
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
So what does that mean?

338
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,120
It could be that it's coming separately from a common genetic risk.

339
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,120
We have to be careful about that, but sensory is easy to talk about because we all relate

340
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
to it.

341
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,120
If you can't get the input, how are you going to interact with others?

342
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,120
But I think that's the thing that is common across the spectrum.

343
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,120
If you take children who have deep disabilities and very high functioning people, they all

344
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,120
share this sensory hypersensitivity.

345
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
And I think that's interesting.

346
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
There's a range, right?

347
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Yeah, there is a range.

348
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:44,120
But I think a lot of researchers now tend to agree that there is an imbalance between excited

349
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,120
and inhibitory systems in autism, and I think that's where maybe things are happening.

350
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,640
I mean, it's a brain that is not well balanced and there is too much noise in the brain,

351
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,240
if one wants to say it.

352
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,120
And that leads to difficulties in the most complex things we have, which is social interaction,

353
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
but also other drugs.

354
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,120
It's not just the brain, it's the body.

355
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Yeah.

356
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
We have to get out of the brain.

357
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,120
The brain is connected, especially to the viscera.

358
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:23,120
And you will not have any effect really on hyperactivity or even on the ability to be remediated for

359
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,120
auditory and visual processing deficits if you're not calm.

360
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:35,120
And I think my work in the gut really tells us we better pay attention.

361
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,120
And the octetosa receptors in the gut, we showed it for the first time.

362
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,120
We showed what the signaling is in downstream pain, or the doctor.

363
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,120
And this is one system, this derasionaltism we got to start looking at the whole body,

364
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
and not just the brain.

365
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,120
The brain is a motor organ as far as I'm concerned.

366
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,120
And psychiatry only wants to look at the cortex.

367
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,120
There's another piece of the brain here that psychiatry has missed entirely.

368
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,120
And they're modified by autonomics.

369
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,120
Jeremy, can I come, I wanted to come back to your point that we've made a step forward

370
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,120
by collapsing pervasive developmental disorder asperger's and autism.

371
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,120
And I do think that that's a step forward, although I think Fred Bookmark might disagree.

372
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,120
But I don't think we're done because what I hear from colleagues, clinicians,

373
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:34,120
family is the terms nonverbal learning disorder, sensory integration disorder,

374
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:40,120
and soid personality in adults, and I don't think we know how those overlap or don't overlap

375
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,120
with various aspects of what we mean by autism.

376
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:50,120
So even the word autism now, I think is still uncertain, has uncertain boundaries.

377
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:57,120
And if the more we use it as a singular noun, the more we fool ourselves, I worry

378
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,120
into thinking that we've figured out where the edges of this meatloaf are.

379
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Yeah, I would agree with that, but correct.

380
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,120
Well, so, yeah, I think my comments a little away from that, but related to distribution.

381
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Maybe you go first, Jeremy, and I'll jump back in.

382
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,120
So I would acknowledge, we acknowledge we know where the edges are,

383
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,120
and we also, in particular, don't know where the edges are likely to be for an individual

384
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,120
longitudinally. And that's a real challenge right now because we have kids who,

385
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:32,120
at two or three years old, clearly have what we define now, carefully as autism

386
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,120
spectrum disorder, who by the time they're 10, don't look that way again,

387
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,120
and sometimes then again by the time they're 20, look like they have

388
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,120
schizoid personality disorder. So there are these sort of ebbs and floes

389
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:53,120
in expectations and ways of interacting that predict whether a child is impaired

390
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,120
by what presumably are static changes in the brain.

391
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,120
And I think that's one of the challenges we have not just for autism spectrum disorder,

392
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,120
but across all of medicine, but I would say particularly in behaviorally defined disorders

393
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:15,120
where the expected behavior changes developmentally along with the individuals

394
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,120
or sort of the organisms capacity to do different things, evolves over time.

395
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,120
So, you know, 10 year olds oftentimes can interact quite nicely around restricted

396
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,120
and can do, you know, beautiful parallel play where both kids are watching

397
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,120
and doing the same thing, but by the time they're 15 they have to be facing each other

398
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,120
having a nice social interaction and that may not be as simple.

399
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,120
So I think that there's a lot of ebb and flow and there are a lot of questions around

400
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,120
which difficulties should be defined within the autism spectrum and which shouldn't.

401
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Because one of the sequelae it seems to me to that is when we then start to have

402
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,120
the discussions around treatment, which I agree or ultimately where we all want to go,

403
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:02,120
it then becomes easy, they vague, a target for projection about what we think made the difference

404
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,120
or not when we don't actually know the normal course of a lot of these illnesses.

405
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,120
So I hear a lot of different stories from a lot of different people

406
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,120
about what achieves some people call it cure or certainly improvement

407
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,120
and without actually understanding the variability, it's very hard to track those things.

408
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,120
I mean, I don't know, I want us to be working in a therapeutic way

409
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,120
but I also want us to be able to agree on what we're measuring.

410
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:37,120
So I do think the field very much wants to go in the direction of leaving the idea of dichotomy,

411
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,120
autism versus no autism. I think that's the way some parts of the field wants to go.

412
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,120
But I think the critical tension about the need for a diagnostic label to access services

413
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,120
is going to be something that's just going to be pulling back on that.

414
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:57,120
And I think that from a medical sociologic perspective, not that I'm qualified to have one,

415
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,120
but from that perspective, I think the need to have categorical diagnoses

416
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,120
sort of create these problems for us in other fields too outside of autism.

417
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,120
But part of the two reasons why I think the field wants to go in this direction

418
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,120
and there's some support for going this way. I wanted to just comment on briefly.

419
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,120
It's one etiology. So there's been some very elegant work recently,

420
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,120
although it's really just starting where it's done in large twin samples

421
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,120
where autism diagnosis was measured, but they also did quantitative measurement

422
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,120
of autism-related phenotypes using what are still arguably early days tools,

423
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,120
autism quotients, SRS. These are mostly parent-report questionnaires

424
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,120
that ask about a range of behaviors and generate sort of a continuous score

425
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,120
instead of saying yes, autism, no. And what they did in these family studies

426
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,120
is they estimated some basic characteristics of etiology,

427
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,120
like what component of the condition was heritable,

428
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,120
what component was due to shared environment, what component was due to unshared environment?

429
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,120
There are lots of problems with doing that, but it's one way to sort of take a big picture

430
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,120
look at etiology. And they did that based on the continuous measures,

431
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,120
and they did that based on just categorizing the extreme end of the distribution

432
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,120
what you would do when you're saying these are cases. And they basically found identical results,

433
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,120
which in some ways I think is going to prove to be pretty important,

434
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,120
because I think people were holding onto this idea that this thing that we think of as autism

435
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,120
has its own, it's its own thing that he causes, and if we start thinking about this broader spectrum,

436
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,120
we're somehow going to be diluting our ability to find a spot, because in fact,

437
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,120
I think we're actually going to be increasing the power, because when we measure things dimensionally,

438
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,120
it's very helpful in research and increases statistical power, it's very, very helpful.

439
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,120
So that's point one. Point two is on, you talked about the public health perspective,

440
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,120
and the idea that there's some sort of tension in terms of, you know, ignoring the diagnosis of autism

441
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,120
is really ironic, because actually the public health perspective is really focused on dimensionality.

442
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,120
It's actually this thing called the prevention paradox,

443
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,120
it's termed invented by very famous British epidemiologists called Jeffrey Rose,

444
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,120
and in fact your hypertension example works great for this.

445
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,120
If you think about the distribution of blood pressures in the population,

446
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,120
and you think about the people who are above a clinical cut point, and we consider them hypertensive.

447
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,120
If you have two strategies to fight hypertension in the population,

448
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,120
one was you treat everybody who's clinically hypertensive, and then you estimate, say,

449
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,120
how many heart attacks would I prevent?

450
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,120
And then if you said it, well what if I switched shift the whole blood pressure distribution

451
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,120
to percentile points this way?

452
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,120
You actually would prevent many more adverse events doing that

453
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,120
than you would just treating the people at the extremes, because the folks,

454
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,120
the left of the extremes, there's so many more of them, and that benefit of just shifting.

455
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,120
So that's the prevention paradox, and that's not to say we shouldn't treat the people at the extremes,

456
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,120
or spend some extra time and energy focused on them, of course we should.

457
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,120
But we shouldn't lose sight of shifting these entire distributions.

458
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,120
And I think in behavioral conditions it's a little harder to wrap our heads around that,

459
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:11,120
but I mean I actually feel that bringing that kind of thinking to autism is very helpful.

460
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Like, you know, if we try to improve social cognition among all preschoolers, right,

461
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,120
and there's going to be some benefits for kids who are at risk for autism,

462
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,120
but there are going to be benefits for other kids too in terms of academic achievement,

463
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,120
other psychopathology down the line.

464
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,120
So I think that's the way we have, so that's why I think the field wants to go this way,

465
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,120
but we have to get around this nettlesome problem of, you know,

466
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,120
very real problem that families need a diagnosis to start getting stuff done for their kids.

467
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:45,120
Yeah, I think actually my reading of that emerging literature is that the estimates of heritability

468
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,120
are actually higher when you look at social communication as a quantitative trait,

469
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,120
and repetitive behavior as a quantitative trait.

470
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Although some of that's also driven by the one Hall-Mayer study that sort of reports heritability

471
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,120
as being considerably lower, but I think that's an interesting point.

472
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:09,120
What we really don't understand is why we have so many kids who have elevated scores

473
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,120
in both social communication and repetitive behavior domains,

474
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,120
if these really are just quantitative traits that are independent in the population,

475
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
and that's a challenge.

476
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,120
The SRS doesn't do that because it lumps everything together.

477
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,120
No, and it could be, it could be, you know, if we, and again,

478
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,120
probably reducing this to saying that there's one dimension of phenotype for autism

479
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,120
is a gross oversimplification, but let's just say there's one dimension.

480
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,120
What could be is there's one dimension and then there's, you know,

481
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:43,120
a tiny bimodal sort of peak out here, and some of that overlap is in that peak,

482
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,120
but it may continue.

483
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,120
So this is a sense, and it's very helpful.

484
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,120
There's one other factor, though, which I think we'd be remiss to not acknowledge,

485
00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:00,120
and it's tied to the public health awareness issue, but it can sound nefarious,

486
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,120
and therefore is worth stating clearly.

487
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,120
There's also an academic thing that happens when an area becomes hot,

488
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,120
when something becomes where funding goes, that academics,

489
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:20,120
treaters, agencies want to join in because A, they get funding for it,

490
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,120
and B, they are then seen as dealing with a contemporary problem,

491
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,120
which is not to say it isn't an important problem or that they shouldn't do this

492
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,120
or somehow this is some evil thing.

493
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,120
I don't believe that, but it does create a kind of, you know, snowballing effect.

494
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,120
I don't think I would have ended up working in the autism field

495
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,120
if I hadn't been looking for funding around the time when this was a major

496
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,120
funding priority, and so that word caught on.

497
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,120
Now, there are people who got to it long before that and can say,

498
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,120
I was there before it became a thing, but certainly the amount that we talk about it today

499
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,120
and the amount that we, of money that's going into it,

500
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,120
has some kind of a feedback loop with our own activities,

501
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,120
and I'm curious what others think about it that way.

502
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,120
I started in 2000, so I will...

503
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,120
No, I think it's important that a lot of people are doing research on that,

504
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:23,120
because there is so much that we don't know, and I think a lot of us are trying to find

505
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:29,120
biomarker for autism, if there is such a thing, and because we need something that will help us

506
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,120
measure treatment effects and what changes with treatment,

507
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:38,120
and maybe also what's common across autism, and I think it's important that

508
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,120
a lot of resources are put into research on autism, because it also informs you about other disorders,

509
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,120
other neurodevelopmental disorders, because we talk about autism,

510
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:52,120
but I think there is a big family of neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD,

511
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:58,120
and Tourette syndrome, and all kind of things that kind of overlap more or less,

512
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:05,120
and before the DSM-4-5, you couldn't have autism in ADHD, it was exclusionary,

513
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:11,120
and she's kind of crazy when you think about it, because a lot of people with autism have ADHD,

514
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:16,120
and a lot of people with ADHD have autistic traits, so we also need to think about

515
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:23,120
brain-developmental disorder as a more general thing that I think we need research about,

516
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,120
because it's the future of kids that...

517
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Can I just contrast the way you're talking with the way the last comment you made,

518
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:36,120
because to me saying we need more resources for this thing called autism is not the same,

519
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:43,120
as saying we need to understand what these multiple dimensions are that involve a wide range,

520
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:49,120
including difficulties, and also including normal functioning, that presumably underlie it.

521
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:56,120
It's much harder to sell that, and it's much easier to sell, there's this thing called autism.

522
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:03,120
I think we need to be wider. Just focusing on autism. Autism is a strange concept to start.

523
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,120
That's what I said.

524
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:11,120
In interest of going wide, I was in Washington last week, and I found out that the statistic

525
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:17,120
for kindergarten readiness is that 40% of kids are not ready for kindergarten,

526
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,120
so we're going to have to go wider, Craig.

527
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:30,120
I think that part of what's happening again is researchers are still using the term,

528
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:38,120
but in their aims, mixed in, is sort of more work acknowledging the sort of breadth,

529
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:43,120
and it'll be a slow transition. It's dangerous, and I agree with what you're saying about

530
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:49,120
the perils of something becoming hot, but I do also think that there's a little bit of a backlash

531
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:55,120
against autism, and it's tough to pit funding for one difficult condition against another,

532
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,120
but the prevalence of autism and the prevalence of Alzheimer's are about the same.

533
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:08,120
Alzheimer's is a terrible condition if it impacts on mortality in addition to quality of life,

534
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:16,120
but the average age of onset of Alzheimer's, as we know, is 60 or so, autism is a lifelong condition.

535
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,120
So research funding for Alzheimer's is about fourfold for autism right now,

536
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,120
and that's again using these simplified labels and counting things.

537
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Autism, the most common neurodevelopmental condition that's serious, $250 billion a year cost estimation.

538
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:37,120
So I worry a little bit when we start talking about autism funding, and is it autism hot,

539
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:45,120
and aren't we that yes, but at the same token, I really don't know that the resources

540
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,120
that are going in this direction are yet at an appropriate level.

541
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,120
Well, I'm hoping research is going to go into prevention.

542
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,120
If it's really true, if we replicate our fine, every use of risk on MCHET,

543
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:03,120
and more than 14, 1 in 10, the clue of how important prevention could be.

544
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:11,120
And not only did it go from one to one ten, but dividing MCHET to two categories,

545
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:19,120
the primary motor and socio-emotional, the family-nusher intervention babies had zero problems in socio-emotional,

546
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:25,120
which means they're going to not be on your cut-off, Craig, where you move it.

547
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:33,120
So I hope that it's not just going to go into autism, which speaking of autism, yes,

548
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,120
the biggest increase is calling it a spectrum.

549
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:45,120
What used to be true autism from the 70s, that's dire and actively rare still.

550
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:50,120
But at the time it was linked to schizophrenia.

551
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Yeah, the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders was for a time,

552
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:01,120
Journal of Autism in Childed Schizophrenia.

553
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Now I should remember this, but that definitely went back and forth,

554
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:14,120
and certainly the term autism came out of the original description of schizophrenia by Broiler.

555
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,120
So it isn't something that Leo Connor just came up with.

556
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:28,120
It was a descriptive term that he pulled out of the existing literature to describe children who really did seem a part.

557
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:36,120
I think that's useful to pay attention to, in part as we follow folks longitudinally

558
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:42,120
and try to understand those kids who are on the edges of the spectrum and what their lives look like.

559
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:48,120
I think one example is a syndrome that's variously known as Vealicardiofacial syndrome,

560
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:54,120
or 22Q deletion syndrome, but these are kids who, if you follow them,

561
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,120
some of them have intellectual disability, some of them don't.

562
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:06,120
Some of them have features that would generate diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, some of them don't.

563
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:14,120
Many of them develop mood disorders in adolescence, many of them develop psychosis in late adolescence or late adulthood,

564
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:20,120
and you find a different term applied depending on what age you're looking at.

565
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:26,120
And yet at the same time, all of these individuals have the same underlying cause, right?

566
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:32,120
And we look at them differently, apply a different name at different time points in development,

567
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:40,120
but what they have is this deletion syndrome, not autism plus ADHD and maybe intellectual disability,

568
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,120
and then in another time bipolar disorder, and then another time schizophrenia.

569
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:52,120
I suspect that what we will continue to find is that where we are able to really define the biology,

570
00:40:52,120 --> 00:41:00,120
we find that it does not respect our diagnostic boundaries and especially does not respect them over time,

571
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,120
but that it will help us those clear, biological risk factors,

572
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:10,120
which you can sometimes think of as causes, but usually are not causes of autism.

573
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:18,120
And that causes of an IQ decrement of 20 points compared to family members, some form of social disability,

574
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:27,120
some degree of anxiety that's higher, some sensory difficulty, and that sometimes yields a diagnosis of this or that,

575
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:33,120
but what we're really talking about is what's happening in the brain, glimpsed at different points in development, if that makes sense.

576
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:41,120
And we now have the capacity to do something like that for about 20% of kids with autism spectrum disorder,

577
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:47,120
not that you're able to identify causes, but that you can do a genetic test and say,

578
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:55,120
without this thing that we have found in the genome, this child almost certainly would not have autism spectrum disorder.

579
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:04,120
And where that's true, you can follow a group of kids who have something in common to understand not autism spectrum disorder,

580
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:13,120
but what is happening in that child related to their biology instead of what's happening at this point in time related to their behavior.

581
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:19,120
There is one more thing I wanted to say about diagnosis and prevention is if we look at female with autism,

582
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:26,120
because female with autism get diagnosed much later than males with autism because their way of behaving is very different.

583
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:31,120
And a lot of them are missed until they become teenager, because they can't flush,

584
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:39,120
instead of being alone in their corner, they kind of stand in the center, which works pretty well until you are a teenager,

585
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,120
and after that, everything falls apart.

586
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:49,120
And these females are at so much higher risk of eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and suicide,

587
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:56,120
that if we were able to diagnose them and follow them up closely, we would prevent a lot of these secondary psychiatric disorders.

588
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:08,120
And I think that this is something that is totally understudied, and people should be more aware of also the female manifestation of autism.

589
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:23,120
I agree, and another take on prevention, obviously there's important thinking about preventing downstream psychopathology,

590
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,120
but also upstream.

591
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:33,120
So, are there a modifiable or avoidable contributing causes to autism?

592
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,120
And that gets to the question of cause, and Jeremy's point was very well.

593
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:47,120
Just ask a question before in terms of what machines said, or the incidence number between goals and goals different or same?

594
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,120
What hasn't been done?

595
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,120
A huge, huge, huge, four to one ratio.

596
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:57,120
It's a male dominant condition, and basically that's one thing that basically hasn't changed.

597
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:05,120
A little bit as prevalence has gone up, there's been a little bit of a shrinking back of that prevalence ratio, but really not very much.

598
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:13,120
And some folks do believe that we're still under-diagnosing in girls, we probably are, especially at the higher functioning end of the spectrum.

599
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:22,120
But there's no doubt that male prevalence for autism and for developmental conditions is higher.

600
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:33,120
And understanding the basic biology that's driving that, it's sort of an elephant in the room kind of question that a lot of times when we talk about eating a lot of autism, we just don't even get the mention.

601
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,120
We just avoid talking about, we don't really know why there's this male predominance.

602
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:45,120
It's not simple things, it's not excellent genes, it could be a little bit, but there's no single obvious answer.

603
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:52,120
And that's still something that we need to spend a lot more time on.

604
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:59,120
And then this issue of talk about a genetic cause, and I like Jeremy's definition, you know, a cause is something, if you remove it, you would not have the case.

605
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:10,120
And what that illustrates, what that definition illustrates, this is important for, I think, folks to think about, when I think about causes, is the five causes is not 100%.

606
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:19,120
It's actually boundless, because let's say the only way to cause autism was you had a gene, a susceptibility gene, and there were some type of environmental insult.

607
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,120
That was the only, this is hypothetical, that was the only way you caused autism.

608
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,120
Every kid who had autism had this gene and had this environmental insult.

609
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,120
Well in that case, how much, using Jeremy's definition, how much of autism is genetic?

610
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:39,120
Well if I take away the gene, gene therapy or something, magic, we avoid all autism, so autism is 100% genetic.

611
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:45,120
But if we remove that environmental trigger, we'd also reduce autism to zero.

612
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,120
So autism is at the same time 100% environmental.

613
00:45:48,120 --> 00:46:03,120
So when you have multi-factual causes, you can say that you have a genetic case of autism, and that's great for potentially treating the kid, if you can figure out how those genes relate to treatment or understanding what's going on.

614
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:09,120
But there also might be other contributing causes in that case too.

615
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,120
So that's important.

616
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:24,120
And so I think the prenatal period and understanding potentially avoidable causes, there's a lot of reasons I think there's a little controversy around this, but I think there's a lot of reasons to focus on the prenatal period as a time when the brain is developing.

617
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:32,120
Molecular biology is suggesting that some of the changes in gene expression that we see that sort of are definitional or pathonomonic of autism.

618
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:41,120
Well that's a little tricky to get that certain, but some of those changes, you know, they develop mid-gestation.

619
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,120
There's other indicators that the prenatal period is really important.

620
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:59,120
And trying to think a little bit about whether or not they're a modifiable or avoidable causes in the prenatal period to prevent autism, but probably also would have lots of spillover benefits to these broader endpoints that we were thinking about.

621
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:07,120
Yes, we looked at the central pathology in our subjects in this pre-me population.

622
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:13,120
And first of all, they have more pathology, particularly trophoglass inclusions.

623
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:19,120
And we found no difference in the numbers in the two groups, the treatment group and the control group.

624
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:29,120
But in the standard care group, the number predicted brain activity a term, whereas family nurture overcame that.

625
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:34,120
There was no association between the numbers of these inclusion bodies and outcome.

626
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:40,120
So yes, early prevention, even of biological phenomena.

627
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:57,120
And that's why I'm so adamant about this, that we have to be looking at nurture and what it can do to overcome the downstream outcomes of these genetic or congenital conditions.

628
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:02,120
They're not damning.

629
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:15,120
It seems to me the most likely model that brings all of these together is this very multi-factorial model where there are thousands, if not tens of thousands of small contributions to risk.

630
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:23,120
And it's very hard when you have that number and the contributions are small to label those causes or not causes.

631
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:30,120
That isn't to say there aren't more rare cases with that account that have much larger risk associated with them.

632
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:38,120
But it seems the vast majority of cases will be explained by this accumulation of many, many risks.

633
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:45,120
And then we as a field in technology will have to figure out which of those can we intervene on and which can we not.

634
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:55,120
And the question then becomes both on the nurturing side, it seems to me, and on the genetic side, where can we intervene and where do we not know how to?

635
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,120
I don't think we know the answer to that.

636
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,120
In the study? Oh, yes. It is very well documented.

637
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,120
Well Jeremy said 20%.

638
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,120
That's based on molecular genetic studies.

639
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:15,120
The old twin studies, the original twin studies, and these are very straightforward in terms of how they're set up.

640
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:24,120
Essentially you're looking at monozygotic twins where one is affected and then you will do it with the second one to see if that child is also affected and die zygotic twins.

641
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,120
So identical versus fraternal twins.

642
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,120
In the case of monozygotic or identical twins, they share 100% of their DNA.

643
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:39,120
There are some caveats there. In the case of case, I got twins from a genetic perspective, they're like any other sibling.

644
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:45,120
And so that allows you to make an estimate of heritability. And that's what most of our estimates are based on.

645
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:53,120
The lowest estimate is hovering around 50%. The highest estimate hovers around 90, 90 plus and a few of those studies.

646
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,120
So heritability clearly matters.

647
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:02,120
But as Craig said, that is within an environmental context.

648
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:15,120
So as an example, if you think about susceptibility to skin cancer or melanoma, if we all live in caves, that may look quite a lot different than if we all live outside.

649
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:22,120
And that's an extreme example. But I think we have to acknowledge this that when we're looking at twins, there are certain aspects that are

650
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:32,120
really don't come into the model so easily and represent a societal environment, which obviously does change a little bit.

651
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:37,120
My favorite example illustrates the same point you're making is if you imagined a world in which everybody smoked.

652
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:42,120
In other words, there was just a cultural norm. Everybody smoked.

653
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:51,120
Well, in that case, smoking a lung cancer, that kind of lung cancer would be 100% genetic.

654
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,120
Right?

655
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:59,120
So it's which we obviously think of quite the other way because it would appear to be 100% genetic.

656
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,120
But sometimes it would be if that were the environment.

657
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,120
Yeah, right.

658
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,120
Right.

659
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,120
If that couldn't be changed.

660
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:17,120
And to your point about identifying these complex causes, which you know, what unfortunately seems to be the road that we're headed down with autism is this issue where

661
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:22,120
strong, contributing causes, you know, causes that have higher relative risk or rare mutation.

662
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,120
They're rare.

663
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:31,120
So the population impact of the things that are that are strong that might generally in epidemiology, we say, if it doubles the risk, it's considered strong.

664
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:37,120
So, and some rare mutations have effects that are probably much much higher than that.

665
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,120
But there, you know, the prevalence is very small.

666
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,120
So the number, you know, the population impact of that cause is small.

667
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:50,120
Things that are common, the risk, the magnitude of the risk increase is going to be much more modest.

668
00:51:50,120 --> 00:52:04,120
So, and it really seemed, you know, so back to your lung cancer example, we, you know, got lucky in public health lung cancer that we found the common environmental cause, cigarette smoking, that had a sevenfold relative risk.

669
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:13,120
I don't think that's lurking around the corner in this sense.

670
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,120
I think we're going to be, it's going to be a little tougher to parse these things out.

671
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:33,120
But in terms of genetics, I mean, to a little bit like the 22 Q11, if you think of the first neurologic in that was described, in one same family, you had one child with autism and deep intellectual divisibility, another one who had Asperger syndrome, and the third one was just fine.

672
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,120
They all had the same mutation, but the profile was very different.

673
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:49,120
So, so that also shows the limit of the whole genetic thing in autism because, because we don't know what makes, in one case, something, and in the other case, something different.

674
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,120
Yeah, I would completely agree with that.

675
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:59,120
And even these strong, and I actually don't say cause, but just, you know, just explain what you mean.

676
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:04,120
In some ways, you have to say cause or risk factor that manifests in this way.

677
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:15,120
But as we find more and more of these rare genetic risk factors that are really robust, what we tend to find is that sort of variability, but variability within a range.

678
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:21,120
And so the, the change is in the range, not necessarily the diagnosis.

679
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:33,120
So, as an example, there's a 16P deletion duplication syndrome, which is one of these paradoxes that you can have either a deletion or a duplication of the same genomic region.

680
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:38,120
And in both cases, you end up with autism about 20 something percent of the time.

681
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:47,120
That's kind of dramatic and tells us something about brain development that at this point, actually, we can only have a laser desert guesses at.

682
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:58,120
But it's a clue. When you look at folks who are affected, what you see most dramatically is a change in IQ score compared to family members.

683
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:04,120
That's the clearest thing. And then other things that are like Martha said, not the brain.

684
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:09,120
So you, well, some of them are. So you look at change in body size, body weight.

685
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,120
You also see change in head circumference, presumably brain size.

686
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:25,120
These are things that are really robustly associated with these genetic changes, much more so than an autism diagnosis, which I think tells us we, we don't really know what we're doing when we apply these diagnoses.

687
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,120
We do. We're describing behavioral difficulties.

688
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,120
But that doesn't map on that closely to the biology.

689
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:42,120
Probably the range of difficulties, maybe the pattern of difficulties, or the child who has sensory hypersensitivity versus there are kids who have sensory hyposes.

690
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:52,120
So I'm working with a child like that right now who really doesn't seem to notice things that most of us would experience is quite painful.

691
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:58,120
So you can have a kid who's very sensitive and a kid who's totally hypersensitive.

692
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,120
And we apply the same diagnosis to both kids.

693
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:07,120
Well, I think over time we'll be able to fit some of those patterns on to risk factors more clearly.

694
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,120
Right now we're really at the infancy of that.

695
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,120
Much of that is true of all of psychiatry now.

696
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,120
You could say that.

697
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:22,120
I think in other areas people are maybe less bothered by this.

698
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,120
And yeah.

699
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:31,120
Well, I have a theory about that particular question of our intolerance of uncertainty, but I also want to link it to another observation.

700
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:40,120
I'll bet you if we walked out to 2nd Avenue and stopped 10 random people and asked them, what do you think you'd be most curious about when it comes to autism?

701
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,120
9 out of 10 would bring up vaccines.

702
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:57,120
And of course it's not a topic we want to talk about because it feels like you end up in these kind of impossible debates where the data points one way, the vaccines are not responsible for autism.

703
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:06,120
But yet there is a, whatever we want to call this, there's a public feeling in a large number that this must be related.

704
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:17,120
And what I say is that it is very hard as a society for us to tolerate the uncertainty, particularly when it comes to social disturbances in our children.

705
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:35,120
And one of the things that I've seen over and over again in the families and the parents in particular is who have autistic children is a feeling inside that if only I could crack open this shell, my real child, my normal child would be inside.

706
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:53,120
And I think that is in fact because we are so wired to find our children that it is such a profoundly difficult thing to accept children who are different, that this fantasy is perpetuated.

707
00:56:53,120 --> 00:57:02,120
And that leads I think not just within the academic side but in all of society, struggling with what it means to not know the answer to these questions.

708
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:07,120
Well, it's a perfect storm, it's not only that, but it's also on the vaccination side.

709
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:20,120
There's a huge history going back to the first cow pops inoculations of widespread social skepticism about this kind of tricky idea of, we're going to take your baby and we're going to put some packaging in them and that's going to be a good thing.

710
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:34,120
And it comes back generation after generation in one form or another and you take that with your point about concern over the well-being of kids development and you have a perfect storm.

711
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:53,120
Yeah, I think it's one of the few times when you as a parent in the conflict pain in the child and it's hard not to see why families view this as something all sorts of awful things can be linked to to.

712
00:57:53,120 --> 00:58:05,120
And some ways, blame yourself for anything that doesn't go to like for your child and this is just a really easy one to link on to because you did choose to put them in pain.

713
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,120
We all make this choice, right?

714
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:13,120
And you oftentimes are holding them as they're experiencing that pain that you are inflicting upon them.

715
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:23,120
So of course you are quick to latch on to somebody thinking about this as leading to long-term social emotional risk.

716
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:27,120
But that's, I mean, when you see the amount of evidence showing that there's none.

717
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:36,120
That to me is insane how just because you have a blonde, good looking woman that goes on TV and tells nonsense, suddenly everybody's buying that.

718
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,120
And it's scary.

719
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,120
It's really scary.

720
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:48,120
We have an election on Tuesday with 50% of the country potentially voting for something similar.

721
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:52,120
And I think everybody knows which directs and I will.

722
00:58:52,120 --> 00:59:00,120
You are studying the brain of children with autism. What have you found so far? Anything?

723
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:08,120
I mean, what I've been seeing a lot in my research was I'm studying how emotion processing is going on in autism.

724
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:13,120
And the perception of other people, emotions and feelings and social.

725
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:17,120
And I've been finding a few different things.

726
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:23,120
One of them was that they seem to have difficulties perceiving emotion expressed by the body.

727
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:32,120
And on the other hand, I've been showing that when they perceive people in pain, they are not at all insensitive to that.

728
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:38,120
They actually have exactly the same effective, empathic reaction as we do.

729
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:45,120
There is no difference in brain activation in kids with young adults with autism and typical controls when they see people in pain.

730
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,120
They share the pain and they just don't know how to deal with it.

731
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,120
So that's one thing.

732
00:59:49,120 --> 01:00:01,120
However, I did another experiment with more or less the same group of people where they had, it was a joint attention type of experiment where they had to understand a fearful gaze indicating a potential danger in their environment.

733
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,120
And that's they didn't get at all.

734
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,120
So sometimes you have very similar brain activation.

735
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,120
Sometimes you have very different brain activation.

736
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:15,120
What I'm seeing now, I'm interested in looking at, they have a problem with looking in the eyes.

737
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,120
We know that.

738
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:22,120
And so I've been doing experiments where I kind of force them to look at in the eyes or I let them look the way they want.

739
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:30,120
And very interestingly, when you force them to look in the eyes and you show them low level fear faces.

740
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:34,120
So I've been morphing neutral to 100% fear faces.

741
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,120
I'm showing them 40% fear.

742
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:41,120
They actually have hyper activation in the whole system compared to control.

743
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:46,120
So they are more sensitive to these fearful faces when they are forced to look at them.

744
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:51,120
And I think that's very interesting because it could be why they look away.

745
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:58,120
And because it's, again, this too much flow of information that makes them hypersensitive and that would make them look away.

746
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:04,120
And what happens if as a child you don't look into people's eyes and face, you don't learn a whole lot of things.

747
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:10,120
And your social brain doesn't develop normally because you have less input from this thing.

748
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:20,120
So I think it's been very interesting lately to think about this all eye contact effect and what it means in terms of development.

749
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:26,120
And I see when a baby is born, there is a very crude system that allows to perceive faces.

750
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:31,120
That's why, after just a few minutes, a baby will orient themselves towards faces.

751
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:41,120
And this root is quick and dirty, but it's the root that is then used by our system to perceive fearful stimuli in the environment.

752
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,120
It's called the sub-cortical root.

753
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:55,120
And what I see in people with autism, young adults, is that sub-cortical root that processes fear is constantly over-activated when there is an eye contact.

754
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:02,120
And I think that's really interesting because what it could mean is that at the beginning of development, this root gets too connected.

755
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:20,120
And that over time, at least the whole cascade of social interaction difficulties, but it could be something very basic in terms of hyper-connection of this very low-level roots that could, I'm not saying this is the explanation about it.

756
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:25,120
But I think it could be a contributing factor to the sum of the problem that we see.

757
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:40,120
That's very interesting because in our study, we looked at the amount babies looked away from the mother, and in the intervention group, they looked away half as much as standard care babies.

758
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,120
Interesting.

759
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:51,120
Shall we go and see what questions they are?

760
01:02:51,120 --> 01:03:05,120
One of the problems that I have here is that from what I know about what psychiatrists are saying about autism, they don't understand what it is.

761
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:12,120
And they have this thing called autistic spectrum with unrelated disorders.

762
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:21,120
For example, if somebody has a lung problem, they're coughing, short of breath, and he's got tuberculosis, and another one has lung cancer.

763
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:27,120
They both have shortness of breath, but they're two entirely different phenomenon.

764
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:35,120
Now, we agree with autism is that they are withdrawn, and not socially interacting.

765
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:40,120
Well, is the cause something inside the brain?

766
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,120
Or is it a speech language problem?

767
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:46,120
Because I hear people telling me, I run to people, oh, my son has autism.

768
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,120
He can't communicate.

769
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,120
He's withdrawn. He's in a shell.

770
01:03:51,120 --> 01:04:05,120
Unfortunately, I have an autistic brother, Boulder, and he's not in a group home, and he is totally articulate.

771
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:13,120
But the difference between him and you is that he lacks the normal human needs.

772
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,120
Like right now, we're interacting with each other.

773
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,120
We're curious about each other.

774
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:23,120
And the autistic people aren't. They're in a different world. They're in a world of patterns.

775
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:28,120
Like, for example, when he was a kid, he would run away from home to ride on the subways. That's a pattern.

776
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:33,120
Like baseball, it's a pattern. Music is a pattern. Checkers is a pattern.

777
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:40,120
But normal interactions is not a pattern. They just have ceremonies.

778
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:50,120
After my mother died, my father's last years, we go to the group home where he lives out in Suffolk County every six weeks or so.

779
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:57,120
And as soon as he got into the car, we'd take him out for dinner. He'd have to say, do you have enough money for dinner?

780
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:01,120
Because for whatever reason, the first time we took him out, he said that. That's a pattern.

781
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:05,120
Where he'd sit in the car, after the same place.

782
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:12,120
Now, there are also neurological problems. If you looked at, for example, he was normally coordinated.

783
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:15,120
Normal. Could throw a ball, catch a ball.

784
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:20,120
But if you ever see his handwriting, it was like someone that had cerebral palsy.

785
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:26,120
Jagged. Or even the way in which they would interact, it's like something falls.

786
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,120
I mean, just to trust my acting.

787
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:35,120
Supposing somebody has this experience, I was walking down the park. I saw a wallet.

788
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,120
So I picked up the wallet, and I flagged down the cop.

789
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:42,120
And I gave it to him. Didn't have any money in it. So I guess he lost the wallet.

790
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:49,120
Now, when a autistic person telling you the same story, I was walking down the street.

791
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:59,120
I saw a wallet. The wallet was on the floor. I picked up the wallet.

792
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:04,120
I picked up the wallet, and I saw a cop. And I called the cop.

793
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,120
Do you see the difference? It's like they're in a different world.

794
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:12,120
It's like a whole something very abnormal.

795
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:21,120
So I don't see how you can link that to a speech language disorder.

796
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,120
It's a whole different concept.

797
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,120
Now, I'm sure you're familiar with Temple Graden.

798
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:34,120
She's really weird because I believe is autistic, but actually not that severe.

799
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:40,120
So she can function. And I think the things that she has said about overloading emotions.

800
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:45,120
And the stimulation. Like the way you might imagine.

801
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:49,120
I can look at you. And we're having a conversation.

802
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:54,120
But I'm also getting other stimuli. The temperature, the room.

803
01:06:54,120 --> 01:07:00,120
Extraneous sounds. Smells. The feel of my feet and the shoes.

804
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:03,120
But I can ignore all that and concentrate on what you're saying.

805
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:08,120
We all do that. And what Temple Graden said is they can't do that.

806
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:16,120
Imagine being bombarded by all kinds of stimuli. Thank you.

807
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:23,120
And you can't control. So therefore, instead of they had the abnormal controls

808
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:28,120
by having the spony system of ceremonies and patterns.

809
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,120
For example, they have no sense of humor.

810
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:36,120
They have no capacity to emotionally bond with anybody.

811
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:42,120
So the reason I'm saying this is just because I think that we're talking about autism

812
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:45,120
and without even saying, well, what the hell autism is?

813
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:50,120
We maybe should have started there. But I think I would agree with a lot of what you've said.

814
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:53,120
But I would say some in front of almost everything.

815
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:59,120
Some people with autism. Some people. Because there are many different experiences.

816
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:10,120
I would say somebody is clumsy. And because they have bad vision.

817
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:15,120
And another because they have a neurological disorder.

818
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:19,120
No, that was clear. We're done because there are other questions.

819
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:24,120
But that was clear. What I thought the first point you were making is that the manifest,

820
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,120
whatever you see manifestly, doesn't mean it's causal.

821
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:32,120
That's what I'm saying. So I just want to clarify. Thank you.

822
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,120
Thank you.

823
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:46,120
Hi. One word that I didn't hear, I was surprised I guess, is the social disconnection.

824
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:55,120
And it just seems to me that autism as what schizophrenia should be considered disconnection syndrons,

825
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:05,120
that the differences occur because of the point in time which this disconnection occurs in terms of the brain

826
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:14,120
and as it's encoding experience. And as you've said, there's like 10,000 factors.

827
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:20,120
So there would be all different reasons for disconnections to occur in the brain.

828
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:26,120
And schizophrenia, one of the reasons might be white matted to degradation.

829
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:32,120
But there are many, many other things that are associated.

830
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:42,120
And it seems to me when you think of the brain as a hierarchical processor with a lot of modularity,

831
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:53,120
that social issues would be the most challenging and that at the highest levels of spectrum spectrum sub-tism,

832
01:09:53,120 --> 01:10:02,120
there would be those social issues because of the much greater level of integration as necessary to

833
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:09,120
meaningfully connect the medial prefrontal cortex with the rest of the brain.

834
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:22,120
But in addition, when you talk about the Bellicardio syndrome, you might have a much more severe type of disconnection

835
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:29,120
that occurs at a much earlier stage. And then you also don't know whether that's really just that one issue

836
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:37,120
versus the other 10,000 things and that that might be creating the variability in terms of whether somebody

837
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:47,120
progresses to encode their cortex and then lead to further disintegration, which would be more of a schizophrenic

838
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:58,120
like pattern versus somebody who disintegration is so early in development that you do not have really meaningful

839
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:03,120
encoding and you have a much more significant disability.

840
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:13,120
So I'm just wondering about this being really part of a disconnection syndrome and that it wouldn't be more helpful

841
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:21,120
to be calling it that rather than autism. It's almost like the problem of me going to Alaska and speaking to

842
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:28,120
Eskos and that's going to be having 26 words for snow, yet psychiatrists and neuroscientists really should have more than

843
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:37,120
26 words for this phenomena. You did hear me say that I thought one of the remedies would overcome many of these

844
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:49,120
problems in autism would be to emotionally connect to recondition, co-condition and connect. So that's a

845
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:58,120
lot of the things that I'm trying to imply that I agree with you. So if you see someone disconnected, the idea is get them

846
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,120
reconnected. Yes.

847
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:08,120
You're talking about patients that have much less severe disconnection disorder than many other autism disorders.

848
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:20,120
I think that's not true. The my experience is not true.

849
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:28,120
Hi. So I think what he was referring to the whole disconnection is like spot on because like yesterday I attended

850
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:34,120
something on yoga and psyche and then Dr. Dan Siegel who's a neuropsychiatrist was talking about interpersonal neurobiology

851
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:43,120
and just the mirroring neurons and all these things. So my question is I don't know if the panelists have come across a

852
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:54,120
study where there was a population or sample groups that they had perfect bloods like as parents, perfect ratios,

853
01:12:54,120 --> 01:13:04,120
called hormonal ratios and things just everything seemed very good. And the absence of genetics and say even heavy metals

854
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:13,120
or things that's getting more detailed. But parents that really didn't have much of a chance given all the labels

855
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:22,120
and environmental, you know where I'm going with this. So any studies or findings or research that was done on that end?

856
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:29,120
Any of your knowledge? I'm not sure what you mean. But maybe you know what it means. I don't know what it means. Not much of a chance.

857
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:39,120
You mean that there's no genetic finding anything? I've heard many, many doctors talk about autism and there are different

858
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:53,120
linkages, fire retardants, vaccines and different things. Whether there's much science to back it up or a little science to back it up, there are a lot of different linkages.

859
01:13:53,120 --> 01:14:06,120
So if you get people from a village who you sample their blood and everything looks good and they don't have much of the exposures that we have here in the Western Hemisphere,

860
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:17,120
were there any, was that ever conducted I guess as well as? Yes, thank you for clarifying. So I don't know that we've done enough of that.

861
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:29,120
And one of the problems is that most of the research on risk factors, etiology has been done in developed countries as you've alluded to.

862
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:38,120
And at a very general level, the background rates of exposure, social exposures, environmental exposures are somewhat similar.

863
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:48,120
The reason why there's been less of it and more pristine, typically lesser developed countries is because the apparatus to do the outcome assessment isn't there.

864
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:56,120
So that's why we see a little dearth of it. However, there have been some investigations in more remote populations.

865
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:07,120
And these are generally small scale. So it's difficult to compare rates as the prevalence rate of autism in such a population similar to Western society, but you do see autism there.

866
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:25,120
You see autism basically everywhere. But we haven't done large scale studies in what would be lesser developed, very low exposure to the types of environmental concerns that you're raising at a size

867
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:34,120
where we can estimate with some confidence what the autism prevalence is and to see if there's a shift down or a shift up so that we really have an idea.

868
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:40,120
So there are general causes, but as far as historically there are general causes.

869
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:50,120
But is there any kind of leading indicators of why the ratio has kind of been shrinking so quickly over the last two decades?

870
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,120
Which ratio?

871
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:57,120
The ratio of autistic children being born. I think the prevalence is going to be more and more and more.

872
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:03,120
Yeah, just turning back to the original concept, I think a lot of it is diagnostic awareness.

873
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:08,120
So I'll just give you a more concrete example. And I talked a little bit about this. I don't think I associated the numbers.

874
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:15,120
In the Danish registries where they tracked over a 10 year period prevalence, it actually was longer than that.

875
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:25,120
It was a longer time series, probably 10 years of birth cohorts with maybe 20 years of follow up because they could do those kinds of things.

876
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:29,120
Many fold increase in prevalence over calendar times as we see everywhere.

877
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:38,120
They looked at just two definable diagnostic related features. One was the shift from DSM-3 to DSM-4.

878
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:48,120
And the other was the inclusion of psychiatric diagnoses in outpatient records, as opposed to just being inpatient psychiatric hospital records.

879
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:52,120
Those two factors alone, nothing else accounted for 60% of the increase.

880
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:57,120
Really? Yeah, now it's a big increase and there's still that 40%.

881
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:05,120
But once you factor in the sort of softer factors related to awareness, you know, you're probably going to be eating into that.

882
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,120
So, you know, that's why I think folks, and I don't know what others germiners are.

883
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:17,120
Many people believe that a large chunk of this, above 50%, you know, how far above is 75, 80, 90%.

884
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:25,120
It gets harder to know, but a large chunk of this is due to this constellation of diagnostic shifts and diagnostic awareness.

885
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:34,120
But I believe that there is a small chunk that is probably due to some changing, you know, real risk factors in the environment.

886
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,120
Do we know the numbers for maternal age increasing?

887
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,120
Yeah.

888
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,120
How much that's responsible for?

889
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:48,120
Yeah, so they haven't said it's looked at that and I think California did that and they found perhaps, I think, I want to say, perhaps a 10% contract.

890
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,120
But it's the same.

891
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,120
What's that?

892
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,120
I think it's maternal to the pet.

893
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,120
It's maternal to the pet.

894
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,120
It's maternal to the paternal age.

895
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:56,120
They've looked at the increasing increase of preterm birth.

896
01:17:56,120 --> 01:18:02,120
And the other thing you have to remember too is you have that same problem that we talked about, we talked about causes.

897
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:05,120
A lot of these things could overwrite when things overlap.

898
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:12,120
It's not, you're like, oh, you said 10%, you said 60%, paternal age 10%, you're getting very close to 100%.

899
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,120
But you can't do it like that.

900
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:19,120
You have to look at everything together and account for the overlapping contributors and no study has been able to do anything like that.

901
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,120
Thank you.

902
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,120
Yeah, thanks.

903
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:28,120
I want to thank the panel for some very interesting hypotheses and some interesting facts.

904
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:38,120
Now, as I sort of set my question, which is about how far we've come and where we're going.

905
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:45,120
I graduated from medical school down the street here 67 years ago and there's been a lot of progress.

906
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,120
I'm a gastroenterologist.

907
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,120
And let me explain to you what I mean.

908
01:18:49,120 --> 01:19:00,120
Pectic ulcer disease, two-dee-nolcer disease was more prevalent in the spring and in the fall and it's related in some ways to stress.

909
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:04,120
And then H. pylori, which was there all along, we saw it.

910
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,120
We just thought they were bacteria.

911
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,120
Well, they are bacteria.

912
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:15,120
And it took a long time to convince the community that it plays a major role in causing a due to ulcer.

913
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:24,120
So one has to be patient between the time that somebody first has light gone and the time that the community begins to accept it.

914
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:30,120
Now, one of the questions that I want to ask you is where are we going?

915
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,120
For instance, there's an opportunity.

916
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:38,120
Right now, there's a tension on the viral causes of brain development.

917
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:41,120
Zika has sort of lit the fire.

918
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:45,120
But there are a couple of others, toxoplasmosis is a factor.

919
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:49,120
German measles is a factor that we've known for a long time.

920
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,120
CMV is a factor.

921
01:19:51,120 --> 01:20:02,120
So I think there's an opportunity, these countries that were particularly hard hit, just having a small head is only, I think, part of, is just the tip of the iceberg.

922
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:10,120
I think these babies are probably affected in other ways that may not really show up for three or five years.

923
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:19,120
Can we mount some studies in these communities and even in Florida with these affected children?

924
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:26,120
And with, you know, it's very nice to do studies in zebrafish and in mice and you can slice their brains.

925
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:29,120
But with humans, you have to have more subtle ways of studying them.

926
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,120
Where do you think we're going?

927
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:38,120
I think that's a great point that there could be an opportunity with all the attention that's going to come and following highs.

928
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,120
You can expose populations.

929
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:49,120
You know, we think about a certain very narrow range of endpoints, but if we're going to go in there and we're going to put these kids under follow-up, there might be a great opportunity to look for a broader range of neurodevelopmental endpoints.

930
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,120
We might learn some things, so I think that's a great suggestion.

931
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:57,120
With respect to infectious causes of autism, that is an area where there has been an evidence-based growing.

932
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,120
And there is, you know, it's one of those things.

933
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:07,120
There have been a number of studies that have shown that prenatal infection, mostly earlier,

934
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:11,120
in the pregnancy period, although there have been some studies with positive findings later on,

935
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,120
has been linked to higher autism risk.

936
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:20,120
The types of data, you know, these have not been studies where there's been biomarkers of prenatal infection.

937
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:27,120
Largely, it's registry data, it's reports of infection on either outpatient or inpatient records.

938
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:32,120
But that is an area where there is real and real interest.

939
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:39,120
Toxo specifically has been looked at a little bit, and the findings there have not been as impressive.

940
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:47,120
But influenza in particular, prenatal influenza, is one particular agent that has shown a positive in a number of studies and folks who have fallen.

941
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:54,120
The most solid one is probably rubella, although we don't see it anymore.

942
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,120
I mean, vaccines prevent autism.

943
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:06,120
And that's just the clear example, that rubella exposure during a particular window, although thankfully we don't see it enough now that we can study it with today's methodology.

944
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:16,120
But that seems clearly linked with not just autism, but a whole array of problems, including sensory problems as well as brain developmental problems more generally.

945
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:28,120
So, you know, I think that it is clear that some of these infectious infections in utero are, in some cases, devastating.

946
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,120
And in other cases, less clearly linked.

947
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,120
The influenza data is a good example.

948
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:35,120
So there's lots of influenza data, but it's all a little different.

949
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,120
And so it's hard to pull apart.

950
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:55,120
I have a different answer to your question, though, about where we're going, not around the issue of Zika or infectious causes, but this is something that makes me hopeful for the field and we alluded to it, which is, I think there is going to be a sea change from sharp marrow categories

951
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:01,120
into an expansion all over psychiatry in understanding things along continuum.

952
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:09,120
And, you know, the NIH has played a role in this by advancing this thing called the research domain criteria for ARDOC. And it's had a lot of pushback.

953
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,120
It's certainly not been rolled out in the easiest way.

954
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,120
And there's a lot of concerns about it.

955
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:25,120
But I do think that general moving away from what was classically thought of as the DSM system that neatly divides people into groups and seeing many continue on.

956
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:33,120
And I don't think we know what all those continue on are yet. I think the current version of ARDOC is just the first staff at that, but it may look quite different in 10 or 20 years.

957
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:45,120
That that's going to give us the power, the statistical power that you alluded to earlier, to study things in a much broader way and then look at the interactions between these different dimensions.

958
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:50,120
But now, I don't know when that'll be clinically useful. It could be a while, but I think that's a good step.

959
01:23:50,120 --> 01:24:03,120
I just want to comment on the first gentleman's concern, though, because he was worried about that. And at the risk of doing a really poor analogy, over expansion of the borders is important as well.

960
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:13,120
And so, you know, I think we need to move from the meatball to the meatloaf, but we don't want to include the carrots and the onions and the pan, if you know what I'm saying.

961
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:19,120
So there is concern about that. I think in your comments, you were worried that there's some dilution of what we think autism is and that that's going to have asthma.

962
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:38,120
And that that's going to have adverse effects in our understanding. I think that is a legitimate concern, but I think as we move towards our doc and other ideas to think about dimensionality, we need to be mindful that I think people are being, even if that didn't come out in some of our earlier comments.

963
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:54,120
So, I, sorry, I tend to be more of a splitter than a lumper when it comes down to it. I think it's important when we're applying diagnoses that are used clinically and informed treatment to be honest about what we can say and not say.

964
01:24:54,120 --> 01:25:07,120
And I think in that case, it makes sense to say, look, we're somewhere in the meatloaf. But I think when it comes to science, it's much more helpful to not say, well, this child has autism spectrum disorder, but to say that this child has

965
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:21,120
this particular risk factor that contributes. So it may be that that's a way to get at people who are better defined. And from my perspective, the best definitions are ideologically relevant.

966
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:36,120
So the genetic syndromes, the biomarkers, studying kids who are born extremely preterm, very low birth weight, following them up, most of those kids are not going to develop autism spectrum disorder.

967
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:47,120
But if you can shift their developmental outcomes as a group, that's incredibly powerful. It makes me a little uncomfortable, honestly, to say that we're preventing autism that way.

968
01:25:47,120 --> 01:26:02,120
But we may well be improving developmental outcomes for a big group of kids in a really powerful way. And I would say that approach where we're studying, say, kids with a defined genetic risk factor that we can put our hands on and understanding

969
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:13,120
what changes their outcomes, understanding how that comes about. I think that that's the revolution. We're in the midst of. And some people call it precision medicine. I think ultimately it's about just like hypertension.

970
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:26,120
You want to know why? And once you've figured out, oh, this person has hypertension because they have a problem in their kidney, and you define what exactly the problem is and how you treat that particular case, and then expand outward to say, well, how many other folks can we find,

971
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:41,120
have a related problem that might yield to the same treatments? And I think that's ultimately where we go. And it's initially about splitting, not lumping, although clinically splitting, meaning smaller groups that have better definition

972
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,120
instead of larger groups that are really nebulous.

973
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:58,120
Where you can get every diet and exercise and shift it that way with the right about what it is. I think there's a quality of discussion issue that to me, I think that splitting, lumping isn't the ideal analogy. It goes in the direction of dimensionality.

974
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:13,120
Because in cardiology, there's no question that you have to decide to give the anti-hypertensive or not. I don't think anybody would ever argue that there's something bad about saying hypertension that I'm going to treat

975
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:35,120
or not going to treat. But nobody is under the illusion that there is some kind of a bimodal distribution of blood pressure. And I think we are under, continue to be in our debates under this false impression sometimes that if we only can get the answer of what is autism and what isn't. And I know, and you don't know, and I'm going to tell you what it is.

976
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,120
I think that's, I don't think that's good for our discussion.

977
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:48,120
We're all really separate. By the way, the blood pressure analogy is interesting because a few years ago, what was the limit? 160 and now it's 130?

978
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:53,120
Right. Sometimes you have to change depending on what you know.

979
01:27:53,120 --> 01:28:01,120
Okay. Do a chanchine neuropsychologist. I just wanted to address the question about the heterogeneity in autism.

980
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:12,120
Based on some new work that's coming out of Mount Sinai, they're Sea River Center, they're looking at genetics, they have international, hugely international pooling the genes.

981
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:21,120
And what they basically find is there are certain genes that are rare. And the rare ones that underlie autism, underlie specific subtypes.

982
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:30,120
But then there are other genes that they call common variants that we all have. But we have very few of them, so we don't manifest the autistic spectrum.

983
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:40,120
But those people who have a lot of them wind up showing signs of autism too. So it's a very diverse group with completely different genes.

984
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:48,120
So then you say, well, how do you wind up with autism, with all of those different genotypes, to them looking at the construction of the synapse?

985
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:59,120
And they're saying that many of these genes contribute in some way to putting together a synapse, and it really doesn't matter which way, like if your chair is wobbly, it doesn't really matter if the person is in the room.

986
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:04,120
It doesn't really matter if the front leg or the back leg or the back is thrown off or something like that.

987
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:13,120
You still have a wobbly, probably chair, it's how you get there. But you get there in different ways because it's different components of constructing these synapses.

988
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:19,120
And then the question you could ask is, well, maybe they're different synapses. Maybe some are synapses related to emotion.

989
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:22,120
Maybe those are the ones that are affected because they haven't yet determined that.

990
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:35,120
So the work they're doing now is to give growth factors, neural growth factors, and in very young children to see if that has anything to do with maybe correcting some of the deficit or promoting learning,

991
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:41,120
because if the synapses prevent adequate communication between the nerves, maybe you could do something to us.

992
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:57,120
So they're looking at that. They're also looking at oxytocin thinking maybe you can promote normal emotional interaction with, you know, just by adding something extra to the situation.

993
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:11,120
And then the third approach that this is not amounts on, but is the ABA therapy, you know, where some people are brought out. I still with that therapy, not everybody talks.

994
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:18,120
And, you know, so then you say, okay, well, maybe their genotype affected that pathway. It's a world different.

995
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:22,120
Thank you.

996
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,120
Last question.

997
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:41,120
Thank you for a great discussion. So my question about gender differences and autistic phenotype, because we know that it's one to four prevalence, but in genetics, back then we'll see that it's normal distribution of language and social skills between the relatives of autistic programs.

998
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:58,120
So how, what's happening, why they're not diagnosed until the lesson year's goals? And is it any, maybe, societal pressure or any language skills which allow goals to overcome this deficit from childhood?

999
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:02,120
Because we know that pragmatic language never better develop in females.

1000
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:19,120
I think the girls who have intellectual disabilities, those are diagnosed early. The one that are diagnosed late are those who have normal intelligence. And why is because their behavior is very different from the males, because girls are in general better at social interactions than boys.

1001
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:23,120
So maybe it's, and they're at this age.

1002
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,120
No?

1003
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,120
No, these are me and Populate.

1004
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:38,120
But what's interesting in the previous studies, in the extremely low birth weight with the premise where they were following these kids from the very beginning and doing all these tests, they don't find this one to one difference.

1005
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:45,120
So I think, again, we don't really know.

1006
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:58,120
Yeah, so I think that that's important. The girls who have intellectual disability plus autism, actually the lower the IQ, measured IQ goes, the smaller that ratio.

1007
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:06,120
So it's one to one if you get down into the range of IQ that most people would describe as almost unmeasurable.

1008
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:13,120
And then as you go up in some of the studies, it's as high as 10 to one in very gifted children.

1009
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:19,120
Why that is, so some people think it's based on societal expectations, sexism.

1010
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:22,120
I think that these are relevant expectations.

1011
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:36,120
But I think it also is meaningful that if you look at social aptitude measured any number of pace at an average level between men and women, women are more socially in tune on average.

1012
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:48,120
You take an individual, man, an individual woman, that isn't always true. But I think that this is something that probably does, in part, flavor the ratio that we see.

1013
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,120
And there's some evidence for why.

1014
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:55,120
So the expiratory I have been built on males. Does your child align little cars?

1015
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,120
Well, yeah, if he has cars to play with.

1016
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:06,120
I mean, there is a lot of things that were developed for boys that will not necessarily happen with girls.

1017
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:34,120
Thank you. Thank you.
