00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
I'm Ed Nurse-Assyan, Director of the Helix Center.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,080
Welcome to the program of this afternoon on biology of the mind.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,480
Just two announcements.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,640
Next week, the roundtable is on Nationalism, Phonaticism, and Identity.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,560
And on April 12th, we can get this up.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,400
And on April 12th, we have a roundtable on synchronicity.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,360
Today's roundtable is Biology of the Mind, and I will briefly present you the participants.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:44,320
I won't read everything that is on this paper, which I think some of you have, just the highlights.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,000
When I read your name, if you raise your hands, that would be helpful.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,240
So John Kraakauer is Professor of Neurology and Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:07,720
of School of Medicine, Director of the BLAM Lab and Co-Founder of the KATA project.

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:15,680
Gary Marcus is Director of the NYU Center for Language and Music and Professor of Psychology

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,080
at New York University.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:30,680
Ken Miller, who has been here before, is Professor Department of Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience,

15
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:38,880
Department of Physiology, and Director Center for Theoretical Neurobiology, Columbia University.

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,520
David Rosenthal is Professor of Philosophy and Coordinator of the Interdisciplinary Concentration

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,120
in Cognitive Science at the Graduate Center of the University of New York.

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,360
So Matthew, you want to...

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,520
Associate Professor of Computer Science and a member of the Center for Cognitive Science

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,000
at Rutgers in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Thank you.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay, well, my main work used to be on the mind-body problem.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,640
Now I mainly work on consciousness.

24
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,400
When I worked on the mind-body problem, it seemed to me very clear that all mental gongs

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:26,320
on are simply physical gongs on in the brain.

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,720
And maybe I won't say very much more about that right now, waiting to see what other people

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,520
say about that.

28
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,320
That seems to me unproblematic.

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:46,640
One of the things that was listed that we might talk about is how far down mental functioning

30
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,120
goes in the phylogenetic scale.

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,920
And I assume it goes pretty far down.

32
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,720
I don't know.

33
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,240
I don't know very much about fish.

34
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
I'm pretty sure...

35
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,840
Way lower than that.

36
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,400
Well I'm just saying I don't know very much about fish.

37
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,240
So you can...

38
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
I'm suspicious.

39
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,240
You're suspicious that fish have mental functioning?

40
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,760
I don't know very much about fish.

41
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,600
Fish may have mental functioning.

42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,960
Fish certainly have complicated biological functioning.

43
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,800
But it seems to me...

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,000
Well they certainly make choices about what they should do in a given context.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So what behavioral evidence I'm not a fish expert, but they make decisions about mates.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,160
They battle over mates.

47
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,920
They decide about obstacles and whether to go this way or that way.

48
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,800
To me that certainly counts as mental functioning.

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
You could...

50
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,840
I suppose have a definition of mental functioning that would have a higher bar.

51
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,160
You could say well you only have mental functioning if you can reflect on yourself.

52
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,160
But I would call that...

53
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,160
Oh no.

54
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
It's not mental functioning.

55
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
No, I don't...

56
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,920
They share lots of neurotransmitters and brain organization with us.

57
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,840
You can use the same kinds of instruments and even better instruments to look at their

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
neural processes.

59
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,840
To me it doesn't seem controversial to say that a fish has mental functioning.

60
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,640
It's just a question of deciding what is the mental function.

61
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Or a fly or a spider.

62
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,840
I mean if you're an animal with a nervous system you have mental functioning at some

63
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
level or so.

64
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,840
I go down to jellyfish and maybe even take the argument to bacteria.

65
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,200
I don't think that you need to set the bar anywhere near consciousness in the sense of

66
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,400
self-awareness or self-reflection.

67
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,480
It seems to me some plants do various things that are beneficial to the plants.

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,600
And it doesn't seem to me we want to say that's mental functioning.

69
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,040
So if a fish does something that's beneficial to the fish like choose a nice mate or get

70
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:01,000
some food or go away from an environment that isn't conducive, that doesn't seem automatically

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,440
to be mental functioning.

72
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:10,360
It seems to me there must be some difference between biological functioning and mental

73
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
functioning.

74
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Well what's this?

75
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,800
Now we get to what we really need to respond to.

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Well I don't...

77
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
One of you would define what you mean by mental functioning.

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,480
Well it's his term and I want to define it but the last point that he said is even more

79
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,440
provocative I suppose, which is I take it and I thought you did that all mental functioning

80
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
is biological functioning.

81
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Oh I take it.

82
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
And the functioning is a subset of biological functioning.

83
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,920
Absolutely but it's a subset.

84
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,440
I just agree with that.

85
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,160
You want to disagree with that part?

86
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,720
Well certainly it would be non-biological mental functioning.

87
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,600
Oh I agree with that.

88
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:52,160
I don't let's hear that argument.

89
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,520
In principle if you think that when you take a functional approach to the mind and you

90
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:09,760
want to describe either making decisions, pursuing goals, acting in ways that seem intelligent

91
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,600
in the context, that functional behavior as best we can tell is something that we can

92
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,040
understand at the level of what we usually call information processing in the sense that

93
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,040
there is represented information about the world in some physical form that's then controlling

94
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,000
the behavior of the system.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,320
And we know that one way that that can happen is in neurons but as best we can tell that

96
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,600
can happen in silicon or really any other physical system.

97
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
That's a different kind of distinction.

98
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,520
I'm willing to, here I'll give you a revised version if we're opening the window to silicon

99
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,880
which would be that when biological creatures have mental functions they do it using biology.

100
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,560
For them it's a subset of biology but you could use silicon and then we don't really

101
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,920
apply the word biology to silicon.

102
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,480
There'd probably be mergers in the next 20 or 30 years we could talk about where it would

103
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,880
be more complicated to draw those dividing lines.

104
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,800
But if the argument you want to make is it's possible to have mental functioning and some

105
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,600
other kind of substrate say silicon I think that's a reasonable argument but I wouldn't

106
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,840
want to make the argument that there's any mental functioning that we humans do for example

107
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,600
that doesn't have a biological basis.

108
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,520
We can't ultimately trace down to these things like actions of neurons and so forth.

109
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,320
I don't know if anybody wants to challenge that view.

110
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,520
So I'm agreed with all of that.

111
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,040
I guess I would challenge another tiny aspect of what you said.

112
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,560
You said and I agree that mental functioning is a subset of biological functioning.

113
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Which subset?

114
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,640
Well, I mean I think there are many things that go into that subset.

115
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,480
I think we can start exclusionarily maybe and we can say although it gets problematic quickly

116
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,520
so we can say we're mostly not talking about things like metabolism but the truth is that

117
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,800
they do matter.

118
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,520
So a lot of the machinery that goes into the biology of thought goes into the biology in

119
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
general.

120
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,480
So if you take away the Krebs cycle that gives us metabolism in individual cells you take

121
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,160
away thought you take a lot of other things away too.

122
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,160
But the way that evolution works is it builds new things on top of old things and mental

123
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,840
life is built on biological life so neurons are specialized cells.

124
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,200
A lot of the machinery we expect in a cell in general we find tweaked in some particular

125
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,760
way in a neuron.

126
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:35,640
So I understand all of that but I would have thought that the distinction between the mental

127
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:42,640
as a smaller subset of the biological was going to be in some way or another functional.

128
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,400
That is to say we would say well there's all this biological stuff going on and some

129
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,680
of it some of the biology serves mental functioning.

130
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,040
So liver is absorbing or dealing with toxins for example.

131
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,720
It's probably biological but it's not mental function.

132
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,360
I don't know what we're talking about.

133
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,720
I have to say the same thing.

134
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
I don't quite know.

135
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Everyone must be completely bewildered.

136
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,920
I mean what are we arguing about?

137
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,520
In other words how do you know when you want to describe something?

138
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,560
I think it's you know it comes from philosophy and David there's our representative philosopher.

139
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,960
You want to be able to say what counts as mental what counts as physical and what is

140
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,520
the relation between the two.

141
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,640
If we don't give the audience an answer to this question that's been bandied about for

142
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,120
twenty five hundred years then they're right to ask for their money back.

143
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,720
So we should try to answer this question about what is the relation between them.

144
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,200
But there's I mean you're starting with the dualism which you know I think most of us

145
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,800
at bottom maybe all of us reject.

146
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,920
But I think we have a.

147
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I think we have a.

148
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,800
But the question is what is the revised view?

149
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,240
How do you articulate the revised view?

150
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
I think there are no dualists I think.

151
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,160
But these are the tests you finish your song.

152
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,080
Thank you.

153
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,040
You know what we think of as mental functioning I think is where you sense what's going on

154
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,720
in the world and you decide how to behave toward the world based on that sensing.

155
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,280
And I guess and I would talk about I mean so some of that could be metabolic you sense

156
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,640
that there's some glucose in the environment or something.

157
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,120
So okay I'll grant it needs a little bit more distinction but in essence but maybe not maybe

158
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,680
that's even the beginning of mental functioning but it's basically what animals have to do

159
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:35,880
that plants don't have to do which is they've got to get their food by going after it and

160
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,360
they in order to do that and they've got to find their mates by going after them.

161
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,440
You know just to spur your seeds to the wind and all the apparatus that let's just do that

162
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,840
and let's just see you know sense what's going on out in the world and then develop a behavior

163
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,880
to deal with the world based on that that allows us to reproduce that's mental functioning

164
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
as far as I understand.

165
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,280
Well don't plants up the roots go after water or light or light.

166
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,640
It's a I mean I think this is the wrong level I mean I think what everyone I mean my guess

167
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,560
is that what people are intrigued by as you go up to a phylogenetic scale and I'm allowed

168
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,760
to say that people in evolutionary biology hate that value judgement about going up or

169
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,160
down is I'll give an example maybe this will help you know the lobster has its claws and

170
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,320
it's at the bottom of the ocean and its own tail gets into its line of sight and it suddenly

171
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,640
lunges for its tail is that because it doesn't realize that that tail belongs to me and is

172
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,440
that because it doesn't have such a conception I think people who care about consciousness

173
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,080
and some philosophers like Daniel Dannett will only speak about humans because of this notion

174
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,720
of I but on the other hand there are ways that the nervous system can actually give you

175
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,680
a sense of self through E. Fringe copy and proprioception so the lobster probably won't

176
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,920
start feasting on its own tail without actually having to conceive of the lobster saying I'm

177
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,880
not going to eat my own tail because it's mine and anyone who has a cat sometimes a

178
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,960
cat starts chasing its own tail you get the funny sense that it's forgotten that it's

179
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,840
actually something attached to itself okay now there's an entire neuroscience of this

180
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,720
notion of sense of your own body versus the external world and some philosophers and neuro

181
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,200
scientists have said that consciousness is just some kind of evolutionary adaptation

182
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,600
on that system that can distinguish self from non-self so there's certainly an argument that

183
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,280
can be made using neuro-sci-free principles for how you might be able to iteratively reach

184
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,520
something that phenomenologically is consciousness and I think what everyone in the room including

185
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,440
probably us is it doesn't feel comfortable intuitively that consciousness is just going

186
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:49,160
to be one more phenomenon generated by the nervous system that has all these as Nicholas

187
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,400
Humphrey puts it magical feeling and qualities to them therefore we have to invoke something

188
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,280
qualitatively different to explain it that we don't demand of any other manifestation

189
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,200
of another system now I frankly I don't want the other speakers think think that's an illusion

190
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,360
I take the Dennett view that because it feels qualitatively different therefore the mechanism

191
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,440
has to be qualitatively different and I think that is something that we need to basically

192
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,480
get rid of because what it really is if you say that is dualism in its modern guys right

193
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:28,480
that and I dismissed that actually and I think Ken does probably as well I'm not sure I followed

194
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:37,760
all of that I mean there can be simpler and more complicated neural mechanisms and so

195
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:45,120
there's no reason to suppose immediately that we know what mechanisms are going to

196
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,600
correspond what mechanisms are going to sub serve more or less advanced psychological or

197
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:59,040
mental functioning but my thought about this wasn't that there was anything magical I don't

198
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,960
think that there is anything magical I started out by saying it's all biological and I think

199
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:11,640
it's all neural so far as we know it is but it does seem to me that it's a subset of the

200
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:18,360
neural reflex arcs aren't going to count as something that is psychological or mental

201
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,920
I think even though they're neural and so we have to be able to give a little bit of

202
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:33,480
thought to what it is that constitutes the subset oh and there's wonderful work on that

203
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,560
and you're totally right in other words there's work on binocular rivalry there's work on

204
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,160
other phenomena where it does seem that it's a subset of regions that seem to be responsible

205
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,720
for this you know if you can extrapolate from perception for example V1 you know primary

206
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,600
visual cortex doesn't seem to have this property extra strike cortex may have this property

207
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,720
when it comes to motor cortex it doesn't seem to have this property prefrontal singular

208
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,200
inferior parietal cortex seems to have it so I absolutely the property of this extra

209
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,560
property of the mental of the kind that I was mentioning we should be careful here I don't

210
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,520
think it's a property yeah I think we're talking about two different things and we

211
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,760
need to keep them separate before we make decisions about them one one is about whether

212
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,960
something's mental or not and the other is about whether something is a part of awareness

213
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,760
and what I heard in your neuro anatomy there was an inventory of the things that participate

214
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,160
in awareness but I would argue that you don't need any of those things to have a mental

215
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,160
property so men reflexes are actually worth arguing about and or grounding our terms whether

216
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,640
a reflex is a mental property so I would say that a rock doesn't have a mental property

217
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,880
of being able to make anything like a decision and when I bang your knees not exactly a decision

218
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,760
but it is to me it seems like a cognitive system there's an input there's an output there's

219
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,160
information processing and so for me I would actually count that as mental not awareness

220
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,040
I mean almost by definition that particular reflex is not the word mental for you just

221
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:13,080
become anything that a nervous system does it well I mean basically that's making mental

222
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,520
synonymous with what a nervous system can do well just no work up to Matthew's point about

223
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,120
functionalism and maybe machines could do mental things too so if a machine does calculation

224
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,840
you know it depends on how you want to find the terms it goes back to do airplanes fly

225
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,080
or not well it depends on how you want to find fly and this is why I wanted us to ground

226
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,920
these definitions early before we get into the stratosphere of like what do we count

227
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:44,320
as mental or not I'm perfectly comfortable attributing mental to a reflex because I think

228
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,560
that's what biological creatures do in response to certain kinds of stimuli and all the grounds

229
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,600
for excluding it but we can we can make a different definition I just want to be firm about it

230
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:01,680
so if the stimulus is the sun and the plant goes towards the stimulus that's mental I'd

231
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,120
like to know more about plant biology there was a pretty interesting article in the Yorker

232
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,360
which I did not yet read I confess not too long ago there are lots of neurotransmitters

233
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,600
can might know this literature better than I do but you find in plants that there's you

234
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,160
know there's some relation between the neurotransmitters we have and some set of signaling molecules

235
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,280
that are in the plant so there's signaling and somebody could say that signaling is you

236
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:30,600
know at least the first step towards mentality so so well and maybe this is this is partly

237
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,800
the divide between the empirical scientists and the philosophy just how we think about

238
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,840
things but what we're talking about is not the world and what's out there what we're

239
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,480
talking about is our our concepts and where we want to draw the lines on them you know

240
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,120
and and we start with I mean I think our real interest from about the mind comes from the

241
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,560
fact that we have one and we experience one and so a lot of our real interest is in self

242
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,240
is in all the stuff we're aware of but then of course we're aware there's a lot of stuff

243
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,160
we're not aware of and so we're interested in that too and then you start trying to generalize

244
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,400
and look at other animals and try to see how much of it like us and how much of it different

245
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,560
from us and but it's a concept mind is not a thing that that God created or Plato put

246
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,240
out there in the world it's a concept we're just you can draw your lines where you like

247
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,200
I wouldn't be uncomfortable with with calling you know plants doing active things in the

248
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,600
world mind and I wouldn't be uncomfortable with not calling a mind I don't know that

249
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,720
it's a really critical thing to work out I mean I agree with you and I think it depends

250
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,960
on where you want to go from there if we're going to start as a ground assumption and

251
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,960
ask a question like what is the relation between consciousness and the mental we need to know

252
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,960
what we mean by the mental but I agree with you that these are things that don't have

253
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,440
an absolute truth we're we make some cut definitionally and then we can go from there and try to

254
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,520
build something based on that initial cut so suppose we just think about let's forget

255
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,240
about plants and we think about what nervous systems do as our as our grounding for mental

256
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,920
functioning and then maybe this some subset to that that we're particularly interested

257
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,840
in I would I would vote for you know let's just start there in order to focus the conversation

258
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,080
let me throw out a concrete example that I think is interesting to think about which

259
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,400
is the worm the CL again's worm which is one of these model organisms that we know a lot

260
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:20,480
about including the connective of all of its 302 neurons and there are some interesting

261
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,680
neurons in there like I think it's the AIB intern neuron one thing that it does is it

262
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,760
seems to correlate with hunger and with a kind of state where the worm can do one thing

263
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,040
or another thing depending on hunger I got this example from Corey Bergman who's who's

264
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,360
on the NIH panel among other things for the brain initiative and she's she described having

265
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,360
a picnic at her house and she said you know there was all this wonderful fresh meat that

266
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,000
all of her graduate students were gravitating to but she had a nora virus at that moment

267
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,560
and so she was repulsed by the same smell and the point is that you can be in different

268
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,240
states which were split back to an external stimulus in the worm I think is in this case

269
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,560
so there are there are input neurons that respond to particular smells there are motor

270
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,920
neurons that engage particular actions mostly turning around that's what worms do and then

271
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,880
there are these intern neurons that mediate so the worm can be basically be in a hunger

272
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,880
state or not for me and people can argue with it and it is partly definitional but for me

273
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,040
that seems like a rudimentary example of a kind of awareness and in this state or I'm

274
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,440
in that state I'm not any longer driven purely by reflex I'm driven by which state I'm in

275
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,320
for me that that act already puts it over the edge and then everything else is complexity

276
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,600
everything else is more complicated states I don't think you have to accept that view

277
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,240
but that's the view that I've been sort of gravitating towards like what state you're

278
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,000
in digestively you've had a big meal you've had a small meal you're starving whatever

279
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
it is you'll behave differently it doesn't seem to me that the digestive system is part

280
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,920
of what subserves psychology yeah well Gary I'm puzzled by you by using the word awareness

281
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,120
there I mean you can be a different state but you don't know you're not necessarily aware

282
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,600
of any of them well I mean I think the self-awareness is reflective awareness which I think is a different

283
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,760
thing so I would not argue that the worm has any self-awareness but I would say that it

284
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,600
has an awareness of its environment that those states it has an awareness of an internal

285
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,680
state it may not be able to reflect on it and speak about it but that internal state mediates

286
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,960
its input output relations that's true but that's true we've known about state dependent

287
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,000
reflexes for half a century I didn't say it was new I just thought it was a nice example

288
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,160
stretch reflex stretch reflex is state dependent tell me you know depending on where you are

289
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,080
in the gate cycle for example will completely determine what your 1A afferent neurons and

290
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:53,400
spindles will do so even I mean even the notion of a reflex itself is problematic because

291
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,880
reflexes can be remarkably intelligent they can have state dependent reversals they can

292
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,240
be context dependent so I think that I agree with you that you can take something that

293
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,240
seems so simple and rudimentary like a reflex and begin to show that they can have intelligence

294
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,040
and the view I would take about reflexes if they are simply primitives that we incorporate

295
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,720
into more complex behaviors and what you've described you know in C. elegans is simply

296
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,840
the stretch reflex in another dies well there's actually a second question in that neighborhood

297
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,320
that I've been thinking about lately which is I call it the subsumption issue so it seems

298
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,120
like consciousness is unified you have one conscious state and we could talk about split

299
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,920
brains as a possible counter example and so forth but in general it seems like you're

300
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,360
aware of one state and there's all kinds of details modulating that but it seems at least

301
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,320
logically possible that if you're let's say a low order creature and I know about the

302
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,440
evolutionary biology cautions on that you are already looting to but if you're a low

303
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,800
order creature that maybe your only state is hunger or not and if you're a high order

304
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,600
creature there are many things that enter into your awareness but maybe some of the principles

305
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
are the same.

306
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,880
Just one other point I mean awareness and consciousness in the incognative neuroscience

307
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,760
and not synonyms so they can dissociate so for example Anton syndrome where people have

308
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:21,800
occipital strokes and they're blind will be unaware that they're blind but they are

309
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,000
blind and they're having the problems are blindness experiencing them but they're not

310
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,120
unaware of other things but that but so in other words there's they're different so

311
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,320
I and also again I do think for the sake of myself and the audience we have to sort of

312
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:43,480
be clear where we're going one is what are what are the you know is there a hierarchy

313
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,680
of behaviors that only nervous systems are capable of and do they have to be implemented

314
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,240
by biological tissue or by silicon and I think we've agreed that you could probably imagine

315
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,400
processes being done by other materials we can have our clue as to what we're interested

316
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,880
in by behaviors and then have a hierarchy and I think what's being implied here is that

317
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,640
at the top of the hierarchy of behaviors that can be implemented by circuits whether biological

318
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,200
or not is consciousness right that's what we're really talking about here is we start

319
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:20,600
with reflexes can we go with the the approaches and experiments and concepts that we use to

320
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,080
explain reflexes and can we extrapolate to consciousness that's what we're really talking

321
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:32,280
about here and I think again that we probably can right that we it may seem counterintuitive

322
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,200
and there may be a dualist urge but I think we can go from reflexes which are surprisingly

323
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,480
complex which is good because they've already got characteristics that may make them worthy

324
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,560
of study and I'll be very blunt I study the motor system and visual motor transformations

325
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:54,000
which I think lie just in that intermediate space between reflexes and consciousness with

326
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,200
the hope that by studying this intermediate kind of behavior we're going to be able to

327
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,120
generalize up and down and actually get to where we're going rather than jumping in

328
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,640
and studying consciousness and I don't know what the psychologists say about that but

329
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,560
I do think it's important to realize that we can use the same armamentarium and the same

330
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:18,800
concepts to ultimately I think explain something even as seemingly mysterious as consciousness

331
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:25,600
but I think that's what we're talking about here can we get there right.

332
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,280
So I would let me let me throw out my thought on that which then people can shoot down that

333
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:40,120
well first of all we've got nobody's debating that it all just is something the mind the

334
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,320
brain does is the nervous system does and there's nothing else magical going on so if

335
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:51,400
we can all grant that but the question is you know what can we say scientifically about

336
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:58,720
consciousness important to what does it mean to explain it and my own thoughts are that

337
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:06,920
in principle we can we will be able to say you know with absolute clarity this kind of

338
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:12,080
structure of neural activity and through consciousness and this kind of structure of neural activity

339
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,160
does not enter consciousness and these aspects of this piece of mental of neural structure

340
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,960
and through consciousness will will be able in principle there's no reason why we can't

341
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,320
completely correlate every aspect of consciousness to every aspect of neural functioning but

342
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,600
to explain why we're not zombies we'll still have a question to explain why we actually

343
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,600
are aware of anything when all this happens I don't understand how science could possibly

344
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:44,520
approach that the whole nature of science is that we I mean the world as we encounter

345
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,000
it has subjectivity and objectivity the whole nature of science is to extract the objective

346
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,800
and the reproducible out of this mess of subjectivity and objectivity and now we want science to

347
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,760
tell us why some set of mental constructions leads to an internal awareness I don't even

348
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,520
know what why would mean I just don't see how you pose that as a scientific question we

349
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,280
could say everything about when it happens but why are we not zombies I don't see how

350
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:17,560
I don't know what to do with that question so by subjectivity you mean what well everything

351
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:23,760
that our internal experience our internal awareness so could you derive from first principles

352
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,960
just to make this concrete what it feels like to be in pain to experience an orgasm or what

353
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,840
it's like to perceive the color red so there's one piece of the problem that seems very straight

354
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:41,320
forward if not easy which is which which information source are you aware of it at any given point

355
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,400
neuroscience is making a lot of progress on that so we John Davis a rundown before these

356
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,520
areas seem to be part of that awareness circuitry and these aren't you can say that this particular

357
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,000
thing is enters into v1 but doesn't go beyond there and so forth we can characterize this

358
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
this is this is Ned Bloch's access consciousness versus phenomenal consciousness but can we

359
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,800
explain these other things could you explain to an alien what it's like to experience an

360
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,280
orgasm given the facts that we know about how the brain works or could you only say for

361
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,560
example it's represented in this way in the prefrontal cortex and there's this other

362
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,160
representation in the brainstem and these are the patterns of activity that we see during

363
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,800
the orgasm but not actually be able to explain yeah I mean I think this is the core question

364
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,880
would we ever be able to explain to an alien what it's like to see red and I think this

365
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,160
is the most I mean again I take the denit and Humphrey view this is such a pseudo question

366
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,960
I mean there's no denying that there's such a thing as qualia and experience but I think

367
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:52,080
what the fallacy of it is to think that the explanation is going to feel like the thing

368
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,520
it's explaining now why do we think that explanations when it comes to consciousness have to feel

369
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,640
like consciousness itself in other words it's the same fallacy I think anybody's saying

370
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,840
that well that I think that is what's actually happening is it okay you've explained memory

371
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,800
with synaptic changes but it doesn't have the memoryness of memory when you explain it that

372
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,600
way well but John take the question of the questions take take the question of why you

373
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,760
have an awareness of something and you're not a zombie that's the thing I think we can't

374
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,680
address but you think we can address that when you say why I want to know what you mean

375
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:30,800
by why so let me just you know take the denit Humphrey line right where they and there are

376
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,920
two questions that come to the bottom of consciousness well three right one is could you detect it

377
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,120
in another person doesn't mean you know what it feels like but couldn't alien come down

378
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,880
as Nicholas Humphrey has written about and do enough recordings and observations to say

379
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,920
this is a conscious being not a zombie a b what are the neural bases for consciousness

380
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,440
we don't know right he comes up you'll be interested with the idea of you piggyback on

381
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,000
E. France copy and forward models you develop a reverberating attractor and that itself

382
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,720
leads to a endogenous feeling that's called consciousness but there's there's all the

383
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,760
magic leads to no no no but I could say that about anything else so when when I say I want

384
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,120
to pick up this cup the commands that I need to generate to reach that cup we don't know

385
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,880
what they look like they certainly don't look like the movement itself in other words there's

386
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,920
no obvious mapping if you have a windscreen wipe of switch on your car right and you see

387
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,240
the windscreen wipe is going like that the one thing you don't need to do with the switch

388
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,120
on the cars it doesn't have to look anything like it I think you're attacking a strong

389
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,960
man optical illusions are the same thing it's never the explanations just going to be that

390
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,240
is the necessary and sufficient conditions in the brain to cause the phenomenal other

391
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,800
of all phenomenon and to say that the explanation has to feel like the phenomenon will never

392
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,520
happen well no no but this is this is my question I can say this is this is the you know this

393
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:04,760
is the correlate oh I mean we can't say cause we can say correlate in if you lesion it any

394
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,840
of you had a measure of consciousness go it goes I mean correlation and cause can be fused

395
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:18,280
if you do necessary sufficient conditions so you're you're not telling us what this subjectivity

396
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,440
is you're speaking of it is something other than you're speaking out of it is something

397
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,840
that gets caused or gets led to or something of that sort I think what probably an alien

398
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:39,600
isn't going to find out is an alien isn't going to have your experiences so if the demand

399
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,720
is to have your experiences then not going to happen but the alien isn't going to have

400
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,800
your stomach or your food or anything else you isn't going to have your home or your

401
00:31:51,800 --> 00:32:00,720
car right that's different so I'm not I'm still puzzled by what this thing is you're calling

402
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,040
subjectivity so it does seem to me it does seem to me that you can give a pretty good

403
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:13,040
explanation not in neurological terms but in psychological terms as to what's going on

404
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:22,600
when you see red I won't for today hazard a guess as to how to describe orgasm but seeing

405
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:28,520
red is a lot closer for example to seeing orange than it is to seeing blue and you can

406
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,200
get a kind of quality space which people have mapped and you can give a description of what

407
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:41,360
it's like to see red in those terms and you and I assume that if neither of us colorblind

408
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,000
and colorblindness is perfectly testable empirically we assume that more or less my

409
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,560
do love the difference of cone distributions in our eyes this is going to be the same for

410
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,840
you and the same for me right but I'm not going to have your experiences and you're not going

411
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,400
to have my experiences so if that's the mystery of subjectivity it doesn't seem to be a mystery

412
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:09,480
at all my two degree well look we can build everybody agrees we can build a robot that

413
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,040
has some interesting behavior not nearly as interesting as ours but has some interesting

414
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,920
behavior I think we would also all agree that the robots we can build right now don't have

415
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,800
any self-awareness don't have any consciousness don't know if we know that in advance there

416
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,800
are this guy named Scott's a lady at Yale who's been building robots that have a swarm of self-awareness

417
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,480
so they can recognize themselves maybe in a mirror and they can plan around their own

418
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,160
bodies and so forth so that's actually not as obvious as as you're presuming it do you

419
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,880
I think that they have subjective awareness like you and I do well I mean I go back and

420
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,720
forth on this there are days in which I think this is a pseudo problem as these gentlemen

421
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,040
have been saying and that there's no way to answer that question so we don't have a meter

422
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,120
that can evaluate this person has a subject subjective awareness or not and I think the

423
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,200
reason why I think it's not a pseudo problem is because I can absolutely imagine a world

424
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,080
where we do all the things we do for all the reasons that we do them and we have no subjective

425
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,440
experience about it well I don't know what you're imagining when you imagine that there

426
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,640
these people like the Chalmers who say that they can imagine this and they can imagine

427
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:26,360
that and I think this is wonderful I can't and so I would like to know from you what it

428
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:32,520
is you're imagining that is to say what I'm imagining the robot for a good thing behavior

429
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,360
but I'm quite confident does not have anything like my experience so I'm taking you to be

430
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:44,280
a generous fellow and therefore to accord me experiences of Brown and so forth and so

431
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:53,560
on but on what basis just just by analogy to my own experience and then but what's the analogy

432
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,160
I mean you can't if it's the right I can never say for experience but I you know I take it

433
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,760
for granted but I can't prove it no no no no no not I'm not asking for proof proof is

434
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:13,200
for mathematicians that's what he is a little bit okay so in that field I defer to you with

435
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,440
proof but we just want a good reason we want something to go with here there are always

436
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,960
people in this room why do you think any of them has experiences of anything why aren't

437
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,160
they all like the robot that you were imagining what is the reason for this is it just an analogy

438
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,840
to one person it's good when I talk with them they exchange you know when we talk we exchange

439
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,160
we think that that that that tell me that that they make me believe that what goes on

440
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,120
inside you is pretty much like what goes on inside me I'm sure that they're going to

441
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:51,440
get robots that are really good at that kind of thing well at some point there may be a

442
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,160
question about the robots right now there isn't see what you're asking I'm not going to agree

443
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,480
with you some the second question I mean the neural basis of consciousness is very difficult

444
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,080
right and some the neural basis of it is very difficult some people may never agree maybe you

445
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,080
won't are you saying mental and I'm talking about consciousness now whatever this awareness

446
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,960
self-reflection the non the anti-zombie right that's what I'm talking about mental and

447
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,320
not interested just nervous system stuff okay but then the second question is why do we have

448
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,000
consciousness at all and my problem and I agree with you about this robot world where everyone

449
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,960
is it wouldn't look like our world I mean consciousness was presumably selected for it was

450
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,240
presumably piggybacked on some previous function and it probably has some benefits otherwise we

451
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,480
wouldn't have it and what those better than you're saying there is such an it and there'd be a

452
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,400
possibility of not having it I'm saying yes that's subjectivity I thought a minute ago you said that there

453
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,360
wasn't really any hit there no no no I said that there's no problem with I don't I don't just

454
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,400
agree that there's subjectivity in consciousness and I also agree there's more of it in humans than

455
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,680
other animals what I was saying is not sure that the Nagel the Nagel view of what it liked to be

456
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,120
a bat is not a scientific question in my view all we need to know I don't think it's a question of

457
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,280
any sort yes agreed but people get hung up on saying what's it like to be me and think that

458
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,920
scientists are going to come up with an explanation that's what I'm pointing to a question when I'm

459
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,240
asking about the what I'm saying about the robot point is that consciousness is probably what makes

460
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:27,560
everyone in this room sit and listen to us blather on right they actually come here and go I want to

461
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:33,000
learn about the mysteries of life I'm interested that when your dog is panting and can't wait to go

462
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,680
for a walk right take me for a walk give it were a robot it would just you know presumably you can

463
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,240
go robot to do that no but then what you're doing is your mimicking your mimicking these funny

464
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:51,720
features of joy and exuberance and curiosity and those might be useful actually for evolutionary

465
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:58,200
purposes and that may be what we're talking about but hold on there's evolutionary purpose in having

466
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,160
a motivational system and having a selective attention system and so forth and consciousness is a

467
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,440
uber version of that well that's the question is so what is it what is it adding beyond the

468
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,240
selection attention the motivation and so forth think why not just have an organism that had those

469
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,560
is there some extra thing that we're trying to explain and what is that extra well I'm gonna I'm

470
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:24,000
going to study for the next through four years to be a doctor because then I'll be able to make money

471
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,240
and help people think about that that's a motivational system an animal there's no animal that can

472
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,440
see four years ahead we have different motivational systems and other animals I don't doubt that all

473
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:41,120
I'm saying is that perhaps consciousness is the prerequisite for that much more complicated form

474
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:46,400
of motivation that's what I'm saying I think that there's reason to think that that's not the case

475
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,920
because look thinking thinking can occur without being conscious what is that mean how how how

476
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,440
oh easy oh so all the stuff that happened before you're aware what you think it's nothing but I'm

477
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,240
thinking just becomes again like mental a synonym for anything your nervous system can process and

478
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,800
do no it doesn't but it's quite specific you have a problem you don't know how to solve it you say

479
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,960
oh to heck with it I'm going to bed and the next morning you wake up and by gosh there's the solution

480
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:24,720
and so what's this what this is complicated enough that it's going to have mental content it's going

481
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,880
to have what people in philosophy call a propositional or intentional content expressable by that

482
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:39,840
causes I think that such and such I think so and so and it's going to be describable in the same way

483
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:46,320
that we describe conscious thought except for the bit about you're not aware of it taking place so

484
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:54,640
it's thinking but it is unconscious and the question is what is the being conscious add to it because

485
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:03,120
to get an animal to do what's good for the animal right it needs to think and it needs to have

486
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:09,440
selective attention it needs to have all of these things but none of those processes need to occur

487
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,880
consciously well I just want to just to clarify again for the audience no one's denying that

488
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,840
there are quite complex implicit cognitive processes a whole wonderful field your Tim

489
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:25,920
shallis is written beautifully on this that you can have processes that look analogous to

490
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,480
processes that you're conscious of without consciousness on them and you want to deny that those are

491
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,640
thinking no well okay so if you grant that those are thinking that I don't know how to make sense

492
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,880
of what I'm saying I'm going to say no right because then thinking stops doing useful work as a

493
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,680
concept so let's take me overnight well no it doesn't stop doing that useful work what you can do

494
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,840
with thinking is for one thing infer so you have this thought and that thought leads to this thought

495
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,000
which leads to that thought and you wake up in the morning with the solution well okay let me just

496
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,800
say talk about that so we have no evidence right that qualitatively what you just described when

497
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,320
awake and conscious is what's going on overnight when you have your aha moment in fact consolidation

498
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,400
so just for those of you who aren't neuroscience it is true that you can have all sorts of

499
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:21,840
improvements overnight in many many tasks that you did the day before and come back better the next

500
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:27,200
day with no additional practice right so the question is something was going on in your brain

501
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:33,440
overnight that continued what you were doing and you wake up and you're better and you could

502
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,440
extrapolate to say maybe that's the aha moment because you were doing something overnight there

503
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,880
people and study hippocampal replay for example but what seems to be happening is you may be

504
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,800
tuning neurons better right and so that when you now use that same circuit to do the same thing

505
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,440
the next day it's better at it that tuning that went on overnight doesn't itself need to be called

506
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,600
thinking it certainly needs to be called learning but they're not so not are you going to not

507
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,720
sit I mean I always think learning to be a subset of thinking but you've got a different definition

508
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,920
I think we obviously we have another uh definitional issue here what what is your definition of thinking

509
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,440
that it excludes learning no I think thinking is another one of these dangerous vague terms that

510
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,160
people have a fuzzy colloquial notion about you seem confident in writing around and excluding

511
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,280
things I gave you a pretty tight I would say that thinking is another word we give to conscious

512
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:32,160
neural processing no more no less so all of Kahneman's system one things you would exclude from thought

513
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,760
then I mean all this kind of automatic intuitive stuff that's well I mean that's another you know

514
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,960
what we're going to call Kahneman's cached ideas I mean for those you know system one system two

515
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,920
what system one is and there are many other areas in neuroscience that look like system one

516
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,600
it where you have a cached repertoire of responses that are triggered right because it would be

517
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,640
incredibly annoying if you had to keep from first principles deriving your responses so yes the

518
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,880
nervous system has cached repertoires of responses and we're gonna let's be careful there because

519
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,800
there's interpolation there so you can you can without conscious effort do some kind of posture

520
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,120
for example or adapt to some unusual posture let's say you're carrying something I'd give you some

521
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,120
extra weight you don't have to think about it but you're changing your motor system that's because

522
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:23,360
you have a control policy a pre-established cached control policy and basically system one in the

523
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:29,440
culture domain is a control policy we should probably define these terms well I'm just saying

524
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,280
I think what's better for the audience is to realize that once one starts to get systematic

525
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,560
and one starts to be thick in one's descriptions of the phenomena one's interested in then you

526
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,440
realize that it's not really the terms we're getting hung up on it's the range of the phenomenology

527
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:53,360
we're trying to talk about like that we have like a coffee which over here so um I think that

528
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:58,720
it's helpful just to talk about the phenomena and how we're trying to describe them and study them

529
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:05,520
so that's interesting but I'm still stuck with your your word thinking because you're using it

530
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,800
in a very different way than I've heard before I would just want to clarify something you're

531
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,760
saying that anything that's cached is not thinking I look I'm not going to be I'm saying you know

532
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:23,600
I'm like the philosophers I don't believe that interesting discussions require rigid definitions

533
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,840
if you look at modern epistemology and philosophy where you talk about knowledge a lot of very

534
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,480
interesting working philosophies been done on knowledge without a definition that's rigid of

535
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,320
what knowledge is and I'm saying that I'm trying to make distinctions which have fuzzy boundaries I

536
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:46,400
admit but I'm saying that to talk about offline tuning of neurons in the brain during sleep as

537
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,840
equivalent to what we do when we're awake and thinking I was granting your sleeping case but I

538
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:57,760
was very interested in the the Kahneman system one stuff so it's a different way of construing

539
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,760
what thought is to say that thought only includes the deliberate conscious reflective kind of stuff

540
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,760
when we sit here and we take a long time I guess as most people here probably think that's what it

541
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,880
means to well I think some people might include like the intuition you decide when you're trying

542
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,520
to pick which apartment you've looked at a lot of apartments and you might buy them and everybody

543
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,920
is fighting over you know putting down down payment first you're integrating a lot of information

544
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,920
about the view and how close it is to the subway what are the schools like and so forth you don't

545
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,440
necessarily put it all in a spreadsheet I mean if you're neurotic like me maybe you do but you

546
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,400
don't have to you can do it off in a way that feels a little bit offline but is that not thinking

547
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,560
it's like what you do is that kind of synthesis is that thinking so it's localizing a sound in

548
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:46,080
this room thinking well I don't see why that follows there's actually this guy in the Netherlands

549
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:52,800
Dijkstra house who has done it's example I was alluding to it's I can go yeah who's done experimental

550
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:00,640
work with complicated consumer decisions it works much better if you don't work it out consciously

551
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,960
with simple consumer decisions it does work out better if you work it out consciously I don't know

552
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,200
why that is but one would think with the complicated consumer decisions like buying a house and so

553
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:21,600
forth and so on with that benefit of a spreadsheet then this is thinking and it doesn't seem to me

554
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:27,680
that when you speak of tuning of neurons that's really at all relevant and the reason that I don't

555
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:34,960
think it's at all relevant is we started out we all agreed that at least for the non-silicon cases

556
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:42,320
if you've got psychological goings on it's going to be brain function so you can tune up the brain

557
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,800
in one way or another and maybe it's thinking and maybe it isn't and you've got to have some other

558
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,960
way of deciding whether that particular tuning up of the brain is thinking when you wake up you

559
00:46:52,960 --> 00:47:02,080
find out well look I wasn't offering a proof as I said before I was offering a good reason to think

560
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,080
that if you're absolutely puzzled when you go to sleep by something and then you're very clear

561
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:14,720
headed and you see all the connections clearly when you wake up something in the meantime has

562
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,560
happened and I don't see why that isn't thinking but I think we're back to debating definition

563
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:26,320
rather than phenomena and I mean we can define thinking one way or another exactly

564
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:37,680
absolutely not neuroscience and it's a psychology psychoanalysis

565
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,080
sorry so you have a situation where somebody whenever they are

566
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:58,320
regretful or feel bad about something they have done or said that they then respond to that

567
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:06,640
by attacking the next person it's a common occurrence if you're looking at people's behavior

568
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:13,520
now they have no awareness that the reason why they are attacking this other person

569
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:23,280
has to do with whatever feeling so how would you in terms of you're talking about there's no

570
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:31,120
unconscious thinking how would you explain this right so first of all this is so far for my

571
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:41,520
purview that I doubt what is with rats it's no no no it's it's true that it is it is far from your

572
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:48,080
purview and it's not since what we are talking about is the biology of the mind and so what I'm

573
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:55,600
telling you is this is what I see as the mind and I'm asking you you tell me what is the biology

574
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:02,240
of this mind so as I said there's a fascinating and other people here know very interesting literature

575
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:09,200
and cognitive neuroscience showing surprisingly complex cognitive processing going on absolutely

576
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:15,040
absence of conscious awareness right in other words everyone wants to say that a certain

577
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,880
threshold of complexity of the cognitive process even if unconscious we're going to call it thinking

578
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,120
and I have no problem you can call it leading to behavior right yes I mean I have you know

579
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,840
cattleman from the from the behavioral economic side or whether it's all the work being done you

580
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:38,320
know by people like Tim Shales and Adrian Owen and all these people there's no question that

581
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:45,120
surprisingly public complex cognitive operations occur that have impact on behavior when people

582
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,720
are processing but when you ask them are they aware that they're doing so to the stimulus

583
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,840
they'll say no there won't be above chance so your example fits beautifully into these

584
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:59,760
vast range of phenomena where complex processing is going on and people don't realize they're

585
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:06,080
doing it so neuroscience is in complete agreement with the kind of thing that you just described

586
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,800
yours might be more subtle and more complicated and harder to do in a lab and more difficult to

587
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,000
control all the variables and to show systematic effects across many subjects so it might be difficult

588
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,560
to do classic cognitive science on your phenomenon so the real question but it can be done yeah the

589
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:28,080
real question is given how much can be done in that way that I would want to call unconscious

590
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:33,840
why we have a consciousness at all exactly right and so that's the question that I posed before

591
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:39,280
we got on to this terminological issue is if you had a motivational system and a selective

592
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,920
intentional system wouldn't that be enough why why do you need more well as I said the person

593
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,120
has written a whole book on this topic in Nicholas Humphrey and it's it's not my idea at all but

594
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:55,200
he's the most interesting so far in trying to answer exactly your excellent question which is

595
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:03,120
that consciousness really is a souped up qualitatively better way to do motivation and attention if you

596
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:08,960
want to be an organism in a common now look to me that almost seems like a category error if you

597
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,200
say that what you've got is motivation and attention and then there could be something else we'll

598
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,920
call that consciousness and it turns out that that consciousness is just better versions of the

599
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,680
first things that we don't actually need to evoke consciousness we just need to talk about how you

600
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,640
make a better selective attention system a better motivation system we don't need a third a lot of

601
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:33,520
empirical evidence that you get selective attention is really very fine grained which in the absence

602
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,160
of awareness there's just been a lot of work in the last time here yeah because another no problem

603
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:47,200
let me ask Matthew what you think of all this well I don't know so I don't actually I'm sort of more

604
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,840
you know also kind of sympathetic to zombie arguments I don't actually think that there's

605
00:51:53,840 --> 00:52:00,000
anything that I could conscious that I could explicitly choose to program into a system that

606
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:10,600
would make it conscious in the sense of having a kind of first-person life even if we like had a

607
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:17,680
whole brain situation understood it's not I'm not I'm not I'm not saying that I would deny that it

608
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:23,360
would happen I'm just saying I can't say that I don't think it's a functional thing so I don't

609
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:30,080
actually think that by programming some capacities rather than others I'd be able to titrate what was

610
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:39,520
what it was like to be a robot so the awareness that we have of ourselves is things like I think

611
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:46,800
I'm sitting I think I'm talking to some people about the biology of mind I think there are various

612
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:57,840
things like that so if you can figure out how to get a gadget a machine to have thoughts and then

613
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:03,360
you can figure out how to get the gadget to have thoughts with this content and that content and

614
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:10,240
so forth then you're home free and you can have a gadget that thinks I'm doing this I'm doing that

615
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,440
I have the experience of bread again like you have you have a system whose representations have

616
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:22,480
have that content yeah something else from saying that like it's like anything to be that system

617
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,760
right so what I want to know is what the other thing is it's as far as I'm concerned it's just

618
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:35,840
this is the universe that we live in well I would I would add ours it's like no no no but I want

619
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:41,360
you to articulate what being with shallmurs amounts okay so what's the difference between

620
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:46,960
so you've got these guys who think that there's this subjectivity and it's mysterious and it

621
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:55,520
defies you know scientific treatment and Nagel's argument is subjectivity is where we start and

622
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:01,680
objectivity is getting away from subjectivity so objectivity can't give an account of subjectivity

623
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:11,040
it seems to me this is all word mongering and unless one can say what it is that's missing well

624
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:18,720
so so what's what's the difference between all this non-aware sophisticated cognitive processing

625
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:26,240
and aware sophisticated so I was saying that what the difference was was that when you've got

626
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:33,680
conscious seeing as opposed to subliminal seeing then you have an additional awareness so if I

627
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:39,200
subliminally see the table and I have an awareness of the table let's not worry about what the content

628
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:45,760
is but I have there's the table I have an awareness of it's subliminal it's not conscious if the

629
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:52,560
awareness of the table is conscious if it's conscious awareness then I have another awareness

630
00:54:52,560 --> 00:55:00,960
of the first order awareness of the table so so so it's a popular robot that that can that can

631
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:06,400
enter into its memory banks you know the thought there is a table and the thought I just noticed

632
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,760
there was a table then is that that robot becomes well I thought we didn't know whether robots

633
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,960
were could be like us well but but suppose I just programmed a robot the way we know robots are now

634
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,920
where we know they're not like us and I programmed it to be able to say you know not only there's a

635
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,960
table but I just said there's a table I know there's a table so it's not conscious but just because

636
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,280
it has that in its memory right that's the soul sort of argument but I see you have to just look at

637
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:37,280
the world I mean let's take play I mean it's amazing how little neuroscience of play there's been okay

638
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:44,480
but playing people are beginning to look at it now not every animal plays so these animals that

639
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:54,080
have attention and motivation like a nute or a locust no one has seen play behavior right then

640
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:00,640
you get to crows and mammals and I'm not going to talk exactly whether you start to see this extra

641
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:08,480
behavior right and we call it play now all I'm saying is that there are these qualitatively

642
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:15,840
different extra behaviors that nervous system start to manifest that seem extraneous you know

643
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:23,040
and whether we want to go to the aesthetic to the planned to playful what some people are saying is

644
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:29,360
that those are the benefits that consciousness mechanisms might start to give you and now again

645
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:34,400
I'm in no position to say whether you can't play if not conscious or whether the beginnings of play

646
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:41,680
suggest a little bit of awareness of self and fun but the I think again quoting from Humphrey and

647
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:47,360
Dennett that the arguments for consciousness independent of the neural bases for it are going

648
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:53,920
to have to take this are we going to have a robot zombie writing a poem is it going to open the window

649
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,440
and go what a wonderful world it is today right now that's what I'm saying consciousness probably

650
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:06,000
you need to have it okay well so look not I would I would agree with you that there's evolutionary

651
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,920
reasons for this system which this part of the neural system that is the thing that enters our

652
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:18,560
awareness the only I I agree that it was selected for I agree that it has a function the only thing

653
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:23,360
I don't agree with is why I couldn't do exactly the same things without having any subjective

654
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:29,840
awareness of it because I'm saying it wouldn't lead to play forward planning well that's that's

655
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:34,720
the point it's not all the same your processing and behaviors happen why do you know what is

656
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,720
they they wouldn't be they wouldn't be triggered I mean that is a good question but I'm just saying

657
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:45,120
I believe purely intuitively that what I it's going to have to go in the direction that I'm

658
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:50,880
saying we're going to have to look at the phenomenology of conscious behavior to get clues as to what

659
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,840
it does extra rather than constantly falling back on these zombie arguments and I completely agree

660
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:03,600
with you they just they're negative pointing it to the limitation you know in other words a boy

661
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:12,240
it can a computer a robot do everything except be self-aware but you do everything

662
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,320
it could even be self-aware but it might not be aware that it's self-aware right now

663
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,960
it may not have any subjective experience

664
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:30,000
so I don't actually think I mean again I don't I don't think about consciousness that much because

665
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,240
like I said I don't think that there's any difference in from the point of view of the system

666
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,880
you know what's interesting from the point of view of

667
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:49,120
the programming as we're able to you know succeed in building more knowledge into systems in using

668
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:58,160
learning in new ways and in like having architectures that exhibit more flexible behavior is that we

669
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:06,080
understand more and more of the sophistication that goes into our unconscious processing in ways that

670
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:11,440
help us I think to reflect on the kind of engagement that we have with the world

671
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:21,040
and sort of why it is that mental explanations are such effective explanations of people

672
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:28,160
so one thing that's different between you know computer systems are very good at

673
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:36,000
solving classification problems so they'll be able to make a really good good prediction about

674
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,560
whether you're going to pay your credit card on time or whether you know whether you want to buy

675
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:51,520
a particular product based on your web surfing history but what they don't do is that they don't

676
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:58,480
kind of critique the representations that they have in the world so that they don't sort of use

677
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:08,960
their what they learn as sort of hypotheses going forward they don't have kind of they don't

678
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,760
pose questions to the world and they don't sort of have feedback and that sort of seems to be one

679
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:21,440
of the things that's really important when we attribute to each other beliefs about the world to say

680
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:28,880
like you know when I think that that's water on the table there that's making a complex set of

681
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,360
predictions about well I'm going to drink it if it doesn't taste good I'm going to try to figure

682
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:39,040
out what it is instead there's a kind of system-aticity to the way that our representations inform our

683
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:46,480
engagement with the world and that kind of functional structure allows us to appreciate why

684
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,400
it's so much easier to explain what somebody does in terms of what they believe

685
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:59,280
than to explain in terms of what's happening in their cortex or even to draw correlations

686
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,400
between what they've done before and what they're likely to do again.

687
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:13,520
Right now. I totally agree with your take on the difference between AI and human cognition.

688
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:21,040
I might say though that that's really about what intelligence is and we have a different kind

689
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,880
of intelligence than machines do of course different machines have different intelligence from one

690
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:31,280
another. I don't know that that's actually informative about what consciousness is so in one theory would

691
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,560
be in order to be conscious you have to have a certain kind of intelligence another theory would

692
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:42,560
be that our kind of intelligence is just one route to having consciousness and maybe machines could

693
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:48,480
have consciousness by taking a different route and again some of its different needs have

694
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,000
consciousness without having this. I mean I'm certainly willing to entertain that I'm not willing to

695
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,920
entertain that new to self-awareness I don't see any evidence of that but some level of awareness

696
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,480
that's prior to self-awareness I think it's probably do have.

697
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,000
Yeah the lobster that knows it's where its body ends and where the world begins.

698
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:15,680
So what's troubling for so might be troubling for some people is that iPhones have some sense

699
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,880
of awareness of where they are right they're GPS systems you know in fact where they are.

700
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,240
To me those kind of arguments are pseudo cleverness right they don't actually get to what we're

701
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,120
talking about I mean okay yes programmers made GPS systems in phones but if we're going to be

702
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:36,080
talking about evolution and how we go from certain forms of all awareness.

703
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,920
From you today is that it's a better motivational system and a better

704
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,720
I have I'm not somebody I can program an iPhone with a better awareness system and a better

705
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,400
motivational system. I'm not sure it's going to get me there I'm not sure it won't either but

706
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,720
iPhone having motivational awareness is just absurd.

707
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,000
Well certainly an iPhone has awareness.

708
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,960
iPhones have awareness they have accelerometers they have GPS systems they have microphones

709
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,640
they have information cameras they can sense things about the world they can sense a lot of

710
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:07,520
things about and and they can selectively filter it so they can focus right now on part of the

711
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,120
image rather than the whole image they can turn on one sensor rather than turn off.

712
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,600
They can turn on an iPhone where but you said a nuke wasn't and a reflex wasn't.

713
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:20,400
Why I said an iPhone you're giving iPhone awareness but you denied that

714
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,000
reflex is added. You denied that reflex is added.

715
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,640
Denied that reflex is had awareness. You said that at the very beginning.

716
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,560
I'm willing to exclude reflexes.

717
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,840
But not an iPhone.

718
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,840
iPhones I have not adjudicated one way or another.

719
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:45,440
I'm simply trying to pinpoint the distinction you're sort of rudely shaking your head but we're

720
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:52,880
trying to figure out where the distinction might go right so it doesn't seem to be at the level

721
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,920
of sensation it doesn't seem to be at the level of selective awareness unless we really have

722
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:04,240
two logical choices we're making some definitions here and one of our logical choices is to say

723
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,000
we're just going to attribute consciousness to iPhones. Most people in the room are comfortable

724
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,160
with that but some might we haven't really given a principled argument if we're going to go down

725
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:17,120
the line that says we're not going to attribute consciousness to iPhones then we can't do it because

726
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:22,640
iPhones lack sensation because they have them. We can't do it because they lack selective sensory

727
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:27,360
apparatus because they have them and even motivational system we could at least have an argument.

728
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:32,320
So if we want to say the iPhone doesn't have consciousness which I think is a respectable

729
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:37,680
position then we want to say why we are holding that position. I have not heard a good answer

730
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,880
to it yet today. Well I mean we're going back to the idea that I agree with you that reflexes

731
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:48,800
are based on simple after input output okay and that the arguments from evolutionally

732
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:54,320
standpoint are you start with sensation then you move to E-france copy and forward models

733
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:59,840
what does this mean by the way it's sort of internal representations of the external world that

734
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:06,240
simulate sensations and there's a lot of evidence for that that you can begin to predict the

735
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:11,120
sensory consequences of what you're going to do based on internal simulations without actually

736
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:16,800
having the sensations and so the argument might be that you go from sensations to these internal

737
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:23,520
simulations of sensations and then maybe that was piggyback to Pong for consciousness being

738
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:29,200
some extra feeling to this internal simulation of sensation and that one can construct that

739
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:35,760
kind of argument. Now that use of circuitry to go along that spectrum is a completely different

740
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,800
universe to talking about the fact that an iPhone could be programmed to have a GPS or an accelerometer

741
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,840
which you know of course but there's no way that the iPhone is now going to say thank you for giving

742
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:51,440
me a sensory system I'm now going to evolve to have internal copies and then I'm going to evolve

743
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,160
evolve to being conscious if it's true that an iPhone could evolve right in front of us in its

744
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:01,040
little lifetime and that's news to me. It seems to me that everything rests on the part that you

745
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:06,800
called the extra. So in terms of having internal models again computers have lots of internal

746
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:13,760
models there's a lot of it's worth noting that most voice interfaces only work because the system

747
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:20,720
is able to subtract its own expected sound from its input to detect what you're saying.

748
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:27,600
Right so so I'm saying that we understand from engineering computing the benefit of Ford models

749
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:34,880
and we've made them in nervous system and it's an interesting phenomenon and could one go with that

750
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:40,240
if we believe in evolution or I'm saying. Now a computer you give an internal model it's not going

751
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:46,080
to evolve right. Well that's not true either I mean you can you can make computers that have

752
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,240
evolved evolution systems there's some very nice work for example by Kenneth Stanley where

753
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:56,240
there's evolution over time the internal models of those computer systems evolve over time they get

754
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:02,400
better at learning all kinds of things so maybe they're limited still in the ways to maybe point

755
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,760
out but but they are I mean there it seems to me like just a technological question so there's

756
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:12,400
there's a whole field of genetic programming of evolutionary programming and it's made some

757
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,960
progress it hasn't made as much progress as I would like I mean I don't think that the systems are

758
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,520
that sophisticated but they're capable of learning some kind of new representation of building some

759
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,640
kind of new model and it seems like you know 25 years or 50 years that that field will be further

760
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:31,280
along like most fields my intuition is that still won't give us that something extra if there is

761
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,000
something extra but part of my intuition is maybe we are it's a it's a red herring looking for this

762
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,920
something extra well that I think I think we're not talking about the phenomenon is real the question

763
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,400
is whether the that's for nation for the phenomenon has to be qualitatively different I think I

764
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:51,680
did you all agree that quanera real the first person perspective is real that they are then I

765
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:56,320
would say we haven't today certainly offered any understanding of even how you would figure out

766
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:05,360
what that I think is a pseudo question okay question from the audience stand up and microphone please

767
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,320
it seems to me that one really simple epistemic can you go slightly closer to the mic or one is

768
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:22,000
very simple delineation that can be made perhaps is that consciousness can't be a discrete unit

769
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:30,000
it seems to me the consciousness how long phrase this consciousness is something that is shared

770
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,160
among us we all laugh at the same time I sort of share a consciousness with my pets they share some

771
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:41,360
of mine I know this is a little silly to to phrase it so simplistically but um

772
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:50,160
um a phenomenon like quorum sensing or the to describe an organization like the United

773
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:57,120
States of America we could describe this we could use the same descriptions of consciousness

774
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:01,680
to describe groups it seems to me that the descriptions break down when you try to

775
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:07,680
identify one discrete unit of consciousness I think the one place where neuroscience has

776
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:14,640
actually made some progress is on replacing this idea of pure localization one spot in the brain

777
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:19,280
that does this with the notion that there are networks and circuits and I think once you have

778
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:23,680
that realization that there are networks and circuits then at least a little bit of what you're

779
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:29,360
asking about gets gets a little bit easier so if you understand that what any computation

780
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:33,040
whether we're talking about language or walking or whether we're talking about consciousness

781
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:37,360
is a network and that these different networks overlap with one another then you're not quite

782
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:42,480
stuck I think in the puzzle of saying well it's it's not a discrete thing well most

783
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:47,280
most cognitive capacities aren't really discrete things there there are constellations of neural

784
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:51,680
processes that are in flux they may vary from one moment to the next even in one particular

785
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:56,160
individual and certainly across individuals and I think we're starting to have some understanding

786
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:59,520
of the network dynamics of the brain because they're not even figured it all out but I think

787
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:06,720
that's a place to make progress on that question. I'm Chris Kenzel I'm a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst

788
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:14,720
and I like to offer a new paradigm of just take me a minute. Ten years I'm sitting behind the couch

789
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:25,280
patients over over that time I have the distinct impression that the mind is consciousness and

790
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:33,120
unconsciousness. Don't ask me all the details of how I got there but that in fact is what the mind is

791
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:44,560
so what's the so the next question is well what is it it's it has to be a form of matter

792
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:52,400
but it does it's not like any other form of matter you can't see it you can't measure it you can't

793
01:10:52,400 --> 01:11:01,520
weigh it you can't what is it is it up is it an abstraction then of matter is it a special form

794
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:10,240
of matter so I came across in Scientific American the notion that all matter is waves

795
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:19,200
I began to think well maybe consciousness and unconsciousness are indeed matter ways themselves

796
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,320
that is maybe the reason we can't break them down or get their components and so on is because

797
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:33,280
they're primary fundamental matter ways just like energy and time and substance so on that

798
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:44,560
they're fundamental matter ways I don't know if I can get the the theory of the hypothesis is that

799
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:52,240
at a certain point in the evolution of the universe that consciousness and unconsciousness matter

800
01:11:52,240 --> 01:12:02,400
waves emerged that they then made life think about the cell without a survival drive and without a

801
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:10,640
survival implementation implementation how could a cell possibly survive without drive and without

802
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:18,400
a means to do it a procedure so unconsciousness became the drive the survival drive consciousness

803
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:24,640
became the procedure you have survival drive survival procedure you have adaptive drive

804
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:34,400
and animals adaptive procedure and you have a whole person evolution thing in human in human beings

805
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:41,360
so there's two parts in what you're saying one is is that drives are really important and I think

806
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:47,280
there's room to argue about what counts as a drive whether whether you find a drive in a single cell

807
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,040
and that's a definitional thing and we could talk about that on the other part of what you're saying

808
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:58,320
I would say that the waves aren't going to help us here but what we're looking for is an

809
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:03,200
organization of matter that's what's proven to be helpful in understanding life itself so people

810
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:08,000
were looking for this vitalist force which they never really found what we found instead was that

811
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,600
the right way to understand life is in terms of particular arrangements of matter that have

812
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,480
particular properties such that they reproduce such that they have metabolism and so forth

813
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:24,160
and that's how we understand life now is if you have the right arrangement of matter that gives

814
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:28,240
you those properties what I would say in consciousness is whatever the answer is it's going to start

815
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,920
with information processing that you're going to have arrangements of matter that allow you to

816
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,400
do information processing there may be some other requirement but I would say that's a beginning

817
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:42,160
necessary requirement that probably nobody here would disagree with can you will go and say something

818
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,720
yeah I mean I agree with that I just the a couple of things one is that the

819
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:55,200
the connection between you know the fact that matter is wave which is basically quantum mechanics

820
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:02,080
and and the mind or consciousness is that they're both not they're both mysterious

821
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:08,160
and and therefore there's a tendency to say this this is mysterious and that is mysterious so

822
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:14,320
this must explain that and they have nothing to do with each other exactly totally agree yeah and

823
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:20,720
the we know quantum mechanics is mysterious in certain special ways which typically go under the

824
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:24,240
name of entanglement when these special things happen it's very foreign to our experience and

825
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:30,240
it makes it mysterious it's it's very clear that there's entanglement is not playing a role in the

826
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:34,560
brain the brain is operating out of temperature under conditions where this is just not playing

827
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:40,240
any role so it's just it's just divorced what what is the other thing that I want to say is just

828
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:47,280
I mean we we all agreed on this issue and so therefore we didn't discuss it which is that

829
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:52,720
you know consciousness is and mind are just are just manifestations of the brain but

830
01:14:52,720 --> 01:15:00,480
just to give an experience just to make I mean we live with this weird internal awareness which

831
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:05,600
is our mind and it's seen so mysterious like it must you know be connected to the cosmos or the

832
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:13,120
universe or something but when you start doing when you do surgery on on animals or on people

833
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:19,520
you know everyone has got a piece of meat called the heart and that pumps their blood

834
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,960
and everyone has got a piece of meat called you know a kidney and that filters their blood

835
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:33,600
and everyone inside their skull has got this brain thing and it's it more fat excuse me more

836
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:40,400
fat than meat yeah but it's me it's a piece of meat that evolved biologically to do a function

837
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,200
and it's no more mysterious or dependent on quantum mechanics than the kidney or the heart

838
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,960
I agree I agree okay next question please

839
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:56,000
first I want to say there are a few iPhones in here that don't seem to have intelligence

840
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:05,280
they just want a 10-cent second I have two I have two short questions that are sort of contradictory

841
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:12,400
one is we don't know what strength is in particular we know that it's an emergent

842
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:21,200
quality of certain objects so why can't consciousness be considered an emergent quality of the brain

843
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,800
and then the second question maybe I'll just let it go with it actually

844
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,160
I'll start on that one and other people can disagree if the analogy I was just making with life is

845
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,920
right well life is an emergent property but there are different kinds of emergent properties so

846
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,880
life is a kind of emergent property that we can well understand why the functions of particular

847
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:48,400
molecules lead to the configurations that give you the reproduction the metabolism and so forth so

848
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:55,120
life is different from the constituent molecules but it emerges in a lawful and predictable kind of

849
01:16:55,120 --> 01:17:00,560
way so that's one kind of emergence it's conceivable that there's another kind of emergence that is not

850
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:06,720
sort of doesn't follow in the same reductionist or inverse reductionist fashion so I would argue

851
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:12,880
that if you understand the right information processing properties that that then consciousness

852
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:18,640
emerges I mean we I don't think we have a proof of that but at least with the rest of of mental

853
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:23,360
function that seems to me to be the right way to go as we say these mental functions emerge

854
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:28,320
if you have the right configurations of matter and I would just say I mean yes it is an emergent

855
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:35,200
property of the brain but it's not as sort of nonspecific as that I mean the brain has a lot

856
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:39,760
of detailed structure and different pieces of that structure are involved in different kinds

857
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:46,480
of cognitive processes and there are some detailed set of structures that we don't understand that

858
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:51,600
you know and or some some cons or some constellations of activity in all these detailed structures

859
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,520
that emerges consciousness but it's not just kind of you know a soup out of which continents

860
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:00,080
emerges it's a very specific thing that's involved it's not magic it's emergence from high degree of

861
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:07,520
structure yeah very briefly at what point would you all be willing to seed to an either an alien or

862
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:17,520
a robot the property of consciousness very good I have a hard enough time with other human beings

863
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:23,440
I don't think there's an easy answer to that because there are different ways that we

864
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:32,160
try to answer that question one is the thing that Kim said earlier there's a kind of an analogy

865
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:38,960
right we all look roughly alike and we seem to function in similar ways and so forth and so on

866
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:47,600
we can exchange things by way of language in non-linguistic ways so I assume that you're

867
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:56,080
kind of like me and you assume I'm kind of like you that's one thing but we know well we think we know

868
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:05,120
I guess the first point of contention was I said fish and all I said was I didn't know much about

869
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:09,680
fish and everybody jumped and they weren't mental they didn't have I said I didn't know

870
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:19,760
but everybody jumped on me but you know one thing about fishes I don't feel like a fish is very

871
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:26,720
much like me just looking at it off hand so when you look at its genome and its brain organization

872
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:33,120
that that's very different so the question is how do you do it right and what I'm saying is

873
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:38,080
we have different ways of doing it and one answer isn't going to fit all cases

874
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:46,720
I would say that you know I don't work in consciousness you know but people who do in neuroscience

875
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:52,960
and people who do in philosophy do come up with criteria behavioral criteria and we've

876
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,840
ultimately if we believe what we all do which if it's have a physical basis there will be neural

877
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:04,160
criteria which an alien would potentially then be able to say these conditions are necessary

878
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:09,600
insufficient to produce the behavioral phenomenon of consciousness so even though I'm not somebody

879
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:16,320
who's writing down the behavioral and neural requirements people to have it's not totally

880
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,920
impossible to do so I think we could do it but if you took Matthew's point from the very

881
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:28,240
beginning seriously and at least allowed the in principle possibility that machines could have

882
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:32,960
consciousness and you won't come up with necessary and sufficient neural conditions you might come

883
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:39,920
up with necessary sufficient computational I mean processes I mean component processes components

884
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:45,120
and processes I'm a functionalist I'm not an internal here I think David Mars levels in terms

885
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:49,440
of describing things in terms of algorithms and implementation we might be looking for

886
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,600
something that's algorithmic I'm not sure we can find it at all but if we can I would think it would

887
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:58,640
be I'm just saying that you got to figure out what the machinery is doing not what the machinery is

888
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:06,640
actually far as I'm a hootian neuro-conversity liberal liberal studies philosophy background so

889
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:11,200
this is going to be a little bit philosophy going on really enjoyed everything the contention was

890
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:18,240
great kind of heated up their own so these would be that first comment that might be helpful is

891
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,920
Immanuel Kant made a distinction regarding what science is because part of the discussion was

892
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:29,520
what science was that was maybe implied constitutive versus regulative principles

893
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,920
regulative principles helps sort of guide where science is going what's worth doing etc

894
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,640
constitutive principles are which atom which molecule under what conditions will do what for you

895
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:45,280
and it seemed like the something extra the magic that was banished immediately from the room which

896
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:51,840
is still here I think has to do with regular to print principles because the regulative principles

897
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:57,600
for Kant you can never get these you can't find them under microscope and yet you should try to

898
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,320
find them anyway for instance the beginning of time that kind of thing is the example he uses

899
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:08,240
so I think part of the discussion goes to that consciousness as a regulative principle helps to

900
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:13,520
guide the research whether it's functional research or other kinds of research about neurons and

901
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:22,000
connect homes and so forth because it's kind of why we're doing this on the other hand another

902
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,760
question that I have I guess at first a comment on the emergence thing if you do have all the

903
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:34,560
conditions I don't think it's predictable as Professor Marcus said you have conditions that

904
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,400
would give rise to life but you can't predict what kind of life it's going to be otherwise we could

905
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:44,080
predict evolution which we can't I think no one's going to say that the entire scenario was predictable

906
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:53,920
given the right to no one so with that I will then ask you a real question and the question is

907
01:22:53,920 --> 01:23:00,240
basically we have the motivational thing the kind of constituency we're saying if we had these on

908
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:06,480
the iPhone would be conscious perhaps there's one thing missing that would be helpful I get this

909
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:14,400
from Whitehead it's the self intensification of experience something that has experience

910
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:20,080
will try to intensify its experience and it's that in that that Whitehead finds consciousness and life

911
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:27,920
and it finds it in the respect that it diverts from or diverges from routine it diverges from

912
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:35,360
reflex every time it does that things get intense if experience craves intensity then experience would

913
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:41,600
logically do that at some point and improve itself thereby so it kind of fits part of what you're

914
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:48,000
saying but I was wondering if there's any correlate to the effort to intensify one's experience at

915
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:57,680
whether one is a fish or a sea elegance or human I could take the first part of that there's something

916
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:02,480
that didn't come up today but always comes up and it should come up which is there are kind of a

917
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:08,160
few logical possibilities here one is the consciousness is like life that it's an emerging property if

918
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:12,480
we have the right definitions we understand the right molecular processes we can understand it

919
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:18,880
another possibility is that we can never understand it that we're not smart enough and that the

920
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,120
tools that we have won't get us there Colin McGinn has made this argument I've never been impressed

921
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:27,600
by it but it's it's out there it's a logical possibility and the third possibility is that

922
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,400
we're trying to find the answer to a question that is a non-problem that it doesn't really have an

923
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,480
answer so sometimes historically scientists have looked for things that don't exist and they were

924
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,800
just asking the wrong question I would say that today we have made no progress towards giving an

925
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,760
answer to what consciousness is because what I would count as an answer would be if we say what

926
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:49,920
that something extra is so that I can then go out and figure out whether I can program it into my

927
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,400
phone or not and until I have an answer about what it is such that I can decide whether it's

928
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:58,400
programable or not we haven't made progress so that just leaves those other two either we're too

929
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:06,960
stupid or it's not a good question in terms of the intensification I I can always tell you my

930
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:12,800
reaction to it is is that it we're taking ourselves as humans and our experience a little bit too

931
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:20,240
seriously as the explanation of of all of you know mental functioning or consciousness or awareness

932
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:28,320
that you know that that I don't have to just add a fly in the end it's an empirical question you

933
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:33,360
know we're gonna have to look the only creatures that we can be sure you know are fairly sure

934
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:38,160
our conscious are creatures that can report it to us which right now is just humans and you know

935
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:42,320
eventually maybe we'll be able to say in humans what neural processes lead to consciousness and

936
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:46,080
then maybe we'll be able to look for analogs that in animals and try to cross including

937
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:51,760
the imperative we don't know what it is and and I I guess the point is we're not going to get there

938
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:58,000
any more than we could understand quantum mechanics just by thinking about experience we're not

939
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,640
going to understand how the brain works just by thinking about experience it's it's going to be

940
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:07,840
a deeply empirical question and the answers are going to be you know completely surprising and

941
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:12,000
not at all what we imagined well that's something else we didn't really talk about today much is

942
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,440
what kinds of neural tools for example might help us so there's a lot of things on the table with

943
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:21,760
the brain initiative people are trying to figure out better ways of imaging circuits of neurons

944
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:26,560
rather than just individual neurons or large clusters of neurons I don't personally see how

945
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,880
that's going to lead us to an answer to consciousness but it's a it's a very interesting question is

946
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:36,000
there some circuit level property that if we understood that we would be in a better position

947
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,560
to understand consciousness or can we even be more articulate than that and say this is the kind

948
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:45,520
of circuit level property so there's been some efforts to look at the circuits that control the

949
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:51,520
flow of information on the notion that part of what consciousness is about is what I was calling

950
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:55,280
selective attention so there are many things you could attend to at any moment but you select

951
01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:00,320
from those possibilities and I think we're on a good track to understand that at the neural level

952
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:04,800
but if consciousness is this extra thing that goes beyond selective attention then it's not

953
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:09,280
it's not so clear that getting more information about how the circuitry works is really going

954
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:14,240
to answer the question I would say I would say we're five or ten levels away of understanding

955
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:19,200
away from being able to talk maybe 50 or 100 from being able to talk about that I mean at

956
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:25,760
right now we just we need to understand how the pieces of the brain work to do small bits of

957
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,040
computation which is what we're going to understand from these studies looking at many more neurons

958
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:34,160
at once and then we're going to have to build up multiple levels of understanding of the brain

959
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:38,320
before we can never really get to this place we all want to get to now because it's what interests

960
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:43,760
us so much which is to say you know well what is it about neural processing that is a recent

961
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:48,480
conscious that's that's it isn't to say that by adding lots of neurons now we're going to solve

962
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:52,240
that by adding lots of neurons now we're going to help build the next level to the next level of the

963
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:55,520
next level and I don't know how many levels that before we finally get asking those questions

964
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:09,040
I think we need to go to the next question otherwise people there's quite a few people waiting so let's

965
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:13,920
we've reached two hours so we're out of time technically no we started at two-thirds it's not

966
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:22,880
four o'clock yet so go ahead hi there my name is Joe Russo I'm a web developer and just yeah we're

967
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,360
at the one and a half curious person what we're at the 90 minute mark we were just given incorrect

968
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:35,440
information very good I was wondering your thoughts on when there are people having near

969
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:40,160
death experiences and there are basically a lot of things shut down in their body and then they

970
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:44,880
they come and they're brought back some some who happen to be brought back claim to have

971
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:52,400
experiences of of certain kinds of things and it makes me wonder if perhaps the the biological

972
01:28:54,240 --> 01:29:00,160
armor that we're sort of equipped with now is just simply one potential place where

973
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:07,760
the experience of consciousness and interaction and all that other individuality and all that

974
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:14,000
stuff occurs but it isn't necessarily recorded what are your thoughts on that the movie flatliners

975
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,880
talks about that a little bit too it's great so I didn't understand the question the question is

976
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:25,520
that we don't just say it again I was wondering your thoughts on the idea of them maybe consciousness

977
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:35,040
doesn't even require a body per se it may be something that actually can can have a persistence

978
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:41,680
without having biological home to live in one thing that comes to mind is like you know ducks

979
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:45,520
flying and they're kind of communicating and they have this real this really elegant harmonious

980
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:50,240
kind of interaction that goes on and granted yes they have little duck brains that hold their

981
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:55,760
little thoughts and everything but there is also this interaction that seems to happen between them

982
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:00,400
in the air and makes me think that this idea of consciousness of thinking of self-awareness

983
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:04,480
all these things that many of the things that we've been talking about you've been talking about today

984
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:13,040
may be piggybacking as it were off of biology but not even necessarily be necessary so there is hope

985
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:18,400
for the iPhone still well I think all of us would categorically reject that but we could we could

986
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:25,040
talk about why as well I mean there is some some interesting work about modules in the brain you

987
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:30,400
know stonice love to hane for example has this blackboard view that it's sort of like a working

988
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:38,640
memory buffer analog and sort of like your ducks that certain basic modules like s1 m1 v1

989
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:45,280
aren't conscious but there's a place where you can put their information into a buffer and this

990
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:51,920
buffer has the property of consciousness so we wouldn't be totally rejecting if we were to say

991
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:57,440
that maybe these network models that suggest that there's a way of bringing modules online

992
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:02,960
and this is the one theoretical model this blackboard model that's quite interesting with some

993
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:09,280
empirical data with it but not embodiment which if I think what you were getting at I don't think

994
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:15,200
we we've got I mean the idea that you can just leave the brain and the body behind I mean it's

995
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:23,440
about it's about what it feels like to us it feels like our our mind is disembodied it feels like

996
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:29,520
our mind floats free of any material substrate we would all agree that's a new one but yeah I mean

997
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:35,360
the fact is you know any any piece of your mind can be destroyed by destroying some

998
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:40,320
appropriate piece of your brain your mind can be split up in so many completely non-intuitive

999
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:46,240
surprising ways by losing bits and pieces of your brain yes you know and don't depress us

1000
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:54,000
do they don't depress us and all of us up here are physicalists so we're we're arguing a little bit

1001
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,320
about whether iPhones might possibly be conscious we don't really have the definitions and so forth

1002
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:03,200
but all of us think that whatever consciousness is as a physical basis so we all agree that as a

1003
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:08,720
biological basis in us a physical biological basis in us and we hold open the question

1004
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:13,520
depending on how you define things for whether it might have a different kind of physical basis in

1005
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,040
some other kind of creature as Matthew pointed out in the beginning but we all think that has a

1006
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:21,520
physical basis I'll say one sentence about near-death experiences the only sentence I'm going to say

1007
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,840
which is there's some very interesting work by Philip Lieberman who's a linguist and a mountain

1008
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:31,920
climber about what happens when you lack oxygen and your your brain gets distorted not surprisingly

1009
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:36,240
near-death experiences fall from my mind in the same category what happens when you don't have

1010
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:40,720
enough oxygen doesn't tell us anything about consciousness and I can I just say that the brain

1011
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:47,280
look everything you're seeing and experiencing now it's not like a camera opening its lens it's a

1012
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:52,720
computation your brain is computing this whole scene from the sensory information it's receiving

1013
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:58,800
brains sometimes compute hallucinations sometimes compute distortion they compute you can experience

1014
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,800
all kinds of things it doesn't mean they're out there it means that's what your brain is doing right

1015
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:09,120
now okay there's an additional thing that should we throw in I think all of us are physicalists not

1016
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:14,720
only with respect in mind and consciousness but with respect everything that is everything has a

1017
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:21,920
physical basis yeah I wanted to say I'm as interesting and make one comment and then

1018
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:27,040
quit comments and then ask the question the quick comment is just my opinion the early on

1019
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:33,440
the issue of definitions came up and I for one think that it is not just important to define

1020
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:40,640
things clearly that it's essential to define them precisely and because if you don't as many

1021
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:46,080
scientists agree and it seems would seem to be logically obvious if you don't define your terms

1022
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:52,480
you do not know what you are talking about so that's the point I wanted to make

1023
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:59,120
then the question I have has to do with all the talk about the rights room let's say I have a

1024
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:07,360
million questions on the subject but derives from the issue of motivation there are certain

1025
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:12,960
presumptions and assumptions that underlie that if you're talking about motivation as how it

1026
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:17,680
affects the brain and its development of consciousness well let me just step back one second I won't

1027
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:24,000
take it on the issue of definitions I think the example of it is how we in the discussion today

1028
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:30,880
there was a great deal of confusion and imprecision in the terms consciousness awareness thinking

1029
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:38,320
and so on there was talk about senses I didn't hear anyone say anything about conceptual

1030
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:42,320
consciousness which I think is specifically what was referred to by consciousness sometimes

1031
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:46,560
other times it was used in a general way then it went this is whisked like all kinds of

1032
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:56,560
confusion you know this perceptual consciousness sensual consciousness there's all kinds there's all

1033
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:56,960
you're sent an awareness let's say and thinking and the difference between that and thinking what is

1034
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:02,400
thinking I didn't hear a definition of thinking so and it's a simple thing to do I would say but

1035
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:07,440
let's back it into that now because it will become a more story my question is this on the motivation

1036
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:12,320
if you're going to get into motivation you have to get into free will because something has to cause

1037
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:18,800
it and what I'm thinking of I know that logically or philosophically to take the position of determinism

1038
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:25,280
is self-contradiction but when you think about what happens when you make a choice when a consciousness

1039
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:31,440
makes a choice that requires action and sends a message to pick up the glass of water or whatever

1040
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:37,200
it was then there's a change of state somewhere in the brain and you get an infinite regress if you

1041
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:42,480
try to explain it because according to the laws of physics physical you're all physical guides here

1042
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:50,080
the laws governing motion are pretty well determined for everything you have electrons you have molecules

1043
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:58,800
and so on and then you make the decision to do something the instant before that in order to send

1044
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:08,080
that message down a neuron something physical has to initiate it and I think that's where the real

1045
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:15,600
real serious mystery lies because what is what is the cause of that change when you make a decision

1046
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:20,800
how can you translate your decision into motion if you say well because this atom moved over this

1047
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:26,080
electron moved over there well how did it move what's physically what moved in and then you give

1048
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:30,960
that answer you say well oh okay because the electric potential change well then what changed

1049
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:36,000
it well because this or then what changed it and you get into an infinite regress and it seems

1050
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,640
incapable of solution that's the mystery to me and that's what I want to ask you if you have

1051
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:50,080
any comments so I don't accept the infinite regress argument I think people are actually

1052
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:55,280
making progress on cases like that so first of all I do accept your criticism that our definitions

1053
01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:00,480
are really shoddy and I think our definitions are really shoddy because for the most part the things

1054
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:06,080
we're talking about don't have facts of the matter in the world so my example on this point was about

1055
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:10,880
whether airplanes fly there is no fact in the matter world about whether airplanes fly it's

1056
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:16,240
definitional you can choose to make that definition with respect to some other problem but there is

1057
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:20,000
no fact in the matter in the world and so it's hard to make those definitions I'm not going to let

1058
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,200
you take another question because there are other people waiting on the infinite regress part however

1059
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:29,600
what I will say is that people like 10 people who do molecular computational neuroscience

1060
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:34,400
so that people working in those two domains have made some real progress at looking at things

1061
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:40,480
like signal transduction where they look at the individual molecules that are just involved in

1062
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:46,800
very very low to sit low level decision making where we have a little bit of a cognition on one side

1063
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:51,520
and we have molecular events that we can actually identify and manipulate and so forth so I think

1064
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,040
there's real progress there I don't know that we've made any progress at all in understanding

1065
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:59,920
consciousness but in decision making we really have I really can't we really

1066
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,600
just another question just really give me a answer my question because my question is

1067
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:11,440
where does the free will or the conscious consciousness where is the point at which it enters that first

1068
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:15,600
pause that makes the physical thing process I think it's a mistake to think of keep it

1069
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:23,840
a finite physical process where is the entry point of your free will okay Matthew so so I tend to think

1070
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:32,000
of identity as a content so to say to say that I did something is to say that that action is

1071
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,600
responsible to my values and my beliefs at a point in time that is to say that I can take ownership

1072
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:43,600
of the action is expressing who I am well but what I think is that who I am the values and beliefs

1073
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:52,080
are represented their physical patterns of activation and so to say at what point does the physical

1074
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:58,880
pattern of activation well actually there we know how to implement inferences and and to like

1075
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:05,040
translate from you know statements of values and statements of beliefs to inferences that say

1076
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:10,320
certain actions are the best actions that respond to those things and it's it's completely mechanical

1077
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:20,000
the mistake is to think that the your identity the meaningful what's meaningful about who you are

1078
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:26,160
is separate from the physical instantiation that's making it all possible it's a way of looking at

1079
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:34,080
the physical instantiation that's making it all possible and so that's why you can make decisions

1080
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:40,000
because your brain makes you and it makes the decisions and it makes them match two two two

1081
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,040
answers your point about definitions and I absolutely agree the kind of science that I do

1082
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:51,200
and it kind of operational definition to essential on the other hand when we have quite

1083
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:57,440
nebulous things like thinking and consciousness operational definitions are possible and I agree

1084
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:02,000
with you but they're going to be fuzzy just like there's going to be a discussion potentially about

1085
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,960
art here one day no one's going to come up with the fundamental definition of art it doesn't mean

1086
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:12,800
you kind of interesting conversations about it beauty is another term so I would say that we are at

1087
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:18,080
the intersection between philosophy and science where strict operational definitions are not

1088
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:22,800
available yet but I agree with you and the second point about the the start point I think you're

1089
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:29,120
right that to talk about where did it start an infinite regress is to say that we have a t zero

1090
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:35,920
but we don't really have a t zero right in other words I'm in this room right now I'm biased towards

1091
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,080
being in this room there's a cup in front of me so there's a little bit of a biasing towards my

1092
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:45,200
language reach back up I'm in a context where I met at some point reach fit although now it's empty

1093
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:54,720
but um do I know exactly why I chose at this time point to go for it versus plus or minus five

1094
01:40:54,720 --> 01:41:02,080
seconds on either side no okay but I definitely know that I'm in the context biasing me towards

1095
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:08,560
certain behaviors so there's no real t zero you see that's the mistake I think is that we're

1096
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:15,200
in this ever lengthening context with many different shells of time to it which all bias you towards

1097
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:22,960
certain behaviors because you're in it and so no I know and that might see a little bit indeterminate

1098
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:28,960
but being in a room in front of a cup was something that I decided to do so in other words I think

1099
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:36,560
that by t zeroing it the way you are it causes a slightly false infinite regress thank you okay

1100
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:40,400
next you can always approach the participants' labels

1101
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:48,960
so just a couple quick observations leading to the question about the the role that hasn't really

1102
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:56,080
been addressed of ecological context in which brains operate number one and the role in

1103
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:02,320
computational neurobiology of local minimum and maxima so in terms of ducks for example and fish

1104
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:09,440
birds flocking behavior we actually do know it's not ephemeral that it is the relationship of keeping

1105
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:15,840
the fish or bird next to you in front of you at a certain average distance at all times so it's

1106
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:21,760
simple but it is a social ecological context in which neural processing is occurring so that's my

1107
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:26,000
entry point to this I wanted to follow up on the first question about quorum sensing because I

1108
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:31,760
think the response took it wrongly I think it was more about again the social context not about one

1109
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:38,480
portion of a brain but one brain in an ecological context of other brains quorum sensing is ubiquitous

1110
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:46,480
it occurs in bacteria we can simulate it very nicely so I'm asking the question if consciousness

1111
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:53,680
is an emergent phenomena that is somewhat proportional to the degree of neuro complexity in a social

1112
01:42:53,680 --> 01:43:04,160
species cats have a neuro cortex but it's smooth but the neocortices of more highly insephalized

1113
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:10,480
complex and sephalization in social mammals they tend to we tend to look at them and see more of

1114
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:17,040
our behavior and sensitivity elephants are looked at as quite emotionally sensitive for example

1115
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:22,400
we are very similar the question is not whether we are similar to champion

1116
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:28,400
champions champions ease for example a lot of behaviors they do everything from deception

1117
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:35,520
to certain social aggressions and the rest of it so my question is how would you address the again

1118
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:41,680
the ecological context of neurobiology and how that interaction might affect the local minimum

1119
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:53,280
maxima that can lead to a decision point that's it I mean I don't think any of us would challenge

1120
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:58,640
the notion that the social component is important there's a interesting new book which I have not

1121
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:03,200
finished yet by Michael Graziano that tries to give an account of consciousness evolutionarily

1122
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:08,880
in terms of social function you know whether you buy that argument partly depends on how you

1123
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:12,720
ground the definitions of consciousness in the first place so if you accepted my example of

1124
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:18,560
the worm you'd say well the worms got some modicum of awareness but it's not social or maybe it is

1125
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:23,200
socially you could probably argue that part too so me again there's a there's a grounding issue but

1126
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:27,600
I think Graziano has has some interesting arguments there and I don't think any one of us would want

1127
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:33,120
to deny that the social component is really important certainly to our subjective experience of the

1128
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:38,160
world I think we might make the argument that in order to understand that ultimately we need to

1129
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:43,200
catch that out in terms of my brain internal experiences how they cope with the information

1130
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:47,920
that comes from the outside world we don't want to say that you know information from the ecological

1131
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:52,000
and environment or the social environment isn't really crucial to the kind of experience that we

1132
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:57,440
have some of what we were trying to grapple with here is why does the experience have that we have

1133
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:02,720
have the flavor that it does so why does pain seal the way that it does and presumably social

1134
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:06,400
things should enter into an answer for that we just haven't figured out what would count as an

1135
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:09,200
answer but when we get there that should be part of it I just want to say that I'm saying

1136
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:13,680
that's the inverse I'm very concerned but I want to make sure the question is taken properly

1137
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:19,600
in my view it's not that we're coping with the social ecological context of others in our species

1138
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:28,960
it's that we need that my my small hypothesis is that consciousness emerges in our species because

1139
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:35,200
we even have the facial frequencies of one gyrus which is about to focus precisely on details in

1140
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:42,000
the facial facial musculature and motion of others in our species so that's my question

1141
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:48,800
the only look I can't say much about the social except obviously we're very social creatures and

1142
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:55,440
that was involved in our brains evolving but I just want to caution against taking familiar

1143
01:45:55,440 --> 01:46:00,400
familiarity as humans with something essential about consciousness or about minds or about

1144
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:06,320
intelligence I mean the creatures whose behavior seems most familiar to us by and large are the

1145
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:11,440
creatures that were more closely related to and and so you know we have more mental structures

1146
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:16,400
in common with them but it doesn't mean that you know some very distant creatures I mean certainly

1147
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:21,520
crows and parrots and ravens are pretty distant but they're they independently evolved you know

1148
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:26,880
quite a quite a high intelligence but they don't write symposia well neither the dogs are cats or

1149
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:33,280
I just have one point tangential point about your question about the

1150
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:39,840
flocks of birds with these complex structures that's a great analogy and then you said

1151
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:44,640
correctly that the rule that leads to this so-called complex structure is actually quite

1152
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:48,720
simple it's about keeping an average so in other words there are many there are many examples of

1153
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:53,680
this where the phenomenon looks incredibly complex but the rule that leads to this so-called

1154
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:57,920
complexity from our viewpoint is unbelievably simple I'll give you another example a colleague

1155
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:05,200
of mine in california modeled little mice pups that you could film from above and these little

1156
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:10,960
mice pups when they're put in a box make quite complex pinwheel shapes okay and it looks quite

1157
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:17,760
complex and so he said he was going to make some robotic rap pups and he was going to then do

1158
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:22,400
you have to do a sort of like rat touring test you'd watch the film of the digitized real rap

1159
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:27,360
pups and the robot rap pups and he got the rap pups to do the same kind of thing what do you think

1160
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:37,840
the rule was anyone something random simony it was entirely random it was just that the shape

1161
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:44,640
to get to your point of the rap pups plus random behavior led to so-called complexity so I would

1162
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:50,160
say that's the same as consciousness it seems so mysterious and complex to us that we think the rules

1163
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:56,240
that lead to it in the nervous system have to also be very complex to us and what I'm saying

1164
01:47:56,240 --> 01:48:01,600
is just like the flock of birds just like the rap pups the rules will turn out to be surprisingly

1165
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:07,600
simple and surprise us and we're going to be entirely wrong it's our incense hubris because

1166
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:12,800
we think it's so mysterious the explanation has going to have to live up to our sense of its

1167
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:22,480
mysterious it does and so I should be happy and keep my mouth checked but okay no no wait we have

1168
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:28,080
to have we have only 10 minutes left and we have still hi uh thematically that's exactly what I

1169
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:32,240
want to ask about it's not I don't really have a question I just wanted you guys to talk a little

1170
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:37,920
bit more about that inflection point and if it's the biology of the mind what's your question point

1171
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,080
towards having consciousness would yeah with the worm sorry I looked at you and assembly

1172
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:48,400
knew we were talking about the worm uh that that how biology evolved past that point and if we

1173
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:54,240
stepped forward in time maybe that's the best foil to look at where something more complex emerged

1174
01:48:54,960 --> 01:49:00,720
but you know I think it's sobering to realize that you know life was kicking around on this

1175
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:06,320
particular planet for you know three and a half billion years before primates emerged and primates

1176
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:13,200
were kicking around for what 20 million years before 50 uh human or 15 50 million years before

1177
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:18,320
hominids emerged and hominids were kicking around for four or five million years before humans emerged

1178
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:23,440
and you know it there's a whole lot of life and a whole lot of intelligence a whole lot of brains

1179
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:28,880
a whole lot of minds that were happening before human beings happened to pop into the world and

1180
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:36,800
and and speak so uh I I'm worried about the idea that there's some magic you know there's some

1181
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:42,160
inflection point where we where life crosses it and then we're there you know life has gone in lots of

1182
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:47,360
ways and places and intelligence has evolved all over the place I mean octopus octopi are

1183
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:50,640
extremely intelligent by many measures I don't know if they have consciousness but they're they're

1184
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:56,080
smart just that it simplifies the problem a little bit more and I honestly just wanted to hear

1185
01:49:56,080 --> 01:50:01,600
knowledgeable people talk about why they think what were the the evolutionary conditions in the

1186
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:11,040
selection why did that the brain take that power reaction I had to your question was to think about

1187
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:17,200
so there has been an inflection point clearly in uh human evolution so we're very different than

1188
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:24,000
our ancestors were 200,000 years ago people kind of slice at 50,000 or 200 they argue about that but

1189
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:29,200
certainly we're pretty different from 200,000 years ago a lot of things have changed since here's a

1190
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:35,680
question that's very app-proposed what we're talking about is was the evolution of some change in

1191
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:41,600
the system of consciousness really important to that so it could be that what really made all

1192
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:45,920
that change was language let's say and maybe that affected consciousness and maybe it didn't and

1193
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:51,520
of course again we don't have a machine we go around and say well our dogs conscious are

1194
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:56,000
bonobos conscious and then we could you know we could look at our ancestors if we had a time

1195
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,680
machine too right if we had a time machine and a consciousness meter we would you know be much

1196
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:04,160
better positioned to resolve these arguments but as we don't have either all we can do is

1197
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:10,160
these kind of thought experiments it seems to me like just having language and maybe the ability

1198
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:16,800
to represent hierarchical structures and to care about the intuitive theories or beliefs of others

1199
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:20,640
might be enough and maybe you wouldn't need consciousness but we don't really know so I thought it was

1200
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:24,240
actually a provocative question that was very difficult to answer but I think your point is

1201
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:30,880
well taken that we have to that you know I'll give an example of dexterity right some monkeys cannot

1202
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:36,080
individually their digits and we can't right it's a remarkable change in dexterity and then you

1203
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:40,640
ask well is it a biomechanical or is it neural and we think it's neural and then you start looking

1204
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:46,240
for what is the neural basis for this quite phenomenal leap from being able to really just do this

1205
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:50,960
to be able to do that and you know it's a few connections to the ventral horn a change but it's

1206
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:58,160
not a giant change in the neural mechanisms and yet you get behaviorally a very big change right

1207
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:01,680
so in other words I think what's going to turn out is that there's going there is an inflection

1208
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:05,920
point we're all talking about something that humans have an abundance we haven't defined it but

1209
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:11,760
consciousness and self-awareness we have it nevertheless we have to agree with Ken that it had to be

1210
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:16,240
piggybacking in some incremental way on a nervous system that's been around a very long time so we

1211
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:21,920
have this mismatch between an incremental work on the substrate and what seems to be a very non-linear

1212
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:29,120
change in behavior on the outside but that happens with non-linear systems right so evolution is the

1213
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:34,560
way to get at this and we will answer this how do we get this apparent behavioral leap with a

1214
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:41,040
fairly nondescript change relatively speaking in the brain it wasn't like a whole new lobe suddenly

1215
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:44,720
occurred right so that's the way we're going to have to go if this question is the right one and

1216
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:48,000
the inflection point is something we're going to have to look for and I think we will reverse

1217
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:59,120
engineer it frankly eventually thank you my question is like we say that the mind gets distracted

1218
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:05,360
the drones it it wanders and and like how how is it related to the underlying conscience like

1219
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:11,200
this the the mind being wandering or distracting or running how how does it relate to the underlying

1220
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:16,880
consciousness or subconsciousness and then how does that relate to the firing of the neurons and

1221
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:23,600
like how does this kind of like interlink and which way does it go meaning like does it go from the

1222
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:29,680
mind to the neurons or does it go from the neurons to the mind or like well the second part is the

1223
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:34,240
easier part to answer which is the mind is what the brain does Marvin Minsky said that originally

1224
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:40,160
so it's bi-directional they are they're just descriptions at a different level of the same thing

1225
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:44,560
the way that you can have physics and chemistry they're both true it's not that one is true and

1226
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:48,720
then makes the other one happen they're both simultaneously true and so we're really talking

1227
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:53,760
about different languages to describe the same phenomena we're talking about using psychological

1228
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:58,640
terms versus using neural terms in terms of the mind wandering stuff that you started with well

1229
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:04,880
that's about how the brain decides which information to follow at a given moment so for example we are

1230
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:09,920
distractible if there was suddenly a loud noise you'd stop paying attention to what i'm doing and

1231
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:13,840
if you stop paying attention to what i was talking about you might at that point start thinking about

1232
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:16,960
your laundry and this is a risky avenue for me to talk about because you might start thinking

1233
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:23,440
about your laundry don't think about pink elephants anyone please um but so we have some machinery

1234
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:29,200
that govern basically our train of thought i mean i think that that Freud and James and so forth

1235
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:34,240
thinking about stream of consciousness had something to it there there's filtering that we use to

1236
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:39,280
decide which stimulus should i pay attention to at a particular moment and account so it was mind

1237
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:44,880
wandering if your brain says i should pay attention to this thing they'd say of immediate importance

1238
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:48,880
even though i had decided i should be paying attention to my class and there's kind of very

1239
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:53,440
there's i mean there are different neural structures responsible for doing parts of

1240
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:58,000
attention but there's a there's an area which in monkeys is called lip lateral interpridal

1241
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:05,920
which is involved in in aspects of monitoring visual salience as to what you get the attention

1242
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:10,160
and there's an experiment that was done by micky golberg and jane beasley at columbia where

1243
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:16,720
they record from lip and the monkey is fixating and then it um it gets shown a target that says

1244
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:23,040
when the fixation light goes off sicada move your eyes over there and you'll get a reward and then

1245
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:27,440
while it's still fixed so then during that time lip is really representing that area quite a lot

1246
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:32,000
it's saying oh that's very important i'm going to tend to that and then something completely irrelevant

1247
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:38,720
flashes over here well lip represents that briefly uh but it goes away again because it's irrelevant

1248
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:43,200
and it turns out the attention you can also measure where the animal's attention is by various

1249
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:50,160
tricks and the animal's attention goes to the distractor precisely when the lip activity for

1250
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:55,200
the distractor is higher than the lip activity for the target and when it comes down again when the

1251
01:55:55,200 --> 01:56:00,640
when the hill crosses that's when the attention switches back so that's a neural correlate of

1252
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:03,520
there's something there that where you know you there's something there that you're not

1253
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:07,920
attending to but it's still represented and then you come back to it when it gets to the the

1254
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:12,320
the biggest hill that's that's one example of some correlate between neurons and what you're

1255
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:19,840
asking about thank you um my question is one of the problems that you have in discussing consciousness

1256
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:25,840
is that we talk about it as a unitary phenomenon but it's really there are levels of consciousness

1257
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:32,960
even within the same individual so you can go from coma to acute awareness to meditation and

1258
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:39,440
then the other levels in between so um greenfield who's like a neurobiologist has studied

1259
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:44,320
different neural populations that she found that very small groups she calls them neural

1260
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:52,400
assemblies very small units are very briefly um activated and then disappear and she would link

1261
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:59,360
that more with a transient awareness maybe something like children have maybe animals other species

1262
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:06,400
but as consciousness as we call it like really attending builds up you find connections between

1263
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:11,760
the different neural assemblies and they're more long lasting and then out of that even

1264
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:18,720
of experience of self emerges from you know but it what it's really dealing with is going from

1265
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:23,920
let's say a coma state where almost nothing is happening where maybe um you can activate someone

1266
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:29,600
who's deeply unaware am I saying imagine yourself playing tennis you know they've done that experiment

1267
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:35,440
and they see on an fMRI the that area of the brain lights up so that brain of a deeply comatose

1268
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:42,960
person is indistinguishable from an aware person but obviously that person is not conscious um but

1269
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:49,280
in a conscious person you see many more areas activate so what we would call consciousness is

1270
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:55,680
more like a global long lasting level of activity and the experience of the individual as to whether

1271
01:57:55,680 --> 01:58:01,840
or not they're really present in the moment or they're just um you know being activated bombarded

1272
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:08,160
with stimuli has to do with how much of the brain is functioning at the same time then the other

1273
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:15,520
um caveat is that the right and left sides of the brain have different styles of functioning and

1274
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:22,160
the right hemisphere processes in a more global very quick way and we call that unconscious it

1275
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:28,480
doesn't have language and when it gives some kind of message when you sleep on what you get when

1276
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:35,520
you wake up in the morning it then transfers to a more conscious of verbal which it pay we pay a

1277
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:40,880
price for the consciousness because it takes time you have to think about each detail and then come

1278
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:47,920
up with a decision like you're fed that information from your global intuitive side thank you i just

1279
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:52,080
don't want us to clarify the age of an experience very grief yeah the adrena experiment i mean i

1280
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:56,720
think to the audience it's very important to distinguish what neurologists mean by the word

1281
01:58:56,720 --> 01:59:01,280
unconscious and conscious when it comes to coma versus what we mean by consciousness that's

1282
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:06,400
totally different things and to adren o n when they did that experiment on the tennis those

1283
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:11,120
patients were not in coma in fact the whole argument was these were the people who were being

1284
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:16,880
deemed to be in coma the bedside by neurologists but in fact what was called minimally conscious

1285
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:23,040
state so in fact it it's they're not in coma with a fragment of consciousness they're not in coma

1286
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:30,960
okay next briefly yes move be brief i'm going to toss this at uh professor morkers first

1287
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:35,840
i want the comments of the other members of the panel there's been a lot of discussion about

1288
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:42,480
definition and i'd like to ask you to comment on the valid solid definition that general

1289
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:49,840
element offers for consciousness self-awareness the ability to project into the future reflect

1290
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:58,800
on the past language use uh whether you might comment on his very concrete definition of consciousness

1291
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:06,240
which rises out of biological levels what i would say is that all of those things are well two

1292
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:11,200
points all those things are not a few points you have two other people away the one point

1293
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:17,440
can do all of those but it doesn't get at whether there's something extra thanks for

1294
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:25,120
i'm missing two things first is the female presence on the panel i think that would have

1295
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:30,320
added something secondly i'm always too easy to get to you

1296
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:38,160
mate um secondly that is an old problem that is the ambiguous ends of the day

1297
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:44,880
secondly i uh you're speaking a language it's very different from my language i come back from a

1298
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:51,760
psychoanalytic background and the unconscious is so important to this institution and i feel like

1299
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:59,040
i'm missing something today i feel like i'm missing you using the word unconscious i haven't heard

1300
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:09,760
it much and i uh to be brief i would be interested in who given your expertise in the research lab

1301
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:20,480
who who is uh approaching uh your terminology from a psychoanalytic perspective who's doing

1302
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:29,040
critical research today on brain functioning and the unconscious as it's used in the psychoanalytic

1303
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:38,480
community and as most people are aware of uh psychoanalysis was more or less uh left out of the

1304
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:45,600
academic community as our civilization has evolved because of its lack of research and ability to

1305
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:53,120
have control groups so my last question is what is the hope for psychoanalysis to be included in

1306
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:59,200
academia again in this world of research well there's a lot of work being done okay implicit bias

1307
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:05,920
a lot of work being done in that which you could argue the psychoanalytic you about before um

1308
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:11,200
all the unconscious processing work that i discussed that people like Tim Shallis are doing

1309
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:15,680
huge amount of fascinating neuroscience who's doing so Tim Shallis for example has written very well

1310
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:20,480
about this there's a lot of work on cognitive processes that are below the level of awareness

1311
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:27,440
so implicit bias that kind of work priming right i mean you could argue that what goes on the

1312
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:32,960
psychoanalytic is just a higher level version of of being primed in some way by your experiences so

1313
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:39,360
it may not look to you like it's in the domain of the phenomenology you like but at the level of

1314
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:46,400
proteins that beneath the level of awareness huge amount of neuroscience the problem is that most

1315
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:53,440
of the research done in neuroscience does not have to do with what you are saying what he said is

1316
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:58,640
not really the same unconscious you are talking about you are talking about what Freud called the

1317
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:06,480
dynamic unconscious and uh to my knowledge there is very little work on the dynamic unconscious

1318
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:11,920
and in my own personal view is that psychoanalysts first need to define that better than they have

1319
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:18,800
uh starting with Freud's original work i also just say that most neuroscience is not

1320
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:24,240
at the high cognitive level at all it's it's at levels of just understanding how basic little

1321
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:29,440
pieces of neural circuit to work and do very small things that are very far from cognitive

1322
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:34,720
processing little unconsciousness um so you know we we're just a long way from that level of understanding

1323
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:44,080
in the brain okay thank you one more question i have two very different questions the first one is

1324
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:51,680
assuming based on very poor science i know that it was true how do you integrate healing at a distance

1325
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:58,160
and sending messages that a distance into the biology of mind that's my first question my second

1326
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:05,920
question is related to basically what was stimulated by our uh Cambridge speaker uh when we have a

1327
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:13,760
slalom at the olympics and they're going down and we know that they're using a long term i'm using

1328
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:20,160
his words long-term motor skill learning and its relationship to higher cognitive processes

1329
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:27,760
such as decision making how much is body language that is learned does that put you at a lower or a

1330
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:35,680
higher level of mind and consciousness in terms of the first this is the last this was the last

1331
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:42,480
question so in turn to the first one the the mind's talking to each other to distance or healing at

1332
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:48,080
a distance i think i you know at least for myself i would say i don't believe in it and um until

1333
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:52,720
somebody can scientifically demonstrate that it happens i'm not going to try to explain it because

1334
02:04:52,720 --> 02:05:01,920
i don't think it happens yeah so um just one general point i think i i think what Ken said is something

1335
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:06,480
that for us who do psychology neuroscience is very important we talked about consciousness today but

1336
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:11,760
we're far from being in a position scientifically i mean understanding that explanation in other

1337
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:17,200
words even now when it says looking at little circuits and they explain behavior we do a very

1338
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:23,200
poor job with even that right in other words it's the unspoken elephant in the room that we're not

1339
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:28,640
really that good at extrapolating from the behavior of neurons to behaviors we can correlate

1340
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:34,960
but the understanding is very poor so we have to be super super modest we do a really bad job

1341
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:38,960
even the low level stuff and here we are talking about consciousness that's why philosophy is

1342
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:44,160
a very important and psychologist before we get to the neurons okay to the skill thing

1343
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:51,440
um i don't quite get your question in other words what are you saying being good at something

1344
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:56,240
physical makes you less cognitive is that what you say no i'm saying that they spend a long time

1345
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:02,800
long time learning uh how to move their bodies but they make decisions at the same time that

1346
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:07,840
they're going down that slalom there is conscious thinking too so i'm just asking where do you put

1347
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:15,280
the learned body language is this now back to more a reflex response or are you dealing with a very

1348
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:20,320
advanced response yes it's a great question it's about the role of the motor the role of the motor

1349
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:27,440
system that is connected to consciousness yeah well yeah i control powers about that yeah okay

1350
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:39,840
thank you very much
