1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
which she investigates using behavioral, computational,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,000
and neurophysiological methods.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,040
The central goal of her research is to understand cognition

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,480
as an adaptive process whereby the brain dynamically allocates

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,240
its resources to best serve the demands

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,600
of a decision situation.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,120
Gerald Hurwitz, Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychology

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,160
and on faculty for the past 30 years

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,800
at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,120
He has a full-time clinical practice in psychopharmacology

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,280
and neuropsychiatry in New York City.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,440
Dr. Hurwitz is a founder and chief medical officer

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,440
at M3 Information and Information Technology Company

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,720
that focuses on mental health integration

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,800
into primary care.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,960
He has authored and co-authored many texts

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,520
in the fields of psychopharmacology and neuropsychiatry.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,240
Dr. Hurwitz received a master's degree in philosophy

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,960
from NYU, an MD from Jefferson Medical College,

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,680
and a Bachelor of Arts, Physics and Philosophy from Yale.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,240
Your biography is too long.

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,000
It's actually boring.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,840
Mark Polisati has translated more than 50 books

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,600
from the French, including works by Flabeille,

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,360
Miliano, D'Oras, Touton, and Raymond Roussell,

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,400
a chivalier of the Algaredesar, Edeletta,

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,040
and the recipient of a 2016 American Academy of Arts

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,000
and Letters Award for Literature.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,280
He's the author of 11 books, including Revolution of the Mind,

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,160
The Life of Envoy Bouton, Luis Bunuel's Las Alvidadas,

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,280
Bob Dylan Highway 61 Revisited, and Sympathy for the Trader,

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,720
a translation manifesto.

33
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,880
His essays and reviews have appeared endlessly.

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,280
The New Republic, The Wall Street Journal, Art News,

35
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,120
The Nation, Parnassas, Partisan Review Book Form, and elsewhere.

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,360
And he directs the publications program

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,040
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,360
Josefa Rosvelasco is associate in the Department

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,920
of Romance Languages and Literature at Harvard University.

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,760
And I don't know about pronouncing this,

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,480
but Annrielle Callegio Complutense.

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,080
Real Callegio Complutense.

43
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,920
Thank you.

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
Annrielle.

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,040
Post-doctoral fellow.

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,320
She is conducting multi-disciplinary research

47
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,200
on the evolutionary role of boredom

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,080
from a philosophical anthropological point of view

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,040
to argue against the widespread understanding of boredom

50
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,480
as a pathological personality trait,

51
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,880
whereby medicalization of such a common daily annoyance

52
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,440
is legitimized.

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,640
As part of this approach, she is examining

54
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,080
how the comprehension of boredom in terms of a mental disease

55
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
has gradually formed historically as a result of the act

56
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,880
of taking at face value the metaphor of boredom

57
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,200
as an illness especially represented in 19th century

58
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
Western literature and philosophy.

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
She's editor and author of the books, Feminism, Past, Present

60
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,720
and Future Perspectives, Contemporary Approaches

61
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,240
in Philosophical and Humanistic Thought,

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,200
and Hans Blumenberg, Lidlatera, Estetica, I Nihilismo,

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,280
and of academic papers such as Hans Blumenberg's

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,440
Philosophical Anthropology of Boredom.

65
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,880
Boredom Humanizing or Dehumanizing Treatment,

66
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,680
boredom, a comprehensive study of the state of affairs.

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,920
She's currently working on her next book, History of Boredom,

68
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,120
the Way Towards the Path, The Ligization of Boredom

69
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
and Its Alternatives.

70
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,720
In the future, she would like to read a research project

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,360
on boredom in old age and the improvement of seniors'

72
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,280
quality of life in old people's homes

73
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,040
by paying attention to the phenomenon of boredom.

74
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,040
So that's my introduction.

75
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Thank you all for being here, world.

76
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,040
And you have missed your comments such a beautiful day.

77
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,040
And I thought again, I'd like to mark.

78
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
I'm glad to have you.

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
I'm glad to have you.

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
You can't hear me as well.

81
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Oh, my goodness.

82
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Yeah, right.

83
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Well, it doesn't matter.

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,040
To begin, I'd like Mark Politzati to say if you

85
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
introductory words on our subject.

86
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Hello, everyone.

87
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Thank you indeed for being here.

88
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
I apologize for those who are looking at my back.

89
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,040
I would rather you hate me than be indifferent to me.

90
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Schopenhauer wrote that the two enemies of human happiness

91
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
are pain and boredom.

92
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,040
And of the two, the more fearsome is clearly boredom.

93
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,040
We rot our brain cells with drugs or Twitter to avoid it.

94
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,040
We willingly endanger life and limb to get away from it.

95
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Here today, I would much rather you throw tomatoes at me than yawn.

96
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,040
So if you must walk out, please do it from anger or disgust, not from lack of interest.

97
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,040
What is it about boredom that so frightens and discomforts us?

98
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Tolstoy defined it as the desire for desires, which speaks of a yearning,

99
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,040
but one that can never be satisfied because it's a failure of yearning itself.

100
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,040
The fact is boredom is hard to concentrate on.

101
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
We get restless.

102
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,040
We are literally driven to distraction.

103
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,040
The desperation we feel when we're forced to endure it for long periods

104
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
can be positively claustrophobic.

105
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:53,040
And yet, somewhat paradoxically, boredom maintains a real hold on our imaginations.

106
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,040
You find it unexpected references to it everywhere.

107
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Robert Museo, in his novel Three Women, writes of a group of prospectors,

108
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,040
what caused them more suffering than food poisoning was melancholy and boredom,

109
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,040
which seems to buttress my conviction that we'd much rather suffer physical pain

110
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,040
than suffer tedium.

111
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Others have taken a more prescriptive approach to boredom,

112
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,040
offering recipes on how to be a bore, that presumably really mean to tell us

113
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
how not to be a bore.

114
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Voltaire's formulation was, the secret of being a bore is to tell everything.

115
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,040
A sentiment echoed by the American humorist Bert Leston Taylor in a well-known quip,

116
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,040
a bore is a man who, when you ask him how he is, tells you.

117
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,040
But hey, we would simply say, TMI.

118
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Still others have tried to combat boredom proactively, if not always, considerably.

119
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,040
The surrealist leader, Andre Bertome, having cruelly humiliated

120
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,040
one of his closest friends in public, explained afterward to his non-plus companions,

121
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,040
it's only natural when on board to provoke an argument, even a nasty one,

122
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,040
to avoid losing stamina.

123
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Now, you have before you five people who are going to spend the next two hours

124
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,040
trying to engage your interest in the negation of interest,

125
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,040
which might seem like the very definition of a fool's errand,

126
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,040
but fear not, because for every sage who is dispirative boredom,

127
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,040
others have zeroed in on its redeeming qualities.

128
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,040
The American educator John Cabazzin, reflecting his work on mindfulness,

129
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,040
points out that when you pay attention to boredom, it gets unbelievably interesting.

130
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Similarly, John Ashbury wrote in his poem, The Short Answer,

131
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Why Make Things More Difficult Than They Already Are?

132
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Because if it's boring in a different way, that'll be interesting too.

133
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Indeed, the potential of boredom to spur creativity is well known to any artist.

134
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:56,040
The life of the creative man, said Susan Sontag, is led, directed, and controlled by boredom.

135
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Avoiding boredom is one of our most important purposes.

136
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,040
And Robert M. Persig, author of Send in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,

137
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:12,040
put it even more bluntly when he said that boredom always precedes a period of great creativity.

138
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Are they protesting too much, putting a happy mask over their agonized faces?

139
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Perhaps, but many are those who have written not only out of boredom,

140
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,040
in both senses of out of, but have even made boredom their pet subject.

141
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,040
Alberto Moravia's most celebrated novel is titled, Boredom,

142
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:35,040
though it's actually about a young man's, but a bored young man's, dangerous infatuation.

143
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,040
The decadent writer, Joris Carl-Wiesmanz,

144
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,040
who we might call literatures, Chairman of the Board,

145
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
made it career, you know I was going to do that.

146
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:50,040
Made a career of displaying in book after book his uninteresting society and all its works.

147
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,040
If you search under boredom in the book listings on Amazon,

148
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,040
it will return more than a hundred pages of results,

149
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,040
suggesting that the literature of boredom is practically an industry unto itself.

150
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,040
The mention of literature quickly steers us toward boredom's highfalutin French cousin,

151
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Henri, as well as to his German relative, Velschmätz.

152
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Even though the terms are nearly synonymous, each carries a particular resonance,

153
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,040
and each stands apart from plain vanilla boredom,

154
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,040
in its connotations of romantic world-weariness,

155
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,040
of being not only bored, but extravagantly, even exotically bored.

156
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,040
From Kierkegaard to Sartre, Henri has got something that mere boredom hasn't got,

157
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,040
cache. So much so, in fact, that a company making protective sports gear

158
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,040
shows it as their brand name. Here's the pitch on their website.

159
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Urban sports are extremely fun. Don't ruin the experience with the wrong gear.

160
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
Choose on we.

161
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,040
No, while on we and Velschmätz give off a paradoxical whiff of excitement and intensity,

162
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,040
plain old boredom is just, well, boring.

163
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,040
It's on we, stripped of its glamour. It's what we all know when we're at home.

164
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,040
It's the tedium of the familiar. Still, I would posit that that very familiarity

165
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,040
of the same old, same old can also be a comfort, and I'll end my remarks with one last quote.

166
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,040
This was said not by a famous pundit, but by the woman in a couple I know,

167
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,040
who for years have been maintaining a bicoster relationship.

168
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,040
Once when the three of us were dining together, they were lamenting the difficulties

169
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,040
of never quite seeing each other for long enough. And after thinking it over,

170
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,040
she came out with one of the most romantic sentences I've ever heard.

171
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,040
It's not that I want you here all the time, she told her partner,

172
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,040
I just want the luxury of being bored with you. Thank you.

173
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:55,040
So feel free to jump in, or if you have something you'd like to say,

174
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,040
or if you'd like to talk about.

175
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,040
I don't mind jumping in. First of all, I'm sitting over here just in case the tomatoes start flying.

176
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,040
I thought I'd be as far away from Marcus I could be.

177
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,040
I know I'm really struck as a psychiatrist with sort of a very mundane nature,

178
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,040
everyday nature of boredom, and how it's something that's in front of us,

179
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,040
and it's in front of everybody. A little bit like sleep every night,

180
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,040
that's still mysterious, and I think that's really a wonderful feature of it.

181
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,040
It was an as to the sort of interest of boredom. I make this observation for what it's worth.

182
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,040
A recent review of two books on Jewish humor by Kathleen Shine in the York Review of Books,

183
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,040
quotes the poet Billy Collins to say,

184
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,040
humor's the dog that leaves the room when you call its name.

185
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,040
It's sort of well known, and it's an old saw that if you have a clinical or critical discussion of humor,

186
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,040
it's not funny. Humor and Mirth are sort of positive effects or feelings in emotional states,

187
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,040
and the more you talk about them analytically, the less humor it becomes.

188
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:09,040
Boredom, maybe Mirth's evil twin sibling, has a negative valence,

189
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,040
but it seems the more we speak of it, the less boring it is.

190
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,040
I thought that was an interesting way to start, and also I won't go on to this point now,

191
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:26,040
but I wonder about Mirth as being, you know, in more literally a kind of the other side of boredom.

192
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:35,040
On that point, I mean one of the things that I would like to say is that, you know,

193
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,040
I think if you give, as you said, you know, if you give boredom at least sort of a second thought,

194
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,040
it's sort of beguiling really and enticing, and on the one hand I think that's both a blessing

195
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:55,040
and a curse for scholars of boredom, because it is so open to understanding, definition,

196
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,040
interpretation, study in so many different ways, it's almost like, you know, this rorshock

197
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:09,040
that can capture all of our thoughts, and it indeed does seem to provide an organizing framework

198
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,040
for a lot of preoccupation and concern that people have today.

199
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,040
So on the one hand, that's just plain fun as a scholar, right, because you can just roll around

200
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:27,040
in this unconstrained, limitless landscape, but if we want to, you know, really collaborate with one another,

201
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:36,040
if we want to be able to make some progress, dare I say, if that's an okay thing to say,

202
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:44,040
in our understanding of boredom, that I think we need to find sort of some lingua franca that we can all work from,

203
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:52,040
and we need to find some way to work together to develop some precision around terms and around the uses of our words,

204
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:59,040
because the term boredom is so elastic that as a scientist it's really difficult to wrestle with it, right,

205
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,040
when one person uses the term, that might mean something very different than another.

206
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:13,040
So while I really think multi-disiliterity approaches, multi-method approaches are absolutely the way to go,

207
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,040
I think it would be wise for us to find ways to corral and constrain our thinking,

208
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,040
and to find ways that we can communicate across disciplines and work with each other.

209
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:38,040
Yeah, I totally agree because today concerning boredom, we have to admit that we have more questions than responses, than solutions.

210
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:45,040
But we all recognize that we have to do that to speak of boredom.

211
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:54,040
At least we have to admit that boredom, to talk of boredom is not boring because we are all smiling all the time.

212
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:00,040
So my first reaction to your presentation, your fascinating presentation,

213
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:09,040
you told in one time that boredom conduct to disaster at the very beginning.

214
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:18,040
So I think boredom conduct to disasters, because we are worried about boredom,

215
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:25,040
especially because of the consequences of being bored,

216
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,040
in particular of the consequences of not to be able to get rid of boredom.

217
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:42,040
So I think boredom leads to disaster in two different situations when individuals are unable to give a response,

218
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
or reply to boredom.

219
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:51,040
And also, this is the topic I use, like how you treat and psychologists are working on.

220
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,040
And individuals have problems with regard to attention and so on.

221
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:14,040
And also on the other situation, when the context is so close that doesn't offer the responses you are expecting.

222
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:24,040
In this case, when the individual is not able because of their own problems, mental problems and so on,

223
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:31,040
or because of the context, in this two situations when boredom leads to the disaster,

224
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:44,040
I mean to behaviors that everybody could say are pathological, are deviant behaviors.

225
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,040
Yeah, I completely agree.

226
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:56,040
And I'm wondering to your point, maybe one of the things to try to distinguish between is boredom

227
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:03,040
and the feeling of discomfort that we feel that we call boredom, which are maybe not quite the exact same thing,

228
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:10,040
because I feel very lucky in the sense that if I'm on my own, I actually never feel bored.

229
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:17,040
I mean I can feel tired, I can feel that I don't have any particular activity, I can feel lack of energy,

230
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:24,040
but I don't feel bored in that sense of being almost kind of desperately anxious to get out of whatever that state is.

231
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Where I do get bored sometimes, this is when I'm in a place where I can't leave.

232
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,040
So I mean boredom is hell is other people and so is boredom.

233
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:41,040
And the classic example for me is in my day job, if I'm stuck in a meeting and I just have to be there,

234
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,040
and sometimes they can be great but sometimes they can get really painful.

235
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:53,040
And it does cause that sense of claustrophobia that I referenced, where my astral self is sort of getting up from the table

236
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,040
and walking out of the room and going, yeah, it's running down the hall.

237
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,040
But my physical self, because I'm sort of stuck because of the expectations of the job,

238
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:08,040
are still sitting there just waiting for this thing to end, because whatever they're talking about is just a no interest whatsoever.

239
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,040
And there's a memoir I remember reading once by the former director of the Louvre,

240
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:19,040
who was talking about one of his predecessors would go to meetings of which they had zillions,

241
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,040
and the French are even worse than we are in the museum world.

242
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,040
And they would go to meetings at a certain point, he would just stand up and say,

243
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,040
okay, I'm going to the movies now, and all the other curators would be sitting around the table completely non-plus

244
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,040
because this man actually dared to do what they probably wanted to do themselves,

245
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,040
but he actually stood up and did it and walked away and it eventually cost him his job,

246
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
but it kind of didn't matter because he just didn't want to be bored anymore.

247
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:51,040
The first kind of boredom, hide the gut, talk about boredom or a situation in which you are not forced to be there,

248
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
but you should.

249
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
You're constrained.

250
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:02,040
You decide to go there voluntarily, nobody is forcing you,

251
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,040
but you know in advance you are going to be bored.

252
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:12,040
I'm not sorry if this is the first of the second kind of boredom,

253
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
hey, the gut talk about.

254
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,040
I would actually take slight issue with that because the fact is that there are pressures and constraints on the,

255
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,040
you are kind of forced, I mean you're not forced physically at gunpoint,

256
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:28,040
it's not like being in jail, but the fact is that the dictates of my job and the position I have at the museum

257
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,040
and the expectations are such that I'm expected to be in that room,

258
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,040
I'm expected to pretend that I'm paying attention, I'm expected to pretend that I actually care what these people are talking about,

259
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,040
and I mean obviously most of the time I do, but once in a while it's, you know, it's where I am in my salary,

260
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:49,040
and this is part of the job, so there are pressures to do it.

261
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,040
I can't just walk out, much as I would love to.

262
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:59,040
I have a question about the other kind of boredom that happens when you're alone by yourself,

263
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:07,040
and some people who don't get bored in that situation, and I apologize, and I think very lucky,

264
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:14,040
but then other people who do get bored in that situation, what do you think is the difference?

265
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:24,040
I know you've studied this a lot, and maybe related to this, what is the role of boredom in mental illness and psychopathology?

266
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Let's say, yeah there's a big topic.

267
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Yeah.

268
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,040
That was why the human side board.

269
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:37,040
What's the difference between people who get bored when they're by themselves and people who don't?

270
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:43,040
I have a few thoughts to address a number of those issues, and please jump in.

271
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:50,040
There's lots of different factors, cultural, social, environmental, psychological factors that can cause boredom, right?

272
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:57,040
There's a wide variety of things, but I do think we need a clear definition of what the state of boredom is,

273
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:04,040
and so I define the state of boredom as the uncomfortable feeling of being mentally unengaged.

274
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Yeah.

275
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:12,040
And while not perfect, I think it does a pretty good job of succinctly capturing the definition,

276
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:19,040
and I think the underlying cognitive mechanism is this state of underutilized cognitive resources, right?

277
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,040
We have mental capacity that's sort of pent up and not being utilized or not being used,

278
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:31,040
and I think that's an inherently uncomfortable feeling, and I think we are just designed, evolutionarily,

279
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,040
to experience that state as a versa, and I think that's a good thing, right?

280
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
It's a good thing.

281
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,040
I mean, we wouldn't be here today having this conversation if we were content to be mentally unengaged, right?

282
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:50,040
We wouldn't be here in this culture, the society, not unless this conversation itself.

283
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,040
So I say boredom is the uncomfortable feeling of being mentally unengaged,

284
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,040
and I think you can compare it to physical pain.

285
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:08,040
I think that the discomfort of boredom is analogous to the discomfort of physical pain.

286
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:14,040
They both keep us safe, or they both keep us well.

287
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,040
So it's a good thing that we have the capacity for boredom.

288
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,040
That doesn't mean that we should cultivate boredom, right?

289
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,040
So just because pain is a good thing, we don't go around cultivating it, right?

290
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,040
We don't say yes, we should cultivate it.

291
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Nor do I think we should become preoccupied with trying to avoid pain at any cost.

292
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:42,040
That would not be advantageous, nor would it be advantageous to try to avoid boredom at any cost, right?

293
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Similarly, like pain, boredom can become chronic and problematic, right?

294
00:22:51,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Similarly, like pain, I think boredom is the signal, and how we respond to it is what's really critical, right?

295
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Pain is just a message, it's just a signal that tells us we're in a non-optimal state, we're cognitively unengaged,

296
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,040
and it gives us that impetus to do something about it.

297
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:20,040
What we do, you know, rung jump, go and get drunk, read a novel, whatever, we can all respond in very different ways,

298
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,040
and that's where boredom can become problematic, right?

299
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
It's about our response to it.

300
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,040
I'm not a fan of the idea of pathologizing boredom, I don't think we should consider it an illness,

301
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
I don't think we should consider it a problem.

302
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,040
In its chronic form, it does co-occur with what I would call mental disorders,

303
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:50,040
but I don't think of boredom itself as a pathological state, but one that we need to handle carefully in lots of different contexts.

304
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:57,040
I like to expand on that a little bit, and also maybe make it a little bit more intuitive for people who are listening about your,

305
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
that's an excellent analogy to pain.

306
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:04,040
When you say that people, we need pain, it does serve a function.

307
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:09,040
I think most of us think of things like you stubbed your toe, or it's considerable pain,

308
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,040
but you know, there are all these folks out there who don't have pain fibers and don't have any sense of pain.

309
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,040
Their number one problem is, see, I'm here, I'm a little constrained, I can't keep changing my posture,

310
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:26,040
but we all, if we stay in the same posture exactly for any period of time, pain is what makes us want to move,

311
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:33,040
so our joints don't get stiff, et cetera, and you know, people in hospital who are forced to be in the same position

312
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:41,040
can start to develop pain, and it becomes worse and worse, so it can really be a very tiny negative feeling, pain can be.

313
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:48,040
And where we don't even recognize it's occurring, and we shift our posture because it's starting to build,

314
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:54,040
but it's there, that is a little tiny bit of pain, and so I think using that as an analogy to what an boredom is,

315
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:01,040
is really useful because boredom can happen in these sort of micro doses and have an effect in spurring us to do whatever

316
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,040
we can, hopefully we'll do next.

317
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:12,040
I'll just say one other thing just to be a little bit argumentative with your wish to find boredom,

318
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:19,040
just simply that, you know, there's an idea that goes back to the beginnings of modernism of, I'm sorry,

319
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,040
of sort of the enlightenment that if only we could have a language, a scientific language that was precise,

320
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,040
then all of our problems would be solved, right?

321
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Whereas I'm really, I think that the pro-dian nature of boredom is actually a very interesting issue

322
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:40,040
because it has many sides and aspects to it, and it fits in so many places, and I'm certainly in favor,

323
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:49,040
and I like your definition of it as well, but I think we also can bear in mind that it is a sort of slightly ambiguous term,

324
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:56,040
and it does serve in different contexts slightly differently, or it has a role in different contexts slightly differently,

325
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:03,040
I think that's actually interesting, we don't want to cut off an idea about boredom by reducing it too much.

326
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:14,040
Fair enough, I mean I agree with that, I remember actually once attending a conference where this poet was talking about T.S. Eliot's,

327
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,040
and he was talking about how any definition of H2O needed to include a little duckweed, right?

328
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:28,040
So I'm quite comfortable with that idea, but I think right now if you can talk about a field of boredom study,

329
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:35,040
the problem is we got too much duckweed, and not enough precision, but I certainly think we need to stay open,

330
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:43,040
and I do think that there are useful, precise ideas that cut across contexts,

331
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:50,040
and finding those common patterns is I think very exciting and very useful.

332
00:26:50,040 --> 00:27:00,040
I wanted to ask about boredom definition and so on, because what Mark was describing,

333
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:07,040
I also have been lucky enough to be in that position sometimes,

334
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:15,040
and I never described that as boredom to myself, I described it that I was restless, irritated, impatient,

335
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:23,040
couldn't tolerate all the nonsense being talked about, but I felt more annoyance,

336
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:33,040
whereas when I am bored, it's more that I kind of pass, am passively not knowing what to do or how to engage,

337
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:44,040
or so there is a difference there, and one question then is who think about you, people who think about boredom

338
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:50,040
and are knowledgeable about it, how do you define it, what is it exactly?

339
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Actually, if I can just jump in with one thing, because there's anemologically,

340
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:59,040
and this might or might not have a bearing, but the French direct translation of boredom is of course en-wie.

341
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:07,040
En-wie comes from Old French, which means annoyance, and that comes from Latin, which means hated.

342
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:14,040
So there is the annoyance, hatred, boredom, vector, it's very tight.

343
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:20,040
I had a fellow in my lab once, who was from France, and he would always say, this is boring, this is boring,

344
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,040
it's still annoying, and this is annoying, it's very dated.

345
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:30,040
So the show is also the cultural quality of boredom, and whether or not one chooses to use that term,

346
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:35,040
because I think when you heard that some people would label what your experience is boredom,

347
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,040
I don't think you said, well I didn't have boredom, that was something else.

348
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:44,040
You said, I didn't think to call that boredom in a way, and I have a different thing I refer to when I think of boredom,

349
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:51,040
but I think there may yet be something in common between those two states, which is, I don't know yet what I want to do with myself,

350
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,040
and gee I wish I did, which is the wishing to have a wish that Mark referred to.

351
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:06,040
And then there's the under-utilization of my sort of cognitive capacity, where I could do more, or I'd like to act,

352
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:11,040
and somehow I'm constrained to not act, and that can create a sense of boredom.

353
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:21,040
But the words that Ed used are all active words. I mean, I'm annoyed, I'm irritated, they're all active words where boredom, as you pointed out,

354
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:29,040
is a passive. Well I think it's a passive state, maybe not. So what else could be in boredom that's not passive?

355
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Why?

356
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
What would make a difference?

357
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
Why passive?

358
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Well, as opposed to annoyed, irritated, all those things, they're active words, and boredom is something.

359
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:49,040
I think that's it. I think that whatever the dichotomy captures it, because the person's both idle in some sense,

360
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:59,040
or not acting as much as they might, and yet they have an impulse to do so. So there's the active impulse, and then there's the feeling, I don't know what.

361
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Because in French, on we has a passive quality to it, whereas if you say someone we, that annoys me.

362
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:18,040
So when you say someone we means that annoys me, but when you say I have on we, I'm just passively feeling something uncomfortable.

363
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:27,040
So this gets back to a concept that comes up in many, many contexts, and that is the optimal level of stimulation.

364
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:37,040
And it comes up, I mean, I don't really know. It's a very mysterious concept in neuroscience when it's presumably maps on some network state, right?

365
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:51,040
If your brain is a state, a big dynamical system of neurons interacting, and there's presumably some optimal rate of interaction that is just good, and it feels good, for whatever reason.

366
00:30:51,040 --> 00:31:06,040
And so this is how I imagine, born of, even though I couldn't tell you what that state was, what the principles are, but imagine, born of as being in some other state that is understimulated relative to that optimal one.

367
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:12,040
And of course we can imagine being overstimulated, and that feels bad in a different way.

368
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:25,040
So it's not really determined by any single external circumstance. If some people, the same boring meeting, maybe experienced as irritating by somebody.

369
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:30,040
And fascinating, maybe my others.

370
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,040
Or boring people.

371
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Or maybe even by yourself in a different day.

372
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:44,040
It's funny to read some of the methods sections of some of the papers on board, and where they're trying to, you know, you've been among them.

373
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:53,040
What can we use as a stimulus for board on, which is almost again an oxymoron? It's funny to read, like, oh, we got this movie that's so boring, we'll show that.

374
00:31:53,040 --> 00:32:07,040
Yeah, but it's never a property only of the external environment is what that external environment does to you. What kind of memories it evokes, what kind of mental life it stimulates.

375
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:16,040
So if all of a sudden that boring meeting, something came that triggered your memory of something, then at least you could distract yourself with some memory.

376
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:28,040
And anyone be bored anymore. So it's not a function just of familiarity or just of novelty. There's some happy medium.

377
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:36,040
If things are too simple or too complicated, they can both be boring. So there's some happy medium there, right? Whatever that is.

378
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:47,040
So boring, boredom, I think, is the state where you might be understimulated and don't like it and want to get out of it, as I think you very well say.

379
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:56,040
There you go. Well, there are participants of a sort. We're doing a practical demonstration.

380
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:06,040
Or a concept from both overstimulated and understimulated. Yes, when the flow is broken.

381
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:16,040
I guess what I would say is that, you know, where we choose to put the definitional boundaries is up for grabs, right? I mean, there's no a prior a right answer.

382
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:30,040
And we have to decide what's useful. And, you know, well, I think boredom has a long sort of history. I'm sure that culture and situation and time have shifted where that boundary has been put slightly.

383
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:40,040
You know, in my mind, I would think about it as an emotional state. And I think the two neighboring states that we need to distinguish it from our frustration on the one hand and apathy on the other.

384
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:49,040
And I think boredom fits somewhere in between those two. And I think it's important not to conflate boredom with apathy, which often people do.

385
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:58,040
And I think that boredom involves that desire for desires. We already heard the Tolstoy quote, right? And that idea goes back to Schopenhauer's formulation of boredom.

386
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:06,040
There's this restless longing and desire, but an inability to articulate what is long for, right? So it's not at all a passive state.

387
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:21,040
There's a sense of urgency and desire for action. The psychoanalytic writers talked about the desire being too threatening, and so it needed to be repressed.

388
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:28,040
But that desire for action remained without any target for discharging that energy, right? So there's that it's not apathetic.

389
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:38,040
And on the other hand, frustration, you have a goal out on the horizon, and something is thwarting your progress towards it. Something is standing between you and a desired state, and that's frustration.

390
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:45,040
But in boredom, you don't have that future desired state articulated, right? So you can't be frustrated.

391
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:52,040
You know, I heard another psychoanalytic writer that talked about a board person is like putting on a suit.

392
00:34:52,040 --> 00:35:01,040
You know, it doesn't quite fit, right? No, is it? Or trying to remember a name, right? Like, what is that guy's name? Was it Joe? Was it George? No, no, no, what was it?

393
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:09,040
Like, you've got this sense, this wraith. There's something there that you want, but you can't name it, right?

394
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,040
And in terms of the over-under stimulation, I would, again, go back to the idea that situations that are too challenging, right?

395
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:22,040
If we attend a lecture on some topic that we know nothing about, it's like we can't get a foothold in, right? We can't get a foothold in.

396
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,040
And so we are not cognitively able to engage with what's happening.

397
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:36,040
If the lecture is on something we know too well, and it's sort of very, you know, uninteresting to us below our capacity, then it doesn't engage us either.

398
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:45,040
And so I think in both, you know, those over-under stimulating or over challenging situations, they have that final common pathway of being cognitively,

399
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:55,040
un-engaged. And when I say that that's the underlying subpersonal cognitive mechanism, I don't wish to say that that's all there is to it.

400
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:05,040
There's a phenomenological, there's a subjective part on top of that underlying mechanism that's very important, and that's where all the affective kinds of components come in.

401
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:18,040
I can't think of it a little bit. We are all the time talking about one kind of boredom. As you know, we should talk of boredom perhaps,

402
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:31,040
because we are talking of this situational contextual boredom, but what about society, which is bored, completely bored?

403
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:49,040
This, you know, this differentiation between the situational boredom or, yeah, the situation in which you are bored, but you can do something, boredom perhaps you may get rid of boredom.

404
00:36:49,040 --> 00:37:12,040
But then you have the profound boredom, the deep boredom that later John Philosophia talk about. This differentiation was established by Paul Balevi, the French support Paul Balevi in the last century.

405
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:27,040
And then also, if I'm not too, yeah, I think it was cracker, secret cracker, then also repeated this definition of boredom in a certain situation.

406
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:44,040
The boredom that a society suffer, this kind of boredom you suffer when you are associated with your cultural, social, economic structures.

407
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Yeah, so perhaps apart from attempting to define a definition for boredom, we have to start talking of different boredom.

408
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:14,040
I agree not to make it too focused in one direction, but when you talk about society's societal boredom, is that really bored in the sense, even in the larger sense that we are understanding it, is that more metaphorical?

409
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:35,040
And societal boredom sounds to me like it shades more toward what you were talking about in frustration, that when we talk of a society being bored, it really is that the people in that society are feeling that there's something that's not working, whether it's an economic structure, whether it's a political situation, whether it's their ability to affect it, yeah, but that's not really bored of, that's really frustration.

410
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:45,040
We're not bored with the correct administration, we're just frustrated with it.

411
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:58,040
Well, in my case, or some part of our enculturation in a particular society may not give us the goals or may not cultivate the goals in people, I don't know how to exactly say this, but if those goals are not cultivated by people, you know, it's sort of like some young people are coming up through school,

412
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:11,040
they'll say, I don't know what I want to do with myself, and say, well, go see a career counselor, which is perfectly reasonable, but the idea is maybe that person will find some interest the person wasn't aware of where they had or give them some focus and direction.

413
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:27,040
So frustration implies there are things barring people from expressing themselves, and I think that's a more sort of a description of philosophical and sociological description of, let's say, anger among the underclass or in feminism and such.

414
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:35,040
People would say, well, yes, of course women are, of course, African Americans are angry because of the being mistreated, so why are you treating it like a psychological problem, it's a societal problem.

415
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:46,040
In this case, I think with boredom, you could say, actually also, people don't know what to do with themselves, and they may also be frustrated, it's not just one or the other.

416
00:39:46,040 --> 00:40:04,040
I do think when we judge something to be boring, we're doing social work, we're dismissing, we're denigrating, so to describe something as boring is kind of a social act, I think, and so I would definitely agree in that regard.

417
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:11,040
And you can think about it, you know, like a child in a classroom who, let's say they're struggling with math.

418
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:24,040
Well, this is boring, right? What's happening right there, right? Well, maybe this child lacks the capacity to be successful in this context, but it's a way to save face, it's sort of an aloof kind of stepping back.

419
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:40,040
And we use boredom to judge people as well, right? I had one graduate student who was doing a project cross-culturally looking at boredom in rural communities in Guatemala, and it's interesting that when people say, well, I'm never bored.

420
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:49,040
I'm never bored because I got too much work to do, it's just those rich guys over there that get bored, right? It's a way of rejecting the other.

421
00:40:49,040 --> 00:41:00,040
So I do think social work is happening around boredom in a way that's interesting and a little different than other kinds of emotions, perhaps.

422
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:09,040
And so I think your point is well taken in that regard. I also think that there are many different potential factors that can cause boredom when you've touched on that as well.

423
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:22,040
But I think if you're thinking about it as an emotional state, I would think of it as singular with lots of different causes and then lots of different responses I might make to it.

424
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:28,040
So there's certainly a variety that needs to be explored and understood.

425
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:39,040
I remember many, many years ago, we were talking one of the early meetings like that, and Carl Pribram was there.

426
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:47,040
And Carl Pribram said, many of these words we use, and we were talking about creativity, imagination, and so on.

427
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:54,040
He said, these are just words we use, that it's because we don't really know what they are about, and we give them a name.

428
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:59,040
Do you think boredom falls into that category? That it's...

429
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:11,040
For example, when we say fear as an emotion, it seems to be a lot more specific, and now you can talk about fear circuits and so on.

430
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:25,040
But boredom seems to be, as I listen, it seems like different people feel it or describe it, or like your student with the mat, who says I'm bored.

431
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,040
Does he actually have an emotion that is specific and can be called boredom?

432
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:42,040
This is kind of where I started, right? My thought would be that boredom can be like fear if we can work together and come up with a definition.

433
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:56,040
But I think the person in the street will and should continue to use the term very broadly and very loosely, just the way people use the term fear in a way that neuroscientists would say, well, that's not actually not quite fear, right?

434
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:02,040
I mean, they would like to think just between fear and anxiety and all kinds of nuances that others wouldn't make.

435
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:13,040
So I think we should start by listening to the person in the street to develop kind of grounded definitions of our concepts and make sure they're culturally relevant, and we should look at theories.

436
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:20,040
But then I think we need to do a little pruning and kind of come up with that definition so that we can work with it like we can work with fear.

437
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:31,040
Yeah, I agree. So I think it's so coming from neuroscience where we're not really studying boredom yet, but we're not studying a lot of interesting higher level concepts like curiosity.

438
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,040
Right.

439
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:39,040
It's, right? But it's not that they cannot be studied. It's just we didn't get to them yet.

440
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:46,040
So this is why I mean fear is impossible to study at the biological level not long ago and all these decision making.

441
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,040
Everything we care about that's interesting. It's very hard to define.

442
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,040
That's right.

443
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,040
That's in a sense that's why we're not going to give up trying to, you know, operation.

444
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,040
So, yeah.

445
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:03,040
Just some disciplines are in terms of studying boredom because it's so difficult to define that.

446
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,040
Yeah.

447
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:13,040
And perhaps some anthropologists think of what we are going to say about boredom because it's an affection, it's an emotion.

448
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,040
A state of mind is...

449
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,040
Well, I mean, so it's the same as sort of the dark side of mental life, right?

450
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,040
So even when we study feeding behavior in neuroscience, we don't say we study hunger, right?

451
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:33,040
Hunger is a motivation for feeding. So the same thing boredom is the motivation for engaging in mental life.

452
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:40,040
But so I was going to ask you, speaking of these disconnect, I mean, in a sense you're a lot farther ahead than we are in neuroscience.

453
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:50,040
And this is what attracted me to read some of your studies because I started thinking about what motivates us to engage attention, what motivates us to be curious.

454
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:59,040
And then I looked in my field in neuroscience and I'm amazed to find that in neuroscience we think of mental activity as a cost.

455
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:07,040
So, right, it's really nice to be able to put everything that has resource limitation in an economic framework, right?

456
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,040
So attention, mental capacity is limited, so we have to decide how to engage it.

457
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:17,040
Either I'm attending to one thing, that means I'm not attending to the other.

458
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,040
And we engage our mental life in order to obtain some benefit.

459
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,040
Whatever that is, utility, right?

460
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,040
But optimally or rationally, we want to obtain that benefit with the minimum of effort.

461
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:39,040
So in that framework, mental life is a cost that if we, everything being equal, I'd rather not pay, right?

462
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:49,040
So if you give me a choice between doing something that's a bit more difficult and a bit more easy, if you don't pay me extra, I'll just go for the easy stuff, right?

463
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,040
That's our theories.

464
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,040
That's the state of our theories that people go by.

465
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,040
And of course that opens the question, well, then why are we curious?

466
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:05,040
Why are people reading books for no apparent benefit when you just go to sleep to conserve energy?

467
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,040
Things like that, right?

468
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,040
So clearly that little definition that we're working on is very incomplete.

469
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,040
And anyway, so I was wondering what do you think about that?

470
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,040
Well, I think that's a great question.

471
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:22,040
And so you could summarize that maybe as this cognitive miserly model, right?

472
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:29,040
This idea that we want to reduce our expenditure of resources and we want to.

473
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:37,040
Now, so sometimes people when they hear me say that the state of being mentally unengaged is inherently aversive, they say, well, wait a second.

474
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,040
How does that jive with this cognitive miserly idea?

475
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,040
Right.

476
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:49,040
But I don't see a conflict there because I'm not, you know, a cognitive miserly model is about the exertion of effort, right?

477
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,040
And there are ways to be cognitively engaged that don't necessarily require a lot of cognitive effort.

478
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,040
You know, so you think about reverie, daydream, mind wandering.

479
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:06,040
These are all ways of being engaged mentally that don't involve cognitive effort.

480
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:13,040
However, you brought up some other examples like curiosity, which I think is an interesting example.

481
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:21,040
And you might argue, well, curiosity sometimes does require the exertion of effort and therefore it might be contradictory.

482
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,040
Yeah.

483
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,040
With this miserly model.

484
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,040
Yeah.

485
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:40,040
And you know, I don't have a kind of a solution to that paradox when it comes to curiosity, but I feel confident that we can say that being mentally unengaged is inherently aversive without it being in conflict with this miserly model.

486
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:46,040
And I think the miserly model as you're pointing out is too simplistic, right?

487
00:47:46,040 --> 00:48:03,040
That certainly there are times in which affectance motivation, like we're motivated to demonstrate our competence, to be effective in the world, make changes, and that sometimes requires effort.

488
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:18,040
And so I think the miserly model is, which has its base in this very narrow cognitive science kind of paradigm, is doesn't apply more broadly when we look at human life.

489
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:29,040
Well, maybe I don't know if this, how this affects or whether it's a cognitive miserly model, but you know, maybe one pathway into it is to broaden the definition of what payback is.

490
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:45,040
Because you know, you talk about, okay, I want to do something for the least possible effort, if you're only going to pay me x by z, and I'm thinking, you know, just in a very practical, basic term, translations I've done that have taken me enormous amounts of time and enormous amounts of effort and for which I've gotten, you know, one

491
00:48:45,040 --> 00:49:02,040
nth the amount that I would usually charge for one of these, because I just wanted to do it. It was the labor of love, right? And so the payback there is my satisfaction in taking the time and putting in the effort to do what I consider a good job and being able to then read it and say, oh, that's actually pretty good.

492
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:08,040
That's my payback. I mean, the monetary part is fine, but if it were only because of that, I just wouldn't have done it at that rate.

493
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:25,040
And so when you talk about why people engage in altruistic events or why they, you know, why they do things that don't seem to have any particular return, the return is, you know, potentially the return is, in fact, that feeling of having engaged in some sort of altruistic effort.

494
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:41,040
And sometimes a little bit of what we were talking about earlier about the very small valence attached to pain or boredom. And I think the same thing applies to reward. And we have this new model, newish model about how dopamine functioning in the brain and the mid brain affects our

495
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:57,040
participation of reward. And bear in mind, actually, that can easily become too simplistic a model where we think, oh, reward equals dopamine. And that's clearly wrong. But it's because actually, I was careful to say the anticipation of reward is different from reward, right?

496
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:10,040
And so what we, each of us, imagines will be the reward if I do X, Y, or Z, may have a greater bearing on what we end up doing in the world. And I do mean again, just like with the issue about a slight bit of pain and one joints.

497
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:22,040
If I'm sitting somewhere and I'm just idle and I suddenly see a bottle of water, let's say I just want to move it because it's not where I want it to be or let's say I'm thirsty.

498
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:34,040
Very small valence of interest then motivates me to get up and move and to do it. And I suppose that does involve something to do with the dopamine that's going through my brain.

499
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:44,040
I was also interested in the whole idea of the sort of default mode network, which hasn't been mentioned so far, which is sort of a background activity in the brain.

500
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:52,040
And it's interesting to note in keeping with our talk about boredom not being a passive state.

501
00:50:52,040 --> 00:51:07,040
And again, I want to be careful not to equate boredom to the default mode network, but the default mode network, which is sort of how our brain seems to be functioning the network connections between parts of our brain when we're idle, is also not a very passive thing.

502
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:14,040
And that's part of the thing that's interesting about it. It's actually an active state that needs to be sustained in some fashion.

503
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:24,040
And so I know that then switching from that idle state to a more, you know, a salient state where things become interesting and I might want to choose to do X, Y, or Z.

504
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:32,040
That's an important area, right? And I think we have to carefully imagine where might boredom fit in there in that paradigm.

505
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:43,040
There's actually some research on that. There's not very much, but, you know, I think one of the areas that's really exciting is looking for the neural and the physiological signatures of boredom.

506
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:56,040
So you've already mentioned the default mode network, which is active when you're sort of at rest or when you're engaged in internal thought and internal reverie, and the central executive network when you're engaged with kind of tasks in the world, right?

507
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:08,040
And trying to figure out, you know, something in front of me. And certainly when you are bored, the default mode network is more active than when you are engaged in some activity.

508
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:18,040
But importantly, you know, there was a study done by a colleague of mine, James Dankert, at the University of Waterloo, where they compared someone in a bored state versus a resting state.

509
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:33,040
And there is a difference, right? So the insular cortex is another part of the brain that is thought, amongst other things, to be involved in helping you toggle back and forth between the default mode network and the central executive network,

510
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:38,040
and is also responsible for tagging saliency in our environment.

511
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:53,040
And so I'm going well beyond the data in my interpretation here, and this is only one study, but one way of interpreting this is that the person is having a hard time shifting out of the default mode network into the central executive.

512
00:52:53,040 --> 00:53:03,040
So there's this kind of, you're stuck where you can't disengage from the one and engage in the other neural network.

513
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:12,040
So, indeed, you know, just to summarize, the default mode network is quite centrally involved in boredom, but it's not equivalent with boredom.

514
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,040
There's some very important distinctions.

515
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:25,040
In fact, external movements are so very different when you are bored. Sometimes you're young. It's totally different.

516
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:34,040
There's a thought actually yawning. I read something about yawning being involved in this toggling. Did I make that up? Or do you know whether I don't know?

517
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:45,040
I think I saw some reference where they mentioned that yawning actually helps someone sort of switch out of the default mode network, which is just perfectly in keeping with what you're saying.

518
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:57,040
So when I think about curiosity, again, with very little data, but the way I imagine this, so if the default mode network is engaged in resting state and it's involved in mind wandering, all kinds of mind wandering.

519
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:11,040
So people, when they don't do anything, people do stuff. Usually, there's studies that probe the thoughts, and usually you're planning stuff on most of the time, and sometimes it's other things like singing songs or reciting stuff.

520
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:29,040
Okay, so that's associated with the default mode network, but that's a resting state which is not boring. So if you can, so the way I imagine this working is that if you can engage your default mode network together with your memories and somehow engage the reward system, then you're happy.

521
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:37,040
You're in a good mental state, but there must be some other state where you're resting and you can't engage that whole network and then you're not happy.

522
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:48,040
I agree well put, it's sort of what I was trying to get at is you're in between the two. You can't get into one mode. You can't activate one neural network fully or the other.

523
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:56,040
And so, you know, I do see mind wandering to be a consequence of boredom in situations where you're constrained and you can't leave.

524
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:02,040
You know, you might mind wander as a way to engage your cognitive resources and therefore to not be bored.

525
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:15,040
And when you're able to do that, then you just see default mode network. But when you're being told you have to pay attention to this and you don't really want to and you're trying to daydream at the same time, it all gets all gets bungled up.

526
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,040
That is interesting.

527
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,040
Then there's an interesting answer where you become interested in what your mind's wandering over.

528
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,040
Sure.

529
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,040
And that becomes salient in of itself.

530
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,040
Sure.

531
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,040
And what is that exactly?

532
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,040
And how does the brain adapt or respond in those circumstances?

533
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:40,040
Because I think people who are creative almost certainly are, you know, sort of riffing off these sort of mind wandering, you know, events and then paying attention to it and developing it.

534
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,040
And it's interesting.

535
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:56,040
And I think on, you know, just maybe this is shifting the topic a little bit, but I'd be very interested to hear what you think about this in terms of curiosity, you know, because there's a psychologist that talked to use this term constructive internal reflection.

536
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:03,040
And she was referring to that mind wandering state when you are kind of riffing and that creativity is happening.

537
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:10,040
And I think what happens with boredom is we often go to the external world for salvation, right?

538
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,040
We're for relief.

539
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:19,040
And I think that short circuits the capacity to develop that constructive internal reflection as a skill or as an ability.

540
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,040
And a resource.

541
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,040
Yeah.

542
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:33,040
And I think culturally we're in a culture right now where our attention is being yanked around by the collar from all these exogenous demands, right?

543
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,040
Look here, do this.

544
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:42,040
I mean, standing in Times Square, you know, from the big town of Toronto and Times Square is overwhelming, right?

545
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,040
And your attention is just drawn everywhere.

546
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:54,040
And what happens is that capacity for constructive internal reflection or for endogenous control of attention can sort of atrophy.

547
00:56:54,040 --> 00:57:03,040
And I think boredom can maybe push us to seek out that external stimulation as a short-term solution to our problems,

548
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:10,040
but in the long term it may actually end up really making the situation worse, you know?

549
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:19,040
And so I think that's what you're saying about creativity and about that internal reflection being adaptive kind of pulls it together, right?

550
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,040
That's right.

551
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:30,040
Well, maybe because part of it is to, you know, if you can focus on one thing that's calling for your attention or if you're bored and you focus on one response to it in a creative way,

552
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:35,040
that does imply some kind of engagement and depth that you have to then go into,

553
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,040
whereas if it's the Times Square model, you can't.

554
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:43,040
You know, you start moving in one direction, but then there's this other thing calling you there and you never really go anywhere.

555
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:48,040
There's no, there's no attention really paid. It's just constantly, I mean, the question is, do you get bored in Times Square?

556
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,040
Yeah.

557
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,040
Shall I open it to questions?

558
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,040
Yes.

559
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:03,040
Just follow each other in one of the other.

560
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:13,040
Dr. Rees would be happy to know that you got me thinking, but it was something I was irritated about.

561
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:21,040
But then you changed it a little bit and I think that it was a target.

562
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:31,040
It was the word you used first, looking for the right word, and you would say the word unengaged.

563
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,040
And the grammatical word is disengaged, right?

564
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:46,040
And disengaged, for me, carries an ethical aspect to it.

565
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:51,040
If a patient would say to me that they were bored,

566
00:58:51,040 --> 00:59:01,040
is there something that you want to do that would be engaged, engage you?

567
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,040
You know, save the world, help your family, you know, something like that.

568
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:15,040
In other words, it's key to taking some kind of action and actions have ethical aspects.

569
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:23,040
But I'm very glad that you, and not only that everybody started using that term, being engaged,

570
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:32,040
which is a very different than something which is neurological, essentially neurological.

571
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,040
So could you comment on that?

572
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:43,040
I'm glad you brought that up and I think there's a really important idea here that's fairly complicated, right?

573
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,040
And there's a number of elements to your comment, to your question.

574
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:53,040
Engaged is a description of my relationship with something else, right?

575
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:58,040
So I'm engaged with this or I'm not engaged with it and it's action oriented, like you said,

576
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:03,040
and as you said, it contains ethical implications, you know, what I choose to engage with

577
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:07,040
or whether I commit myself to something or not.

578
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:14,040
So unengaged is a description of sort of my cognitive resources and they are not being utilized.

579
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,040
The way to utilize them would be to become engaged.

580
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:24,040
But I think it's important for me to define boredom in a context-free way.

581
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:32,040
Because if you try to define it in a way that is linked to disengagement,

582
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,040
then you need the context to define the state.

583
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:45,040
But if you define the state as this unengaged state, then it is a definition that sort of transcends the context.

584
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:52,040
Having said that, I think I would agree with all of your points about the ethical connotations of this topic

585
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:59,040
and the importance of seeing the solution through engagement.

586
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:06,040
Thank you. My name is Ronald Alvas from the Paris Analytica,

587
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:11,040
Skarnelikus Society, and I apologize for my English.

588
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:17,040
So I have one comment and one question for Mr. Polisotti.

589
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:27,040
I'd like to emphasize the importance of time when we speak of boredom,

590
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,040
Brodsky's invasion of time.

591
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:37,040
And this preoccupation of time goes and about to avoid boredom

592
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,040
goes far beyond the enlightenment.

593
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:48,040
I don't know if you know about Palatsos Kifanoia in Ferrara.

594
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:56,800
It's a beautiful story because Duke of Ferrara in Italy,

595
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:02,960
the family Deste, one of the dukes in the 14th century

596
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,200
built a new palace.

597
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,880
And he called it Palazzo Schifanoia.

598
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:16,640
Schifanoia in Italian is Esquivare La Noya,

599
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:21,080
which is to avoid the boredom.

600
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,800
And he commissioned two painters of the Renaissance

601
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:32,480
to paint a frescoes on the walls of a room,

602
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,240
which is called El Sello to the Amazie,

603
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,880
the room of the month.

604
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,440
Because these two painters, the Francesco de la Cosa

605
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,800
and Cosmetura, which are a very important painters

606
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:51,280
of the Renaissance, they painted the month of a year.

607
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,880
So it's about time.

608
01:02:52,880 --> 01:03:01,560
They painted this appropriation of the boredom,

609
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:05,400
led them to a creation, a statistical creation,

610
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,400
of representing the time.

611
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,800
That's my first comment.

612
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,120
And the time is also important because it's

613
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:21,320
maybe could link us to Melancholia and the Melancholia

614
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:28,160
to engage mentally through things.

615
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:36,080
But for example, our patients, very often,

616
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,480
they are not able to engage because they're not

617
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:43,160
able to, they're not capacity for cateches.

618
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,280
And that's also about boredom.

619
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,920
Time is everything in boredom.

620
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,440
Is everything.

621
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,600
So it's a relationship.

622
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,120
Just pay attention to the war in German.

623
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,720
Lang Bile on the opposite cooks.

624
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,520
Bile.

625
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,720
Lang Bile?

626
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,560
The time is long.

627
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,280
It doesn't pass.

628
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:06,560
It's the subjective impression that the time is not passing.

629
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:10,920
And sometimes the feeling we are experiencing when we are bored

630
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:15,680
is because we feel bad of spending our time

631
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,360
in doing anything or time passes.

632
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:23,560
And the question for you is, as a translator of Gustav

633
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,240
Flaubert, could you say some words on Madame Bovari?

634
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,240
Mm-hmm.

635
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:28,760
Fire.

636
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,760
Mm-hmm.

637
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,960
Just what you heard is the word that you did.

638
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:40,160
Well, if we speak about boredom, we can't avoid Madame Bovari.

639
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,160
Mm-hmm.

640
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:47,840
I mean, I suppose the simplest one could say is that she's

641
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,600
a good case study and the self-destructive behavior,

642
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,760
the one can indulge in if one is bored.

643
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,760
Mm-hmm.

644
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,680
In French psychiatry, the term Bovari, I don't know

645
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:05,920
if you use it in America, it's a very particular kind of boredom.

646
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:06,920
Mm-hmm.

647
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,920
Mm-hmm.

648
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,880
Boredom in satisfaction.

649
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,800
In the sense that there's something sort of a grasses,

650
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:17,280
always greener kind of a sense that there's this ideal out there

651
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,240
that can be attained and, in fact, doesn't really exist.

652
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,680
You also wrote up something that told me to hold you up.

653
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,440
But you brought up one thing that I actually, we might not

654
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,440
have time to touch on here.

655
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,800
But I'd be curious at some point to know

656
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,160
what the scientists and the philosophers think

657
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,440
of the relationship between boredom and depression.

658
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,600
Because it seems to me that you alluded to this,

659
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,280
that those two also have a connection.

660
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,640
And that boredom and depression might be maybe

661
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,760
two sides over the same coin.

662
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,560
I don't know.

663
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,560
It's a, I was in this.

664
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,120
Sure, yeah.

665
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,200
I mean, in reference to that, I was about the zag.

666
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:56,200
I don't mean it whatsoever to reduce what you said so well

667
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,800
to discussions of neurotransmitters and such.

668
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,200
But there is a nice correspondence

669
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:07,520
here which is related to the way time is perceived in people

670
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,960
based on their sort of how much dopamine

671
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,160
we have sort of coursing through our veins.

672
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,800
And you know, the most famous case of someone

673
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,320
having a very long, low amount of dopamine

674
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,520
are people with Parkinson's disease who are almost

675
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,000
like moving in slow motion, right?

676
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,520
Their time is much slowed and their time senses

677
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,960
is changed as well.

678
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,240
And that's very interesting.

679
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,360
Depression, of course, has all sorts of effects

680
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,400
and all different neurotransmitters in the brain

681
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,800
when one is depressed.

682
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:39,440
But one of the changes, again, is an effect on dopamine levels.

683
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,840
Some people, especially elderly patients,

684
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,480
when they become depressed, they can actually

685
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,480
appear somewhat Parkinsonian, who you say,

686
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,880
because their dopamine levels have dropped sufficiently

687
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,280
for that to be manifest.

688
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,360
And so there is the same issue if dopamine is

689
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:58,840
the sort of the stimulus, let's say,

690
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,840
that makes us move here or there or elsewhere.

691
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,800
And when that is at low ebb, we don't have that

692
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,360
to sort of guide us forward.

693
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,640
And that doesn't mean our desires or wishes are gone.

694
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,400
And that's important.

695
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,400
And I think because they're not gone,

696
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,040
that may be a recipe for feeling bored, right?

697
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,440
But Andrea had a question.

698
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,960
And so you mentioned the distinction between boredom

699
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,760
and apathy.

700
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,560
So it seems to me that you could be depressed.

701
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,640
And I don't know if this is true.

702
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,280
So you could be depressed and not, I mean,

703
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,440
be so apathetic that you're actually not bored.

704
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,400
Because you don't want, can't even imagine,

705
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,600
don't even want to get out of this state.

706
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,200
Because you don't, right?

707
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,800
And whereas boredom could actually

708
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,080
be an improvement of that.

709
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:44,040
It's a desire to, you know, experience something else.

710
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:44,880
You hit it perfectly.

711
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,040
And that's right.

712
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,360
They very much do overlap.

713
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:51,280
It's a very common bit of confusion for family members

714
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,200
and caregivers to people with Parkinson's, for example,

715
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,440
that they think of them that they're depressed.

716
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,440
Just because they are so apathetic.

717
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,960
And so there are pure forms of apathy

718
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,680
where there's no boredom involved.

719
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,040
They have no wishes.

720
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,800
And then there's sort of, it could shade from one to the other.

721
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,320
And you're, again, correct.

722
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,040
If you move towards feeling a restless sort of boredom,

723
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,840
that's a movement in the right direction.

724
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,640
Yeah. It seems that we use the word boredom very,

725
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,640
likely very easily.

726
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,400
That's right.

727
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,320
In all different ways.

728
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,560
Yeah.

729
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,960
There's so much more that could be said about boredom

730
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:26,520
and depression.

731
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,480
So I won't get into that.

732
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:32,360
But they are very much linked developmentally across time.

733
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,400
The time is a really important point,

734
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,680
which we didn't talk about today.

735
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,760
But, you know, it is part of the definition

736
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,120
that phenomenological feeling of the slow passage of time.

737
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,720
And we've already heard about the relationship

738
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,760
between dopamine and the perception of time

739
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,480
passing.

740
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:51,400
We also know that cognitively, when you are not engaged,

741
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,560
there's a sense of time passing slowly as well.

742
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,200
And so we know that boredom prone people

743
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,680
don't judge the passage of time well.

744
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,240
And in our studies, when we try to manipulate and make people

745
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,760
bored, we rig the passage of time

746
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,960
as one of our variables to try to change that.

747
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,960
And then there's time.

748
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,720
But then there's things happening in that time, too, right?

749
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,640
And so you can think about boredom

750
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,200
as sort of everything is happening at that moment.

751
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,400
And nothing is about to happen, right?

752
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:24,560
And so you think about the difference

753
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,560
between art versus sort of pornography or propaganda, right?

754
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,600
And in propaganda, pornography, it's all there.

755
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,800
What you see is what you get.

756
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,480
There's nothing more, whereas art kind of draws you in.

757
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,320
There's that sense of walking through the garden.

758
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,840
And as you turn a corner, a new vista

759
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,000
presents itself, a new possibility.

760
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,880
And in boredom, that stops, right?

761
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,200
That possibility of more stops.

762
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,160
So there's time.

763
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:53,000
But then there's also what is happening within that time

764
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,200
that's important to think about.

765
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:59,040
Ema vu vaire was not depressed.

766
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,240
Was for stavid.

767
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,240
It was.

768
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,240
It was.

769
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,240
Yeah.

770
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:07,640
Conversation has been anything but boring.

771
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:10,360
Two quick questions in a quick comment.

772
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,920
Wondering about mindfulness and meditation

773
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:16,680
and the effect on being boredom.

774
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:20,040
The second question is, are curious people less bored

775
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:25,120
and can curiosity be in fact an antidote to boredom?

776
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,360
And the third is just a pedestrian definition

777
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,760
of perhaps boredom is just the nanosecond

778
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,040
before we reach for our phones.

779
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:32,560
So.

780
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,560
Yeah.

781
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,560
Yeah.

782
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,560
These things.

783
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,560
Nanobordum.

784
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,160
That would be a nanobordum.

785
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,160
Microbordum.

786
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:43,040
I can say a few things about those questions.

787
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,880
On the issue about mindfulness, there's a little bit of research

788
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,480
on mindfulness and boredom.

789
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,640
And as you would expect, people that are high in trait

790
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,400
mindfulness or people who regularly practice mindfulness

791
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,040
meditation when put in a vigilance task or a sustained

792
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,120
attention task, which is very, very boring.

793
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,920
Trust me.

794
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,000
We just have to watch a computer screen for a rare kind of event

795
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,480
that may happen and then press a button.

796
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,680
People that are high in trait mindfulness

797
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:16,680
experience less boredom and less discomfort and less

798
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:22,960
agitation during those kinds of potentially boring situations.

799
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:30,280
So indeed, mindfulness prevents or protects one from boredom.

800
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:33,600
And there's some open questions about precisely why.

801
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,560
One idea is that mindfulness actually

802
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,760
results in the strengthening of a tensional capacity

803
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,400
so that you then can attend more effectively.

804
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,040
But there's also the idea that mindfulness

805
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,200
may make you less emotionally reactive

806
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,640
to the state of being under aroused.

807
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,320
And we just have one study that we haven't published yet

808
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,160
where we're looking at this.

809
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,880
And so far, the data seems to be more

810
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,200
consistent with the idea that mindfulness

811
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,240
has its beneficial effects via that emotional reactivity

812
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:05,960
pathway not through an increasing attention capacity.

813
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,600
So they're definitely related.

814
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,480
And curiosity, yeah, do you want to speak to that issue?

815
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:15,880
Yeah, so I think it all goes back to this.

816
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,520
So yes, I would definitely think that more curious people

817
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,400
are less bored.

818
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,960
And I think it all goes back to this idea

819
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,160
of being able to generate questions.

820
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:31,640
So the key about curiosity is the way we think it works

821
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:38,360
is that you encounter a situation that triggers

822
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,200
a bunch of hypotheses in your mind.

823
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,280
What could be happening here?

824
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,840
It could be XYZ.

825
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:47,840
And then it's the willingness to engage and answer the question.

826
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,400
That's how it works.

827
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,920
So in a sense, it goes back to the same thing

828
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,360
as being able to generate mental activity, which

829
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,040
is then very satisfying.

830
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,480
So answering those questions is very rewarding.

831
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,840
It goes back to those internal rewards that I think

832
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,800
fuels human civilization.

833
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,120
If we didn't have curiosity, we'd still

834
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,200
be back in the caves, I think.

835
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:13,240
But anyway, so yes, so it's exactly the antithesis.

836
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:18,560
And I think of boredom, I guess, as the failure in some way

837
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,280
to trigger that mental activity.

838
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:26,880
I would add, I'm hoping that your John's last interpretation

839
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,240
of how mindfulness might work.

840
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,760
I actually don't know if it's true, but I like that.

841
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,840
I agree with it.

842
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,960
That is that if you feel more comfortable managing

843
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,280
the state of being idle-minded, let's say,

844
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,760
and not get tense and stressed about it,

845
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,040
and actually think I can master it,

846
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,480
that might be a way also to master being

847
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,840
able to focus your attention when

848
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:53,040
you want to be able to focus it, not getting anxious about it.

849
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,080
I think to the other topic we didn't talk on very much,

850
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,680
it relates to your comment or your question about curiosity,

851
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,160
is that I think this is something

852
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:04,280
all educators would really say, yes, a big thumbs up.

853
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:07,280
We want to be able to cultivate curiosity in people.

854
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,520
And how do we go about that?

855
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,600
What are the different mechanisms by which we do it?

856
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,320
And I think art and science and literature

857
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:18,520
are our most common ways that we try to do that with people.

858
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,080
And I think there's proof that it works.

859
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,240
Yeah, so emotional reactivity is very important.

860
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,360
And there are some studies on that.

861
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,920
It actually affects memory.

862
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,440
They're direct studies on memory.

863
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,800
So the way that you remember an item or an event

864
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,600
depends on the circumstances.

865
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,560
So in the laboratory, we can motivate memory, for example,

866
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,320
by rewards or by avoiding punishments.

867
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,200
We can put somebody in a task.

868
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,920
And it's been shown that the encoding of information

869
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,560
differs in those two contexts.

870
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,680
So if you're motivated by rewards,

871
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,840
you encode more incidental information.

872
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:01,040
There's more a richer context that's being stored.

873
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,760
Whereas motivation by punishment, which presumably

874
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,440
induces anxiety, narrows the focus.

875
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,800
It's interesting because all of these

876
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,840
seem to be positive without being too systematic about it,

877
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,240
a dividing line in which on the one hand

878
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,400
you have boredom and anxiety.

879
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:22,240
And it goes back to the example of the kid

880
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,320
who can't get the math.

881
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,040
So he gets bored with the study of math

882
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,280
because he's afraid.

883
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,840
He's anxious about it.

884
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,240
Versus curiosity and ease, curiosity and comfort,

885
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,440
which is that when you are more comfortable with the state

886
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,240
of not doing anything and having to focus your attention

887
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,840
in a way that many people might find boring,

888
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,160
you're actually a less bored by it.

889
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,040
There's kind of, again, a sort of a reward

890
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,040
of self-fulfillment that comes from those activities.

891
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:54,040
Thank you all very much for this.

892
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:59,040
I'm a person who qualifies as essentially very bored.

893
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,040
My name is Nancy Garnier, I'm a musician,

894
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,040
and performing and teaching.

895
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:11,040
My memory as a child was an incredible boredom,

896
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,040
except when I was playing the piano mostly fooling around.

897
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:20,040
And when I was about 12, I hit on something in a book

898
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,040
by a composer.

899
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,040
I knew nothing about anything my family

900
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,040
was not into classical music at all.

901
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:30,040
It turned out it was within a sonata by Mozart.

902
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:33,040
It wasn't the piece, it was specific sounds

903
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:38,040
within that piece that just blew my mind.

904
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,040
I thought, oh, there's been a person in the world

905
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:46,040
who hears as I hear.

906
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:50,040
I then subsequently found that the field of music

907
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:54,040
was not at all interested in that quality of hearing,

908
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:59,040
that rather, it was assumed that people heard a certain way.

909
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,040
I don't believe that's true, I still don't believe that,

910
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,040
that's true.

911
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:09,040
I believe that this power of shared intensity

912
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:13,040
is epitomized in the action of hearing.

913
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,040
It's become my life's work, in fact.

914
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:22,040
The thing that has meant most to me in putting together

915
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:27,040
my incredible capacity for boredom and the intensity

916
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:31,040
of my reaction to specific sounds was measured

917
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:35,040
by A. James Huddspeth at Rockefeller University

918
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:40,040
who found out that there are 16,000 moving hair cells

919
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:46,040
over here in your cochlea and 16,000 over there

920
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:49,040
and that they impart information to the brain

921
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:54,040
200 times faster than any other sense perception.

922
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:59,040
When I tell this to a child, a student who's eight years old,

923
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:04,040
they call me, wow, and there's no possible way

924
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,040
they can get bored.

925
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,040
None, it's gone.

926
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,040
There's so much happening.

927
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:14,040
It just totally transformed my ability to take in

928
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:18,040
all kinds of information, from disabled students to,

929
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,040
I don't know, all kinds of people.

930
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:25,040
Anyway, I've joined the Society for Music Cognition,

931
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,040
Music Perception and Cognition, to my astonishment.

932
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:33,040
They have bought into this kind of

933
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:36,040
mangle ironed approach to listening.

934
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:40,040
So the examples they study are all recorded.

935
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,040
They've all been listened to a million times.

936
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,040
They're all, it's like canned green beans.

937
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,040
It's such a massive disappointment to me.

938
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:52,040
I just throw out to you if you're studying boredom

939
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:57,040
to consider the dynamic of hearing

940
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:03,040
and how it can inform vision.

941
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:07,040
Usually it's the reverse, that vision is used to kind of

942
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,040
quiet the hearing down, so it won't be so intense.

943
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,040
Is that a question?

944
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,040
I don't know, I hope it's a question.

945
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:17,040
Well, it's certainly an inspiring story.

946
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,040
Now, I'll say this about what you said.

947
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,040
I don't know if this is so.

948
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,040
I'd ask you more questions to find out.

949
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,040
But, no, I think you brought up something very interesting

950
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:28,040
about having an experience of a shared experience

951
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:32,040
played such an important role in unlocking your feeling of curiosity.

952
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,040
Because you said, oh, someone heard this

953
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,040
and intended it the way I hear things.

954
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:40,040
And that idea of empathy, obviously played a role.

955
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:43,040
And I think that's why the best teachers are often the ones

956
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,040
who in part are feeling of empathy in their students.

957
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,040
I think it also brings up, you know,

958
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:51,040
this without any scientific basis to say so,

959
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,040
that to me instinctively it makes perfect sense that people

960
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:57,040
hear things different ways and that it does bring up what I think

961
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,040
we were touching on before about, you know,

962
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:03,040
part of curiosity or boredom has to do also with personal response.

963
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:06,040
You know, the same reason that someone could be very moved by Mozart

964
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,040
and someone else could be very moved by Ozzy Osborn.

965
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,040
And, you know, who's to say that it's,

966
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,040
who's to say that there's a, you know, a wrong or a right answer there?

967
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,040
It just depends on.

968
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,040
Oh, okay.

969
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,040
I won't get a mama answer.

970
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:20,040
Yeah, so let me give, I want to give a little perspective

971
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:25,040
because you mentioned studies of the year, of the cochlea and so on.

972
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,040
So in neuroscience, again, I think this is,

973
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:33,040
this, I come back to this topic of how early we are in neuroscience

974
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,040
because, I mean, there's a magic to all the senses.

975
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,040
I mean, vision is incredibly rich.

976
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:42,040
Or faction is incredibly rich, hearing as well.

977
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:47,040
But in neuroscience, we study them separately, just like you said,

978
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,040
in the field of music and cognition.

979
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:54,040
We study the receptors as just engineering systems input

980
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,040
and how things are represented.

981
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,040
And then when we study other things like emotions and decision making,

982
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:04,040
that's a different topic, like a different world, different people.

983
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:08,040
And clearly there's an enormous interface there because the way

984
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:11,040
much of our pleasure comes from interacting with the world

985
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:17,040
and there's enormous variability there and how people sense and hear things

986
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:22,040
and the emotion, anyway, all of that is totally unexplored.

987
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:27,040
I was just going to say one other thing about the other thing I heard in your story there

988
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:32,040
was the importance, I would call that, of sort of doing ecologically valid research, right?

989
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:35,040
And so you know the joke about, you know, you come into the parking lot

990
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,040
and there's the drunk looking for his keys under the lamp post, you know,

991
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,040
and you say, well, what are you doing? I'm looking for my keys.

992
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,040
Well, where'd you lose them over there? Why are you looking here?

993
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,040
Because the light's better.

994
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:50,040
And so, you know, I think a lot of science can be characterized in that manner, right?

995
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:53,040
Yeah, of course you are.

996
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:57,040
So, you know, I hold that, but I still hold my earlier comments

997
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,040
about our need for more precision, right? And so it's a balance.

998
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,040
It's a balancing act. But thank you for your story.

999
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,040
I have one more real quick comment about what you said.

1000
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:09,040
I don't know the author. What is a recent study of infants

1001
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:14,040
that showed that they observed the effort being made by their parents

1002
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:17,040
doing some tasks, some tasks that might be frustrating.

1003
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:22,040
And the infants saw the difference between the parents making the effort or not.

1004
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:25,040
I don't know how they measured the outcome, but there was some sort of outcome.

1005
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,040
This is in nature. It was not an obscure journal or anything like that.

1006
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,040
But it was interesting that how, you know, that idea of empathy and that,

1007
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:36,040
oh, that's important to someone else, important to me.

1008
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:40,040
So that must be important. And as a way of engendering curiosity,

1009
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:43,040
you can see that be rather potent.

1010
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:49,040
I want to add my thanks to all of you for such an interesting conversation.

1011
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:56,040
I live in this neighborhood in which there are a lot of children of working parents,

1012
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:03,040
a number of whom have wherewithal, and increasingly children go to school

1013
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,040
after school have a lot of activities that are assigned,

1014
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:15,040
gymnastics, art, whatever. It's sort of like little channels.

1015
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:21,040
And in between, I've observed, they will say, I'm bored when one activity is over.

1016
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:29,040
I'm bored. As if they say to members around, as if that's their responsibility

1017
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:35,040
to find how it should be resolved.

1018
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:40,040
And I wondered, you had mentioned internal reflection.

1019
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:47,040
What happens to that in that kind of a situation where you're not allowed to be bored,

1020
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:52,040
or it quickly has to be resolved, whereas in other times,

1021
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:59,040
children were left supposedly to their own, you know, finding their own answers to these things?

1022
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:05,040
One metaphor that might speak to that from George Simmel, a sociologist, many years ago,

1023
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,040
we talked about the relationship between technology and boredom,

1024
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,040
and how they collude with one another. We're hearing lots about collusion,

1025
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:17,040
so the idea that boredom and technology collude, and on this particular issue,

1026
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:22,040
the idea is that using technology is like falling into a fast-moving river

1027
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:26,040
where you can forget how to swim. The river carries you along,

1028
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:31,040
and you don't even need to know how to swim anymore. You just, before you know it, you're downstream.

1029
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:38,040
And so I would use that metaphor to communicate the idea that if your time is structured exogenously,

1030
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:46,040
if your attention is directed exogenously, the capacity to endogenously direct your attention may atrophy.

1031
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:51,040
Now, I can't say this based on any kind of research finding at this point,

1032
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:57,040
but this is certainly something that we're trying to see if we can bring under the lamp post of science

1033
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:00,040
to see if we can kind of actually quantify that sort of effect.

1034
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:03,040
What loss is there? I mean, what happens then?

1035
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:10,040
It's, I mean, to put it very metaphorically, it's like a skill that atrophies.

1036
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:14,040
When we're born, we have a hard time directing our attention, right?

1037
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:20,040
Our attention is very much stimulus bound. There's a, you know, a rattle over here, you know,

1038
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:27,040
and then it takes some development for us to be able to disengage from that and to engage in internal reflection.

1039
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,040
And so this is a skill that needs to be taught and needs to be developed,

1040
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:35,040
and I think the excessive use of technology may short circuit opportunities to develop that skill.

1041
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:41,040
And it's not only technology. I mean, I completely agree, and I think, you know, I hear what you're saying about those children,

1042
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:47,040
and I see it a lot myself. You know, we are not in a society that actually fosters that sense of self-reliance,

1043
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:55,040
and the beneficial effects of being bored, i.e., using your own devices to mentally come out of that state

1044
01:25:55,040 --> 01:26:01,040
and to actually use it to some kind of positive, you know, that creative capacity that we were talking about earlier on.

1045
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:06,040
You know, standing in the subway, I try to read when I'm in the subway, but there are announcements all the time

1046
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:10,040
that have nothing to do with anything. There are people talking, you know, there's just, you're constantly stimulated.

1047
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:14,040
When I was in, when I was in, when I lived in Boston, there was this one moment that,

1048
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:20,040
thank goodness, only lasted about a week. It was an experiment, and I think they must have gotten a lot of complaints

1049
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:26,040
where they suddenly started blasting music on the platform so that, God forbid, you should be bored for two seconds

1050
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:32,040
or actually, you know, alone with your thoughts while waiting for the train to come, and I was thinking, you know,

1051
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:36,040
I want my thoughts. I want a little bit of quiet. I want to actually find out what's going on in there.

1052
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:41,040
That's like going into a doctor's office where they're playing some kind of medical TV or something.

1053
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:45,040
Exactly. That's right. And blasting, usually. So you can't even, yeah.

1054
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:50,040
And this also slides into the ethical issue, right, about who controls the focus of our attention, right?

1055
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:57,040
And who controls what's in the focus of our attention and have we given that up, right?

1056
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:01,040
Have we willingly kind of just said, well, okay, you get to control it.

1057
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,040
Right.

1058
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:16,040
Along the way, I feel I was taught in the clinical situation to look at boredom as a defense or as a way of avoiding or not feeling

1059
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:23,040
some other affective state, whether it's depression, anxiety, annoyance, anger.

1060
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:30,040
I think fear of death and anxiety about death may be present in everything we talked about about time.

1061
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:34,040
We don't have that much time. We're worried about losing it.

1062
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:42,040
And then in the clinical situation also, I was taught, Ted Jacobs was one of the great teachers in this,

1063
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:49,040
that to use my own sense of boredom when patients are obsessively going on about something that's not important to them,

1064
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:55,040
to try to bring them back to the things that are important by pointing out their areas of defense

1065
01:27:55,040 --> 01:28:00,040
and get them to. And what usually happens is once people start talking about something important,

1066
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:03,040
they're again, become alive and all of that.

1067
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:06,040
And this thing, I was thinking about Eric Handel with the Applesia, you know.

1068
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:10,040
You hit the snout, first time the Applesia is really excited about all this.

1069
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:15,040
You hit the snout 20 times after, well, please give me something else.

1070
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:21,040
You know, if it's killing the Applesia, it's probably not that good.

1071
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:25,040
But we haven't, maybe Ed could talk more about this,

1072
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:31,040
and how this comes up in the clinical situation and how people use their own boredom,

1073
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:35,040
understanding of their patient's boredom, and then this question of,

1074
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,040
is boredom related to some pathological interior state?

1075
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:45,040
If you're very healthy and you're always curious and all of that, you don't get bored unless somebody else annoys you

1076
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:50,040
with their narcissism. But anyway, discussion of this.

1077
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:53,040
Want to give it?

1078
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:59,040
No, I have to remind my email that I have to put my own way of dealing with it.

1079
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,040
Try to always put it in the process of doing it.

1080
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,040
Yeah.

1081
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,040
There is a second.

1082
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:15,040
I think it would be, if there is this sort of, if there is, if it's so,

1083
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:21,040
if there is sort of this toggling back and forth between just sort of our minds being kind of empty,

1084
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:31,040
and then taking action, if that's a reasonable metaphor or a paradigm for what we do when we get curious or fieldboard.

1085
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:39,040
I think one of the mechanisms that may stymie that would be thwarted wishes or that sort of goes back to the psychoanalytic model of it.

1086
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:47,040
If the person has an act, there's an act they have in mind, usually unconsciously, but sometimes, not always unconsciously,

1087
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:51,040
and they can't act it sort of like Hamlet, they dither and they say, I'm bored.

1088
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,040
And I, well, you know, in so many words.

1089
01:29:54,040 --> 01:30:02,040
And it could also lead to depression because of the lack of attaining goals and the loss that may come as a consequence.

1090
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,040
There are all sorts of ramifications.

1091
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,040
But I think that, where's the action?

1092
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,040
Why is the action not taking place?

1093
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:15,040
By the way, the thing about action may have to do with whether you're from the Eastern way of thinking or the Western way of thinking.

1094
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:28,040
A lot of these issues like mindfulness and how comfortable people are within their skins may be different in cultures where they're trying to reduce desire rather than just get them satisfied.

1095
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:34,040
Well, but what's interesting about Eastern traditions, though, they're not, they don't say don't take action.

1096
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,040
They're saying don't have desires.

1097
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:40,040
And that's an important difference. So they actually do have a sense of action being important.

1098
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,040
Yeah.

1099
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:48,040
One of the things you started with was that boredom was the desire for desire.

1100
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:53,040
But there's also this rejection of the options on offer.

1101
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:59,040
Like for a child who's on board, will go out and swing or stay in and play with your cars.

1102
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:04,040
Things that were engaging yesterday and will be engaging again tomorrow,

1103
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:10,040
for some reason are failing to capture that attention at this particular time.

1104
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:20,040
And the physical pain of a hot stove will always be the same, whereas this attentional pain of boredom can vary.

1105
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:23,040
So I was just wondering what your thoughts on that were.

1106
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,040
Yeah.

1107
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:28,040
Can you just expand your last point there about the physical pain and the potential pain?

1108
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:34,040
So a hot stove always gives you the signal that's something you should avoid.

1109
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:40,040
But a day in which you're not interested in the things that have been interesting and will be interesting again

1110
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:44,040
are giving you this boredom signal, this attentional pain.

1111
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,040
Right.

1112
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:48,040
That doesn't happen every single time.

1113
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:54,040
Right. But I would say when the signal does happen, it's pushing you to find engagement either with what you were doing

1114
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:58,040
that may have in the past engaged you or something else.

1115
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:01,040
But your first point maybe speaks to this.

1116
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:04,040
I'm not sure come back to me if it doesn't.

1117
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:09,040
But indeed, the boredom is this desire for an actionable desire.

1118
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:14,040
And the flip side of that is to say what is is not okay.

1119
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,040
Right.

1120
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:19,040
So when you're bored, there is a rejection of the present moment.

1121
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:23,040
And it's sort of saying, I won't have this.

1122
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:26,040
Right. I won't commit to this. I won't engage with this.

1123
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,040
I won't have this.

1124
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:40,040
And the degree of sort of obstinents I guess can vary to some degree, you know, or is it driven by an oppositional stance

1125
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:44,040
or is it driven by a stance that I can't connect with it, you know.

1126
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:51,040
But I very much resonate with your idea that boredom, we talked about it in the positive, a desire for a desire,

1127
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,040
but there is an inverse side of that as well.

1128
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,040
And that's very much part of the phenomenology.

1129
01:32:55,040 --> 01:33:00,040
And I wonder too whether this doesn't shade into what you were saying about boredom moving toward frustration

1130
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:04,040
because there could be some sense of frustration that this was interesting to me yesterday.

1131
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:07,040
And now I can't get interested in what's going on here.

1132
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:12,040
Yeah. So I want to go into your comparison with pain.

1133
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:20,040
So, you know, there's a bit of a cognitive illusion here that if there is a stimulant that whatever we're,

1134
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:24,040
the world is, the way like we open our eyes and things are.

1135
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,040
And that's reality. That's given.

1136
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:33,040
But I think we fail to appreciate that unless our brains make a decision to engage.

1137
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:37,040
And if we don't engage with that, things are not really.

1138
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:44,040
So even the simple decision that I made a decision to engage with this part of the world and to ignore what's behind me,

1139
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:46,040
I think it's a bit the same thing.

1140
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:52,040
So just because you have that toy there today, it doesn't mean it's going to engage me in the same way.

1141
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:57,040
There's a very complex filter going on that determines my response to that toy.

1142
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:03,040
Now if things are stimuli that are really strong, like a hot stove or if somebody hits you on the head,

1143
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,040
you can engage with that.

1144
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:09,040
But that's a very small fraction of the information.

1145
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,040
And that's a good survival.

1146
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,040
Right.

1147
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:20,040
Yes, I see your point when you say that boredom is also a rejection of the possibilities.

1148
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:30,040
As I understand your point, yes, I totally agree because sometimes boredom is the result of,

1149
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:37,040
yeah, you simply are rejecting the possibilities that the environment is suffering you because

1150
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:45,040
how to say I'm trying to find the world are preplanned.

1151
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:53,040
So you previously expect what are the possibilities you know in advance.

1152
01:34:53,040 --> 01:35:00,040
So there is no novelty in the possibilities of the environment.

1153
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:08,040
Yeah, more or less all, this is the first point when you say boredom is a rejection of the possibilities.

1154
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:14,040
Not even necessarily a rejection, but perhaps even a failure of the stimuli to capture your attention.

1155
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,040
Oh, yeah.

1156
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,040
Yeah, I think you're right.

1157
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:21,040
You don't see the prospect of learning.

1158
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,040
You don't see the prospect of any new pattern.

1159
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:26,040
I think we're constantly looking for patterns in the brain.

1160
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:30,040
And if you don't see it coming, it's just not engaged.

1161
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:34,040
The choices themselves, the range of choice themselves can become hack need.

1162
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:38,040
You know, like, you know, these are the range of things I might do.

1163
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,040
And now I'm bored with that as well.

1164
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:41,040
Exactly.

1165
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:50,040
There is the point is there are not possibilities in which you can be engaged, but you know all of them.

1166
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:51,040
Right.

1167
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,040
So who they are going to.

1168
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,040
Right.

1169
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,040
Thank you for the discussion.

1170
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:58,040
It's really, really great.

1171
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:03,040
It's taken me by surprise because I didn't think that boredom would be such an interesting and fun topic.

1172
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:08,040
I'm just going to read my notes because they turned into questions.

1173
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:23,040
And so it would be, is boredom a state of which we perhaps are also not comfortable being with our state of being or being with ourself?

1174
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,040
Is it okay to be bored?

1175
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:49,040
And should it as such be encouraged among especially children to just be until any sort of engagement comes naturally and not as a suggestion or guidance or pressure of another who has perhaps an already preconceived notion of what boredom is for them?

1176
01:36:49,040 --> 01:37:07,040
And so can one allow their own experience to choose what they want to do and be and until that comes to be okay to be bored?

1177
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:17,040
On your first comment, your first question, I mean, it's a little bit, I mean Kierkegaard talked about boredom throwing you back into yourself.

1178
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,040
Right.

1179
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:32,040
And so that when we can't have that engagement with the world, that intentional stance towards the world, that something falls apart and we're left with nothing but ourselves.

1180
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:36,040
And that's a very kind of adverse of sort of state.

1181
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:40,040
So I do think that that first part of what you said makes a lot of sense.

1182
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:52,040
But I would suggest that we shouldn't be encouraging people to foster the state of boredom, as I said earlier, but we should be encouraging them to develop the capacity to be quiet, right?

1183
01:37:52,040 --> 01:38:02,040
To develop the capacity to be understimulated, to develop the capacity for that constructive internal reflection that we spoke about earlier.

1184
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:12,040
And I think that's not the same as being bored, right? That's being quiet and being with yourself.

1185
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:18,040
And I do think that that is something that needs to be fostered.

1186
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:31,040
But I think just a small, I agree completely with what you're saying, but I think maybe a small nuance is that the idea that it might not be okay to be bored is maybe something that then creases that sense of anxiety that in fact goes kind of hand in hand.

1187
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:36,040
And I mean, the reality is, of course it's okay to be bored, and everyone is at some point.

1188
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:38,040
And I agree.

1189
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,040
I'm allowed to promote boredom, but...

1190
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,040
Exactly.

1191
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:46,040
You want to tell people to be bored, but it does happen, and there are things, very good things that could come out of it.

1192
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:48,040
If you're not so anxious about it.

1193
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:58,040
Someone here used the word magical earlier, I think you were referring to, I forget, you said something about being, that sense is being so magical, right?

1194
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:12,040
I think that sort of existential challenge to be, just be, it's such a wonderful possibility that we don't teach that very well to people that this is a creative and very exciting for me to create myself in some way.

1195
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:16,040
I mean, that's getting out there philosophically speaking, but I think you asked for it.

1196
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,040
I think it's wonderful.

1197
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:22,040
Getting people to really engage in that level is so important.

1198
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:29,040
And the challenges, this is a society in which the possibility of just being without distraction is becoming harder and harder.

1199
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,040
But I want to ask you something.

1200
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,040
So you live in this society, right?

1201
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:37,040
And you manage to enjoy being by yourself without distraction, right?

1202
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:41,040
So to what extent do you think, clearly there are individual differences, right?

1203
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:51,040
So some people would just always be able to talk by themselves, think about something, inquire something, research, do this or that, no matter how many cell phones they have.

1204
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:56,040
But then other people, so what do you think, I mean, right?

1205
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:59,040
So is this part, nurture, part, nature?

1206
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:10,040
I don't know what the question is, but so how would we structure an environment that, for example, that encourages the other?

1207
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:16,040
I mean, look, you could say for me, people ask me, does the internet, does that induce boredom?

1208
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:22,040
I'm like, no, just the opposite, it's more stuff to learn and find out, it's more easily available information.

1209
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,040
How can I possibly be bored?

1210
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,040
I'm not sure about that.

1211
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:26,040
Right?

1212
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:29,040
Well, I understand that there are two responses, right?

1213
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:34,040
But the question is, how do you nudge people, you know, one more one way, then?

1214
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:37,040
It's not just the environment, so a reaction to it.

1215
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:42,040
Well, I mean, we know that there are a lot of individual differences in the propensity to be bored.

1216
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:46,040
And that's a whole topic in its own right that we didn't touch on today.

1217
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:50,040
Like, what are the psychological characteristics that predispose someone to feel bored?

1218
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:56,040
And in the psychology literature, there's actually more work that's been done on that on the state boredom, right?

1219
01:40:56,040 --> 01:41:00,040
So there's state boredom, and then there's trait boredom or the propensity to be bored.

1220
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:08,040
But now I think the field is circling back and realizing that the way we had defined and measured trait boredom was quite problematic.

1221
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:13,040
But there are some findings, and to the question about the clinical setting,

1222
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:18,040
Alexa Thymia is highly correlated with boredom-proneness.

1223
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:22,040
So, you know, just to give one example, and there's many others that we could look at as well.

1224
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,040
You should define that for me.

1225
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:28,040
Oh, so Alexa Thymia refers to, I think it literally means no words for feelings.

1226
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,040
Would that be the right word?

1227
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:34,040
So someone who is high in Alexa Thymia would, if you ask them, how are you doing today?

1228
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:37,040
They might say, oh, I have a tummy ache, right?

1229
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:44,040
So they might somatatize, or they might just say, oh, I feel bad, but they couldn't say I'm disappointed or I'm upset.

1230
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:51,040
So they lack the capacity to label and reflect on their rich emotional kind of,

1231
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:57,040
and I guess there's some debate on whether it's purely a lack of a label or lack of an experience or some combination of both.

1232
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:05,040
But I think about emotions as compass points, right, that orient us in life toward moving away from things that are a problem or moving towards things that are value to us.

1233
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:12,040
And so if we lack those compass points, if we are high in Alexa Thymia, it's more likely that we're going to then struggle with boredom.

1234
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:19,040
Very cool point that the insula cortex is close to the speech center in the brain.

1235
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:24,040
Hi.

1236
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:26,040
I thank you for the discussion.

1237
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:33,040
Just to the disclaimer, my father Gerald has been talking about this for weeks in preparation, which has been a bit boring.

1238
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:43,040
So I would like to thank the other conversants for giving their thoughts on it so I could put it all together with my father's thoughts for the past few weeks.

1239
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:51,040
But anyway, my father had an earlier comment about Murph being the opposite of boredom, and being a millennial.

1240
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:56,040
It made me think about memes, because I say this both in jest and in seriousness,

1241
01:42:56,040 --> 01:43:03,040
and just because my father's on a roundtable and to ask him a question about memes seems pretty appropriate.

1242
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:13,040
But the seriousness comes in the fact that I feel memes have become the vector of a lot of millennial humor and the humor for the generation after me, I think Generation Z.

1243
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:19,040
And it seems to be a cure in my eyes if Murph is the opposite of boredom.

1244
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:26,040
It's a cure of boredom, boredom in the nanosecond scale, as the other questioner mentioned, of how you feel before you reach for your phone.

1245
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:29,040
So how do you think about that statement of meme culture?

1246
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:32,040
Is the millennials' attempt at curing boredom?

1247
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:40,040
And do you think it's a good idea in this vein to do memes actually cure the sanosecond boredom,

1248
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:48,040
or is it just distracting us from the reality that this thing exists and it's always going to exist, and that this isn't the best way to go about it?

1249
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:51,040
Well, thank you, son, for reminding me of that comment I made earlier.

1250
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:58,040
I actually intended to follow up with that comment about Murph being the opposite in some sense,

1251
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:02,040
and I don't mean it strictly speaking, but Murph being the opposite of boredom.

1252
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:08,040
There's some ideas about the sort of development of a sense of taste going back to the 18th century,

1253
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:15,040
where I think it was Dubois wrote a piece early on about aesthetics and the theory of aesthetics,

1254
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:22,040
where he said that the playfulness of the mind, or the play of the mind is what allows people to find beauty in things,

1255
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:25,040
or is a cause of identifying things as being beautiful.

1256
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:33,040
And it's an interesting way to look at an interesting paradigm, because playfulness is another version of curiosity,

1257
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:42,040
where it's a natural stage of curiosity in, I think, in many animal species, I know for sure the mammalian species,

1258
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:55,040
and the means come in, it really comes down to what's funny and what might engage you in a feeling of Murph.

1259
01:44:55,040 --> 01:45:03,040
I think if it's just sort of a sensational and exciting and sensational, that it's not very helpful to stave off boredom,

1260
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:06,040
and it's a way of just getting like a shot of cocaine.

1261
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:09,040
Maybe not that good, but, you know.

1262
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:17,040
But if it engages you to think in a funny way, or in a playful way, even more important and funny,

1263
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:24,040
if it engages you to engage in a playful way with things, then I think that's a wonderful remedy to boredom.

1264
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:32,040
I completely agree, and I guess I might add that creating clever means is a better antidote than observing them.

1265
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:34,040
Yeah, well, but, yeah.

1266
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:41,040
Yeah, actually, the playfulness links to what I was thinking about, which really has to do with infant and child development,

1267
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:49,040
and what we've learned about the importance of mother-infant play, or caregiver-infant play from very early on,

1268
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:54,040
in terms of regulating both emotional states and attentional states,

1269
01:45:54,040 --> 01:46:02,040
and then as development proceeds to then get to a state where the child, you know, can tautle over and show mommy something,

1270
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:05,040
or daddy and daddy says, wow, that's fantastic.

1271
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:13,040
This little caterpillar is moving, and how important those shared interpersonal experiences are,

1272
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:17,040
not only in epic regulation, which I think is a lot of the underlying stuff,

1273
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:23,040
but in expanding capacity for both attention and curiosity, which, you know, certainly,

1274
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:30,040
and trauma, where you see alexithymia in other states of deadness, variations of that,

1275
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:36,040
and things we might call boredom, that we really see in the clinical situation all the time,

1276
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:41,040
and I think that's why we focused on it with our seeing as a defense, and always wondering,

1277
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:46,040
both what is happening now with my patient, that either my patient is saying they're bored or I'm feeling bored,

1278
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:50,040
what's happening between the two of us and what's not being touched on,

1279
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:55,040
as well as historically of what was the joint interpersonal joining experience

1280
01:46:55,040 --> 01:47:01,040
and shared experience of both curiosity and affect is really important in, I think,

1281
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:06,040
in thinking about boredom and curiosity, which is clearly important.

1282
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:12,040
There's a study that we need to do there, right, to see if there's sort of generational

1283
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:21,040
boredom, if it's something that, you know, those developmental experiences increase the likelihood of it.

1284
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:27,040
Okay, thank you.

1285
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:55,040
Thank you.
