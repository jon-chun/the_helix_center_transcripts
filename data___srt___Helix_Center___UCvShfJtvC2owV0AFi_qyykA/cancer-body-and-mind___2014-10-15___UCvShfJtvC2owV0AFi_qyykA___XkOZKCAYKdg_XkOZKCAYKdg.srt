1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm Ed Nurse-Shesian, Director of the Center.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Welcome to this meeting on cancer and body and mind.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,480
Before I introduce the participants,

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,760
I'd like to tell you a few things about future programming.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,760
On October 25th, we have span of infinity.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,200
On November 15th, complexity and emergence.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,440
On November 22nd, we are going to show the movie Particle Fever

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,920
and after that, we are going to have a round table.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,960
And on December 6th, we are going to have a program

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,680
called French Thureles Poetry, a sampler

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,360
that Anne-Marie Levine has organized.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,400
And on December 13th, we will have

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,320
search for immortality.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,600
Today's program came about during a conversation I had

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,520
with Andrea Califano, where he was telling me

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,440
that cancer is always in your body.

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,000
And he can correct me if I'm saying it wrong,

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,880
because we had a few glasses of wine.

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,680
And I may not remember things, right?

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,840
But essentially, that cancer is in your body

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,080
and what makes the difference.

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,840
Or one of the things that makes the difference

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,960
is your immune system.

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,120
And that one of the factors that affects the immune system

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,360
is stress.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,760
And one of the things that can be stressful is being depressed.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,720
So that's what gave us the idea of discussing

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,880
the latest findings on cancer, but then also

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,680
talking about the role of the mind in some effects

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,600
on the immune system.

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,800
So today's participants are Andrea Califano, who

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,960
has been here before, and who is the Clyde and Helen Woo

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,800
Professor of Chemical and Systems Biology at Columbia

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,000
in the departments of biochemistry and molecular

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
biophysics and of biomedical informatics.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,160
He is currently the founding director and chair

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,840
of the Columbia Initiative for Systems Biology.

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,960
He also serves as associate director

39
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,400
of a bioinformatics in the Herbert Irving Comprehensive

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,240
Cancer Center.

41
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,680
I'm not going to read everything but just

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,840
to give you an idea.

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,960
The next to him is Selena Cenkeang,

44
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,000
who is professor of pathology and professor of immunology

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,960
and microbial pathogenesis at wild Cornell.

46
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,000
Her focus is to convert conceptual breakthroughs,

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,200
into novel cancer therapies.

48
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,000
She pioneered the concept that controlling the cell

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
cycling cancer cells can reprogram them for a killing

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
by a partner agent.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
She has implemented this novel strategy

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
in several hypothesis driven clinical triers of combination

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
therapy in human cancers such as lymphoma.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Susan Lottgendorf is professor at the Department of Psychology,

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Obstetrics and Gynecology and Geology and member

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
at the University of Iowa.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Her current work funded by the National Cancer Institute

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
examines how factors such as stress, depression,

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
social support or link to biological processes

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
involved in endogenesis, inflammation,

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and recurrence in ovarian cancer patients.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hans Gido Wendell is the principal investigator

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
at the Cancer Genetics Laboratory at Memorial Sloan Cathering.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He works to identify new cancer therapies

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
based on the genetic origins of the disease.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He comes from Germany,

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and he is a physician.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He is a physician.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He is a physician for the disease.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He comes from Germany and trained in medicine in Arkan

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and then was at Edinburgh and is currently

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
an associate member of the Sloan Cathering Institute.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So that's it, and you can start.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:35,160
So, just going back to our discussion, I think it was prompted by the fact that over

76
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,760
the last three, four years, there has been a tremendous transformation of the cancer

77
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:47,320
field due to an increased success of immunotherapies based approaches.

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,160
And it started a long time ago with some of the work that Rosenfeld has done.

79
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:58,320
More recently, Carl June, many others have studied to really harness how we can remove

80
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,560
the veil that hides the cancer from the immune system and therefore have success in some

81
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,560
cases where, from a point of view of either surgery or conventional chemotherapy or even

82
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,800
targeted therapy, there was really no hope left.

83
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,040
And just a couple of weeks ago, a new drug called Pembro has been approved by the FDA

84
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,320
on an accelerated path.

85
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:33,040
And this drug essentially re-establishes immune function in the context of cancer and has

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,480
been tremendously successful for using melanomas and now it's been also tested on gastric cancers

87
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,320
that are positive for the ligand of this particular protein called PDL1.

88
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:55,080
So based on these unexpected and maybe long expected but not yet delivered suddenly becoming

89
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,760
available successes, we thought that maybe there was going to be an increasing focus on

90
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:09,360
the immune system even in terms of how immunosuppression contributes in some ways to the development

91
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
and progression of cancer.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,800
And certainly there are now even concepts at the NCI that are focusing around the notion

93
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,960
of stress and how stress can potentially be one of the triggers.

94
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,280
And remember we were saying that we have cancer every day, what we mean is that we have, you

95
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:34,600
know, so a billion cells in our body and the probability that one of those cells has mutations

96
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,480
that would make it to more genetic are very high.

97
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,800
And so something has to be taken care of that on a continuous basis and that's what our immune

98
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,640
system does, basically immediately targets any kind of lesions.

99
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,640
There are also other mechanisms that are built in the cell like senescence and scope apoptosis

100
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:59,400
but the immune system does a great job of getting rid of initial sort of starts of these

101
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,680
disease.

102
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:07,080
So that was the context in which this discussion came out and I think it would be great to

103
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,080
hear from Susan whether there have been more sort of the molecular level connection between

104
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,720
stress and anxiety and cancer.

105
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:30,120
Okay, so in the work that we do, we look at two areas related to cancer, cancer initiation

106
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,760
and cancer progression.

107
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:38,320
And initiation is the development of cancer and people who don't have cancer already.

108
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:45,240
And progression is once people have cancer, does the question is does stress help cancer

109
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,480
progress?

110
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:56,040
So looking at the initiation side, there's, the evidence is really pretty equivocal.

111
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,720
People think that stress can cause cancer, it's out there in the popular literature.

112
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,880
I've had people come up to me in the clinic and say, my sister says I'm such a positive

113
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,640
person, I don't understand why I've got cancer.

114
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:20,320
And so the role of what stress can do is limited because it's interacting with biology.

115
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:27,600
One of the things we know in the field of psychonuroimmunology is that there is a very,

116
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,400
very well characterized relationship between stress and the immune system.

117
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:40,800
And it seems to affect both the cellular immune system and the humeral immune system.

118
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,880
A cute stress tends to stimulate the immune system and it's really chronic stress that

119
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,680
we think about in the context of cancer.

120
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,960
So what's chronic stress?

121
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:03,600
People have looked at it in terms of chronic loneliness, caretaking, medical students studying

122
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,160
for boards.

123
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,080
Nobody's looked at people studying for, people preparing grants, but you probably get that.

124
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,760
Well, unless you're doing grant after grant after grant.

125
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,120
Today, hearing grant is chronic stress.

126
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,560
Right, because it's one after the other.

127
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,560
But chronic stress particularly where the person has a feeling of helplessness or this

128
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:36,760
is going to go on and on can affect the immune system because on B cells, on T cells, on

129
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:45,040
MK cells, on macrophages, there are beta adrenergic receptors, there are glucocorticoid receptors,

130
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,520
and those basically change the functioning of those cells.

131
00:09:51,520 --> 00:10:02,880
So what we've seen in the context of cancer is people started looking in the area of do

132
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:10,440
in people who have cancer is natural killer cell functioning depressed, is macrophage

133
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,520
functioning changed, is T cell functioning changed.

134
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:22,720
And basically, there's good evidence that in people with chronic stress and people with

135
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:31,800
depression, in people who are lonely, that various aspects of cellular immune function

136
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,000
is downregulated in people who have cancer.

137
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,320
And that's where we started out in our research.

138
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,840
And people had looked basically at peripheral blood and we asked the question, what about

139
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,480
in the tumor itself?

140
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,760
And we found that indeed not only in circulating blood but in the area of the tumor, there

141
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,360
was depression of natural killer cell activity.

142
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:10,960
Then we started looking more directly and saying, well, if there is an effect on host

143
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:18,280
tumor cells, on immune cells which are supposed to be doing surveillance against tumor cells

144
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,480
or attacking tumor cells, would we see direct effects of stress on tumor cells?

145
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,200
And that started a line of research which I've been involved in with a colleague, Neil

146
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,640
Sood, from MD Anderson and supported by the National Cancer Institute looking at direct

147
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,080
effects on tumor cells.

148
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:49,440
And so what we see is that in correlational studies and clinical studies that patients

149
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:58,560
with either higher levels of loneliness or higher levels of tumor norepinephrine, which

150
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:06,560
is a stress hormone, have higher rates of angiogenesis.

151
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,480
They have, their tumor cells are more aggressive, they're more invasive, they're less likely

152
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,520
to die when they're circulating through the body.

153
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,120
So there seem to be all these relationships.

154
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:31,640
And conversely with people who are more positive, who have a more, an outlook on life that is

155
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:39,040
looking more for benefits rather than fear based, they tend to have a stronger immune

156
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,200
system and less of these effects.

157
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:50,480
So that's sort of the overall picture that we're seeing that stress or negative psychosocial

158
00:12:50,480 --> 00:13:00,920
functioning not only can make the tumor more aggressive but also depletes the body's resistance

159
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
against the tumor.

160
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,800
Can I ask you a little bit because this is very interesting.

161
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,680
You talk about a direct effect on the cancer cell but is it mediated by the immune system

162
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,240
or do you think that it's actually immune system independent?

163
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,480
So if you did this in a, in a nutmeg mouse, that's no immune system, would you still

164
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,760
see an effect of stress directly on the tumor cells?

165
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
You do.

166
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
You do.

167
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Okay.

168
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,840
And so I'll give you some thoughts on mediation.

169
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:34,680
So if you're looking at how does stress affect tumor cells, you have direct effects through

170
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:43,680
beta-atronergic receptors on tumor cells and through nerves that are innovating the tumor

171
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,200
mass itself.

172
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:54,080
You also have indirect effects, for example, through the macrophages so that stress can

173
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,560
– so should we put cancer patients on beta blockers?

174
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,000
Well there's been a lot of interest in that and there have been some pilot studies looking

175
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,440
at that because – Does it make a difference?

176
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,160
Does it make a difference?

177
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,440
I'm not aware of the study.

178
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,640
There have been both positive and negative findings.

179
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:25,360
It seems to depend on the cancer and it seems to depend on the particular receptors on the

180
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,200
cancer.

181
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,480
But there have been some – there was a meta-analysis done recently and there have been

182
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:38,400
some pretty successful studies of – and at this point most of the studies are retrospective.

183
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,400
There hasn't been a really solid multi-center clinical trial looking at putting patients

184
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
on beta blockers.

185
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:51,680
I think that in terms of stress, the two areas are probably quite important – one is cytokines.

186
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,760
These are the small molecule and often stress – at the molecular level some of them are

187
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,600
understood is induced inflammatory cytokines.

188
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,800
And that has a huge consequence in terms of every cell in the immune system, how they

189
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,960
receive the cytokine and how in turn generates cytokines.

190
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,400
I think this is a loop that's extremely important.

191
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,520
And one of the consequences about this loop is – there are two things.

192
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,040
One of the sloop is increasing cell number by cell division.

193
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,480
So you cannot have cancer unless the cell division is misregulated.

194
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:41,160
You need to have – one of the basis for cancer is cells are not controlled as programmed

195
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
and stopped dividing.

196
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,760
They keep on dividing.

197
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,960
That's one thing.

198
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,160
The other is as if a train failed to get to the station.

199
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,720
They stopped somewhere in the middle.

200
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,640
And that's lack of differentiation.

201
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,520
But even that we won't have cancer.

202
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,640
The other part is the cells fail to die.

203
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,600
So you need all these parts.

204
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,080
And actually all these are very much affected by cytokines.

205
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:16,800
Because actually in the immune system T cells, B cells, all these cells – the students

206
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
talk about cells in the immune system.

207
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,760
NK represents natural killer cells.

208
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,160
B cells are the cells that make antibodies.

209
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,280
And T cells are two kinds.

210
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,360
One is the T cell that help B cells to make antibodies.

211
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,080
The other is the kind of T cell that itself can kill cells.

212
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,880
And the macrophage is the powerhouse of making inflammatory cytokines.

213
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,840
So I think that is actually – and that's both systemic as well as in tumor.

214
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,320
And a lot of tumor cells are not supposed to make these things, but because they become

215
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,640
tumor cells, they themselves make them.

216
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
I think that's the issue.

217
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
I think that's the issue.

218
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,640
There's probably more here though, right?

219
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,200
At the moment we're sort of discussing how does your psychology affect your immune system?

220
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
We all know that, right?

221
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,080
You're stressed and you hope this flares up.

222
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,120
And obviously there is a connection here.

223
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,760
You can probably turn it around as well.

224
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,320
You can say, well, people have different abilities to deal with stress, different abilities to

225
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,760
deal with the stress of a cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, cancer going to the hospital

226
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,840
back and forth themselves.

227
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,680
And that may affect – well, it may affect the outcome.

228
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,440
It may affect the way they can handle it.

229
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,520
I'm talking about something that I have no clue of because I'm not a psychiatrist.

230
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:43,880
But I would imagine for patients who are diagnosed who have cancer, their own ability to deal

231
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,600
with stress, you know, having friends, having their network, having whatever helps you to

232
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,840
deal with all your own predisposition to deal with stress affects the way that the cancer

233
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,920
in turn affects them.

234
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,480
I don't know if that is measurable in outcome, in survival and so on.

235
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,880
But it probably is a big factor for patients and a big difference.

236
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,200
If you look in a hospital on any ward with 30, 40 patients, you're going to have a spectrum

237
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,800
of people who respond to it by saying, well, you know, it is what it is and I'll deal

238
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,000
with it and you'll have people who respond very differently.

239
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,600
And, you know, so I think that we've now discussed the – these sort of how does your

240
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,080
psychology affect your immune system and cytokines and macrophages.

241
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,080
But the mind and cancer problem, you can probably turn it around and it's not that I have

242
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
anything.

243
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:46,920
One of the things that turns out to be consistently really important in terms of coping is social

244
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,360
support.

245
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,840
And one of the things – and the kind of social support is also really important.

246
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,360
So for example, in ovarian cancer patients, which is mostly what I study, we've seen

247
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,440
that it's the kind of social support where people feel emotionally connected with people,

248
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,560
where they feel like they can talk to somebody, there's somebody at their back as opposed

249
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:16,360
to there's somebody that can bring them chicken soup, that they can borrow money from, etc.

250
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:24,760
So it's this emotional connection that we see related to survival in ovarian cancer

251
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
patients.

252
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:33,520
We see it related to tumor norepinephrine and we see it related to actually the gene expression

253
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:41,800
at the time of diagnosis that there are – there's really a different signature in people who

254
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,360
have high social support versus low social support.

255
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,200
So I'm not understanding that what you were talking about, you were talking more about

256
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:01,200
patients, the stress coming from having the cancer, having the diagnosis.

257
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
Resources and dealing with it, right?

258
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,760
But after having the disease.

259
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Yes.

260
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
Right.

261
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
It's too different.

262
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,680
That's what I'm talking about too.

263
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:18,840
So nobody's then talking about or it's not relevant, the issue of social support, stress

264
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,560
and so on prior to the diagnosis.

265
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,960
I think that's where Susan was saying that the waters are much murkier because I think

266
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,640
after you get cancer there's a clear function in the immune system and the question is whether

267
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,760
because the number of cells, the cancer cell is huge once you have cancer is detectable,

268
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,280
it's a huge number.

269
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,600
Once you have – when you start – you essentially start to get cancer, the number of cells

270
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,040
is small, the potentially even maybe a minimal function of the immune system is already sufficient

271
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,200
to keep it in check.

272
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,200
So I think that's maybe what – you know what I see, again, I'm also like Gito, I'm

273
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,600
not a psychiatrist or psychologist, but I work in basic sciences and one thing that we see

274
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,720
that is very interesting is that in tissues there's always this balance.

275
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:13,640
And essentially you have processes that compete, typical processes that compete in tumors are

276
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,920
something called apoptosis which is programmed cell death and proliferation.

277
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,960
And literally you can in lymphoma for instance, you know, which is on a field that you have

278
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,360
eminent experts here, it was long thought that there was a process for instance by abrogating

279
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,720
the function of P53 that you would essentially block apoptosis.

280
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,680
But actually in the LBC alpha, diffused laspis-helymphoma, there is a significant fair bit of apoptosis

281
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
going on.

282
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,280
It's just that the proliferation is higher than the apoptosis and the tumor grows.

283
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,200
If you can bring down – either increase apoptosis a little bit or bring down proliferation,

284
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,360
then the tumor shrinks.

285
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,560
And so it's really a balance between two things.

286
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,920
And one thing that we've observed and this came out from some research results that we

287
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,400
have not even published yet is that cancer seems to be really divided in two groups.

288
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:07,400
There's a group where proliferation pathways seem to have a really marked sort of signature

289
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,400
and there's a group where immunosuppressive pathways seem to have a significant signature.

290
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,080
And the ones that are immunosuppressive are much less proliferative.

291
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,000
So for instance, neuroendocrine tumors, completely non-proliferation tumors, they can be indolent

292
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
for years but they're totally immunosuppressive.

293
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,240
They have like, they eliminate, they mask themselves behind the veil of a shroud of secretness

294
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,720
and the immune system can undertake them.

295
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,560
And there's work by – or Weisman that I think has been really seminal in the area

296
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:41,280
of specific receptors called CD47 that actually are called the don't eat me signal.

297
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,640
Basically they're used by stem cell that still have an immature self image that would

298
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,040
otherwise be attacked by the immune system to basically tell your own immune system don't

299
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,440
eat me as I go and do, you know, generate the tissue that I need to go and generate.

300
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,960
It turns out that the vast majority of tumors actually express the CD47 receptor and IRV

301
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,400
has been having some pretty substantial success and it's now running some large clinical

302
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:10,200
studies with inhibitors of the CD47 receptor just to see whether we can – so that's

303
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,400
an example where it would be very difficult for your own immune system to play a role

304
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,840
because it's really – there's nothing to attack.

305
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,320
You know, the essentially the tumor is invisible.

306
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,360
So it doesn't matter whether your immune system is suppressed or not.

307
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Just tumor is like thin air.

308
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,840
But if the tumor becomes visible where you essentially for instance in proliferative tumors

309
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,120
where you have less immunosuppression then it may be possible that what Susan was saying

310
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
may play a big role.

311
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,720
So in fact I think many people wonder what the nutrition plays a role in cancer and that's

312
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,400
another aspect I think that of eating healthily and sort of, you know, so far the reasons

313
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
of the glucose metabolism.

314
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:58,480
I think there's definitely a good reason is that one clearly recognized fact is the

315
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,680
metabolism of a tumor cell is very different from a normal cell.

316
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:11,320
And because the tumor cells you would think that they are more powerful but actually if

317
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,400
you remove these tumor cells and take it out they die very quickly.

318
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,320
They are much more dependent on certain type of metabolism.

319
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:28,080
So one of the ways now thinking about attacking tumor and sparing a normal cell is actually

320
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,760
attacking the cancer metabolism.

321
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,280
We're not there yet but there's a direction.

322
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,680
The reason I want to bring this up again is the fact that all the things that you've

323
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:44,600
mentioned and you mentioned about a cell cycle because we study that at some point it's

324
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:54,280
actually integrated at metabolism it's like a real stat because that's the central sort

325
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,000
of business wheel of a cell.

326
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:05,680
It gives you energy, it gives you resources to generate manganese so a mother cancer cell

327
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,720
can divide into two daughters cell.

328
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,120
Without this the cancer cell will die and this is a very important thing.

329
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:21,360
And I think what is also important is the way that if unless a patient is not treated

330
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:29,360
otherwise when patients treat it often times the dose is too high, the drug and that high

331
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,480
dose itself induces stress.

332
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:39,340
And I think that's the direction that we are actually designing clinical trial beginning

333
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:47,480
to think about this because sometimes the consequence of those high dose is worse than

334
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,080
the benefit of it.

335
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,840
And one major thing is interfering with metabolism tremendously in a bad way and the other is

336
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,760
induced stress.

337
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,960
I think this is a very, I think this stress and immune system are not separable.

338
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,760
These two things are almost integrated.

339
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,800
Is there another reason actually that started to come out just now of why for instance using

340
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:20,840
drugs in ways that sort of overwhelm maybe negative positive is that drugs essentially

341
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:28,520
a pressure on the cancer system and as a pressure typical evolutionary system it promotes

342
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,560
essentially survival of certain clones, essentially some cells that have specific characteristics

343
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,160
and kills the ones that don't have those characteristics.

344
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,480
Because the ones that have the survival characteristics are much worse cells than the ones that

345
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
get killed.

346
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,400
And so you're basically, you're creating an environment where the absolute worst cells

347
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:53,760
that would then give you a very aggressive tumor are now given total empty space to survive

348
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
and to proliferate.

349
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,000
And so what happens very frequently for instance is that you see that these tumors are initially

350
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,280
shrink significantly after you get a particular treatment but then the tumor that comes up

351
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,760
after that becomes extremely aggressive and actually kills the patient very, very rapidly.

352
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,760
So these are things that we're just starting to understand.

353
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:22,360
In fact I think almost invariably anyone who unfortunately get diagnosed the initial treatment

354
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,040
always work a little bit and sometimes work very well.

355
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:34,360
The time that's very difficult and very challenging sometimes is hopeless is a relapse.

356
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:41,760
So I think what we really have to understand is how the progression leads to that relapse

357
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,080
and all these factors whether it's stress, whether it's nutrition, whether it's support

358
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,480
because I think support is not only for cancer.

359
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,320
Anyone who has childbirth would like to have support.

360
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
All these factors are universal.

361
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
They're not just for cancer alone.

362
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,560
It's the entire well-being of the individual.

363
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:07,400
And I think for cancer I think probably the most important thing is to really understand

364
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,280
and everybody's different.

365
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,160
I'm sure you know this too.

366
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,480
We do genomic sequencing and you take the normal cell from a cancer patient and we do

367
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,120
this all the time.

368
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,480
And you ask how many mutations, you know, normal cells.

369
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,560
I bet you will have a million and I have a million, you have over a million.

370
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,120
But you're okay.

371
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,880
And what is different is what's the difference between your two more cells and normal cells.

372
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:40,080
So I think ultimately to really get very deeply, we sort of have to recognize the individual.

373
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Every person is different and to really understand that deeper in order to integrate all this

374
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,240
information and get to it.

375
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,800
Otherwise we're going around the circle because until today cancer in most cases is not curable

376
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,040
because we're going around the circle.

377
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,920
And I think it's pretty important.

378
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,960
But we have the tools now, right?

379
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,160
We have a lot of tools.

380
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Incredible tools.

381
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:09,200
There's also a lot of promise because I would say five years ago we don't have all these

382
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
targeted agents.

383
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,200
We have no ability to deal with some more number of cancer cells.

384
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
But I think we do.

385
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,040
We have a lot of systems, biology, everything to help us deal with that.

386
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:27,880
I think it's a very interesting point right now because I'm actually quite skeptical towards

387
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:33,400
targeted agents that go after a specific oncogen simply because, you know, typical examples

388
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,560
be rough, right?

389
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
So every one of our...

390
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,960
But the combination of therapies ultimately need it.

391
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
Exactly.

392
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,440
But also I think we need to hit...

393
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,560
Right now we're concentrating on the oncogenes.

394
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,960
I think we need to find very much like your work, we have to find the non-oncogenes that

395
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,000
are the Achilles heel of the tumor.

396
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,040
And for instance, a typical example you were mentioning about the fact that we have cells,

397
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,440
normal cells that have ulcerous mutation.

398
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,920
Well the most famous one is BRAF, which is a mutation in melanoma.

399
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,920
It's basically over 50% of melatonin have these mutations in this gene.

400
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:11,960
A very specific point of the BRAF protein.

401
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,280
But all our nevi have BRAF mutation.

402
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,280
But they're not tumors.

403
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,080
They're just normal cells.

404
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,160
So clearly it can be just BRAF alone.

405
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,720
And so when you look at the tumor, the big problem is that every single cell of the tumor

406
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
is different.

407
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Why?

408
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,240
Because the very first event that goes wrong in the tumor is called loss of a tumor suppressor,

409
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,400
which means that your tumor starts accumulating mutations much faster than your normal cells.

410
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,720
And when you do that, essentially every tumor cell accumulates different mutations.

411
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,160
So I think one of the major difficulties, and when you talk about relapse being the major

412
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,560
problem, is that what drugs do, they hit the part of the tumor they can't hit.

413
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,280
And whatever is left out that doesn't respond to the drug emerges and no longer sensitive

414
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,920
to the drug.

415
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,040
So I think what we need to figure out, and we actually published a paper today's ago

416
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,320
in Cell showing that there are these sort of bottlenecks in the regulatory system of

417
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,520
the tumors where all these mutations that you could try to hit with individual drugs

418
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,400
are actually all converging and they have to go through just a small number of proteins.

419
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,640
And we think very strongly that those are the proteins you want to hit.

420
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,880
For instance in prostate cancer, it doesn't matter which genes you have mutated.

421
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,160
In order to have the aggressive form of prostate cancer that will actually kill the patient

422
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,560
and become undergens independent and become metastatic, you have to have co-activation

423
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,840
of two proteins, one called FOXM1 and one called CMPF.

424
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,480
If you don't have the super-activated, you will not get the aggressive prostate cancer.

425
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,240
If you have them activated, you will get aggressive prostate cancer.

426
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,240
So instead of hitting the oncogen upstream, where of which many can be differently mutated

427
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,120
in different cancer cells within the same tumor, if you hit those two proteins, you're

428
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,760
going to be in a much better shape.

429
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,360
I think these are concepts that are just starting to be developed and it will be a long time

430
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,760
before we apply them to the plane.

431
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:08,400
I think if every cancer is parallel in this type of understanding, then we can begin to

432
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,720
elevate our total understanding.

433
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,400
I think that's very necessary.

434
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:20,240
Unfortunately, we do have much better tools than we did before.

435
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,200
In the last five years, things really, really move.

436
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
So that's the hope.

437
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,520
I think we can say that.

438
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,720
It's very exciting.

439
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,640
But the part that I do feel is important is anyone who is really trying to understand

440
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,920
the cancer do have to consider what a normal cell does.

441
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,120
Otherwise, we don't have the differential between tumor and normal.

442
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,040
I think that's very important.

443
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:56,280
After all, at the end, we are wanting to preserve is a normal and not the cancer.

444
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,280
So what do you think?

445
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,280
What do I think?

446
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,360
Yeah, so the topic here is, what's the topic?

447
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,880
Mind and cancer, right?

448
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:13,200
In my view of how cancer rises, it's a population of cells that sit in your bone marrow or wherever

449
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,120
in your lung that escape all the normal control mechanisms.

450
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,840
So cells that are in your bone marrow and that make blood cells that are tightly controlled

451
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,920
by cytokines and factors in the environment.

452
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,320
The metabolism is controlled.

453
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,480
Everything is tightly regulated.

454
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,800
And maybe your psychology even affects the ability to do things.

455
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,480
The cells lose all of that control.

456
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,840
They bypass it step by step.

457
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,320
They become independent of growth factors.

458
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,800
They survive self-stress that a normal cell can't survive.

459
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,720
Their metabolism becomes completely disconnected from any outside stimulus or even the availability

460
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,320
of nutrients.

461
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,240
They become like yeast on a petri dish.

462
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,360
And so I think an important point for me in the discussion here is to discuss how does

463
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,040
the mind affect cancer and vice versa.

464
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:15,600
Cancer are sort of population of cells that tries to escape from any outside influence.

465
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,160
They become rogue.

466
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:22,160
They become terrorists who say, you know, we are out of your reach.

467
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,720
Don't talk to us.

468
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,680
They escape the immune system by losing genes or proteins.

469
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,960
The immune system may be able to recognize.

470
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
They throw them away.

471
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:40,520
So there's a very strong selection for losing any kind of control and becoming rogue cells.

472
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,400
So they escape these control mechanisms.

473
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,800
Physiological, immunological, maybe psychological.

474
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,520
And with therapies, I think now our discussion is sort of going to the genes inside the cancer

475
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,400
and how we may be able to target them.

476
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,080
And I think that reflects the fact that these cancers use these mechanisms to become independent.

477
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:11,720
And we have some tools to target and to try to restore some dependence on outside factors.

478
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
Right.

479
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:19,160
But last night you were saying something that you implied that you were more pessimistic

480
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,800
about an outside treatment.

481
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:31,360
No, you asked me a very pointed question whether we can eradicate cancer, which is sort of

482
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,680
as a question like, can we overcome death?

483
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,920
Right?

484
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,400
I mean, in a way, that's one way you can understand a question.

485
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,480
You can ask, can a given patient survive cancer?

486
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
And we have great drugs.

487
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,920
Can we eradicate cancer?

488
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
Can we?

489
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
No.

490
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,640
But why do you compare cancer to that?

491
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,240
Why don't we be eradicated, for example, smallpox?

492
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:04,800
So you immediately equate, we can't eradicate cancer because we can't eradicate death.

493
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,960
Why do you make that connection?

494
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,000
Cancer is part of our biology.

495
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's built in.

496
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
That's what I was asking you to elaborate.

497
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,920
It's built into our biology.

498
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:25,360
There is, we, just by breathing oxygen, you are going to accumulate mutations.

499
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,680
Oxygen is very toxic, in fact.

500
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,560
But you can't live without it.

501
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
Right?

502
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,160
Yeah, we need it.

503
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
I think that we-

504
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,880
So you accumulate these mutations and they have an advantage.

505
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,520
Without accumulating mutations, we would still be single organisms somewhere in a little

506
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,880
puddle of the coast of who knows where.

507
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Right?

508
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,560
We would not come off the trees.

509
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,160
So evolution requires some versatility, some flexibility.

510
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,640
There has to be a way that you can mutagenize genes, that you can change things in a germ

511
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,480
line and by extension or zen somatic tissues and so on.

512
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,440
So that versatility I think comes at a price.

513
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:16,400
So whatever is the evolution of a species is also the evolution of cells.

514
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,280
And cancer is evolution of cells, gone rogue, evolution of cells that decided we don't need

515
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
the rest of you.

516
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:34,360
I think following that point is that to have mutation accumulate, again, you need to

517
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,160
mutate the cells to divide.

518
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,000
Otherwise, you will not increase the population.

519
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,640
And for cells in immune system, they are different from other cells in a way that they

520
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,720
have this continuous ability to rearrange their DNA.

521
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,360
And as a result, the frequency of making a mistake is a lot higher.

522
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,760
So this obviously is the division and the selection.

523
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:11,800
There is a parallel between selection for the fittest and the cancer, that's for sure.

524
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:18,600
But I just want to point out that in terms of eradicating cancer, correct, we are not

525
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:25,160
anywhere near eradicating all the cancers, but some cancers are cured compared with what

526
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,440
it was 20 years ago.

527
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,720
That is correct.

528
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,640
So I think we have to look at different cancer in different ways.

529
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,840
For example, pancreatic cancer is extremely challenging.

530
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,320
But childhood leukemia, you can treat it.

531
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,600
And the cure rate is very high.

532
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,240
So I think we have to look at specific, we cannot draw a...

533
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,960
I think your question of can we eradicate cancer?

534
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,480
It would be translated into can we eradicate infection diseases?

535
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,360
Not can we eradicate smallpox, because smallpox is just one type of infection disease.

536
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,600
If you look at the stickular cancer, chorionic cancer, basically, you want to put it close

537
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,400
to one under presentation on cure.

538
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,420
So you have eradicated those, but it's still, it's just like saying, yes, smallpox, we have

539
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,420
eradicated.

540
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:15,560
Well, but the idea I think that I found very interesting in the way Gido was talking about

541
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:23,280
it was that, as he said it again today, that unlike an infectious disease where there is

542
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,960
an outside agent that causes the infection, that the problem with cancer is that it's

543
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,480
essentially inherent in your biology.

544
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,040
Even in designing therapies.

545
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,880
I mean, Selena just talked about different therapies.

546
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,840
Because we all start from a fertilized egg.

547
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,840
This egg divides.

548
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
No, I understand that.

549
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:50,720
And in the process, every division gives a possibility to mutate.

550
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,840
And the best cells survive, usually those not fit would be eliminated.

551
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:01,880
But there would be times all of a sudden you have a mutation that has a survival advantage

552
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,480
and those are the ones.

553
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:10,880
And all some of the cancer, for example, one cancer called multiple myeloma, it's found

554
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,200
in the bone.

555
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,000
And often the average age of occurrence is very late.

556
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,240
But now we understand that there is a period of time and it's called emgas.

557
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:28,920
It means monoclonal agomopathy of undetermined significance.

558
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,920
Why?

559
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:37,240
Because you could actually detect a tiny, tiny bit of something and that could take 20, 30

560
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,600
years to develop.

561
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,120
And that's an example.

562
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:47,480
You have something already going wrong, very early on, but there's no general symptom.

563
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:54,760
And I can imagine during the process, 20, 30 years, the nutrition, the stress, the mind,

564
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,880
that everything would definitely influence its progression.

565
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,000
So I'm going to take a walk from there and go back to something that you were asking

566
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,480
about Ed when you were talking about cancer initiation.

567
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,760
And what do we know about how stress affects cancer initiation?

568
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,440
Because it takes place during that 20, 30 years or whatever.

569
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,840
That's one of the reasons why it's so hard to study because you can get 10,000, 20,000

570
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:28,120
people and a small group of them have gotten cancer.

571
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,560
But one of the areas that people are starting to study, which you might be interested in

572
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,480
as a psychoanalyst, is what we call early life adversity.

573
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:46,760
Which is going back to how is a person initially set up when their physiological systems are

574
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,120
very mutable in a way.

575
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:59,040
And there's been a lot of work looking at when people have inadequate mothering, when

576
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,640
they're neglected, when they're abused.

577
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,200
The endocrine systems don't develop normally.

578
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,720
The immune system doesn't develop normally.

579
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:19,320
And so you get a sort of a vulnerability towards later insults.

580
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,280
One of the things that people have started studying in the context of cancer is what

581
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,880
happens when you have an early vulnerability like that.

582
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,440
And then you get stress later in life.

583
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:38,920
And there's a group at Ohio State that has looked at people with skin cancers and they've

584
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:45,720
looked at the skin lesions of people with early life stress, with early, with no early

585
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,800
life stress but later life stress and with both.

586
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:56,960
And the lesions of the people who have had both, and so it's sort of like two psychological

587
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:08,440
hits are where the most aggressive and showed in terms of the functioning of the immune

588
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,880
cells show the most vulnerability in the immune cells.

589
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,160
So that's sort of thinking about early life plus later life.

590
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,240
What's happened along that transition?

591
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,280
I think this goes back also to this notion that I mentioned before of an endogenous versus

592
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,200
exogenous nature of cancer.

593
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,440
Is the nature of cancer inside the cell or is it outside the cell?

594
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
We know that it's both.

595
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,920
In fact, I think the first discovery of oncogene has been viral oncogenes.

596
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,280
That's where the Nobel Prize was awarded to the virus.

597
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,440
The notion that you can actually transfer a gene from the outside environment into the

598
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,720
cell turns out that viral oncogen is in fact something that's been integrated in your own

599
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,840
cells, in your genome.

600
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:01,680
But if you ask about something like smallpox or take HIV or something, none of the HIV

601
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,960
proteins exist anywhere else in your cells.

602
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,280
You can safely hit them.

603
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,280
You can target them.

604
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
You can block them.

605
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,880
You can take a cocktail of inhibitors against every HIV enzyme you can find.

606
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,520
It's not going to affect your own cells, at least if the drugs are as good as they should

607
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,520
be.

608
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,520
So the answer is different.

609
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,320
I mean, all of us spend most of our time figuring out what's the difference between

610
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,600
the cancer and the normal tissue.

611
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:30,080
Is there anything that we can hit in a cancer that's not going to destroy your normal tissue?

612
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,080
And that's just really hard.

613
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:37,160
I mean, you end up with a few mutations and a few differences and a few concepts but compared

614
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,160
to a smallpox.

615
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,160
That's where the question is.

616
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:47,480
So the environmental factor stresses one, but let's say cigarettes more.

617
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:54,360
There are those things that are considered to, if not cause, certainly contribute to

618
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,960
development of cancer.

619
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,520
So smoking causes.

620
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,520
Causes.

621
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,520
Right.

622
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,080
But smoking breaks the DNA inside your own cell.

623
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,800
So it actually induces mutation.

624
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,040
But the other signal, for instance, if you look at estrogen, estrogen does not induce

625
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,240
mutations.

626
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,680
But it's like putting fuel on the cell and inducing...

627
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,280
For the two most saturated roles, faster and faster.

628
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,240
So women who are exposed to estrogen for longer period of life are much more risk of breast

629
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,160
cancer than women are not.

630
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,200
And it's not because of mutations.

631
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,200
It's because of...

632
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,720
Again, going back to the fact that it's the controlling of how many divisions.

633
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:42,400
And that is central integrating whether it's a signal coming from estrogen from your...

634
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,440
And we all work on cancer, we all recognize the importance of location, location, location,

635
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,800
the environment.

636
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,380
Because environment gives you such...

637
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,880
Give cancer cells such support.

638
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,080
If you cut out the environment, there will be one way to remove the cells.

639
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:05,920
And no matter which signal it comes, at the end of the day, it really centralize in three

640
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,240
issues.

641
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:13,200
One is how many cell times this tumor cell able to divide.

642
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:20,640
And second is after division, would they normally die as they are supposed to, or they lose

643
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,160
that control and keep on dividing?

644
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,440
A third thing is they move migration.

645
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,800
And that's the cause of metastasis.

646
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,320
So it goes from one place to the other to the other.

647
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,240
And these are really the three major components.

648
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,720
We all recognize that, but it's very difficult.

649
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:45,480
And if you say controlling that, how your well-being is definitely a very important control for

650
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,480
that.

651
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,480
No doubt.

652
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,560
Whatever reason that leads to the well-being is a good thing.

653
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,920
It's actually the environment, I think, is probably the number one reason why we can't

654
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,480
cure cancer as much as we would like to.

655
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,040
Because right now, the way pharmaceutical companies have gone, and fact scientists have gone at

656
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,040
trying to cure cancer for a long time, is to screen compounds against cells that are

657
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,960
taken out of the body and put in a petri dish.

658
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,480
And they find a lot of compounds that kill those cells.

659
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,960
Unfortunately, when those cells are in the body, they don't get killed.

660
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,240
Or you have to achieve toxicity that kills normal cells at the same rate.

661
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,680
So this is because, in fact, as you mean a pistol in some very seminal experiments,

662
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,320
you know, a couple, about 20 years ago, where she showed that if you take a cell with the

663
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,960
exact same mutation, and you put it in one part of the body, or in another part of the

664
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,040
body, you generate cancer or not.

665
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:39,440
And so it is completely dependent on the signals that the cell gets in addition to the endogenous

666
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,880
sort of disruption of the DNA.

667
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:53,400
And that's why most thinking is that cancer cells are tough, they overtake you, but in

668
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,360
many ways they are also vulnerable.

669
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,600
It depends on the environment.

670
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,960
And when you talk about environment, there are multiple factors, you know.

671
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:14,520
I think, wouldn't you say that someone who has a very kind of cheer for a personality,

672
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:20,280
many times tend to be able to control a lot of things in life and healthier, too?

673
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:26,920
I think this psychology is two ways, it's not one way, isn't it?

674
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,240
Well, I'm related to that.

675
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:35,760
Andrea asked me a very interesting question last night, which was, if will to, how you

676
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:43,320
can measure will to live, and if will to live, because anecdotally physicians report that

677
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:49,640
if patients with strong will to live may live longer.

678
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:59,160
And I've been thinking about that because we have not found a gene signature, for example,

679
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,760
of will to live, it would be very nice.

680
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:12,320
There's actually somebody who has done gene signatures of happiness that has a sense

681
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:18,400
of meaning to it versus a happiness of, I'm going to go out and drink tonight, and those

682
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,600
look differently, and they look differently in terms of, for example, inflammatory profiles.

683
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:30,520
And you know, inflammation being one of the things that adds fuel to the fire of cancer.

684
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:38,160
Will to live would be very, very nice if we could characterize, and maybe that's something

685
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,960
that you can do with your systemic looking at things.

686
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,600
Maybe just to throw out completely as you talk about the route to live in the psychology,

687
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:54,520
just an idea that, again, I know nothing about, but just a completely different track of thought

688
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,160
here.

689
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,120
Cancer cells affect you in a lot of ways.

690
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:04,240
So, cancer patients lose weight because these cancers make hormones, and cancers change

691
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,000
your physiology, right?

692
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,920
I don't know if anyone is looking at how does a cancer cells, how do they affect your mood,

693
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,920
your psychology?

694
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:21,440
Do they have a direct, measurable biochemical influence on your mental state, on your will

695
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,440
to live with me?

696
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:32,280
There's actually a whole emerging area of research in that area because, and there's

697
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,120
a number of people around the country who are working on that.

698
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:42,240
If you think of cancer cells in addition to, you know, they want to grow, et cetera, they're

699
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,720
also like inflammatory factories.

700
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:51,960
And they're producing aisle six, they're producing aisle eight, an audience.

701
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,960
A whole...

702
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,600
Or does neuroendocrine cancer system make or do you have that hormone, right?

703
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,600
I'm sure.

704
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:04,320
What happens when those inflammatory cytokines go through the bloodstream, there is a well

705
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:10,080
characterized syndrome that happens when inflammatory cytokines hit the brain.

706
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:15,880
And if you think of how you feel when you have the flu, which is basically inflammation,

707
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:23,080
you know, people don't want to eat, they lay down, they don't want to talk to people, this...

708
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:30,600
It's hard to concentrate, this sort of lassitude, and it essentially mimics the vegetative symptoms

709
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:38,360
of depression, this sort of fatigue and difficulty concentrating.

710
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:49,120
And so there's an area of research looking at to what extent is the depression that is...

711
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:55,680
That may be experienced by cancer patients, not only secondary to a person looking at

712
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,760
themselves and saying, I have cancer, this is awful, but secondary to this physiologic,

713
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,760
what's called sickness.

714
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:08,200
For many cancers, I think that's a main complaint of treatment and of cancer is this feeling

715
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,000
of depression and tiredness.

716
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,480
Well, let's forget that, caccadesia, for instance, which is basically your loss of body mass and

717
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,840
is one of the fundamental reasons why cancer patients die.

718
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,080
So if you're depressed and you don't want to eat, that's the worst possible thing you

719
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,640
can do to your body.

720
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:31,920
So in some way, the immune system is one aspect of the connection with stress and depression.

721
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,240
But the other one is more of the metabolic, you know, and just...

722
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,240
Yeah.

723
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,520
Your orgasm fed to the point that we can survive the disease.

724
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,680
So is there any work on why some people don't get cancer?

725
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:50,400
It's in our system and the cells are mutating all the time and it's an ongoing process.

726
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,680
So why is it that some people get it and some people...

727
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,560
Yeah, this is actually some really interesting study.

728
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:01,600
Right now, if we send the several labs that are studying why some very heavy smokers don't

729
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:10,920
get cancer and there are very likely some highly protective genes that help you by cancer.

730
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,280
I can engineer a mouse in the lab that's not going to get cancer.

731
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,280
You can work?

732
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,120
I can engineer a mouse in the lab that will not get cancer.

733
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,920
Put an extra copy of P10 or P53.

734
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,920
They will be perfectly...

735
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:31,160
It's a major cancer of a tumor suppressor gene that's called P53.

736
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:36,200
It's one of the major roadblocks that gets mutated in almost every cancer.

737
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,040
We have two copies of it.

738
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:44,760
If you make an animal with three copies, they're perfectly happy, they won't get cancer.

739
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,960
Evolution didn't give us the third copy.

740
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,280
Didn't think it was necessary.

741
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,760
You gave the third copy to human.

742
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,800
How are you going to do it?

743
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,800
It's a lot of things.

744
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,600
Where would you do it?

745
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,600
Well, how soon do you do it?

746
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,200
Where do you do it in the zygote?

747
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,200
Yeah.

748
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,200
You engineer...

749
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,200
Right, I mean, this whole...

750
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,200
What do you mean?

751
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,200
It's a collision.

752
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,200
You have a big box here, right?

753
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,080
Your immune system will not work actually.

754
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,240
In a lab animal, you can do it.

755
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,240
You can get a terminal center, you can do it.

756
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:19,320
You said you didn't make a lab available and it will not get cancer.

757
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,120
Yeah, it's published.

758
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,120
The...

759
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,120
But I think...

760
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,120
The downside.

761
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,120
The cancer...

762
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,120
Oh, okay.

763
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,720
It will not develop those cancer you have tested.

764
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,920
There might be others we don't know yet.

765
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,960
And also, P-53 does many, many things.

766
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,440
I certainly would not want a third copy for myself.

767
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,440
I wouldn't.

768
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,640
I'm not advertising it, but I'm saying...

769
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:51,280
People have made and they have engineered these mice and they are protected from cancer.

770
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,680
There are people that have a third copy of P-53.

771
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,640
I don't think so.

772
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,280
I mean, there is the opposite.

773
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,520
There are families that have mutated one of those genes.

774
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:07,800
It's called leaf romaine syndrome and they are at very high risk of cancer.

775
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,640
But there's another...

776
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:14,160
They're two famous genes called tumor-suppressor gene.

777
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,400
The other is called RB.

778
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,960
And I was discovered when children have retinal blastoma, they...

779
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,960
Every single one of them lose this gene.

780
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,600
And now we know.

781
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:33,040
The difference, I think, is different from P-53 in the sense that we have studied this

782
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,640
for many years and followed the patient.

783
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:42,520
And what we found was both genes at the beginning of the cancer, you lose one copy or perhaps

784
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:50,040
have mutation and during relapse, the P-53 is always mutated or lost and not functioning.

785
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:55,560
But RB somehow often is preserved at least one of the copy.

786
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,320
There are times both copy loss.

787
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:05,760
So that means that perhaps even that gene that is tumor-suppressor gene, that actually

788
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,760
a cancer cell still needed to develop the cancer.

789
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,040
So things are not completely black and white.

790
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,240
It really depends on the context.

791
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,960
So as you do more studies of people's genetic makeup, are you...

792
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:26,840
Are you going to be able to detect what is causing some people to develop cancer and

793
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,840
some people to...

794
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,280
No, we don't.

795
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:38,320
We now know at least in our study, in one case, we know exactly in one type of lymphoma, treated

796
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:47,960
with a very recent accelerate FDA approved drug, what is causing the relapse that we know,

797
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:53,760
as we follow the patient before treatment, after treatment, and until it's relapse and

798
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,760
ask what happened.

799
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,400
Then we put...

800
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,520
Take that gene away from the normal...

801
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:05,920
Not the normal tumor cell and this tumor no longer respond to the drug and everything.

802
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,440
So that can be done.

803
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:14,200
As far as what differentiates initiation, I don't think anybody has an answer.

804
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,320
No, but also I think you're asking a very important question because I think this is

805
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,880
right now, in my opinion, a little bit the failure of the current way of thinking about

806
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,120
cancer.

807
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,120
If you're going database right now, there are thousands of cancer patients that have

808
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,120
been sequenced.

809
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:36,320
So we actually know the mutation that you have across 20, 25 types of cancer, the more.

810
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:43,160
We know also, because of work that Burt Vogelstein did, but a couple of decades back, that cancer

811
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:48,120
is not a single hit with very few exceptions, and even those are probably also not a single

812
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,400
hit, but you know, you need six, seven, eight different mutations that accumulate before

813
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,160
you actually get cancer.

814
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,680
If you go into those databases and you look for the genes that we know today, there's

815
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:04,160
only maybe 20 or 30 percent of the patients that have more than one mutation among those

816
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,160
under genes.

817
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,280
The remaining ones either have just one hit or they have nothing, which means that where

818
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,840
are the six or seven other hits?

819
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,960
They are mutations that are probably what we call private mutations, that is mutation

820
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,960
in genes.

821
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:23,480
There are somewhere upstream of the genes that induce cancer, but you can't find them because

822
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,560
you don't find two patients that have the same exact pattern of mutation.

823
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:32,800
So if you do a very simple math, you will find that there are more cancer genotypes,

824
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:38,040
that is more possible ways in which you could get cancer, than there are cells on the planet.

825
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:43,160
And so what we're seeing right now in patients is just a very, very small sample of all the

826
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,080
possible ways in which you could get cancer, which means that you can't just use statistics

827
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,640
to figure out how it works, because you're not going to be able to find enough patients

828
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:56,480
that have that particular group of three mutations or four mutations that give you cancer with

829
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,520
that particular response to a drug, for instance.

830
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,920
And so the only way to do it, you know, we are at least, that's what we are advocating,

831
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,720
is you have to understand how cancer works.

832
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:13,840
That is how cancer literally works as a microprocessor that has had some pieces disconnected or rewired,

833
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,760
and I have to figure out why it's working in the wrong way.

834
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,080
I think that going after individual mutation is going to be a long way coming before you

835
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,520
can get the full repertoire.

836
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,520
Yeah.

837
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,520
Very, very dynamic.

838
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:30,080
Of course, there are cancers that are easier than others, and actually, the ematological

839
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,400
malignancies are particularly good class of cancer to study because they tend to have

840
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:40,960
fewer mutations than the other, but if you take a melanoma compared to a childhood leukemia,

841
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,680
it's like having your DNA put through a blender in melanoma versus having your DNA with a couple

842
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,880
hits here and there.

843
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:53,560
And that is where we can understand sort of leukemia and we treat them much better than

844
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,560
we can treat right now melanoma.

845
00:59:54,560 --> 01:00:03,040
Well, that part of the reason is that for the cancer in the blood, you are in a position

846
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:10,560
to define which state and its normal counterpart because you can take the cells.

847
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:17,320
For other type of cancer, like ovarian, a breast, it's called solid tumor.

848
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:22,400
You take the tumor, it's not every cell in that mass is a cancer cell.

849
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,880
You have normal cells, you have everything, they talk to each other and it's very difficult

850
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,440
and can go that.

851
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:35,440
But if you take leukemia, you could just take study pure leukemia cells.

852
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:43,360
And then you also have, by the signature, you also know what the normal cell, that's

853
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,520
the normal counterpart and what the normal cell does.

854
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,080
So that helps you understand something.

855
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:55,880
But some of the things we learned in the blood cancer is applicable to solid but not everything.

856
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,080
Yeah, not everything.

857
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:03,200
Again, it gets to the point of location and environment because you're not the same.

858
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:10,960
So you sequence genes of 50,000 people who have reached the age of 80 with no cancer and

859
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,120
compared it to people who have had cancer.

860
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,840
You wouldn't be able to.

861
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:25,360
It would be difficult because as I said that we take our, the normal cells we often get

862
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,160
from patients from the cheeks.

863
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,160
Wow, okay.

864
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:33,080
And so you take mine, take Andreas, take Edo, take Susan, take yours.

865
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,920
I bet our mutations are not the same, normal.

866
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,800
So it's a very difficult one.

867
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:46,160
And I do sometimes think about what you are saying, I mean they were, they are people

868
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,920
who lived to over 100 and they have no cancer.

869
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,840
What if we look at them, their genes, what would happen?

870
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:58,200
It's very difficult because for instance, you know, people have actually done these studies

871
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:06,960
for what we call complex diseases like diabetes, obesity, you know, other major ones.

872
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,240
And you know, even autism.

873
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:15,680
And what they find is that when you look at each individual gene in isolation, you find

874
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,720
thousands of genes, each one with a tiny, tiny, tiny contribution.

875
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:23,800
And so it is impossible to put together the actual pattern because if you have something

876
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,960
that says, oh, if you have this gene, it's not an alteration, but it's a germline variant.

877
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:34,840
If you have this variant, you will live longer, but your ability to live longer is the probability

878
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,760
you live longer is 1.2% more than somebody who doesn't have it.

879
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,760
What do you do with that?

880
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,720
You know, it's just really not an actionable number.

881
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,400
But that's the tail end of the curve, right?

882
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,920
So at the other end, you talk about GWAS studies basically, right?

883
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:55,760
At the other end of the spectrum, you do have things like braka, braka mutations and breast

884
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,760
cancer.

885
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,760
You have it.

886
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,760
It has a consequence.

887
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,840
You need a surgeon.

888
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,520
I mean, you really need to have a discussion, right?

889
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:07,040
So there is this curve of things that are really important and it goes all the way down.

890
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,320
And the more you look, the more you'll find things, of course, that are, you know, really

891
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,760
do we need to do something about this?

892
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,440
No, we're talking about two different things.

893
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:19,400
So for risk of cancer, absolutely agree with you, you know, braka, one, braka, two, et cetera.

894
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,480
What he's talking about is protective alleles.

895
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,200
Protective alleles, I don't know if there's any protective alleles that has been discovered

896
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,360
so far with eye penetrant.

897
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:34,800
And as I said, like in more complex diseases, so breaking the vase, it's easy fixing it a

898
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,640
lot harder and it's much more polygenic.

899
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,000
So you need the contribution of many, many different genes.

900
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,440
That's where you get into this situation where you may have the 100 patients that defeat

901
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,920
cancers, they may do it in 100 different ways.

902
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,160
Well, it's just a flip side of the same question, right?

903
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:55,000
If you can define the risk alleles, then the absence of the risk is the protection.

904
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,120
Yeah, but protective alleles are much harder to find than the risk alleles.

905
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,840
So you can't design that study.

906
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:04,760
You cannot have a population of 100,000 people who will not get cancer.

907
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,800
It's hard to design that study.

908
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:12,200
It's easy to design the study where you say, yeah, I have 5,000 patients with breast cancer

909
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,240
and 5,000 patients who don't have it and I can compare them.

910
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:20,040
We're actually going at that kind of question, but from a different sort of angle, I'm part

911
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:26,920
of a consortium development project that's looking at long-term ovarian cancer survivors.

912
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:35,120
So these are stage three and four ovarian cancer patients who may have a predicted lifespan

913
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,920
of like three and four years.

914
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:47,320
And these are people who have lived past 10 years and we're looking at their molecular,

915
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:52,000
we're looking at the tumors molecularly and we're also looking at their psychological

916
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,160
factors.

917
01:04:53,160 --> 01:05:00,680
And we're interviewing them about what do you think has led to your long-term survival

918
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:05,080
and we're also looking at what's mutated, what's not mutated, et cetera.

919
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:12,240
So I don't have results for you yet, but that's a potential approach to look at who survives

920
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,200
that you wouldn't expect to.

921
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:20,920
So you don't have to result from the gene part, but for the interview part, what have

922
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,320
you found?

923
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,920
We haven't looked at them yet.

924
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,800
We're just collecting data on it.

925
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,800
You're looking at their immune system?

926
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,040
No, we're looking at their tumors.

927
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,200
We're not, at this point, we're not looking at their immune system.

928
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:42,240
But also, I think that this kind of study has not been done, maybe in cancer with the

929
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:47,680
right control, but they've been done for instance in cardio myopathies and now the type of,

930
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:53,520
you know, in diabetes, they've looked at huge populations, 30,000 individuals, you know,

931
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:57,480
and that they're profiled using snip chips.

932
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:00,760
And I think traditionally it's been much harder to find anything protective than to

933
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,120
find something that appears.

934
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,280
The tears are alleles.

935
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,240
They're few, but they're a little bit easier to find.

936
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,520
Protective alleles, I think, is a much more complicated story.

937
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,200
I think it's the same thing with stress.

938
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,240
You can point at stress and you can say that that's bad, you know, psychologically.

939
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,320
And what's the biology of stress?

940
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,000
But it's harder to define the biology of what's good.

941
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
What's good.

942
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,080
I wanted to point to another aspect of cancer in mind, which we haven't touched upon, which

943
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:38,640
I think it's very important, which is that to defeat cancer or you say, what was the

944
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,800
word that you used before?

945
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,800
Just to eradicate cancer.

946
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:53,440
You need great scientific minds and I think that this is a major threat right now because

947
01:06:53,440 --> 01:07:01,320
right at a time where biologists has come, has been empowered by extraordinary tools,

948
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:07,320
both in terms of availability of small molecules, but also in terms of the ability to now literally

949
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:14,600
look at every single molecule aspect of a cell or image of a cell, we are seeing a dramatic

950
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,840
decrease in inflation on the ability to do science.

951
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:24,600
And I think this has been a dramatic setback that I think should be brought out more often

952
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:31,320
and more forcefully to the public attention because we are close to make some real amazing

953
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,320
breakthroughs.

954
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:40,080
Just to give you an example of what's happening, until three years ago or two years ago actually,

955
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:45,640
the number of approved, FDA approved cancer drugs had declined steadily over the years

956
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:50,760
and then the last two years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of therapeutic agents

957
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,760
that have been approved.

958
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:57,600
That's an indication, in my opinion, that something is starting to work and it's starting to work

959
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,200
in a very major way.

960
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:03,240
And I think this is to a large extent due to the fact that we now are empowered by the

961
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:07,560
tools of technology that we didn't have before.

962
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:14,840
It is to me dramatic and overbearing that right at the time where you have these technologies

963
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:21,680
that can, and we have now figure out cancer a little bit as a mechanistic story that we

964
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:26,720
don't know, essentially we see a decrease in the number of students, postdocs and faculties

965
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,720
that we can actually put to work.

966
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,720
And so the decrease in resources.

967
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,720
Resourceism.

968
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:38,360
And actually this is kind of sad because it's at the time we're embarrassed by too many

969
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,360
riches.

970
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:46,360
We have the tool, we have the reagent, and we need the mind to integrate all this information

971
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,640
and that's we need resources.

972
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,640
And it's very difficult.

973
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,640
It's very difficult.

974
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,640
It's very difficult.

975
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:58,720
It's very kind of discouraging to the next generation because they see the future is

976
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,560
so kind of not promising.

977
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,560
Well, there's a reason to...

978
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:08,320
Look, I told you yesterday when I teach my introductory class in Colombia, what I tell

979
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,880
my students is you should be, you should continue in this direction only if this is

980
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,880
the only thing you can do.

981
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,880
If there's any other thing you can do, go do it.

982
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:16,880
Don't do it.

983
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,880
I say the same thing.

984
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,880
I say the same thing.

985
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:25,360
Because I think to do what you do is not a job, it's a passion.

986
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:29,400
Unless you have it, you're not going to be able to contribute.

987
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,600
So you have less people who are more passionate.

988
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,400
I'll give you an example.

989
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:41,840
The average lifespan of a postdoc today, before they could get six to seven, eight years.

990
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:46,480
That's insane because those are the most productive year of a scientist right after their PhD.

991
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:50,760
So it used to be that people were getting hired even out of the PhD.

992
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,720
Yeah, we were at the time when we were postdoc.

993
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,880
Three years later, you become assistant professor.

994
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,320
Now two postdoc is standard.

995
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,120
And that's six years.

996
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,120
And it's struggling.

997
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,120
And it's a very difficult position.

998
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,120
And it's really...

999
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,120
But that's the kind of funding in the sciences that we're using.

1000
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,120
Yes, it's the lack of regeneration of science.

1001
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,120
We definitely are.

1002
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,120
We definitely are.

1003
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:20,280
And that's very unfortunate because it is not an entertainment of your intellectual

1004
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,280
need.

1005
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:27,360
It's actually a time that things can really get integrated to really make a difference.

1006
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,640
So is it nice to have federal funding?

1007
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,640
Is that an issue?

1008
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:31,640
Right.

1009
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:37,960
Well, it's a domino effect because the federal funding is the biggest funding agency.

1010
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:43,440
So the federal funding drops, then they are smaller foundations.

1011
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,640
Then it's a ripple effect.

1012
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,320
Then everybody goes to those foundations.

1013
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:53,520
And all of a sudden those foundations and also those foundations depend on donations.

1014
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,600
The donation is not as robust as it was before because I'm on a board.

1015
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,600
A couple of them.

1016
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,600
I know that.

1017
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,880
It's a very difficult time.

1018
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,880
Very difficult time.

1019
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,920
No, I agree.

1020
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,600
Money is always better than less money.

1021
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,760
There's another side to it.

1022
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:17,560
I think there's an interesting article in Lancet or something maybe last year or so about

1023
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:23,080
waste in research.

1024
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:26,040
I read it and I thought there's a truth to this.

1025
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,040
And part of it is the nature of it.

1026
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,640
You don't know where you're going.

1027
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:36,080
So of course you get lost and you take the wrong direction and it's easier when you have

1028
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,000
a direct threat.

1029
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,200
It's probably less wasteful.

1030
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,560
So that's the nature of what we do.

1031
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,560
Right?

1032
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,160
I mean, it's not predictable.

1033
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,160
So you don't think...

1034
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,160
Yeah, I think it's...

1035
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:50,600
There is also a lot of waste in the system which you look at.

1036
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,160
And you go to some of these meetings and you look at what's happening there.

1037
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:57,960
Yeah, I think it's a vicious cycle because I remember...

1038
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:05,200
I remember when I was a graduate student in the postdoc, you have certain liberty to

1039
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:11,000
exercise your creativity and you don't have to justify what you do tomorrow.

1040
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,120
But now the pressure is so high that everyone is under the pressure.

1041
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,120
You need to produce.

1042
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,120
You need to produce.

1043
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,120
That's part of the reason that things become...

1044
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:27,320
It makes people be very conservative in repeating things that we all know over and over.

1045
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:28,320
And that's actually...

1046
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,400
Taking tiny little steps.

1047
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,400
I think that's...

1048
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:36,400
And often you just look at it and you think, really did we need to do that experiment again?

1049
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,880
It really is not...

1050
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,880
Or paradigm shifts.

1051
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,880
Yeah, it's a...

1052
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,880
Well, it's risky.

1053
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,880
You will not get money from the NIH for something risky.

1054
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,880
Or in a...

1055
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,880
Paradigm shifting.

1056
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,880
No, I mean...

1057
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,880
Yeah.

1058
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,880
Yeah.

1059
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:56,800
Well, as we said yesterday, there are two types of experiments that you do for a

1060
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:03,800
graph, the ones that you've already done and the ones that you will never do.

1061
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,800
Right?

1062
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,800
All right.

1063
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,800
We'll stop here and open up for a question.

1064
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,800
Can I ask a question?

1065
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,800
Please go to the microphone.

1066
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,800
Okay.

1067
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,800
Okay.

1068
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,800
Okay.

1069
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,800
Okay.

1070
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,800
Okay.

1071
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,800
Okay.

1072
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,800
Okay.

1073
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,800
Okay.

1074
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,800
Okay.

1075
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,800
Okay.

1076
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,800
Okay.

1077
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Okay.

1078
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,800
Okay.

1079
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,800
Okay.

1080
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:37,820
I have two questions.

1081
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:42,300
One of them is sort of science fiction and the other is a little more addressed to the

1082
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,920
idea of cancer and the mind.

1083
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,960
The science fiction one arises from what you said about the P-53.

1084
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,680
Gene, why can't we have them?

1085
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,680
Why?

1086
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,160
Why can't the baby is born or when the woman is...

1087
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,320
I mean, can you get...

1088
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,840
That's a science fiction one.

1089
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,040
Can I buy one somewhere?

1090
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,040
Seriously.

1091
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,240
I mean, is there any...

1092
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,240
Okay.

1093
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:13,320
I think being a scientist, you get more and more humbled and modest every day because

1094
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:17,720
we know so little about how nature designed us.

1095
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,840
So P-53 is a gene.

1096
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,960
If you lose it.

1097
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,840
If you consider a cell has to go around a clock to divide.

1098
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:35,600
P-53 kind of the gatekeeper at two points and it cut a sense if the cell should go on

1099
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,600
or not go on.

1100
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,600
Okay.

1101
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,600
This is a tumor surprise.

1102
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,560
But it does many other things as well.

1103
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:47,240
You can imagine if you have more than two copies, three copies, what if your cell just won't

1104
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,240
be able to move?

1105
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,240
You're in trouble.

1106
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,240
You probably would never...

1107
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,240
There's one function actually.

1108
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:55,720
This is important which is the way you develop immunity, right?

1109
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:01,200
Is because your cells, when they see the antigen in the virus...

1110
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,200
They divide.

1111
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,280
No, they actually mutate their own DNA.

1112
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,280
Okay.

1113
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,640
And to do that, you have to suppress T-53 because otherwise the P-53 would kill the cell.

1114
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,160
The moment it is the mutation.

1115
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:15,440
So basically, if you now have three copies of P-53, as soon as it's trying to develop

1116
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,960
the signature for the virus, the cell dies.

1117
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:18,960
So you would have probably...

1118
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,840
I'll make an inducible one.

1119
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,840
I'll put an inducible...

1120
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,840
It's just what inducible.

1121
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,840
Okay.

1122
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,840
That's another...

1123
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:33,600
You can make genes in such a way that they're not active and then you give a drug like tetracycline

1124
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,520
and it switches the gene on.

1125
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:41,120
You can do this in animals and you would put a gene that kills cancer cells in there that

1126
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,120
has cell activity.

1127
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,120
That sounds good.

1128
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:48,560
You activate it and you leave it on for 24 hours or 48 hours or two weeks.

1129
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,560
Whatever you want.

1130
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,560
Yeah.

1131
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,560
Gee, I don't know.

1132
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,560
It's not that...

1133
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,560
It's not that...

1134
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,440
That's science fiction but certainly it doesn't really apply to...

1135
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:00,200
Well, so it doesn't apply to human medicine in the broad sense.

1136
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,080
It does, maybe with some exceptions.

1137
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,320
So some exceptions, for example, are stem cell therapies.

1138
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:12,080
Like we can make stem cells from scratch and we can make tissues from these stem cells.

1139
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:17,560
And for example, if you're a diabetic, we can make from those stem cells insulin producing

1140
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,560
cells.

1141
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,880
There's a risk that these cells at some point give rise to a cancer.

1142
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:27,160
Now while we make these cells, we can put genes like that in there.

1143
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:31,480
We can engineer these cells to have such a fail-safe mechanism that we can then switch

1144
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,480
on.

1145
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,480
Right?

1146
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,480
So that's something that you can...

1147
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,480
In that setting...

1148
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:40,240
I do have diabetes, so I'll talk to you afterward.

1149
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:46,480
The second question is a little more serious and less science fiction, which is I've come

1150
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,120
to a lot of these and the NYPSI.

1151
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,800
I've never before and I could be wrong.

1152
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:59,000
I don't know about a meeting like this about the sort of mind and the disease.

1153
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,960
Diabetes is a good example.

1154
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:07,640
I don't know if you all have ever had a meeting about diabetes and the mind or malaria and

1155
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,120
the mind or anything.

1156
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:15,400
So why does cancer get one of these meetings?

1157
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:23,080
What is it about the illness that generates this sort of psychological interest, whereas

1158
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,080
others don't?

1159
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,520
Or as far as I know, at least not on East 82nd Street.

1160
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,520
Thank you.

1161
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,520
That Susan has to answer this.

1162
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:37,960
I should say that there are plenty of people doing research on stress and diabetes, stress

1163
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:42,120
and cardiovascular disease, stress and you name the disease.

1164
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:47,320
So maybe this is just the first and a long line of programs.

1165
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:52,520
This was serendipitous because it came out of a dinner table conversation that I had

1166
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:57,040
with Ed about the immune system increased role in fighting cancer.

1167
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,360
So we decided to kind of bring this up.

1168
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,560
Maybe one of a series.

1169
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,280
That there is, right.

1170
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,880
Well, it's more life-threatening than the more life-threatening.

1171
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,880
No, I don't think so.

1172
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,880
I don't think that's true.

1173
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,840
But patients react differently if you tell them you have cancer.

1174
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,320
You have two years to live.

1175
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,920
Or you tell them you have emphysema.

1176
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,000
You have two years to live.

1177
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,200
There is a different psychological connotation to cancer than to equally deadly diseases

1178
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,200
that are not cancer.

1179
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:31,480
Well, when I was in medical student, your comment reminds me one of our professors said, whatever

1180
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:37,520
you do, don't say to a patient, yes, cancer.

1181
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,320
Because that's bad.

1182
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,320
I think it's true.

1183
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,320
I think it's true.

1184
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,320
That's the reaction most people have.

1185
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:47,320
The disease comes with a different type of...

1186
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:50,120
First of all, an observation and then a question.

1187
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:56,200
The observation is, as you may have noticed, science this week has the cover story of humanized

1188
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,760
mice.

1189
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:03,400
So they can't psychoanalyse the mice yet, but almost everything else is going to be possible

1190
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,320
to do with these mice.

1191
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:14,000
When I started medical school 64 years ago, they were curing cancer every day.

1192
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Just as we do today.

1193
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,680
Of course, the surgeons can cure cancer now.

1194
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,680
They cured cancer then.

1195
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:26,320
If it was found at a certain stage and could be surgically removed, you were good.

1196
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:30,640
And the thing that always surprised me was that, for instance, you could have a lung cancer

1197
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,240
removed.

1198
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:39,520
And my impression was, well, if this was a four-pack, a year, a day smoker, the cancer

1199
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,880
will recur and the rest of the remaining lung.

1200
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:48,760
Interestingly enough, many of these survivors do not develop a second cancer in the same

1201
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:52,040
bed that they develop their first one.

1202
01:19:52,040 --> 01:20:01,560
Now the question is, and Atul Gawande was here this week talking to us about being mortal.

1203
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:07,960
And I know you're not clinicians, but I'm sure you come across friends and people who

1204
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:16,400
ask you, in this complex era, when metastatic disease is not the death sentence that it

1205
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:24,320
was 64 years ago, in this complex environment, when the times this week had an article about

1206
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:31,160
the patients who are the rare responders, a clinical trial that has a 15% response

1207
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:35,680
rate, we used to say, well, that's placebo, whatever.

1208
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:42,240
Now we look at the people who are in that 15%, and we see that they are different than the

1209
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:46,120
people in the 85% who don't respond.

1210
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:50,640
From the clinical point of view, from the, you said, we're not there yet.

1211
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,600
And that's certainly true.

1212
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:59,680
Incidentally, about the RO1 grants, the average RO1 recipient now is aged 50.

1213
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:03,040
20 years ago, they were aged 38.

1214
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,920
That's the most depressing thing I'm going to say.

1215
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:06,920
Yes.

1216
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:07,920
You do seven-year postdocs.

1217
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,200
That's the result.

1218
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:17,400
What do you say to a patient now who comes in and says, and incidentally Gawande was, at

1219
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:23,640
Harvard now, they are beginning to teach medical students and residents how to sit down with

1220
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:30,000
the patient and really discuss with the patient where he is and what he wants to do about

1221
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,240
it, or she.

1222
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:38,640
What do you say to people in this turbulent era when different cancers are being addressed

1223
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:46,320
in different ways in terms of getting their care because they need it this year?

1224
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:53,800
So we just opened up a Columbia protocol for treating 260 patients in a completely different

1225
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:54,800
way.

1226
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,800
These are going to be across six different rare tumors.

1227
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:01,280
And we're going to treat each one of them individually, but not based on their genetics

1228
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:06,360
because we know that many of these tumors actually have no genetic lesions that are directly

1229
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,560
tractable.

1230
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,080
But really by understanding their vulnerability, what are the entry point?

1231
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:17,480
We use very sophisticated computational models, in fact, an entire basement, one of the largest

1232
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:22,360
supercomputers in the United States just dedicated to solving this problem and then basically

1233
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:27,320
going to a model of the patients that's going to be put in a mouse and just testing what

1234
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,520
the conclusions from that model are.

1235
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,280
We already have some very exciting results that are coming from this type of approach.

1236
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:38,080
So I think that this is not to say that in the future we're going to treat each patient

1237
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:43,080
on an individual basis, but I think what we're discovering with the exceptional responder

1238
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,960
initiative, where we're discovering with this kind of N of one studies, what we're discovering

1239
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:52,320
with this new initiative called basket studies where instead of studying one drug for one

1240
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:57,480
tumor you study an entire repertoire of drugs, each one with its own biomarker.

1241
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,000
What we're discovering is that we need to first deal with tumor heterogeneity and we're

1242
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,760
going to understand what makes tumors different.

1243
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:09,680
Once you have the key to be able to interpret the data, then you'll be able to just collect

1244
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:14,240
all the different ways in which you treat a subset of tumors in the same way.

1245
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:19,040
In the past, we used to think of a tumor, say bladder cancer, fundamentally different

1246
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,040
from breast cancer.

1247
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:25,160
Today, if you actually put together side by side in terms of the actual vulnerabilities,

1248
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,000
what are their Achilles heels?

1249
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:32,240
The basal subtype of breast cancer, the basal time of the bladder cancer and the lumenal

1250
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:38,840
of the two are actually much more similar than a basal breast and a lumenal breast.

1251
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:43,360
I think we're starting to look at cancer very much from a molecular perspective and

1252
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,840
even though we may learn just there was only a small number of responders when you go across

1253
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:57,120
all the tumors, that ends up being a pretty large number.

1254
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:01,480
I've actually been walking around with a source of stress for 10 years now and I'm

1255
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:05,560
not been given a good answer and I hope you can help me.

1256
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:11,680
My son who's now 12, his lymphatic system didn't form properly and he developed tumors

1257
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,120
but they were not cancerous tumors.

1258
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:17,360
At age one, he had a brain CAT scan.

1259
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,560
At age two, he had a chest and neck CAT scan.

1260
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:27,360
Again at age six, he had another chest and neck CAT scan and I am really worried about

1261
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,240
the effects of the radiation.

1262
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:33,680
He's had probably a dozen x-rays in the chest up until now.

1263
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,200
He's 12 and he's athletic.

1264
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,880
I worry about him getting hurt, needing more x-rays.

1265
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:43,560
One of the tumors was not able to be removed from the center of his neck so there's a

1266
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:48,080
possibility that could grow in the future and he would need another CAT scan.

1267
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,840
So I've been walking around very nervous and paranoid.

1268
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:54,360
Is it my paranoia that I have nothing to worry about or is there something proactive that

1269
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,240
can be done before?

1270
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:59,160
He turns 20 and then, God forbid, something happens.

1271
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:06,200
You're like, oh, you have cancer because I feel like he's had quite a bit of radiation.

1272
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,000
Is there anything that could be done ahead of time?

1273
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Could be checked.

1274
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,400
You worry about the adverse effect of radiation.

1275
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,400
Yes.

1276
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:22,320
Well, there is some concerns about that but is it proven that all these normal, I mean

1277
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,520
not normal, these routine scans?

1278
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:30,000
I think the radiation of an x-ray at the moment is the same as a flight across the Atlantic.

1279
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Right.

1280
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,440
So many of us fly back and forth across the Atlantic.

1281
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,320
Yeah, I think it's about the scan.

1282
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:40,320
So even though he was...

1283
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:48,040
I think the advantages of having a scan to have early detection of the lesion far outweighs

1284
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,720
the potential negative effects.

1285
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:54,280
So I think that right now you're doing absolutely the right thing.

1286
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:59,640
And even if something should happen, you should not feel it's your responsibility because

1287
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,160
you're doing the right thing.

1288
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,520
Well, that's why I'm stressed.

1289
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:07,640
I don't want to just wait and think, what was there a blood test or a non-reige radiation

1290
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,520
body skin that could have been done?

1291
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,520
You know, because I've been told different things.

1292
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:19,160
But I think that Andrea just pointed out the fact that the advantage outweigh the concern.

1293
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:25,040
Because you want to follow whatever that might be developing and I'm pretty sure it's reassuring

1294
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,480
if you see nothing is developing, right?

1295
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,200
Well, that's what I'm saying.

1296
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,600
The doctors just say, well, if something hurts, bring them in.

1297
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,280
But isn't it too late once you feel something and something hurts?

1298
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:41,160
You know the underlying condition, is there been a genetic testing for what your son has?

1299
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:45,000
Yes, he has cystic eye gromas, cavernous lymphin jumas.

1300
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,720
There were tumors inside of his body.

1301
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,120
Did he find the actual genetics of that?

1302
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,120
No, I didn't.

1303
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,120
That's it.

1304
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,760
So maybe that's one thing.

1305
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:59,160
There are several institutions right now and the NIH that look at diagnosing at the genetic

1306
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:03,480
level some of these very rare diseases.

1307
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:08,960
And in some cases, first of all, that lets you know exactly what it is.

1308
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,520
And so you can deal with it better.

1309
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:14,600
But also in some cases you may even find that there are potential approaches that could

1310
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:18,520
be taken to either prevent or delay or so.

1311
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:23,720
I think this is something where you may want to consider one of these sort of, you know,

1312
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:28,160
we know at Columbia we just recruited for instance David Goldstein who's going to head

1313
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,080
our institute for genomics.

1314
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:37,440
And he's done some terrific studies at Duke, but at their institutes in Oman, Sinai, many

1315
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,720
other places in the country do these kinds of studies.

1316
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:46,520
And I think Wendy Chong will also look specifically at children with rare planetary genetic disease.

1317
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:47,520
Okay.

1318
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,520
All right.

1319
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,520
Well, thanks.

1320
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:54,960
You know, you point out the difference between science and clinical medical care.

1321
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:00,960
Because in science it's perfectly all right to say, I don't know.

1322
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,960
We haven't done those experiments.

1323
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,960
We haven't studied it.

1324
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,560
In clinical medicine when a patient comes in and looks at you, you can't just say,

1325
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,560
I don't know.

1326
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,560
That's right.

1327
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,560
That's what I went into science.

1328
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:14,560
That's right.

1329
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:15,560
No, nothing.

1330
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,560
You have to be able to find that.

1331
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:19,560
You're saying, I don't know.

1332
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,560
But I know how we can proceed.

1333
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,560
That's right.

1334
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,560
And that's what you've heard.

1335
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:30,360
In other words, you have to accept the fact that there's still an awful lot we don't know.

1336
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:35,400
But you also have to recognize that there are people who are interested in pursuing this

1337
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:43,800
and who will keep pursuing it, because otherwise you will die by Google.

1338
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,800
Any other questions?

1339
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,800
No?

1340
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,800
Okay.

1341
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:48,800
Thank you.

1342
01:28:48,800 --> 01:29:06,800
Thank you.
