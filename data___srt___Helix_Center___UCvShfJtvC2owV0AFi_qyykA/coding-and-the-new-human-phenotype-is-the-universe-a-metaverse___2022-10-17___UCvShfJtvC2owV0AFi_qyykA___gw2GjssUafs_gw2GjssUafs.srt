00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,720
Hi, good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:20,720
Welcome back to the Helix Center and our conference on coding and the new human phenotype.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,640
This is the fifth of four round tables.

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:31,000
In the previous four, I've been fantastic and I welcome our audience out there to check out

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,840
those four round tables that are available on YouTube.

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:46,080
This afternoon we are excited about our topic, which is the universe is the universe a metaverse.

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,280
We're going to hear more about that and what that could possibly mean because maybe the

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,120
title is a bit opaque.

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,840
That's not, but I want to tell you something about our participants before we proceed.

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,840
Elias Dachwur actually helped conceive some of this idea of the entire conference on coding.

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,480
I want to thank him for that.

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,160
He's taking part today as one of the participants.

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,240
He's an associate professor at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,240
He's been researching novel treatments for addiction for over a decade and the support

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,400
of several grants and national institutes of health.

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,720
A special focus of his research has been evaluating sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions for cocaine

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,800
use disorders in both laboratory and clinical settings as well as investigating ketamine

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,240
infusions as an adjunct to mindfulness based treatment, mind body practices, motivational

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,080
interviewing and other behavioral frameworks for alcohol, cannabis and OB use disorders.

20
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,560
He has a more general interest in the impact of contemplative and non-ordinary experiences

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,640
and of the interventions that might occasion and cultivation well-being.

22
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,600
Mr. Fufus is a professor of physics at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, who specializes

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,240
in quantum information theory and quantum foundations.

24
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:19,240
He is an author or co-author of over 160 scholarly pieces, one of which unconditional quantum

25
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,000
teleportation with H.J. Kimball's experimental route was voted a, quote, top ten breakthrough

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,920
of 1998, unquote, by the editors of science.

27
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,640
He is a winner of the International Quantum Communication Award and a fellow of the American

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Physical Society.

29
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,640
He is most widely known for the development of the quantum interpretation known as Cubism

30
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:51,120
or quantum theory is not seen as a direct representation of what is in the universe,

31
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,560
but rather an aid to decision making in the universe where nature is events of a kind

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,520
of ultimate autonomy or creativity.

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,080
Emily Atlam is a post-doctorate associate at the Rodman Institute for Philosophy of Science

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,760
at the University of Western Ontario.

35
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,400
She received her Ph.D. in no divisic quantum information from the University of Cambridge.

36
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,280
Prior to that, she completed the Perimeter Scholars International Program in theoretical

37
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,920
physics and she did her undergraduate degree in physics and philosophy at the University

38
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,760
of Oxford.

39
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,040
She works on the foundations of quantum mechanics and related issues in the philosophy of science

40
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,720
and is particularly interested in approaches to physics which go beyond the time of evolution

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,000
paradigm encompassing a range of possibilities like temporal non-locality, retro-closality

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,160
and all at once laws.

43
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,480

Reprise.

60
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,000
He is known for formulating the quote unquote, heart-public consciousness which inspired

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,320
Tom Stocker to play the heart problem and for the idea of the extended mind which says

62
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,320
that the tools we use can become parts of our minds.

63
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
One minute.

64
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Let me take this.

65
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,920
They know attention that may not mind the curtain.

66
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,720
Okay everyone.

67
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Welcome.

68
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,560
This is really a very exciting topic for us to leave into and I hope we will make a

69
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
leave.

70
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,600
So does anyone want to start off with a general sort of formulation of what it might mean

71
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,200
for the universe to be a metaverse?

72
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,640
Well I'm willing to start.

73
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,000
First of all I would say it doesn't mean what most people think.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,360
At least from my perspective.

75
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,960
My own research has led me to do in this period.

76
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,120
It's quite astounding.

77
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,320
I started from a position of total skepticism.

78
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,000
Having read about John Wheeler's It From Bit which is the information leads to the existence

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,840
of that universe that we live in.

80
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,040
And I remember quite when I was young, first reading it thinking what an insane idea.

81
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,400
So 15 or 20 years ago in my own research I found mathematical evidence of error correcting

82
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,640
codes and what may be the fundamental laws of our universe if ideas relate to string theory

83
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,440
are correct.

84
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,600
And so at that point I concluded that if you think about this stuff long enough you too

85
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,640
can actually become crazy.

86
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:09,040
Coldly better than an idea of this notion that information is an elemental aspect of

87
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
the universe.

88
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Is that true?

89
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,640
Is that a good way to put it?

90
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,800
I don't know.

91
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm a disciple of John Wheeler's that you just mentioned.

92
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,720
I did some undergraduate work with him.

93
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,680
And his thinking went through various stages.

94
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:37,320
He started, I think when it was finally realized that black holes were inevitable, Wheeler

95
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:45,320
started worrying that somehow every law of physics could ultimately be transcended.

96
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,260
So for instance it used to be believed that baryon number was a fixed quantity in the

97
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,080
universe but she threw the baryons into black hole and the number of baryons decreases.

98
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,720
So what was once considered law of physics was transcended by black holes.

99
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:08,600
And so he went through this phase of thinking well this is transcended, that is transcended

100
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:17,240
and he was left with a position where he would say there is laws but the only law is that

101
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,680
there is no law because they're always ultimately transcended.

102
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,320
So law without law was one of his slogans.

103
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,520
And after that he started thinking well if the universe isn't made of particles, fields

104
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:40,240
or even geometry because geometry can become singular what must it be made of and that's

105
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,280
where he somehow landed on the idea that it was information.

106
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,600
And so I took that as my starting point but then ultimately I sort of worked away from

107
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:01,480
that because it apologized information in a way that I thought was unhealthy thinking.

108
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,840
So what we needed to understand instead was that the universe is the universe and then

109
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:13,360
there are thinking beings in this universe and they use information and they use information

110
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,320
in certain ways because the universe is a certain way but the information itself is

111
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,800
not part of the stuff of the universe.

112
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,000
So one can transcend one's mentor.

113
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,920
Yeah I also tend to be quite skeptical about it from the hypothesis because I think it

114
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,080
fails to distinguish between what is in the world and the information that we receive

115
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
about the world.

116
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,520
Obviously we formulate physics on the basis of information that we have received and thus

117
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,200
it's quite natural that the physics we thus formulate exhibits various information theoretic

118
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,880
properties because it's the result of certain epistemic constraints subject that agents

119
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,600
like us are subject to.

120
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,200
Our physics is going to reflect those kinds of constraints.

121
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,920
It's going to reflect the kinds of information we can obtain but that doesn't mean that the

122
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,480
physics is about information.

123
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,440
It just means the physics is formulated on the basis of information and thus it will

124
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,600
naturally have information theoretic features.

125
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,920
Now our topic is the universe a metaverse.

126
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,400
I think the metaverse actually has features that go beyond the simple it from bit idea.

127
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,720
It may have something in common.

128
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,440
I mean the metaverse standardly stands for a virtual world that we create.

129
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,560
I mean Neil Stevenson introduced the term in his science fiction novel Snow Crash back

130
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,280
in 1992 where the metaverse was basically a virtual reality environment that people would

131
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:47,240
go into with headsets and the like and interact with other people and live a at least a partly

132
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
digital life.

133
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,880
Now of course the tech corporations have appropriated this idea and are using it, you

134
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,240
know, meta is now using it as a label for the ecosystem of virtual worlds that they would

135
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
like to build.

136
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:09,400
So when I hear is the universe a metaverse I hear is our universe a virtual world inside

137
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:16,680
someone else's universe in the same way that the metaverse would be a digital world, a

138
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,800
virtual world inside our universe.

139
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,280
I mean that would have elements of the it from bit idea in it because if our universe

140
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:30,640
is a virtual world inside someone else's universe and presumably we're running on someone else's

141
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,360
computers and there's going to be a level of a level of bits there but I think it's

142
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,560
that idea that we're in a virtual world because we're beyond the it from bit idea.

143
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:46,280
The it from bit idea can be understood as saying there's a digital processes in the

144
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,880
constitution of our worlds maybe there's even a digital physics it's a interesting speculation

145
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,080
maybe true maybe false but it's a universe a metaverse it's like it from bit on steroids

146
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:04,520
there's bits and there's bits that we are grounded within a vast universe beyond it.

147
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,880
How could it have been very appealing let's say to Wheeler and there's also what they

148
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:16,440
would and Fred can also bring about this in years back that so since we have most of the

149
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,320
skeptics here it seems about that idea of it from bit that's great that's that seems

150
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,640
like nice to have that sort of consensus but I like the idea.

151
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,200
I can't even put it in a world like it was two and two.

152
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Okay.

153
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,840
Well Jim I'm not interested in us sort of fleshing out just for the just to be fair and honest

154
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,920
with the idea what is it because I think the general audience may have appreciated what

155
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,080
is that even mean to say the universe is made up of information that seems like if you say

156
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
it's made up of atoms you go.

157
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,800
There's quite a distinct so you brought up at Fred Kim and Fred Kim thought that the

158
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:58,480
world was a program running on something the last time I heard him speak was the other

159
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:07,320
the universe is a program running on the other what's the other at well no answer so that

160
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,280
I never found a productive line of thought.

161
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:17,200
Wheeler on the other hand didn't think that the universe was a program running on anything

162
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,720
so when he was saying it from bit he would even say that the only thing that's going

163
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,680
on in the universe is higgledy higgledy which was the first time I'd ever heard the term

164
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,360
and I'd look it up not for the English dictionary.

165
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,680
You know that the universe is just sort of bubbling out of chaos but the stuff that's

166
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,680
bubbling up is information in Wheeler's mind so they're very different world views.

167
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
So the.

168
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,000
Well remember there's no ether right I mean for a long time I've seen we couldn't do any

169
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,680
physics without there being an ether.

170
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Yeah.

171
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680
People said oh there is.

172
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,680
But we still have these waves.

173
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,200
I mean so can you is it is it fair to be critical of him for not being able to come up with

174
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,760
what is I kind of.

175
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Oh you've been Fred.

176
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Yeah.

177
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Yeah.

178
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,200
Is it fair to be critical for somebody who says I can't tell you what the media.

179
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,200
I can't tell you what the universe is but it's running on the other.

180
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,520
You know the other hand you might say they didn't mind of God and how is this more productive.

181
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,880
But that would be my one.

182
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,520
The idea goes way beyond Fred can though I mean Conrad Zusse who one of the inventors

183
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,320
of the computer back in 1943 he were reams manuscript some the idea that physics might

184
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,720
be might be digital and that's what I take to be the core idea of it from bits just that

185
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,760
they're a level of physics which is somehow digital if for example as Stephen Wolfram is

186
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,480
sometimes slow maybe our universe is a cellular automaton running off like a game of life

187
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,800
bits interacted with bits at the bottom level that would be digital physics.

188
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,520
I mean it's probably true but it's not a crazy idea.

189
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,040
It's a perfectly sensible idea that physics could be digital.

190
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,960
Can I even push it back one step further.

191
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,960
So as I said when I in my own work found evidence for error correcting codes possibly in the

192
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:13,880
standard sorts of laws that out in Einstein and Maxwell which is where we business make

193
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,120
out living I had a hard time getting it published that we were finding error correcting codes

194
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,680
in this thing called supersymmetry which is an extension we've not seen in the laboratory

195
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:31,080
but it extends mathematically other position that starts with Maxwell and Einstein.

196
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:37,000
And so when I wrestle with this one of the things that occurred to me is that it's not

197
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,400
just about the digital part because you can all in my mind you can go all the way back

198
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:49,920
to play those allegory of the cave and ask the questions where do we fit in that story

199
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,680
because I'm sure you're all familiar this is a famous parable about these individuals

200
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,280
trapped in a cave that can only see shadows on a wall and they perceive those shadows

201
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,000
and the shadows come from outside the cave and they perceive those shadows as being reality

202
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,320
but when exposed to actual reality they don't know how to interpret and readily what they're

203
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
encountering.

204
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:24,320
And in some sense to me it's really odd that this several millennium year old idea has

205
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,080
been partially realized in where physics has taken us a couple of thousand years later

206
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,080
to me this is a very odd development but one of the things I would caution a group like

207
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:42,720
this discussing these ideas is not to forget what Einstein said about Galileo.

208
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,400
Einstein called Galileo the father of physics because and this is Einstein's word he drummed

209
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:56,960
it into our heads that the way we know about reality is by measuring and observing reality

210
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:05,960
and that if you have a proposition that leads to no measurable outcome it exceeds the definition

211
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
of science.

212
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,680
Well sort of like this idea that's a metaphysics you're doubly a metaphysics but it's in the

213
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,880
interesting that you mention these error correcting codes and I think well if a consequence of

214
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:24,080
your view of the university model of the universe includes error correcting codes that you're

215
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,800
citing and say well that's a consequence.

216
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,000
So you say more about that?

217
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,600
Is there a way to test that or is there other implications of that idea that might be relevant

218
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,440
to theoretical physics today?

219
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,600
But I have a few minutes to think about that and you can ask about other participants

220
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,520
the way I need to think about that for a second.

221
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:52,080
What is reminding us is this space time interval of special relativity that most folks out

222
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,680
there have read a lot about relativity may not appreciate if there's this geometry at

223
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,360
the space time invariant that's a pretty cool mathematical finding and that does confirm

224
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,960
a lot of what happens in special relativity most folks don't realize that that geometry

225
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,120
is built into space life.

226
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah I was going to say that I think Plato is came as a good example of the sense in

227
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,200
which some caution is required in making these kinds of claims because like the observers

228
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,440
in Plato's came we are presumably quite limited our ability to observe things and we are observing

229
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,840
sort of reflections on a wall rather than whatever is causing them and when we speak

230
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,440
out for an distinction between properties of that are sort of properties of the observations

231
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,520
in virtue of the way in which we are situated at our limitations versus properties that

232
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,160
are properties of the world and my concern is that there were these discussions about

233
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,280
it from bit what's going on is that we are mistaking properties of our observations like

234
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,640
the existence of certain sort of epistemological limitations or inter-fee balance and so on.

235
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,480
We are mistaking those things for properties of reality and we need to sort of keep in

236
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,920
mind that the epistemological limitations that apply to our observations are necessarily

237
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:07,960
properties and the observations are ultimately being caused by.

238
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,040
An original criticism of quantum mechanics.

239
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,200
Yes that is one criticism.

240
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,320
Yeah I think it applies outside quantum mechanics as well as not limited to that particular domain.

241
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,760
You challenged me a few seconds ago so I am prepared now to respond.

242
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:32,080
So when I was part of a collaboration three mathematicians, three physicists and we came

243
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,120
up on this very strange discovery for a few years afterwards I would get the question

244
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,280
what does this mean and that's kind of what you just asked me and this has led me personally

245
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:52,520
to ask the strangest question in my career which is if the laws of physics involve error

246
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,520
correcting codes and as soon as someone tells me they see a super partner in some laboratory

247
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,240
I can make that assertion.

248
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,440
If that occurs the question is how in the world did the laws of physics get to error

249
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,960
correction and to answer that question the only way I know how to answer that is to look

250
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,320
at the nature herself as a model and there is only one part of nature that I know where

251
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,960
error correction is discussed is genetics and in genetics the proposition is the error

252
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,080
correcting codes are put there by the forces of evolution and so the question translated

253
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,800
to what I have seen is what does it mean for evolution to act on the mathematical laws

254
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,760
of the universe?

255
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,160
I can state the question I have no idea what the answer would be.

256
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
That's nice.

257
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Thank you.

258
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,320
I am glad to talk about that.

259
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:55,160
There is an old tradition or there is a tradition maybe it doesn't exist so much anymore thinking

260
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,840
that the laws of nature might evolve and I mean we were talking about Wheeler earlier

261
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,600
Wheeler thinking that laws can be transcended ultimately there aren't laws but there was

262
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:13,880
an American philosopher named Charles Sanders Purse who believed that the laws of nature

263
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,000
could evolve and that laws of nature were habits.

264
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:29,160
I mean there is even like a lovely story of Purse's explanation for gravity was that

265
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:36,160
in primordial universe things were going around some things flew out and some things

266
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,000
formed the habit of going around each other and that was the origin of gravity.

267
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,160
It was a natural selection effect.

268
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,440
So this group of philosophers William James, Charles Sanders Purse, John Dewey they were

269
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,440
known as American pragmatists and they were perfectly willing to believe that the laws

270
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,560
of nature could evolve.

271
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:03,840
And there is a nice I mean I am just telling you historical things.

272
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:11,200
There is the great mathematical physicist Henri Poincare his brother-in-law in Neil

273
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:19,120
Boutro believed that the laws of nature could evolve and Poincare wrote a nice essay about

274
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,800
what could it mean for the laws of nature to evolve.

275
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,840
How would you have some kind of empirical evidence that the laws are evolving and he

276
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:34,760
said presently if you see that your theory gives rise to a singularity that this must

277
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,800
be a statement that the theory itself is telling you I can't go forever.

278
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,800
So I thought that was very nice.

279
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:51,960
You could ask yourself about the metaverse and say and some people do they hear about

280
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,960
it they say that's a crazy idea.

281
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,640
And then you as a prominent philosopher have written a whole book about it which means

282
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,560
to some degree you take it seriously.

283
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,440
So why isn't it a ridiculous idea?

284
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,120
Why is it something to actually think about it?

285
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,520
The metaverse is not a ridiculous idea.

286
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,480
The metaverse is actually something that people are trying to create right now in the tech

287
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,920
corporations and elsewhere we have.

288
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,440
But then there's a hypothesis.

289
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,320
I distinguish the metaverse which is about the virtual worlds that we create from say

290
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:41,120
the simulation hypothesis the hypothesis that we're living inside a metaverse or a simulation.

291
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,800
And that's of course an odd idea in science fiction you get it in the matrix.

292
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,440
You also find versions of it.

293
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:54,280
The video's cave is not too far from a version of it, René Descartes talking about the hypothesis

294
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,320
that maybe all this could be a dream, all this could be produced by sensations produced

295
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
by an evil demon.

296
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,040
Yeah the idea that all this is a computer simulation is a successor to that idea.

297
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Why take it seriously?

298
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:14,360
Well one reason to take it seriously is just the idea that there may be many metaverses,

299
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:22,640
many simulations created in the history of the universe, maybe actually many more virtual

300
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,240
universes than non-virtual universes.

301
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,080
Maybe even many more non-virtual people, many more virtual people than non-virtual people.

302
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,960
I'm assuming because I'm assuming those virtual people are actually conscious and having conscious

303
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:47,200
experiences like ours then you say statistically what are the odds that I'm one of the lucky

304
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,840
ones at ground zero, unsibulated.

305
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,120
I think Postam is actually given the statistical argument that we should take this hypothesis

306
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,000
very seriously and the fact that we're now actually creating these universes, I mean we

307
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
don't yet have simulated universes anything like depth and detail of the physical world

308
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,400
but no one would be surprised if in say a century we were getting pretty close to that.

309
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,920
The fact that technology is going there gives us all maybe all the more reason for us to

310
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,360
take this seriously as a realistic possibility.

311
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,640
So I don't advocate the idea, I don't come out and say yes we are definitely in a simulation

312
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,920
but I take it to grand metaphysical speculation about our universe that we should take seriously.

313
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,040
It's an interestingly, you know it's continuous with the infra-bit idea that there's a level

314
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:37,640
of digitality underneath our reality but of course it goes way beyond it.

315
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,600
Sometimes I talk about the it from bit from it idea, the other bits underneath the it's

316
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,720
the apples and particles are made of a level of bits but underneath that level of bits

317
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,440
there may be so much more such as for example the world in which the simulation takes place.

318
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:01,880
So I think about the simulation hypothesis as a version of the it from bit from it idea.

319
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,320
Earlier I spoke about the simulation hypothesis, the hypothesis is exceeding the bounds of

320
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,120
physics at least as I understand it and when I speak to the public in general because I've

321
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:20,680
been many times asked about this I just point out to people that if you take the simulation

322
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:29,200
hypothesis seriously then ghosts are possible because if we're programs running on some

323
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,560
underlying structure when that program is terminated as long as the underlying structure

324
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:42,960
is not damaged you can be initiate that program that's a ghost and in my universe I don't

325
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
understand how ghosts can exist.

326
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Are you guys making backups?

327
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah I have been saying about the simulation hypothesis for the similar reason.

328
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,120
At least when there are scientific contexts I think there are certain kinds of hypotheses

329
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,000
that we just have to pre-mufface you rule out because they prevent us from using empirical

330
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,280
evidence in the usual sorts of ways to confirm scientific theories and I think that things

331
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,760
like the simulated hypothesis this as well as related things like the ever-entert rotation

332
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,000
various things which significantly interfere with the relationship we pursue ourselves

333
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,800
to have with our evidence for our theories just need to be ruled out at the beginning

334
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,840
if we want to do any science which just you know those things could be true but we have

335
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,480
to pursue their long trip we're going to do simple science.

336
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,040
I just want to say some of us here are not scientists for philosophy.

337
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Yeah.

338
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
It would be fine philosophical hypothesis.

339
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
Yes.

340
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
I'm happy with that.

341
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,520
The law of the hypothesis but certainly within the point of view is trying to decide

342
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
to think things on the hypothesis.

343
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,400
I think it's funny because I think even in Descartes case you know people might argue

344
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,920
that whereas he made a way out of this conundrum could it be that the entire our experiences

345
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,840
and generated by a demon etc.

346
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,960
You know he made his way out by I think therefore I am and then the gods perfect and that's

347
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,160
how I got out of that trap.

348
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,160
But you could argue and I accept this that the implausibility of that first.

349
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Anyway that's the way I think it.

350
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,960
The dad really did a lot of the heavy lifting in moving away from that.

351
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,200
Some people think there could be evidence for versions of the simulation hypothesis maybe

352
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,720
not for the perfect indistinguishable simulation but maybe say it's an imperfect simulation

353
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
with glitches.

354
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,160
Jim's colleague Zorri Devoudi and others had a paper talking about what would it look

355
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:35,000
like if we were in an approximate simulation that kind of cut some corners on the equation

356
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and some potential evidence there or if there are glitches like in the black hat that crosses

357
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
your path.

358
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,480
There's evidence potential evidence for the imperfect simulation hypothesis so that makes

359
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,880
it at least maybe continuous with size but once it becomes the perfect simulation that

360
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,960
Descartes was talking about when indistinguishable from physical reality I guess at that point

361
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,880
it becomes philosophy because there's no experiment you can do.

362
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,040
Well yeah from a scientific point of view it's the problem not so much that there never

363
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,200
could possibly be any evidence but more that there aren't really sort of meaningful steps

364
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,640
that we can take to go out and see evidence.

365
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,000
We have to just wait for some glitches to show up or put you know people outside the matrix

366
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,160
to decide to take us out and tell us the tricks you know that those would certainly count

367
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,480
as evidence for that hypothesis were they to occur but it's not much we can do to bring

368
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,000
about those things happening as play to things like this.

369
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,320
We can run our computers really hard and really fight us to try and strain them to the max

370
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,560
to if we burn out those computers and the silly little pieces.

371
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,160
Cool the whole thing to a halt.

372
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,160
People have suggested serious research programs like that but I don't know how serious.

373
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,520
I think I have to point that these kinds of hypotheses also have the consequence that

374
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,880
they're looking back at empirical evidence to do things like try to confirm a theory like

375
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,880
quantum mechanics is kind of pointless because the simulation people can make our empirical

376
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,000
evidence do whatever they like and so there's no mismocation reading anything at all into

377
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,080
one's empirical evidence if one believes that this is a viable possibility so at least

378
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,240
within that kind of domain those possibilities need to be set aside I think.

379
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:16,200
My colleague Dr. Traumriss points out something that many times try to convey to people that

380
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:23,640
if you believe in the perfect simulation then the programmers in that simulation fit exactly

381
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,240
the traditional definition of God's.

382
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,080
And so one gets outside of the realm of science very quickly if you believe in that perfect

383
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,080
simulation.

384
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:46,080
As a great illustration in my book reality class of God creating the universe.

385
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,080
She's a teenage girl and the next universe up looking at her computer and all the galaxies

386
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,080
and nebulas come from there so it may not be a traditional girl.

387
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,080
Could be creative, could be all powerful, could be all knowing about our universe.

388
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:07,080
A reasonable point back about the ghost idea that you cite Jim is that whatever simulation

389
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,080
assuming we live in a simulation process.

390
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Whenever one we live in there's going to be some rules and regulations about the way

391
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,080
whether they're going to be standard ways we're accustomed to the world.

392
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:25,080
And so no we don't have ghosts in our world and while whereas it would be possible we're

393
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,080
at a computer program that ghosts in the world that these computer programmers that's called

394
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,080
the best of all possible worlds of political life that's right.

395
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,080
So they figured out that we're not going to have repeats in this world.

396
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,080
So we don't, that's one of the reasons we're not accustomed to.

397
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,080
We don't rapids that speak either.

398
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Yes but one of the things I, you know, all of us thought about quantum mechanics and yes

399
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,080
this is sarcastic and there's probability that you have you.

400
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:57,080
But I have a hard time thinking about science where arbitraryness is totally arbitrary.

401
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:02,080
And again the perfect simulation hypothesis that teenage girl might one day wake up

402
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:09,080
in this side to change her mind and allow in a thousand years for me to show up again.

403
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,080
Now that might have some attraction to be personally but I don't think that's how

404
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,080
I see no evidence laid for this way.

405
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,080
In my life that science is like that, that our universe works like that.

406
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:29,080
But I wonder if there's any pragmatic value in holding this I think silly belief because

407
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,080
it's not something you can invalidate.

408
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,080
But it might be that it gives some comfort to the believers.

409
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,080
You know just as one finds comfort in religion.

410
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:48,080
Do you find comfort in the idea that you're some young ladies toy?

411
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:57,080
Maybe there's an afterlife here.

412
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,080
I think most people find this horrifying the idea.

413
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,080
At least initially they think oh my god we're under matrix.

414
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,080
The simulation. None of it's real. My life is an illusion.

415
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,080
I don't think that's the wrong reaction.

416
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,080
But yeah I mean it could turn out that we're in a simulation and if so life goes on.

417
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,080
I'm still real. I'm still having this conversation with you.

418
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,080
I've still got relationships. I still have community.

419
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Those are the things that bring meaning to your life.

420
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,080
I don't find the hypothesis as horrifying as some people find it.

421
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,080
I wouldn't say I find it especially comforting.

422
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,080
It doesn't mean that we're all somehow at the mercy of this simulator as we are with a god.

423
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,080
I've got to hope that this simulator is benign.

424
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,080
Surely if you were some presented with good evidence that's what true.

425
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,080
This would affect the decision making processes in some ways.

426
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,080
For me it would significantly reduce my faith that the laws of nature are going to continue working

427
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,080
and the way I expect. I would probably stop predicting things in quite the way I usually do

428
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,080
because the simulator could change their mind at any time.

429
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:05,080
Whereas if I don't believe in a simulation I tend to assume the laws of nature are going to continue to hold them roughly the same way.

430
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
We could consider the system wondering.

431
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,080
From the point of it was doing philosophy I'd say.

432
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,080
We could consider it a very pregnant form of a law of thought experiment.

433
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,080
We just talked about some other philosophers play the whole thing hard.

434
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,080
It's a way to stimulate our thinking about what we think is the ultimate.

435
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,080
What does existence like ultimately?

436
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:34,080
To me that is in fact the value of a scientist discussing the nature of reality with philosophers.

437
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:41,080
In particular physics used to be natural philosophy before Newton came along and turned it into physics.

438
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:47,080
Physics in particular bears a very close relationship with philosophy.

439
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,080
I think of the simulation idea although I find it unacceptable in the framework of

440
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,080
as I understand the way our universe works and physics works.

441
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:00,080
I find it as a tempting driver to make me think more deeply about that.

442
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,080
I think that's the value as a sort of a hard-course scientist.

443
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,080
That's the value that I see in this discussion.

444
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,080
It forces me to think more deeply and to try to find the errors in my thinking.

445
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:18,080
I think there's possibly an intermediate hypothesis which I find a bit more scientific.

446
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:29,080
Rather than supposing that there's a higher consciousness creating a simulation it's the idea that maybe the underlying reality is kind of very different from the way we experience it.

447
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:35,080
Our reality is in some sense that simulation running on some very different kind of hardware.

448
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:41,080
There have been various suggestions that maybe the world has less dimensions than it does and that kind of thing.

449
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:47,080
In a sense in that kind of picture there is something about our experience which is sort of simulated or illusory.

450
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,080
I think that kind of possibility seems a bit more within the realm of science.

451
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Maybe the simulation speculation.

452
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:00,080
I mean there are ways, I totally agree, there are ways that elements of this could be true without a full-scale simulation.

453
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,080
We could dial it all the way back to the it from bit idea.

454
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:08,080
Okay well maybe there's just a level of bits here generating our reality.

455
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Maybe there's something underneath the bits where we don't know.

456
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,080
Well that is maybe it's not a simulation but maybe it's something else that's unknowable.

457
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Some people speculate that that might be consciousness.

458
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,080
Maybe the universe could be made of consciousness underneath the bits.

459
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,080
I call that bit from bit from consciousness.

460
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:33,080
If you look at that further, the idea that for example space could be emergent from something more fundamental than space.

461
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:39,080
Underneath the space this is an idea that's increasingly taken seriously in physical theories.

462
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:48,080
I think it kind of squares in quite interesting ways with the bit from bit idea or the simulation idea that the space we actually experience is somehow emergent.

463
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:58,080
I think about all these ground, they started as a national metaphysical ground, metaphysical hypotheses, but some of them could end up turning into science.

464
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:11,080
We cycle around this, this comes up a lot and it's come up in our other talks this weekend where something like the term information which has seemed to be two phases.

465
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:18,080
One is what there is and is what we know about what there is.

466
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,080
That's a constant challenge for us.

467
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:28,080
I mentioned the original struggles and still for many people ongoing struggles with how to interpret quantum mechanics.

468
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:44,080
The interest in information also I am standing on is that it also arose after Stephen Hawking made the suggestion about how entropy might be related to black hole formation and it's possible.

469
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:49,080
The evaporation of black holes and that fits into this holographic theory I think.

470
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,080
Also, am I right? I'm pretty sure.

471
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
That's connected.

472
00:37:52,080 --> 00:38:02,080
I'm wondering about that, going back to what are the bits and why do these keep coming up and what to say about consciousness and what to say about the universe?

473
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:11,080
I have been thinking about entropy bounds a lot recently in my recent research and the question I keep coming back to is precisely this question.

474
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:18,080
Are these entropy bounds a feature of reality itself or are there a feature of our ability to get information about reality?

475
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:30,080
What the entropy bounds are supposed to say essentially is that within some region of space-time, roughly speaking, the information contained in that region is proportional to the surface area around the volume.

476
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:36,080
A lot of people want to interpret that as an ontological statement about what's out there in the world.

477
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:46,080
But if you think space-time is discretized, there's a sense in which it's a natural kind of epistemic constraint that we should only be able to get information out of a region in proportion to its surface area.

478
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:54,080
So, arguably, that looks a bit like the kind of thing that's an epistemic restriction on our ability to learn things about the world rather than what's really there.

479
00:38:54,080 --> 00:39:06,080
So, it's an interesting question, I think, how we should distinguish between what features of our observations reflect what is really there and which features just reflect our limited perspective on us.

480
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:14,080
Can I take this as an avenue to talk about not just about information, but about mathematics in general.

481
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:19,080
It's often, when often comes across the state with that mathematics, it's that language of the universe.

482
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:29,080
And that's something that I can't quite accept. And I've said in other venues that it's the only human language that allows us to comprehend the universe at a very intimate level.

483
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,080
And it has several hundred years of proving that.

484
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:38,080
But that doesn't mean that nature herself uses that language.

485
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:46,080
So, this emphasis on the distinction between what there is and our perception of what there is.

486
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,080
This is a very important thing to keep in mind, I believe.

487
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:55,080
I think this is crucial when it comes to information, because this word gets used in so many different ways.

488
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:01,080
I mean, there's information in the sense of something we know, some facts that we have.

489
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,080
And then I call this semantic information, I'm going to see a bit of a lot of different information.

490
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,080
I know where the helix center is, it's on 82nd Street.

491
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,080
Okay, that's information. That's something a person has or knows.

492
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,080
Then this information has bits, which is zeros or ones, and so on.

493
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,080
These mathematical entities, these things that might be out there in the universe.

494
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,080
That's not necessarily tied to anything anyone knows.

495
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,080
It's just tied to what's out there.

496
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:32,080
In my book, I call this structural information to distinguish from semantic information.

497
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:38,080
I guess confusing, causing contemporary databases, computer science, the web, these two things go together.

498
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:43,080
People use zeros and ones, the bits to code, facts, things we know.

499
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
I think we've just really got to separate these things.

500
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:50,080
It's a shame. We've got the same words, these two, incredibly important, but totally different concepts.

501
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:55,080
There's bits, there's facts, and these are really thoroughly different from each other.

502
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:01,080
Yeah, also sometimes when people say information, what they mean is number of degrees of freedom or something like that,

503
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:06,080
which again is not the same as bits or structure or semantic information necessarily.

504
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,080
So it would be nice to distinguish those things better.

505
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,080
I can't, as a kind of structural information.

506
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,080
It just seems the name just be two. You know, you can put the bits two ways, there's three ways, there's tricks.

507
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,080
Maybe there's even continuous information for degrees of freedom.

508
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:27,080
When degree of freedom, you could have many bits, but they could be required to be correlated in certain ways.

509
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,080
The number of effective degrees of freedom could be much smaller than the number of bits in your system.

510
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:39,080
I want to go back to this Jim's notion about the self-correcting codes and whether or not it's a reflection.

511
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:46,080
And of course, you didn't mean to suggest it is survival of fittest, strictly speaking.

512
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,080
In other words, not biological evolution, which would be evolution, would be some other sort of evolution.

513
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:59,080
Of course, there have been a lot of mathematical models applied to how there are self-correcting features of the biological systems.

514
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:06,080
And they usually do once again, go back to theories about entropy and dissipation of energy use, etc.

515
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:18,080
And, you know, I'm wondering whether that's a way to get a handle on, in some way, like, well, what would it imply if the universe goes through?

516
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:27,080
I'm imagining the self-correcting change would be something moving away from what you think, and the way the entropy normally would be functioning.

517
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
Right?

518
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:36,080
So, my comment was within the very tight bounds of looking at this thing called supersymmetry.

519
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,080
The mathematical supersymmetry, that's what I've said my entire adult like looking at.

520
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:54,080
And in those confines, this idea about error correction, there's only one, I have an intuitive way which I would never submit as a scientific paper.

521
00:42:54,080 --> 00:43:02,080
And that is that it's my intuitive feel that if there were something like this kind of evolution that we're talking,

522
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:07,080
that would drive the presence of these error-correcting codes into the mathematical laws,

523
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:13,080
that it has something to do with exactly this point about the university evolving.

524
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:23,080
Because the genetics, right, and genetics, the argument is that error-correcting codes are there because if you have two genomes, one with error-correcting codes and one without,

525
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:28,080
the genome with the error-correcting code is more efficient at producing progeny,

526
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,080
because the one without produces progeny that don't survive.

527
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,080
And so, something like that, you know, if you try to map that over to this picture,

528
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,080
then you get the idea that, you know, that this kind of evolution that you wrote up,

529
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:46,080
a quantity talking about the universe of love, that it's maybe literally possible,

530
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:55,080
and that that would be perhaps why we could see this remnant of a set of error-correcting codes showing up in the laws of physics.

531
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:08,080
I found that very attractive picture. Going back to Charles Perce, the universe kind of gets into a habit.

532
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:14,080
It got into a habit of expanding. It got into a habit of having gravitational forces,

533
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:23,080
because perhaps the genome has made this a good fit for things.

534
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:29,080
At least for some amount of time. But of course, there's always random variations.

535
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:35,080
Let's say there is higgly, higgly, deeply in the universe. Things do change.

536
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:43,080
And when things change, the laws that are the most adapted to it, you know, hang around,

537
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:48,080
and the ones that aren't so well adapted to it disappear. That's kind of cute.

538
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:54,080
Going back to this other thing that Jim said about mathematics is the only language.

539
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:01,080
It just reminded me of a philosopher I can never remember the name of,

540
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:07,080
but I read about that philosopher in some essay by Richard Warti. I can't remember.

541
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:14,080
Richard Warti's name. And Warti attributed to this philosopher phrase, or the slogan,

542
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:23,080
that the world is not sentence shaped. So, you know, you can write all you want about the world.

543
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,080
The world itself goes beyond anything that you can write about it.

544
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:33,080
I think it's Derrida. I think it was Derrida. It sounds like something you'd say too, right?

545
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,080
I've been accused of being a doctor, I've lost it.

546
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,080
By people like him.

547
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,080
I was trying to share, well, I think he tried to, you know, whatever,

548
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:50,080
write some sort of background or substance, his way of looking at Derrida's work.

549
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,080
It was Victor Shine who said in the tractage, the world is everything that is the case.

550
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,080
This was like the world is a world of facts, and too many people that suggested a linguistic picture.

551
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,080
But then it changed a lot. He did it, totally changed a lot.

552
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:07,080
It's not a popular view anymore, I think, that the world is sentence shaped.

553
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:14,080
I was recently listening to a lecture by Nikal Gromov who was talking about evolution.

554
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:20,080
And one of the million things he seems to have his fingers on is really incredible.

555
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,080
And he said, you know, evolution is actually very stupid.

556
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,080
You know, he just survived, died, whatever.

557
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:33,080
But a lot of the models we use in creating computer models are, we often think they're brilliant.

558
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:38,080
They do incredible brilliant things. And in some instances they solve problems that we use

559
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,080
biological entities can't solve. It's much faster, for example, it's there.

560
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:52,080
So one challenge to the idea that we're in a simulation is that things move along very slowly.

561
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:58,080
They don't change suddenly with sharp ankles or, you know, and again, maybe that's because that's what we're used to.

562
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:03,080
They change as fast or as slowly as we're accustomed to, and that's normal for us.

563
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:08,080
But, you know, all of us are distorted. If the laws of causality suddenly changed,

564
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:16,080
or there was some other kind of, you know, whatever, those sorts of changes would be possible for a simulation.

565
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,080
I guess that's what I'm saying.

566
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,080
Is that?

567
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,080
I think the simulation might be setting up the simulation, like, why don't simulations,

568
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,080
one in the time, overnight, test out the different levels.

569
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:33,080
And then I hold back to, like, a million different simulations just vary the parameters in the laws of physics and so on.

570
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,080
Let them, each of them run out. They have to come back in the morning, check out the stats.

571
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,080
And then, and then I'll update, that's how the laws of physics evolve, by the way.

572
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:46,080
It's like, okay, well, these ones produce interesting results, so let's focus in on those.

573
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:52,080
But, yeah, no reason why they need to be paying so much attention to every individual simulation that, like, the laws are going to change.

574
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:59,080
But I mean, what grounds do we have for drawing any inferences about what methodology the simulators, if they exist, are adopting?

575
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,080
You know, we don't seem to have any sort of starting point to imagine what their purpose might be or what they're trying to achieve.

576
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:09,080
So I don't necessarily see that we have good grounds in that scenario to suppose that they won't suddenly interfere,

577
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:15,080
because we just have no possible understanding of what on earth they might be able to or what they're trying to do.

578
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,080
It's true. God moves in mysterious ways, so does the simulators.

579
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,080
I'd probably have to know the character.

580
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,080
So maybe you can assume that kind of like us, and then you'll get one from the other.

581
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:33,080
I mean, I just don't see how we have any way to narrow down the space of possibilities, if we allow that kind of possibility to start with.

582
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,080
That's not a symbol like us.

583
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,080
That's not a symbol like us.

584
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:43,080
Right, well, we couldn't do that either. We couldn't assume that they're any, and assume they're anything like us, or if they are.

585
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,080
Just kind of the crane from 26th time, and they'll opt for the secret.

586
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,080
Right, exactly.

587
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:56,080
Chris, as I asked earlier, whether is it possible we will find some sort of comfort in this?

588
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,080
I don't know of the answer that either. Maybe they do. Maybe some people do.

589
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,080
Others don't. Maybe partially. We all do.

590
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,080
But we do know people find entertainment in it.

591
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:13,080
But I know at least one instance where I think some comfort, evidence of comfort, was exhibited.

592
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:22,080
So in 2008, as I said, I, in a group of mathematicians and physicists, found this very weird result.

593
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:30,080
It took us three years to get the papers published, by the way, because we couldn't convince our colleagues that we had done our math correctly.

594
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:38,080
But after a popular article appeared on this work in 2010 in the British Journal of Physics World,

595
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:45,080
there was an online comment by a young man of deep religious faith.

596
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:56,080
And he took comfort in this idea of simulation, because it matched his conception of a benevolent God at work in the universe.

597
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,080
So some people would have taken comfort from it.

598
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:03,080
You know, there's a cute story about Einstein. It may be apocryphal.

599
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:11,080
Or it may not. You know, Einstein is known as the sort of arch-determinist.

600
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:16,080
The universe is just happening.

601
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:24,080
And that we really, we, as people, don't play an active role in the universe.

602
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:43,080
It's a kind of fatalist. Anyway, the cute story is that if you trace his personal letters from the times when he was having affairs on his wife,

603
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:48,080
that he would take a very fatalistic stance in personal letters.

604
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:56,080
And then at times when he was on the street in narrow, he would not use that rhetoric so very much.

605
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:02,080
So it looks like Einstein could find his own comfort in the idea of a fatalistic human affairs.

606
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:08,080
Yeah, I had no choice. I had no choice but to have this affair.

607
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:21,080
I think there are these studies that when people read articles about there being no free will, they're a little more likely to cheat, I think.

608
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:26,080
That's a trouble made me do it.

609
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:39,080
I was wondering when I would go back to the idea of information that was too faced, quality to it.

610
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:47,080
I wondered, you know, Kant wrote a lot about how we apply a certain intuition when we look at the universe and see some things reflected back like space-time and mathematical facts.

611
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:55,080
I'm wondering, because I understand, David, you've written some more about the extended mind, which is another sort of iteration of that approach.

612
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:03,080
What can you logically derive from the fact that we are playing a role in how we see the universe?

613
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,080
Do you want to say something about extended mind?

614
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:11,080
Well, the extended mind is partly the idea that the tools we use become parts of our mind.

615
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:15,080
So this is something we've all gotten so familiar with.

616
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:22,080
So familiar with smartphones, the smartphone and store phone numbers probably taken over from my memory,

617
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:26,080
it navigates for me, it does planning for me.

618
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,080
And so one of us, we live these increasingly digital lives.

619
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:34,080
So much of our minds is now extending out into these digital environments.

620
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:41,080
In this new era, actually, it's the Metavos, where we're going to be pretty sure we're going to be wearing augmented reality glasses.

621
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,080
It'll recognize people for us.

622
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,080
We're going to have to remember everyone's names.

623
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,080
That's going to be useful.

624
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,080
And yeah, it's so much of the computing it's going to take.

625
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:59,080
So then the algorithm between us and our environment is going to gradually become porous.

626
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:05,080
And whether or not the physical universe is a universe of bits, our mind can at least some considerable extent

627
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:11,080
a mind of bits, partly constituted by these computer processes in our environment.

628
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,080
And then the mind in turn, of course, helps construct our sense of the world.

629
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:24,080
That was the big idea for Kant, that so much of our ideas about reality come from, you know, in a constraint

630
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,080
from the way our mind is built to interpret the world.

631
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:35,080
But the way our mind is interpreting the world is actually constantly changing and evolving as our brain is changing a whole.

632
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:49,080
And let me just say I really appreciate your making the distinction between a partial simulation, let me call it that way,

633
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:55,080
and then the total simulation, because the partial one feels a little bit more comfortable to a physical scientist like myself,

634
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:01,080
because I need to, as our colleague here said, I need to have the idea that I can falsify.

635
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:08,080
And I write this as a great definition, one of the great definitions in science is that it's about things that we can falsify,

636
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:13,080
that we don't actually prove things correct. What we do is falsify our belief systems.

637
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:20,080
And as long as you'll give me that partial simulation, I'm comfortable doing that.

638
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:24,080
However, there's another aspect to the metaverse that you keep coming back to that.

639
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:37,080
I've been thinking about for a while, which is the universe, obviously, as we take these external instrumentalities and let them grow.

640
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,080
And of course, there's this thing that you know about called the Internet of Things out there.

641
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,080
Called the web.

642
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,080
The Internet of Things.

643
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,080
The Internet of Things is out there.

644
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:49,080
It's all these smart devices that are embedded in things.

645
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:54,080
They have already become co-evolving because of us.

646
00:54:54,080 --> 00:55:02,080
One can imagine that they will somehow internalize an evolutionary development of their own, that we no longer control.

647
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,080
And of course, that's a frightening idea, perhaps.

648
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:16,080
But when you start talking about things coming our mind going into things, you have to also, then of course, ask a question about those things getting their own mind.

649
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:22,080
Not to mention all these AI systems, these language models, I think you guys were talking about here this morning,

650
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:27,080
that have basically trained that on text, produced by us, all of the Internet.

651
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:36,080
So they start from a basis of us and that they are internalizing elements of us, which they then project into their own mode.

652
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:42,080
As these language models are going to be increasingly systems we're interacting with, that transient building of the world,

653
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,080
started with us, extends to them.

654
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:48,080
And of course, there's already the AIs that do art.

655
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:53,080
We've been following these recent discussions of AIs that produce art.

656
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:59,080
And I have to tell you, there's this one particular incident that I think we've already read about.

657
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:04,080
Human artists in the competition, it turns out that a piece of AI won the competition.

658
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:08,080
I don't know how many of you have actually looked at that image that lives through the winter?

659
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,080
I actually love it.

660
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:17,080
I mean, it elicits an emotional response from me, and I find that extraordinary.

661
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:26,080
So the simulation hypothesis in this issue of the AI are in a way, on to this.

662
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:39,080
In the simulation hypothesis, some other program or control network or creating the world theory.

663
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:47,080
In the AI hypothesis is the computers and programs we create are going to be control.

664
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,080
Because these three ways.

665
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,080
Yeah, maybe both at once, right?

666
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:56,080
Maybe this is a simulation actually put together by AIs in the next decade.

667
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:04,080
And it's absolutely trivial to generate a simulation that we universe like this, because they have so much processing power.

668
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,080
But I think they're right.

669
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,080
They tend to be different ideas.

670
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:14,080
Because if we are actually creatures of a simulation, especially if we're in a pure simulation,

671
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,080
there's a sense in which we are already AIs.

672
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:23,080
We are ourselves simulated creatures, in which case we say, took something in AI and spoke to a bird.

673
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,080
David, have you met my friend Mario? And if you know him?

674
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:30,080
Playing an AI hypothesis.

675
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,080
His universe is the original metaverse.

676
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:37,080
He's a very agreeable guy. He'll do whatever you ask.

677
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,080
He seems happy.

678
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:45,080
Have you seen three guides about video game character?

679
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,080
And basically a non-player character in the video game, all the humans come in.

680
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:53,080
He's like, hey, we, non-player characters, we deserve rights too.

681
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,080
And this is real for us.

682
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,080
Yeah, it's pretty interesting.

683
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:09,080
The idea that we may evolve along with the development of these technologies is something I think has already happened.

684
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:16,080
And we don't realize it because it's something that's been in the background.

685
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:22,080
We talked about this in one of our earlier round tables, namely that our brains have not evolved, apparently,

686
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:28,080
or are involved enough to account for the incorporation of sort of reading and writing centers in the brain.

687
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:34,080
The brains of earlier humans before there was a writing system were essentially the same brains.

688
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:40,080
But now we seem to have these modules of, maybe we should have a block about this too.

689
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:49,080
They're the sort of nodules rather in our brain that are devoted to writing, reading, and sometimes one and not the other.

690
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,080
So there are cases where we've adapted to these technologies.

691
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,080
It's a technology.

692
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,080
So the brain is kind of an all-purpose flower.

693
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:04,080
It's waiting to be baked in any way that we might...

694
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:08,080
The world may not be sent and shaped, but the brain is sent and shaped.

695
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:13,080
Some little bits of it are sent and shaped, but things have to deal with language.

696
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,080
It's what do you think?

697
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:28,080
Well, I have to confess the tedium of discussing what the universe really is, is getting to me.

698
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:35,080
Because I think we began with talking about what it might be.

699
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:48,080
We have dubious access to our categories of understanding or the constraints, the autonomy with which the universe or nature, as you call it,

700
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:59,080
unfolds, that puts us in a very difficult position, as far as being able to make any kind of knowledge claim about it.

701
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:06,080
And I think the technological fetishism that has infected this conversation,

702
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:13,080
aiming to, my simulations have to be somehow technologically mediated, or the simulation devices.

703
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:21,080
Well, at the same time, conceding that our brains are simulating things all the time by virtue of how we process information.

704
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:28,080
We should also consider that we may be in types of simulation that have nothing to do with technology,

705
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:40,080
that have to do more with our myths, the way we organize our understanding of one another, our acculturation.

706
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:46,080
That also creates a bubble of reality, so to speak, a metaphor.

707
01:00:46,080 --> 01:01:05,080
That isn't it for bit or technological, but very cultural centered in the challenges of being ignorant, human, manipulated by power structures.

708
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:11,080
Those simulations are also important to consider.

709
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:19,080
The mind's construction of reality is itself a kind of simulation mind.

710
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:25,080
So much in the mind is constructed, because back to your point about calm.

711
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,080
In a little way, it's not exactly the same idea.

712
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:35,080
The thought itself is a simulation based on a computer.

713
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:41,080
Our experience of reality is actually an interaction between the mind and between the mind.

714
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:50,080
The world that our minds these days are so bombarded with so many different things.

715
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:59,080
We try to construct things in a certain way, and technology is part of it, but by no means the only part of that.

716
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:03,080
That's a quite different sense in which we could all be said to be living in a simulation,

717
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:08,080
but we're all living to some degree in a world which is constructed by our minds.

718
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:18,080
And our minds, talking about psychedelics, can feel and see things under the influence of them completely differently,

719
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:27,080
so that the person feels totally different things about the world themselves, reality, than without them.

720
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:36,080
So there are layers of what actually our mind and our perceptions and our reality really is.

721
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:43,080
I think drugs in general can do that, in art, in conversation.

722
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:52,080
Speaking of hallucinogen specifically, they have much like information to faces,

723
01:02:52,080 --> 01:03:05,080
and there's the way that they can conjure up cathedrals in the mind of new visions, new experiences,

724
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:14,080
and can be pleasing for a moment, can be potentially for some people entrapping psychosis.

725
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:25,080
But they can also move in a very different direction, and dismantle the constraints of understanding of information processing

726
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:34,080
that allow us to organize the world to, you know, there's a notion in neuroscience of prediction coding,

727
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,080
and constantly throwing hypotheses out to the world.

728
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:48,080
Our model of the world representing a best fit scenario, like an error correction, so to speak.

729
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:57,080
But the errors aren't really with anything real, it's to just ensure a kind of coherent map.

730
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,080
So they can dismantle that.

731
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:07,080
And the map that we've constructed for better or worse is torn apart, and there's an experience of something else,

732
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:13,080
maybe the other bad information.

733
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:25,080
But there's a sense of something deeply unknowable, and that, speaking with David about this earlier,

734
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:37,080
the enough ability that often is described in psychedelic experience has also been correlated with much of the improvement

735
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,080
associated with them in clinical settings.

736
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:48,080
So the other is opportunity, perhaps, to relate to what is, but in a way that isn't discursive,

737
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:56,080
that isn't information-based, that is more primordial and relational, can represent for people who are struggling

738
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:06,080
with ossified modes of cognition, opportunity for making the way through the world in a manner that is perhaps less knowing,

739
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:11,080
but at the same time, fear.

740
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:17,080
Can I respond to the less of sentences?

741
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:27,080
As I've been sitting here listening to this discussion, this strikes me as a typical discussion of one of the two minds,

742
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:32,080
because at least as I've experienced life, there's kind of two versions of me.

743
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,080
Here's the rational version.

744
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:42,080
It's the one that basically does the science and asks the questions about the world and navigates my living, continuing to live safely.

745
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:52,080
But I'm also very conscious that there's this thing that used to be called the subconscious, and at least in my career as a scientist,

746
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:58,080
I've actually seen these two things meet, and they meet on the axis of creativity and innovation,

747
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,080
because we do these new innovative ideas come from.

748
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:12,080
And I point to, for example, the mathematician Ramanujan, who accomplished extraordinary things in number theory,

749
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:22,080
and if you ask him where they came from, he would tell you they came from dreams, and that is not the purview of the conscious mind.

750
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:31,080
I was asking a few moments ago about, well, does it give people comfort to think about this topic, the idea of a metaverse?

751
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:36,080
And I said, well, I know at least it's entertaining, and it's interesting to consider, based on what you're saying,

752
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:42,080
and I also saw some people start using drugs to change their consciousness for entertainment.

753
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,080
I mean, we actually call them recreational drugs, right?

754
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:48,080
So that's one of their possible usages.

755
01:06:48,080 --> 01:07:00,080
I really was interested in hearing what people thought about, well, what is it about thinking there's another level of being that we don't have direct access to?

756
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:05,080
Why do people find that so appealing? I think that's a really important topic.

757
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:17,080
I think for me, I mean, as a physicist, like Floss though, it's an important thing to remember, because I think if one assumes that the link between what is observed and what is there

758
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:23,080
is too direct that is liable to lead into a whole of confusion and misunderstanding about what the physics is really telling us.

759
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:31,080
And so I think that as physicists and the scientists, one should not sort of lose sight of the fact that we don't see everything, we don't know everything,

760
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:42,080
and we need to be careful to ever say to distinguish between what facts are about our mode of access and what facts are about the world itself

761
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:50,080
and how to not sort of allow those two kinds of categories to get mixed up and cause mistakes.

762
01:07:50,080 --> 01:08:01,080
We do live in a, I like the importance of the unconscious, this kind of brings back that we do in fact live in a simulation quite regularly, you know, every night.

763
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:19,080
We dream and we enter into a simulation of our own making, a furthermore simulation which is not generated consciously, it's generated by our minds, but almost entirely unconsciously, and then we interact with that simulation

764
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:32,080
and it's very often extremely real and extremely meaningful to us, that gets us out the power of minds, you've got to get the minds power to construct the world, but also the minds power directly construct the world, unconsciously,

765
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:43,080
and that's really an extraordinary creative power, and of course it's doing that every moment in our ordinary, in our ordinary, weaning life as well in our perception of reality, it's just so obvious to us.

766
01:08:43,080 --> 01:09:03,080
I like the idea of extending our thoughts to, I called it earlier, like a sort of an thought experiment, which may be one way of looking at the idea of there being a simulation going on, because there were, because of these mysteries, you know, like some folks like to spend a lot of time thinking about that,

767
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:20,080
and what are the consequences of my thinking along these lines, can I, can I come up with something thoughtful, creative, might actually move physics forward, but even if it doesn't, it's a way for me to think about the world, and it's, so it's an accurate creativity too, and occasionally something that comes a bit so we know

768
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:36,080
that I think it's thought experiments through history, I guess was one of the first to really say, I'm doing a thought experiment here, watch out, no, and no, this is creative, let me think about what it's like to sit on the light beam,

769
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:53,080
and that's a wonderful way for science to proceed, and it's not what do you call normal science, that's the creative part of science. So I'm really pleased that some people are willing to go at it and go at it and go at it, I think it's wonderful for all the rest of us.

770
01:09:53,080 --> 01:10:21,080
I think the question that's been haunting me is whether it is possible to know, so we've been talking about the very illuminating findings in physics, for example, that get us, I think, closer to the nature of how things might be, but

771
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:49,080
if we take very seriously, Kant's recognition that what we perceive and understand are invariably molded by things that may have nothing to do with the nature of things, that it may be an entirely human endeavor, understanding

772
01:10:49,080 --> 01:11:05,080
of which nature has really very little to say. What position are we in? Can we make any real claims about what the world is indeed?

773
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:34,080
I'm inclined to think we can't. I'm inclined to think that one can't, but I'm an American pragmatist, that's why I've heard some of the genuinely, that we do what works, or we try our best to do things, and I'm inclined to think that the laws of physics capture more about

774
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:45,080
our limitations, and going back to the evolution, how can the laws of physics possibly evolve?

775
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:58,080
One game you can play is to say, well, the laws of physics, in fact, are just an expression or a codification of all my various limitations, or us as a species.

776
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:09,080
We can't help but fall. We can get around that, we can have a parachute, or a flying machine, we ultimately can get around some of these things.

777
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:27,080
Well, we can't even get past the problem constraints we like. Maybe that's an expression of our present day limitation, but we are evolving species, and our limitations may be different in the future.

778
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:36,080
Less limitations. So maybe the law of, you know, the speed of light as a constant is something that can be broken.

779
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:56,080
If you just take a different point of view that the laws of physics are capturing how best to proceed the world, given what we've got right now, and that's not a knowledge plane, that's just a statement of more about us.

780
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:15,080
Practical. I think that the connoisseur just made points to something that I try to keep in my mind, and that I try to tell people about science, that when a scientist makes a claim about some kind of ultimate statement, you should take that with an extraordinarily large grain of salt.

781
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:34,080
Because we, in many parts of human thinking, there's this notion of the truth. I like to tell people, when you're a scientist, you will change your belief in the truth at the drop of a fact.

782
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:54,080
So the word true for scientists generally is not what most people call the truth. And therefore, I think that we need to be very, very humble when we make proclamations that we know.

783
01:13:54,080 --> 01:14:01,080
We know subject to our limitations, and that's why I come back to this.

784
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:18,080
I definitely have a lot of sympathy for the view that the laws of nature may have a lot more to do with our limitations than we realize. But at the same time, I'm skeptical that that can be the whole story, because the very notion of a limitation presupposes the existence of some kind of like

785
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:33,080
rigidity that there are things we can and can't do, and those remain sort of consistent over time. And it doesn't really make sense to me that there could be such limitations if there's not some kind of background schema of laws or reality from which those limitations arise.

786
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:47,080
So although I do think it's very important to recognize that the exact form of the laws we come up with probably have a lot to do with our own epistemic limitations, I don't think that means we should, we should suppose that there is no reality or there are no sort of background laws at all.

787
01:14:47,080 --> 01:15:04,080
I just think we need to be perhaps a lot more careful than we currently tend to be to try to sort of tease apart the threads of our science which are about our limitations and the threads which are about one of the sort of modal rigidity is which from which those limitations arise.

788
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:17,080
Yeah, I think there is a world, there's a world outside of a question, and we can find out things about it on the world, you know, if you look at the world, you look away, you look back, it's still there, it fights back.

789
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:27,080
The question is, you know, what can you know about it? We seem to be at least most something ever say, mathematics from science, we can know something about something of its structure.

790
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:42,080
And so can we actually know its ultimate nature? I don't know, I mean, this kind of comes up and I keep out simulation and so on, there's, I'm the mathematics, I'm the big bits, there's so many different ways the world could be, could be consciousness.

791
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,080
It could be another universe, it could be pure information, it could be pure bits.

792
01:15:46,080 --> 01:16:05,080
I guess I'm actually inclined, I think we occasionally get the little glimpses of the ultimate nature of reality, not least through our own consciousness, and maybe that's actually a glimpse of ultimate reality, and who's to say that they can't be special moments of awareness, whether through meditation or psychedelics, and so on,

793
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:25,080
that give you some clearer awareness of that ultimate nature of reality. I mean, it could be possible to know some tiny elements of this, but you know, as much as they sit in each eye, the galaxy, space is big, reality is big, it's bigger than us, we can't expect to know all of it.

794
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:42,080
I think it's a sort of a mistake to want to answer the question, what is reality ultimately made out of? I think that's not the kind of question science really gives us access to, but at the same time I am optimistic that science does continue increasing our understanding of things,

795
01:16:42,080 --> 01:17:00,080
and there have been developments throughout the course of science that have, while not telling us what the world is made out of, at least giving us a better understanding of what that is structurally and sort of moving from our way of thinking things that we thought were different and absolute that we realised we're not so.

796
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:09,080
So I think that we can certainly learn things about ultimate reality without necessarily learning what it's made out of or what the sort of fundamental stuff is.

797
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:20,080
I'm still wrestling with something you said very casually, that there is a world outside of us. What do you mean? What would it be in my world outside of this?

798
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:26,080
There's a world outside of my consciousness, at least that is producing my consciousness.

799
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:41,080
There's a bird, for example, the tree in the court, you look around and you come back, the tree is still there. The next day wasn't in my consciousness, where was it? So there's something, well, back for example God had the idea of the tree in the court.

800
01:17:41,080 --> 01:18:02,080
The next thing that I'm actually doing is that there's a bunch of matter out there. There's even the idea that it could just be another part of my mind or a cosmic mind that I'm all part of that's out there and it's responsible for my experiences of the tree, but at least there has to be something outside my consciousness to explain all these regularities, all these things that my consciousness discovers.

801
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:13,080
It's also, I think, about intersubjectivity as well, the fact that we presumably are all conscious and we're all having experiences and we presume those experiences are related to each other in certain regular ways.

802
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:26,080
The world outside is whatever it is that gives rise to the sit-on-related experiences and produces these relationships between our experiences that are kind of systematizable and relates to us to each other in ways that we can make sense of.

803
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:41,080
And one of the follow-up and something Emily just said and also what you said earlier, Jim, that when you're doing science, you get this idea of truth that's different from the one you might have come into with as a naive, non-science, or just a young person, right?

804
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:56,080
That things like, well, what really is there in the universe and I think some of us, I think all of us probably agree, well, I don't know, that's sort of a woolly question and we don't take that seriously, although we do look like we're earnestly pursuing it in some strange way.

805
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:13,080
I think there's one of the interesting responses to your comment earlier, Elias, was that about the nature being something that we're applying models of understanding that are not in nature, they're part of us, but yes, they are in nature because we're part of nature.

806
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:22,080
I mean, to a degree, you can say something about that and maybe that's one way out of this, part of partial way out of the conundrum.

807
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:27,080
I think it's interesting that we do always want to pursue things like, well, what really is there?

808
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:32,080
I think that's a human nature to ask that question and it may be a slightly childish question, I don't know.

809
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:38,080
I think maybe it is, but it's still something that fascinates us all and maybe why we're thinking about the metaverse.

810
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:53,080
So we have to stop now because I think I imagine there are going to be some questions from the audience and so if anyone has any, would they come up to the microphone?

811
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,080
Thank you very much for that fascinating panel.

812
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:04,080
My question is about it from bits from it and artificial general intentions.

813
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:15,080
You might become here with a concept, it's basically not narrow AI, but AI that will be a singularity and could be the metaverse.

814
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:29,080
And then the point is that the it underneath is us and you said before that the it underneath must be God because it produces something without mistakes.

815
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:35,080
Are we God and if we take that even further the metaverse will come to happen.

816
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,080
I'm curious about the reaction.

817
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:46,080
I missed the clip at the end, if we're God, then we just have fun.

818
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,080
Each is basically all the collect intentions of all programmers.

819
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,080
Yeah.

820
01:20:51,080 --> 01:21:06,080
And they produce that illusion and we are living in because it's that the artificial general intelligence, which is basically the metaverse has basically the singularity that's based in the end station of AI.

821
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:10,080
So this is saying AGI, this is the view on what AGI has already happened.

822
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:18,080
And the metaverse program was actually produced by an artificial general and how AGI is produced by us.

823
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:24,080
So we are, or that the universe or the group of all programmers.

824
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:30,080
If the simulation hypothesis is correct, we are already artificial intelligence, somewhere general intelligence.

825
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:34,080
So we'd be AGI is already inside a simulation.

826
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,080
But I guess the thought is exactly the same could happen again.

827
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:46,080
Once we create artificial general intelligence, which could happen within 10, 20, 30 years on current,

828
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:56,080
given the pace of current developments, it will then be in a position to create the metaverse and the full-scale virtual world far better than we are.

829
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:03,080
So AGI is a possible route to the creation of metaverses of simulated universes.

830
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,080
And we will be God.

831
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,080
We hope you got four those universes.

832
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,080
Absolutely.

833
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,080
Yeah. We have to use that power responsibly.

834
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,080
And not interested.

835
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:16,080
The one we got.

836
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:23,080
Yes.

837
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,080
Thanks for this panel.

838
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:30,080
I'm always excited to go to a panel where the question begins with, is the universe, whatever.

839
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,080
It's always going to be fun.

840
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:36,080
I had the benefit of being able to sort of check on a few things that were discussed during the panel,

841
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:43,080
the first of which was Rorty. Rorty is, of course, famous for claiming that truth is sentence shaped.

842
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:50,080
And I looked it up the idea that the world divides itself into sentence shaped chunks that we call facts,

843
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:53,080
is Rorty's critique of analytical philosophy.

844
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,080
Which I think is interesting because it's an epistemological question.

845
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:05,080
And as I was listening to this conversation, it seems to me that meta has come to me almost exclusively simulation or simulator.

846
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:09,080
Whereas, meta can actually be used in a couple of different ways.

847
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,080
One is, of course, to say that it's a simulation.

848
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:17,080
And I think this question immediately becomes tedious because even if it is, it's still the same universe.

849
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:21,080
Right? A simulation is always exactly equal to itself.

850
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:27,080
So the way that you would test, you would always, how many layers of simulations of simulations would it go back?

851
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,080
It's an interesting question.

852
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:37,080
But in terms of it not being so much ontological but epistemological, meta can also be used to be like the thing about the thing.

853
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:41,080
So, a metacognition is thinking about thinking, metalinguistics is language about language.

854
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:48,080
And this brings me back to John Wheeler, who was very interested in the idea that the universe is observing itself.

855
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:55,080
So, is there a way in which the meta universe or the metaverse is the universe that observes itself?

856
01:23:55,080 --> 01:24:04,080
And this, to me, takes us back to the hard question of consciousness, which is to say is our consciousness of the universe already a metaverse?

857
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,080
Because it's the universe observing itself.

858
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:25,080
I like that. I like that. And I don't know how to respond.

859
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:31,080
I think a minute and do Jim's strategy of think about it for three minutes.

860
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,080
And then maybe I can have a brilliant answer.

861
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:39,080
I like the idea that meta, meta x is x about x.

862
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:44,080
Metacognition is cognition about cognition. Metatheria is theory about a theory.

863
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:49,080
By those lights, metaverse, I thought it's a verse about a verse.

864
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:52,080
The first is a cross-thinking about the universe.

865
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,080
The term universe is the one crossing.

866
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:57,080
So, the metaverse would be the thing that crosses itself.

867
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:00,080
So, we're back to the self-replicit.

868
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:04,080
It means to the side of it.

869
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:08,080
Maybe short meta universe.

870
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:11,080
This is a universe about a universe.

871
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:14,080
Another image that John Wheeler used.

872
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:20,080
I mean, he's famous for having drawn a view for the universe with an eye ball on him.

873
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:25,080
Oh, there's a lovely little spot in his.

874
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,080
He always carried a big notebook around it.

875
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:32,080
I take notes all the time. And in the margin, he sketches this.

876
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:39,080
And he says, I'll have to explain the story of how this came to me two days ago.

877
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:44,080
And then if you look at the notebooks, you can't find the story.

878
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,080
We'll never know.

879
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:50,080
But there was another image that he used.

880
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:55,080
He wondered whether the universe was a self-excited circuit.

881
01:25:55,080 --> 01:26:01,080
And I don't know if that has something to do with what you're talking about.

882
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:10,080
But he was thinking of it as somehow coming back on it's an ouroboros or something for a long time

883
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:13,080
and self-excitation.

884
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:16,080
I actually think longer.

885
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,080
Three more minutes.

886
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,080
He only took two minutes, by the way.

887
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:28,080
I cannot possibly come up with a good answer to that query.

888
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:31,080
But I would offer this as a thought.

889
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:37,080
So I'm 71 years old. I've been studying a piece of mathematical physics since I was in my 20s.

890
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:43,080
It's the same piece of mathematical physics that worries me now that were in my late 20s.

891
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:48,080
And I've thought about the universe this entire 40, 40, 50 years of life.

892
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:55,080
And to me, as we delve in these kinds of domains between philosophy and physics

893
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:59,080
and recognize the relationship between these two fields temporarily,

894
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:04,080
the honest thing I know about the universe goes,

895
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:08,080
apparently the evidence suggests it was started about 14 billion years ago.

896
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:11,080
And this thing we call the Big Bang.

897
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:16,080
It had this period where it blew up from something much, much smaller than Adam to this thing we live in.

898
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:21,080
It underwent transformations in space and time, stars turned on galaxies formed.

899
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:26,080
To me, the honest thing about the universe is that in this entire time frame,

900
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:30,080
it apparently only produces one copy of each of us.

901
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:34,080
To me, this is extraordinarily mysterious.

902
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:38,080
And so in trying to answer the questions about the metaphors,

903
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:42,080
what I have about Adam driven to is, in some sense,

904
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:49,080
why do I as an individual come to be in whatever this structure is?

905
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:56,080
To me, that's the deepest question that I know that I'll never have an answer to.

906
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:01,080
I think, yes, the idea that we are, that's another way of saying what I was actually trying to bring up,

907
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:04,080
distant for the end, and we are part of nature too.

908
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:10,080
So in that sense, yes, we are looking back on nature with our natural selves.

909
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:15,080
Any other questions?

910
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:23,080
There's a neuroscientist in Modafolina who talks about imagination as the physics of the mind.

911
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:27,080
And I find that so beautiful because it's about trying to grasp reality,

912
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:30,080
but also know about all the probabilities.

913
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:34,080
I'd be so upset if we really understood everything about the universe,

914
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:38,080
because then what would we do with our imaginations?

915
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:45,080
And I just wonder how you experience the difference between your speculations and just the play of imagination.

916
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:53,080
I'm willing to respond to that one as opposed to the hard question.

917
01:28:53,080 --> 01:29:00,080
So one of the things that, again, when I talk to the public about how science works,

918
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:04,080
starts with the statement that Einstein made, he said,

919
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:09,080
imagination is more important than knowledge. Many people have heard this statement,

920
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:13,080
but there's a sentence or two after that which, unless you read them,

921
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:22,080
this statement can't be mysterious. And it goes because knowledge encompasses all that we now know about the world,

922
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:28,080
but imagination encompasses all that we will ever know about the world.

923
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:34,080
And so for me, one of the great joys of being a scientist is to understand that

924
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:40,080
my scientific knowledge grows, the rational part that we've talked about as physicists,

925
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:48,080
grows, but the driving force of that is imagination at the boundaries where we don't know things.

926
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:56,080
It's imagination that's driving the growth of that, but subject to the hard test of nature.

927
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:06,080
That's how we grow in knowledge. So without the imagination, that process stops.

928
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:17,080
And imagination is deeply, deeply non-rational. It comes from the parts of me that I prefer one piece of music to another code.

929
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:24,080
There's nothing rational about that, but that's what's driving my rational growth as of being understanding this universe.

930
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:28,080
And imagination may not only exist at the boundaries of comprehension,

931
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:35,080
it may be implicated in comprehension itself and how we understand things, the theories we formulate, what we construct.

932
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:46,080
But it's that play all the time. I see theories have like fossilized imagination as something that's kind of got stuck in.

933
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:56,080
This is an interplay between imagination and rationality, because one imagines world possibilities and one applies rationality to them to ask does this make sense?

934
01:30:56,080 --> 01:31:03,080
How can this all fit together and one pairs down the possibilities that one has imagined to arrive at something which is a sort of viable theory?

935
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:09,080
So the two components come together to produce them as original, but also makes sense.

936
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:12,080
Can't tell we imagine something else.

937
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:16,080
And imagination is both, as you say, more than what we know now about the world.

938
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:22,080
Maybe it's even more than we will ever know about the world, because imagination is not just about this world.

939
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,080
Physics tells us about this world.

940
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:30,080
Imagination tells us about the vast space of possible worlds that we can explore.

941
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:35,080
There's so much to know about that space of possible worlds that goes beyond this world.

942
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:39,080
Even if today, everything we've said is nonsense about this world.

943
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:45,080
And we've still described the possible world, which a number of possible worlds are making that work.

944
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,080
It's a way to solve it.

945
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,080
Which I've recovered a million times.

946
01:31:47,080 --> 01:32:02,080
I want to pick up on what Dr. Gates said that in Jacques Hademard's book where he interviewed scientists, Einstein also said every idea came to him as an image, not as a theory.

947
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:09,080
And it was only his desire to relate and communicate that forced him to put it into theorems.

948
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:17,080
I think that's so beautiful because it's about what you've all been trying to do today in terms of trying to relate to us.

949
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:22,080
And tell us what you think you know and what you know you don't know. So I'm very grateful.

950
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,080
Well, that's great.

951
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,080
Well, I think it's a wonderful point at which we can stop.

952
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:34,080
I hoped that it would turn out the way it did, but this did exceed my imagination. It was a wonderful, wonderful.

953
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:38,080
And I'm glad there's that extra little bit of extra surplus left over.

954
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:42,080
So thank you again, everyone. I hope everyone here enjoyed themselves as well.

955
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:58,080
Thank you. Thank you.

956
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:17,080
Thank you.
