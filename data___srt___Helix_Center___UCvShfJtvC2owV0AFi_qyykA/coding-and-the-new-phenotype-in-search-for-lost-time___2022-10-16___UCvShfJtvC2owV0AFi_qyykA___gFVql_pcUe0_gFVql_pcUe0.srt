1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My current as well is something. My voltage is about the safety.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The voltage is less because the average is less.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It sucks. Yeah, no, he's saying the whole puncher is bad.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
He's saying that us people down here have...

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No, too few. You're right. You're right. I need more holes.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're going to start. We normally have about 50 people in the audience,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but since this is our first live meeting,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I think we haven't been able yet to publicize it enough so that the people who usually come are here.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The idea for... I'm the director of the Center at Nursassian.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The idea for these...

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Between the way also separates our second decade,

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and something in 2012, and then we accepted

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
to have five programs together. It was a pay because

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
it didn't have anything live for the Nurs

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and the other Nurs and something that we sent to the center.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We came to us by more than one of our friends.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And...

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Elias Dockwarch. And then that coding

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
was an important subject and had many angles to it,

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and maybe we should have round tables on that. And Jerry Horowitz,

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
who is the associate director of the Center, then took this and developed

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
amazingly five round tables.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And so today, this morning, we have the first of those,

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and then we have four more, two more this afternoon, and two

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
tomorrow. I want to thank all the participants

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
who volunteered to come here and have a conversation,

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and I leave it to Jerry to introduce everybody, and who we take on from this.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Thank you, Ed. It's a real pleasure to be back here live

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
at the Helix Center.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let me take a moment to introduce our

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
esteemed panelists today. I'll try to make this quick,

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
but it's certainly interesting to thought,

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
maybe I can introduce the idea behind this talk, which I think is a little bit

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
unusual. So the theme of the conference is

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
overcoding.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I thought, when did the interesting start off?

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What did we all come to the idea of what codes are,

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and what coding might be? I find that,

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and this I'm sure is true, a lot of ideas

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
are sort of being concretized now. That means one thing,

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
which is sort of programming and coding, but codes have a long history,

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and what their meaning is, I think, is fascinating.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So we'll take that up. So first,

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Jorgi Bzaki identified a hierarchical

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
organization of brain oscillations and proposed how these rhythms

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
support a brain syntax, a physiological basis of cognitive

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
operations. His work changed how we think about information

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
encoding in the healthy and diseased brain, such as epilepsy and

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
psychiatric disease. Several laboratories worldwide

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
have adopted his framework and provided supporting evidence for the two stage

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
model of memory in both experimental animals and human subjects.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Bzaki is a big professor of neuroscience at

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Michael Novichak is a curator and professor of paleontology

58

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
to the museum's president. From 1994 to

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
2021, he served as the museum's senior vice president

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
on Provost of Science. Awarded a doctoral degree

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Novichak studies concern

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
patterns of evolution and relationships among extinct

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and extant organisms. His interests have range from the fossil

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
record to data on DNA sequences.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He has led a participation, I'm sorry, he has led or participated

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000

Mark Vandemir Koop, oh sorry, Mark Vandemirup

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
is a historian of the ancient near East and

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Besides teaching at Columbia University, he has taught at the University

106

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
articles on various aspects of the

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
ancient near Eastern history, Egyptian history, and world history

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
with interest ranging from socioeconomic and

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
political history to intellectual history. He has written extensively on historical

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
methodology as it applies to his field of study.

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
In these writings, he aims both to present the materials of these fascinating

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
ancient cultures to a broader audience and to explore new paths of research.

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay. I think we're done.

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So, thank you very much.

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So, I guess I'd like to get started with my

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
premise of the talk, which is

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
if one of you or several of you want to discuss your ideas

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
of what coding and decoding means very

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
generally. Because each of you has a certain area of expertise

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
that goes into specific examples of decoding or coding.

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'd like us to start with hieroglyphs, the Rosetta Stone

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
anniversary stuff like that. So, that sounds good to me.

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Actually, the ancient

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
languages and scripts that I may deal with are not the hieroglyphic ones from

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Egypt, but those from the Near Eastern, especially the first

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
system of writing every invented in world history, the Kine Forum

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
writing system. And there we see in

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
the right 30000 BCE, the invention of a writing system

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
that's quite different from what we currently use, the

132
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
alphabetic writing system, but a system that mixes together

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
science, multiple signs that indicate words for parts of

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
words. One of my things that I'm very interested in

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
is actually what that did to the people's

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
perception of the universe in which they lived. Because

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
in the way the conceit of the writing system,

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
the way they conceived of the elements of the writing system,

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
it was not in order to reproduce speech, but it was

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
in order to reproduce reality and

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
reality expressed in writing.

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And because it's very different from the way we perceive writing

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
or alphabetic script, where let's say each character has

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
one particular value or has only a value within the

145
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
context of the other characters, but it's always

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
the say a letter B, as always something to do with the

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
maybe all impronunciation in speech, each character has

148
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
multiple values, values that can sound entirely different

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
from one another, but also that can have

150
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
different meanings altogether. And what you see happening

151
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
in this Knif form script is actually that

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
they play around with a written form of

153
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
anything, a name, or sentence, or something like that,

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and they reinterpret it using various

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
meanings of the various elements. Obviously this is not the case

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
for basic writings, but this is when you talk about scholarly

157
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
text, ritual text, that type of thing.

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So you can take actually a particular sequence of signs

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and give them one meaning, and actually if you

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
give each of these signs a different, you know, different play around

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
with it, you can actually come up with exactly the opposite.

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So you get this, but seems to be, to us, extremely

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
confusing, but actually the depth there is a coherent system

164
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
that enables you to interpret things, and then

165
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
get an understanding of anything in the

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
universe through its written form.

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Well, would you say that there's more of an emphasis?

168
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's slightly less abstract in more material,

169
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
let's say the material nature of the image

170
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
of these... No, it's actually nothing.

171
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So it's a very visual system of writing.

172
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The basic, and the most difficult thing to understand is that

173
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
actually each element within this system has multiple values,

174
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and if you, obviously there's an apparent

175
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and immediate understanding when you read something,

176
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
but if you really want to discover the full truth,

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
the full value of something that is expressed in writing,

178
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
you have to consider these other options.

179
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And so you can take a particular name

180
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and you can then interpret that name.

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I mean, when I said you can interpret it entirely in the opposite

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
that's, that it does happen, but that's perhaps too extreme.

183
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But you can actually see in the name of an individual,

184
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
let's say, of a God, you can find within that God's name

185
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
all aspects of the powers that God has

186
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
in the universe if you read that name properly.

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
How did you feel

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
decoded, you can inform? How much a decoded?

189
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, how did you understand what these various meanings

190
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
that each of these can ask? Well, sometimes they give us this information,

191
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I mean, we have, I mean, they have scholarly material where they

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
it's not back upon their own writings and give

193
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
interpretations of their own writings. There's a long

194
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
textual tradition that goes on some 3000 years.

195
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And so we benefit from the fact that, especially in the

196
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
late appearance of this history, there are people who looking at

197
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
texts that have been produced in the past and who

198
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
make commentaries on these texts. And so there,

199
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
within these commentaries, we can see how they could take

200
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
certain passages and look at these passages and

201
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
give them various interpretations. So you're saying that there's

202
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
an unbroken tradition in Mesopotamia, which is very different

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
than the broken tradition in Egypt.

204
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Well, no, this doesn't go into the modern era actually, the

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
interesting thing. So this system, you have to rediscover how to

206
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
rediscover it in the 19th century of the common

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
area it was rediscovered. And it wasn't, I mean, it was

208
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
already an accomplishment that said to be able to read its

209
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
kind of form text because it wasn't as easy as with Egyptian hieroglyphs where you have the

210
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Rosetta Stone, which gave you an ability to

211
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
understand this hieroglyphic science. But it was accomplished

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
that once we, you know, people were able to read this

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
text also, they became able to, scholars became able to read more

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
complicated text and figured out that they

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
themselves indicated sometimes, well, although you have

216
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
this particular passage, that passage actually can

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
have multiple meanings, or we can explain the meanings that that

218
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
passage has, by looking at how it is written out, not

219
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
by how it is pronounced.

220
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So, let's start with the basics.

221
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Coding is an agreement between the sender and the receiver.

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It requires a cipher. Without the cipher,

223
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
there is nothing. So information is not out there,

224
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
it's not in the sender, it's not in the receiver, it's a relationship.

225
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The information should be packaged and anybody who learns the

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Morse code knows that packaging is very important because the stop

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
science, or you compute the language, or you can, in human languages,

228
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
you have to have methods to say, this is the

229
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
beginning, this is the end of the message, and this is the asset

230
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
which we call cipher. Without a cipher, you can never

231
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
break the code. Shampaleon,

232
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Shampaleon could decode

233
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
the hieroglyphs because he was given

234
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
the cipher, the Rosetta store, and that grounded

235
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
an unknown language to two known languages that he spoke, he spoke like

236
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
ten languages, he was equipped with the

237
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
way to discover things, all my credit is for him, but without

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Rosetta Storne, he would have no clue. Let's see another example, he wanted

239
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
to have examples. Alan Turing is well known, he is

240
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
the core, the core breaker, in fact he didn't break the code. He couldn't.

241
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The core, that is the cipher, was given to him

242
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
by the Polish intelligence service in 1939

243
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
by the Polish post office because they already had an enigma machine.

244
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Actually, he got two enigma machines. The enigma machines

245
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
contain the key elements

246
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
of which you have to reiterate, reiterate, reiterate,

247
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
the same method for Shampaleon, and many other

248
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
breakers used. Now, in the brain,

249
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
we usually read every single cognitive

250
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
science paper that the brain covers information. This is

251
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
nonsense because there is no information out there.

252
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Information is always a relationship between what's out there

253
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and what is inside here. So, actually, without humans,

254
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I challenge you and say, there is no information.

255
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We make things out there and

256
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
keep it as information because we know and we create

257
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
the ciphers. Now, this is very general. You get the fantastic

258
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
particular examples. I'm interested in this

259
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
possibility though that this modern understanding of decoding,

260
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
let's say where there's a key.

261
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The key, yeah, thank you.

262
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The definition of coding then gets to be, well,

263
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
if you know the code, you know how to proceed to try

264
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
to unpack a certain sort of information.

265
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Decipher. Right. But we, I think

266
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
now have this idea that it's a way to be able to know how to speak the words

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
to just say them out loud. But I think earlier on,

268
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
it wasn't just simply a matter of turning it into an oral

269
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
format. Right. Does that fair to say that that wasn't exclusively

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
what it was about? That's exactly what you need to call.

271
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So, when I let, like to send a message, I can do it various ways. Anyways, can do it.

272
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
By the way, you know, our obsession with about the human mind is just a very narrow

273
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
kind of an approach because

274
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
when you generate an artifact, it is a

275
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
message to somebody else. And the advantage of an artifact that it will survive you

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and it can be given to many, many. So, it's a one to many communication

277
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
and forever. And it's very easy to identify human artifacts

278
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
where you go in the desert or anywhere you find anything

279
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
you say, this is natural or this is a human mind. Because we are sensitive

280
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
to those things that are required, the human mind's, and it's

281
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
ability to construct it. So, that kind of message

282
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
is what was, I'm sending messages

283
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
all the time with my eyes and my gestures and so on. Land beach

284
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
was an extraordinary human invention.

285
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And of course, when land beach occurred, then

286
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
some of these guys around the table, including me, were very valuable

287
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
because they are the people who were the ones who accumulated all that knowledge

288
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and carried the information. But when writing was invented,

289
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
that was huge. And then books were invented, that was huge.

290
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And so on. But it's basically an externalization of brain function

291
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
is sending messages to very signals.

292
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There is something that irritates me a lot. There are a lot of people

293
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
in my field to study. So, the origins of writing

294
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and it seemed to, it would say it actually explicitly

295
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
it was not a big deal. Because as you're saying, there's a system

296
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
of communication pre-written or even in parallel

297
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
with writing a system of communication through visual images

298
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
etc or through objects and so on. And they're saying, well

299
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
writing is just a similar thing parallel and it doesn't really

300
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
affect the brain to, to, beyond

301
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
that's what you've been saying. In my opinion, it seems that

302
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
the invention of writing had a very radical impact on the

303
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
functioning of the human brain. And that it made the human brain

304
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
function differently. But I'm not, of course, I'm not like you are

305
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
specialist in this, that it made the human brain function differently.

306
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And what about people that don't read? Yeah, thank you. Please.

307
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
No, just because I, I walk the materials that I work on from

308
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
antiquity are not necessarily sort of look at texts but I also look at

309
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
images because in antiquity as well as in modernity, not everybody

310
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
could read them right. So the fact that you have these

311
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
amazing, uniform texts, whether they're just like receipts of

312
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
things or more extended ones, it still requires specialization

313
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
to be able to, to be able to carve those

314
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
figures in those particular ways and to have that vast information

315
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
at hand and to be able to read it and process it. But sure,

316
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
we're not ever aware that simultaneous could do that. So for those who were able to engage

317
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
in the very specialized elite activities of the

318
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
production of these texts, surely it changed how they thought

319
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and it sort of had a ripple effect on how society is organized.

320
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But for many people who couldn't engage in those things, right, it took

321
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
until literacy, however broadly we describe it, becomes more widespread.

322
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I think it, it probably, it's true. I mean

323
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
the way bring function might have developed would be different in accordance with

324
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
the relationship to those systems, by imagine. There are actually experiments

325
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
in India that are more illiterate

326
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
than needed and the people who were enrolled

327
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
in a two year school, they were monitored with fMRI

328
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and they showed changes all over the brain almost. It's hard to point, you know,

329
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
this is not a verne kind, it broke areas everywhere. But the remarkable

330
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
thing, I think this is what we have to realize that our

331
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
communication or cypher system is based on a generative

332
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
grammar. That is of course part of the, this, this vocal language, but

333
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
one was written, the key thing is that

334
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
how humans figured out in all cultures, 20 to

335
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
35 elements, letters, to describe

336
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
the entire knowledge of humankind. That's an extraordinary

337
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
achievement and of course it was not designed, I remember no smart people,

338
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
just the general smart people, and they devolved.

339
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And that's something that you can call human emotion

340
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
because no other species achieved.

341
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I think what your saying is very provocative. But I'm thinking

342
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
that if Homer couldn't read and write and Muhammad

343
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
famously could not read or write, do you think their brains are working differently?

344
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah. I do think so. You think,

345
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Muhammad who essentially wrote

346
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
or Homer that wrote all this wonderful material

347
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
that survives for thousands of years. He loved to be here. But he didn't, right? Yeah, but he didn't.

348
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Me too. But he didn't, and it was all sung, right?

349
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And the Quran rhymes, and no wonder people, remember it.

350
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But still, I mean, it became written, but it wasn't

351
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
written by them. Christ didn't

352
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
write his stuff down. And yet, so you're saying that there was this

353
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
big transition in a way from

354
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Muhammad to whatever, I forgot the

355
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
name of the person that described that started writing the Quran down.

356
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
They would have two different kinds of brains.

357
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Okay, all right. You're focusing, I mean, unfortunate.

358
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You're focusing too much on the alphabetic writing system.

359
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And there, this is the issue of the relationship between

360
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
oral and the written. And the purpose of the alphabet is to represent

361
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
the oral. Therefore Socrates thought that writing

362
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
was actually a bad thing because it took you

363
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
one step further back from truth. Okay. But

364
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm saying, or arguing, is that

365
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
the kiniform right is system and a hierarchical right is system for that matter.

366
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
They're not alphabetic. And so in the kiniform, which I know very well,

367
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
it's not, the intention is not to render speech.

368
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
The intention is to render something

369
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
reality in writing. Yes, you can make a connection

370
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
to speech, but actually perhaps initially it was not even connected

371
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
to speech. Initially, it may be just, I mean, the earliest

372
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
text we have, there is no clear connection to speech.

373
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It is not a rendering of speech. It is rendering of reality

374
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
in a written form. That then

375
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
adjusts itself that when it comes to people who, with different

376
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
languages, who use this script to start including more and more

377
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
connections. Well, then I think what you're saying is the big jump isn't to writing.

378
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I mean, I know, I mean, well, facetious, but it's not to writing.

379
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's to doing a form of writing that does reflect speech because the reason

380
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
we remember the Iliad or the Quran or

381
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
whatever is because they weren't done in written

382
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
speech with rhyme and meter so that people could retain it.

383
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So, otherwise they would have forgotten. I want to kind of get back to this idea

384
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
that at the origins of spoken oratory,

385
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
but then I think especially writing,

386
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
there was a little bit of a, it meant something to people who were not

387
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
good at oratory for starts. They thought these folks who could

388
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
do this, they were performers, they were special.

389
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And certainly once writing began, those who were illiterate

390
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
formed this gigantic sort of penumbra around the illiterate,

391
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
the literate folks, they saw a lot of these texts as being magical

392
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
but even though they couldn't penetrate it, they realized it was magical. It was something

393
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
magical about because there were experts who could derive things from it. So,

394
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
it's wrong to think that it didn't have any impact at all on the illiterate.

395
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It was this group that was carried along with that.

396
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I want to say one other thing before I forget it about the brain function and that is

397
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
there are these interesting neurological conditions like

398
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Alexia where people cannot read from stroke and other sort of

399
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
brain knows a graphia where they cannot write. They often go together. They always go together.

400
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
We know their brains are the same as brains of people before

401
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
there was writing primarily. Something happened

402
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
there was some transformation in their brain but it's the same brain and it's an interesting

403
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
sort of mystery. For me, the

404
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
perhaps fundamental distinction early languages and clearly writings is that

405
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
the speech is storytelling. It's mostly about what we call

406
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
episodic memory or episodic information. That is, I'm part of the

407
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
agent who is communicating. Whereas the

408
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
early Cunay for writings were very abstract. They were all about semantics.

409
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The semantics is of starting with counting

410
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
the number of bushels, the number of bags of

411
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
wheat and the number of sheep and so on. This is how the numbers

412
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
emerged as an abstracting because it was a practical

413
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
reflection of the activity of the humans who said

414
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I counted sheep. Now, two years ago I was counting

415
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
doing something and the way I counted one, two, three, this is how the decimal system

416
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
was did I, and things like that. Then all of a sudden it occurred to the person

417
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
that in Cunay forms, early Cunay forms, the

418
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
ten bags of wheat has different ten

419
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
than the ten sheep because they specifically referred to the

420
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
referred thing. Later on, somebody said, maybe ten is

421
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
something I can use in counting anything. That was

422
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
an explicit semantic information. Later on

423
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
when the landages became more complicated or complicated but

424
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
more useful, then the storytelling came back also in

425
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
written languages.

426
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
One has narrative text relatively soon. It's relative

427
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
to the first, you know, written, you're talking about administrative

428
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
text and indeed they're the primary, they're the first things found

429
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
but we have narrative texts. Okay, 600 years later

430
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
admittedly, it's a long time on this. The one thing that

431
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
is very important in this, so indeed the administrative

432
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
documents are the primary documents found in the earliest writing

433
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
and this to me is very important. Alongside, there are lists of

434
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
words, lexical texts, or dictionaries

435
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
but they are actually in my reading of them, their study

436
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
of the written word. So it sees it

437
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
as it's not just making, well, what type of

438
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
sign, cuneiform signs do we have that we can use in administrative text

439
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
which actually takes, because they're visual signs and it takes

440
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
it and it plays around with them and come up with nonsensical

441
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
signs. You know, somehow they see that

442
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
there is an ability to create something, a reality

443
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
that is not connected to physical reality and that's purely

444
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
a written reality. Michael, what do you think?

445
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Well, I am. My interest come way before

446
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
language, I should say, and the work but I'm very

447
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
familiar with the need and the concept is

448
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
cipher. On one hand, I've been working for years, trying

449
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to what we call reconstruct the tree of life and the tree of life

450
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
is an evolutionary pattern that now is

451
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
an extraordinary time, at least in the last decade

452
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and a half, that DNA sequences and the genetic

453
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
code is part of that evidence to reconstruct the tree. But DNA

454
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
has certain limitations. 99% of all life that ever

455
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
existed on this planet is extinct. And so

456
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
for those fossils, except with some very few, and my

457
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
friend Sponté Pablo, just won the Nobel Prize, his

458
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
work, you know, except for those exceptional

459
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
circumstances where the code has actually been recovered in

460
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
human fossils or things that are mammoth

461
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
skin and so forth, things that are very quite young, that

462
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
fossil record is really, really out of the

463
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
scope for DNA. So we have to rely on what actually

464
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
happen, the fossils that we find, and that

465
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
as Darwin recognizes, is an incredibly inconsistent

466
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and spotty record. But you mentioned cipher and I think

467
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
what we have are cipher,

468
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
what happens in the advance of recovering this history

469
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
is the discovery of a cipher. So, and indeed

470
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
almost, it's almost a platitude you see occasionally

471
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
where someone will proclaim, oh I have this early hominid

472
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
fossil, it's the Rosetta Stone for human evolution, you know?

473
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Everything is a Rosetta. But the reality is there are

474
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
ciphers, once in a while a fossil is an extraordinary cipher.

475
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
For example, Archaeopteryx, their earliest bird,

476
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
shows the definitive characters of both dinosaurs and birds.

477
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And it's only in the last five or six, well

478
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
the last decade that we've come to recognize that

479
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
birds are not only related to dinosaurs, they are dinosaurs, they're just

480
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
a branch of dinosaurs. In fact, they're a branch of theropods

481
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
that are related to Tyrannosaurus, an overrafter, and a lot of things

482
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
that we've collected in the Gobi. So, you know, that's our cipher.

483
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It was a combination of characters which was recognized by Richard

484
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Owen in the early 20th century. He said, hey look, this thing

485
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
has some dinosaur-like characters. You didn't go much farther than that

486
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
than a John Ostermet Yale went a little further and then

487
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
people like Jacques Cotea and Mark, my colleague, really

488
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
you know, expanded on that. And so

489
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
it's, I think, we're always searching for ciphers, you know,

490
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
in the fossil record. And there aren't too many.

491
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You know, it's a very rare event. That's why

492
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
there's so much attention paid to it. I think speaking for

493
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
the audience, can you say a little bit more about why birds are dinosaurs? That's really

494
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
pretty intriguing. Well, the

495
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
skeletal structure of a, if you, as

496
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Richard Owen observed, if you strip that arkyoptic skeleton

497
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
of, you know, it's preserved in this incredible

498
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
way in the gerolimestone with impressions of feathers. And if you

499
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
strip that off this

500
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
animal, it looks like a small theropod dinosaur.

501
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And it's hip structure, the orientation of the

502
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
pubis, the lower limb and the

503
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
very, very characteristic of a subgroup of dinosaurs, the

504
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
peripod dinosaurs, with the long claws and the extended

505
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
digits on the foot, and

506
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
a whole variety of other characters. So, and

507
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
of course, we discovered in 1993

508
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
with this very incredibly rich sight in the Gobion, and away

509
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
this sight, which we named Uka-To-God, the whole sight is a

510
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
cipher because it's preserved

511
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
hundreds of skeletons of dinosaurs, little mammals and lizards.

512
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And compared to what we have

513
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and what we found in Mongolia, in

514
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
North America, a lot of those animals, especially the smaller ones,

515
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
are represented only by isolated teeth and jaws.

516
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We knew nothing about what they look like as whole animals.

517
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
We called those fossil spare parts because, you know, you have to

518
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
put everything together. Well, we discovered that

519
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
these overrafters were nesting.

520
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
We discovered the first nesting dinosaurs, and they were on a clutch of eggs,

521
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and the eggs were always in an architectural

522
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
arrangement. And these dinosaurs

523
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
were capable, just like birds, of parental

524
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
care of their nests. So, there was once in

525
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
place, there was a window open to dinosaur behavior that

526
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
we never expected to find, once again, that kind of

527
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
and once again reinforcing the relationship between these

528
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
dinosaurs and living birds.

529
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Just to amplify this point, how important this to have

530
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
a key or a cipher, the

531
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
ciphers lead to game-changing ways,

532
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
and the framework through which we see the world. As an example,

533
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
our effects on the philosopher introduced

534
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
a term called Alan Vitale. Nobody knows the young people

535
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I'm talking about. Alan Vitale was the most

536
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
critical thing in the two centuries ago, because

537
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
it was impossible to explain

538
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
or conceive how from a seed you can make a tree

539
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
or a woman sperm you can make a human.

540
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
That must be a driving saw. Alan Vitale is a

541
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
drive of life. And it led

542
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
nowhere. All of a sudden DNA came around, it was a game changer.

543
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Nobody talks about Alan Vitale anymore. Everything is explained, because

544
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
we shifted to a different framework from where things are

545
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
explained in a self-explanatory manner. Well, precisely, Darwin had

546
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
his theory of natural selection as solid,

547
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
but his mechanism for it is completely wrong, because he didn't have

548
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
that cipher. But I want to make a point about ciphers, because the

549
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
cipher you referred to earlier, Jorgi, about

550
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
the Rosetta Stone, was an explicit like this equals this,

551
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
that equals that. There has been the

552
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
ciphering that's going on here, clearly there's no key. There's no explicit

553
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
key in what you're doing in paleontology.

554
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
There are other methods that people have that try to make some sense

555
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
of decoding what is going on. So there's frequency,

556
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
the chronology, things of that nature. And also, am I wrong

557
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
about this, so linear B also was decoded

558
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
without an explicit key. Yeah, it is the code in the right.

559
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The frequency of the appearance of certain units, elements

560
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
in the language, is used as a kind of a way to build up a key.

561
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
How often in the information being imparted

562
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
does what we think which would be, the letter E appears much more

563
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
than other letters, the letter Z, not very much, except in your name.

564
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And mine is this part of it because everything

565
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
in nature is log normally distributed. The edges are the right end of this

566
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
q distribution. Exactly. No, but those sort of frequency

567
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
analyses and chronologies do help to build up

568
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
a sort of a key which doesn't necessarily, well, which is the best we can do.

569
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But in order to do so, don't you need to have an understanding

570
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
of the general structure because indeed the letter E is

571
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
more common than the letter Z within the structure

572
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
of language. And those are the three words that are frequently used,

573
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
but not really changing or changing much slower

574
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
over the time of humankind. So they give you a language

575
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
when you are looking for common words in

576
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Finoyuri for example, then we have a bunch of words

577
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
that are very basic and frequently used over centuries

578
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
such as blood, fingers and so on. And the rare

579
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
words are changing meaning a lot. Many Greek words

580
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
are used today in a totally different connotation, like

581
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
empathy. Everybody knows what empathy is. The real use in Greek is called

582
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
disgust. So all these

583
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
transformations happen because of the way how we

584
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
use language in everyday life. And these numbers or the

585
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
frequency distributions are very important tools to dig out

586
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
what are the common and what are the unique elements of changing

587
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
language. Also I think you need a context for interpreting

588
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
the key to recognize that key. So just thinking

589
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
back, forgive me about the fossil record,

590
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
there had to be, someone had to present

591
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
the idea that these things took place

592
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
over enormous amounts of time and that was a huge controversy. There was

593
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
an evidence directly for the age. We didn't have radiometric

594
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
dating or anything like that. There was basically

595
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
a concept of time with

596
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
being in this enormous expanse. And it

597
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
was rejected by most intellectuals of the time

598
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
until it finally took hold. So you needed some kind of

599
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
context to interpret even those

600
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
fossils, those cypress people were finding fossils during that time.

601
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And thinking that maybe they were

602
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
casualties that didn't make it on the arc. So

603
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
you had to have some kind of context for interpreting the cypress

604
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
in the beginning and then first place.

605
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I appreciate to imagine it as a type of patterning

606
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
to the types of materials that I work on

607
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
and the way that I work on them. There is no cipher because I'm

608
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
approaching it from sort of a cultural angle. So some of these

609
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
things resemble letters and some of these things resemble pictures. This really

610
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
just paying attention to the precise spatial context and sort of

611
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
broader practical context. And looking at patterns in the distribution that

612
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
enabled us to sort of create some sort of framework but interpreting them

613
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
because otherwise there is no interpretation. It's not, you know, they're not

614
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
words to represent something necessarily. What are those texts that you're referring to?

615
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
A lot of my research is on graffiti in Aramaic

616
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
or Greek in Syria and

617
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the antiquity or the Middle East. And ways in which, I mean

618
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
to sort of park them back to us. You described it these

619
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
ways that people produce artifacts. We just don't know necessarily what

620
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
they're trying to communicate sometime except the patterns

621
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
and their distribution can be helpful. If they're graffiti and burial caves or

622
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
in places of prayer or worship or something like that. But

623
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
these are humans who might not have been able to

624
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
write a record of how many sheep or how many, well maybe

625
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
if it was a very limited vocabulary they could, but they're trying to express something.

626
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I mean they're trying to commemorate a moment, an idea

627
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
and it's sort of trying to get a sense of what, why they're creating this sort of

628
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
artifact of presence or ideation or something.

629
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
How do you know you are writing? I don't. So because that's the, without

630
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
the cipher you have a consensus approach.

631
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
That was a wonderful expression of burning man that I often use.

632
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
That reality or the truth is what we all dream about together.

633
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That's a wonderful expression except it's useless

634
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
because everything that we would like to define

635
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
has to be grounded one way or another. I have to communicate that

636
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
grounding to other cultures because other, no, your classic

637
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
or any classification can happen only from a point of view

638
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
from a classifier's point of view. Now we have, it can be classified in millions

639
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
where it's, you know, you have a beard, you have short hairs and so on.

640
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
That's really nice. So that kind of

641
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
classification is useful and then somebody comes in a different

642
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
framework and said, for sure. But then

643
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
you could say, well Ben what do we do? Do we just need to laugh?

644
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I absolutely, I think that's why it's important to

645
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
create a sort of record your own framework of interpretation.

646
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
As long as we know that we are in a temporary

647
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
particular mindset, then it's, then it's okay.

648
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
This shouldn't bring us to time because you just

649
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
mentioned that people don't have, didn't have the concept of

650
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
very long time because human perception and

651
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
animals perception is based on this cute rule that

652
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
10,000 years for me is the same as the million years.

653
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
There is no way I can.

654
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
When I was a boy, as a kid, I was

655
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
obsessed by this issue. I just didn't understand

656
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
how you could understand time. And my parents took me to the

657
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Grand Canyon. And I said, oh wow, I think I finally

658
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
got it because this is this immense place.

659
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And it starts the bottom of the canyon. It's pre-cambrian

660
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
rockets, goes back billions of years. And then it goes to the top.

661
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And then I realized the youngest rocks in the canyon were 200

662
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
billion years old. The stuff at the top. So there was even more.

663
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I just, I can't wrap my head around that. And I still think,

664
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
even though we can date those rocks and even though we can

665
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
recover these lost communities and so forth from

666
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
eons ago, I still think

667
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
we don't quite perceive what that means.

668
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
We don't know what that means.

669
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
As a young boy, was somebody like humans

670
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
200,000 years ago. We had a vague concept

671
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
of space and time which meant that we are, nobody is in this universe.

672
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Just tiny little things. And there is this huge thing.

673
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Science approached it, well,

674
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
space and time became scientific concepts as

675
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
editing us when we started measuring them. So space was

676
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
replaced with distance, time was replaced with duration,

677
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
and then we came to an agreement with measuring instruments

678
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
such as the rod and clocks. Without such externalization of brain function and

679
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
a universal agreement on things, space and time

680
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
is nothing. If you continue discussion, I will explain you that there is no space

681
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
at no time. But, and indeed, once you

682
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
started to look at those stratifications, those are concrete.

683
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Those could be looked at. And then you look at the physical

684
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
process, or not you, but geologists have said, the evolution

685
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
of this is this long, according to

686
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
biometric, then you have an agreement. Well, while

687
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
you know, looked at those rocks, and then

688
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
it went down to a beach or a river,

689
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
and it's, well, wait, I can see in these rocks these pebbles

690
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
are streaming out. I can see these things forming. Now,

691
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
let's see how long that takes. And it went out in the beach and nothing happened.

692
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You could sit there for a month. And then you saw a little bit of sand

693
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
being deposited on a sandbag.

694
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And so he said, hey, this takes a huge amount of time

695
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
to create what you see here in this rock record. Yeah, I want to

696
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
go back to something Karen just said earlier, you challenged a little bit,

697
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
and I'm just going to talk a little bit about how do you know,

698
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
how could you confirm what you're seeing when you look at these

699
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
archaeological things, and you said, well, it's true.

700
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
A consensus gets built. And you tell your story,

701
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
your account, the best you can, and then you wait to hear what sort of other

702
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
colleagues and experts in the field think, and you slowly build it up. Okay, to me, that's what

703
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
language is also to, isn't language a consent, or we think

704
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
language itself forms as some sort of social thing. Everyone agrees

705
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
that we're going to use the word red, whatever the original

706
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
wrote, whatever the original red was, that we all kind of get into

707
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
this consensus. And interestingly, that seems to give the

708
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
semantics to meaning, right? So you can say, well,

709
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
what you're doing right now seems to be a little

710
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
in co-ed maybe, at worst. I don't think it is, but you know,

711
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
it may be it'll come closer and closer as consensus, and it might go down the wrong path.

712
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
The consensus may be this in a long direction, and that's

713
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
just what you're dealing with. But I think there's something lost in that, because

714
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
the next topic I'm interested in talking about is, well,

715
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
is there anything lost in changing to the thinking of things being

716
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
all a coed? Like, do you miss something? Because it's

717
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
reductionistic to a degree, right? You know? You only miss tons of things, because

718
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
again, we are human and landmen

719
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
chauvinistic. But we can look at the same problems with a different direction.

720
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So semantics or explicit knowledge can be derived in

721
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
all animals one particular way, which is my own experience.

722
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So one, I have one experience, I have another experience, another experience.

723
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And from those interactions or intersections of those experiences,

724
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
something becomes explicit. That is

725
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
the events are stripped off from this

726
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
spatial temporal conditions, and it may become

727
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
explicit. When I've seen a first dog in my life, I said, it's an

728
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
episode, it's an experience. I see another dog and another dog, and then I created

729
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
the explicit knowledge of darkness,

730
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
and I know what it is. Now, this is fantastic.

731
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Humans with landage have another way

732
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
of producing semantics, which is, ticks are given to you

733
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
by an authoring, such as your parents, such as your teachers, and so on.

734
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
They said, this is a USB. This is an iPhone.

735
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And I can use it because I was told about the utility

736
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
of that thing, and it goes along for a long time, and I

737
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
have no reason to go into it, even though I don't know what's in USB. I don't even know what

738
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
USB stands for. I just know what this is. So humans

739
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
can give, there's a little

740
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
funnel here, and then pouring a lot of knowledge into the

741
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
head of a newborn, a child, because we can

742
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
do, and people who cannot generate episodes in their lives that are people

743
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
without people can pull systems, they still

744
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
can get around because they have this enormous freely

745
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
given semantic information. The catch is this,

746
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
because it's not your experience. You don't go through the verification

747
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
process. You don't ground those things. And then I start believing that

748
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I'm a good Democrat because this is my framework.

749
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Or I'm a good Republican because this is my framework, and I never

750
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
questioned my framework because that was given to me. I never questioned those words

751
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
that were given to my teacher, my priest, or if I have one, or

752
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
or authoricists. So that's an interesting

753
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
thing, and that's why I say that when we

754
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
split things to

755
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
it's, or carve nature by its

756
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
joints, and we are trying to go, this is the only time when you have to think about that

757
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
seriously. Where everyday violence is not a big deal. You know, culture is not a big deal when we are

758
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
classifying this and that, but when we are going to the roots of things,

759
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
then this is the key to think about, and this is the

760
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
key to think about it. Absolutely. It needed the approach for space and time as well.

761
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I'm going to go back with this issue of language because

762
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
we have to get to exact term that he uses, but now I'm Trump's

763
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
case, idea of other linguistics is totally different from what you're saying.

764
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
It's not something that is taught to us, language is not taught to us, but

765
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
language is somewhat inherent into the human being

766
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
as a species. I'm afraid I can't. I mean, I hope

767
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I'm not talking about something that is totally

768
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
alien to you. I thought you all thought you'd say. No, no, you just brought up a can of worms.

769
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
It's going to go way longer than two hours.

770
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I should have not. Yeah, not a lot. I mean, happy to get into that, but

771
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
maybe briefly. Really briefly? I mean,

772
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
for me personally, in my own work, I sort of dismiss all of that.

773
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
There are all forms of animal communication

774
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
that have nothing to do with those roles.

775
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And then it becomes, for me, very, very arbitrary

776
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
about what we call language friendly. I mean,

777
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
the Consul Batcha Cup studies, have you ever read these things?

778
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
These are fantastic. This is a spell he just retired, but

779
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
anyway, he studies prairie dog communities in

780
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Arizona, and the different communities have different

781
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
communities. To us, they just sound, they're 100 milliseconds, right?

782
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And so to us, they all sound the same. But if you simply record them

783
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
and slow them down, you find out that they have

784
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
different meanings. One of them will mean

785
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
the coyotes coming from that direction. He even

786
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
did experiments with graduate students wearing different color

787
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
t-shirts, and they were able to assign

788
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
a call to each of the colors that the graduate students used to.

789
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And they were able to distinguish one of the graduate students in a different

790
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
way, even if she was shorter than all the other ones.

791
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Those useful graduate students. Yeah, yeah. And then he would do things like

792
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
shoot a rifle. He'd shoot a rifle off on the side, and then they would develop a new

793
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
vocabulary for that. So, yeah, no, it's fantastic. It's great work.

794
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Is it language? But in this case, wait, isn't

795
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
that analysis based on looking at

796
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
a stimulus and then the frequency of the response?

797
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Like, it's a little bit of a syntactical analysis, because you're talking about the

798
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
formal aspects of those sounds. And that's exactly what we do when you

799
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
try to decode a script that we don't know, right?

800
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I don't think it's inconsistent with, I'm not a Chomsky fan either, but I happen to think

801
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
that's not inconsistent. You could say, well Chomsky would say, yes, but in humans,

802
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
the way language forms, the formal aspects, syntactical

803
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
aspects, have a certain form, and we can rely on that to do an analysis

804
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
of the difference. So he would exclude that as a language,

805
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
and I just frankly stay out there. Yeah, yeah.

806
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And use the word language, like when you're referring to

807
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
prairie dogs or dolphin. He would use the language. Well, I would use communication,

808
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
mostly because I don't want to get down that road of defining

809
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
languages, because to me, okay, this is what I really think.

810
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I think that a lot of academics like to use

811
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
languages a way to differentiate our species

812
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
from all other species. Right. And so I just don't want it.

813
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I don't want to have to do it for them. I think it's a waste. For me personally, it's a waste of time.

814
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I don't think anybody has that. There are very few landmages

815
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
that landmages completely human. Yeah, but no M does.

816
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
He still says it now. No, you're he still says it now.

817
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I know, but then he has a lot of followers

818
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
in different departments. It's like you were saying

819
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
some, the what

820
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Vita, it's like if we were still arguing about

821
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
getting the homunculus from the semen into the

822
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
egg. I mean, it's just something I want to put aside.

823
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I agree this as a prominent person, but I think any linguist would agree that

824
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
communication is a better, perhaps more general word and

825
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I can communicate with my dogs by cats and

826
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
there's no question that we communicate or they communicate with each other.

827
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Do they have syntactic arrows? Yes, they have.

828
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Do they have the same land with Gs? And we know that birds have also

829
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
some of the most complicated things like questions.

830
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
The French dogs communicate differently than American dogs.

831
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Different language? So, let's say interesting

832
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
thing that brings me back to my

833
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
my,

834
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
my, what says it funnel that

835
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
we put a lot of stuff into our brains is because, interestingly, there is a

836
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
big

837
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
key for humans or big discrepancy between

838
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
knowledge of humankind and the

839
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
individuals share. My share of human Christ knowledge is extremely ridiculous.

840
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And it's getting worse and worse and worse obviously every day.

841
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Now dogs, they are not going to be

842
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
very good today. Now dogs, from anywhere

843
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
they have pretty much the same knowledge of

844
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
the kind, anyway, in the world. Do they have

845
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
cultural differences?

846
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
There might be localities. Are there

847
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
cultural inheritances in animals? Yes, there are. There are no monkey groups

848
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
in Okinawa. These are rizous monkeys. They wash potatoes.

849
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And once that, that tradition is

850
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
gone, then perhaps it's gone forever.

851
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
There are many cultures that, like the

852
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Tasmanian cultures, like the Icelandic

853
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
cultures and Greenland, that cultures, they all disappeared because

854
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
the people who had the knowledge died and

855
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
then they couldn't make new canoes. They didn't make arrows

856
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
and things like that, all of a sudden, that civilization

857
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
just disappeared because of the lack of this knowledge.

858
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I have to tell this story, mostly because it's amusing, and I want to

859
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
move away from having this roundtable devolve into a talk about animal consciousness

860
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
which we love to do here at Helix but we're good at.

861
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
The story which may be a good segue is, there was a study about

862
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
cats looking into whether cats understood their names.

863
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I think this is just a wonderful story.

864
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
As opposed to other words, they might hear. So they do an MRI of the cat

865
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
and they call the cat's name. And sure enough, the researchers found, yes,

866
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
cats can distinguish their name from other words, spoken to them.

867
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
They just don't care. Yeah, that's right.

868
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So, it's really funny, but it does say something about

869
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
what then do you do?

870
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It's really, the cat's decoded tabby.

871
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
It's decoded it. Some part of his brain, anyway, seems to evidence

872
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
that it's been decoded. But then what does the cat do with that code?

873
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Is that creates a meaning for the cat, right?

874
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
No, I love that story because they really don't give a damn and it's very interesting to me

875
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
to be around people that are trying to decode, for instance,

876
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the SETI group, which you probably read about this, trying to decode

877
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
the whale song by doing deep learning and the fellow running

878
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
that says, well, we just need more data. That's all we need. And it's

879
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
nonsense, frankly. I mean, God bless them for doing that and I'm glad somebody

880
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
else is doing it. But Roger

881
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Payne, the fellow who discovered whale song, he tried to

882
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
you know, he's done over 50 years

883
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
of following the whales and interacting with them as well as we can.

884
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And he was trying to imagine what the conversation would be and the conversation would essentially be,

885
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
okay, where's the food now?

886
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And I'm tired of smelt.

887
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Give me octopus. I'm tired of smelt. And that's the kind of,

888
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and this also reminded me of

889
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
conversations with Oprah Chernofsky, who you probably know is a bird scientist.

890
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And he says, you know, he spent his life around these

891
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
songbirds and he says, you know, they really think

892
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
we are very slow. I mean, we can't possibly catch them,

893
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
and we're very stupid. And the stuff that we worry about is just

894
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
nonsense. And I think that's right. I think we're going to put a little bit...

895
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
He's absolutely right. And you're right with yourself. In our field,

896
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
COVID-19 neuroscience, neuroscience, we made this mistake all the time because of our inheritance.

897
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
That is, we are giving the world

898
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
to the brain. We are recording from the brain something, such as firing

899
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
or fMRI singles, and then we find a relationship.

900
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And we think we are decoding the brain, and you

901
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
have only been New York Times. The fact is that their message

902
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
is message only for outside observers, because only the

903
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
outside observer has the luxury of seeing the outside world and what's happening in the brain.

904
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Neurons in the brain have no clue. They don't know if there is

905
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
anything outside. The only thing they have is the activity there.

906
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
So what comes into the world, there has to be grounded. It has to be

907
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
connected to something that something has.

908
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
You have to have a second dominion. The only thing that's available for the

909
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
brain, that is for us as humans, also is through our

910
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
actions and our verification of things.

911
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Others, those are... Our things are verified independently.

912
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Everything is just a consensus.

913
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
That doesn't really help us at all.

914
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
So, you know, when it comes to

915
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
communication, so brains work some... We use a lot of imagination,

916
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
but that has to be looked at. And I can give you many, many examples that

917
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
we have tons and tons of misunderstanding. Once you start recording from the brain

918
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
and you ask whether those patterns that we thought were

919
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
going to be authentic, these things, actually means something to the brain.

920
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
If you don't have that grounding knowledge,

921
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
you know nothing. Well, a good way to think about that would be, in this

922
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
goes, returns to Shannon's discussions about information.

923
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
You know, and he made a very strong effort to say, look, this is

924
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
not information in the sense of like knowledge. It's not meaning.

925
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
It's just how you get the code. There's a code for the information,

926
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
right? And it's just imagine

927
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
a signal comes across a wire or the airwaves and it's the word

928
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
dog, right? Okay, dog. Now, that's wonderful.

929
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I heard it. It's the word dog. Now, why is it then, then, if I

930
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
want, I can go to the library or I can think of myself. I can write an essay

931
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
on dogs about all of my experiences and thoughts about dogs. I can

932
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
write a poem. I can make a song. I can write a song about dogs, right?

933
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And so, and those individual expressions of mine will be,

934
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I hope, rich and elaborate. And it goes well beyond just the

935
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
single word dog that the information came along, but it doesn't have the

936
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
full richness of dogness for me, right?

937
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
And I think that's an important... But it doesn't. It's just a few. Yeah.

938
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Because you represent... Right, but the code

939
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
only provides a key to triggering that sort of,

940
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
you're saying there's a context into which these codes

941
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
find themselves and then the rest has to do with the way the

942
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
humans respond to it. That's why I was saying earlier, if a

943
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
illiterate looks at writing, especially I think back

944
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
in the ancient times, it would have a very strong

945
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
meaning to them, although it was not the explicit meaning that the code

946
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
seemed to be trying to convey, right?

947
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
So, back to the notion of the cipher, you know, to my mind,

948
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I think what ciphers are, they are

949
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
the means of falsifying consensus.

950
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And there's so many classic examples of that. I mean, plate tectonics,

951
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
everybody thought continents didn't move. And even though

952
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
there was a concept for moving continents,

953
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
it wasn't really... It didn't really falsify consensus until

954
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
as examples of real science brought up here,

955
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
paleomagnetic reversals,

956
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
patterns on the ocean floor showed

957
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
actually that the ocean seafloor was spreading and these continents

958
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
moved. So that happened almost a century

959
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
after the concept of continental drift.

960
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So the cipher, the key was

961
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
paleomagnetics and it falsified

962
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
what most scientists believed at the time. And the Russians still,

963
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
some of the Russians still believe that continents still move, but

964
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
it's an exceptional community.

965
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
There are these paradigm shifts, okay?

966
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And we should, I mean, I think we shouldn't be too arrogant

967
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
into believing that now we have found that. So, it was a

968
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
century or next year, you will find some, you know,

969
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
some other revelation that will create

970
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
a different type of idea. I'm in a field with violent arguments

971
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
about this because I keep encountering and

972
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
in combat with, say, genomics people

973
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
who say, now we have the true tree. We know exactly

974
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
what was related to what. And I'm in a

975
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
school or a group of people who say, we don't. We may never

976
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
have the true tree. I'd be very much like in technology.

977
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
She were describing. Have you read

978
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Integral Tree? No. This is exactly about

979
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
the darkest tree and today's different branching and how you

980
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
classified all ocean in different ways. It's an extraordinary

981
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
good, you know, time vessel, this thing.

982
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
It's still very good. I think one of the reasons

983
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I was interested in coding is I feel, in many ways,

984
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
we were in this sort of paradigm of computers being the answer to everything

985
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
we're going to apply, a computer model to understand every

986
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
phenomenon we come across. And I thought, well, I'm interested in coding

987
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and I think it's not all a bad thing, but I feel there's some

988
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
a little overreach. Well, isn't it because

989
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
in medicine, it's everything's genetic.

990
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Oh, I wouldn't say that. But there's a lot that's genetic.

991
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Yeah, but then you see I have identical twins, which are except for

992
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
T cell receptors and antibodies are genetically

993
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
identical and they're obviously not identical. So now I wouldn't say that.

994
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
And some of them develop, we have ones with plenty cases of somebody develops a disease

995
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
and the identical twin never develops it. This is the biggest problem we have

996
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
in neuroscience that we've got inbred that is identical

997
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
twins and these are 50 to 100 generations.

998
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Yeah, so embarrassing that you take 10 animals and

999
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
two of them are outliers all the time. Yeah, yeah, still.

1000
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
So yeah, I would say, okay, maybe sometimes people

1001
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
pretend that everything's genetic. But it is a paradigm.

1002
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
It's a powerful paradigm. Well, the discovery was so exciting.

1003
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
People are dead or you can identify

1004
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
genes. Oh, absolutely. I mean, there are plenty of

1005
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
you if you have the Tysock's gene, if you have sickle

1006
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
cell, you might develop the disease at different ages, but

1007
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
eventually you will develop the diseases. But there are plenty of others where

1008
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
you will never have. But like in paleontology

1009
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
that's the thing too now. Are you talking about

1010
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
genome? So we're all looking at these

1011
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
particular questions with a new lens that is say that

1012
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
we think enable us to create these

1013
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
genealogical trees and things like that. That might

1014
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
mean, in my understanding, the whole issue of

1015
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
human evolution has radically changed in whatever. The 80s

1016
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
or something like that? Yeah, well, and now, but there's still

1017
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
a lot of arguments even with all this new genetic information,

1018
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
genomic information. There's still a lot of arguments

1019
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
about the mobility of

1020
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
homo sapiens and the relationship to homo erectus

1021
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
and whether or not there was one exit from Africa or

1022
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
25 exits or it's not a field that I'm really

1023
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
deeply involved in. But even with the

1024
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
arrival, and in the areas where I work, I work primarily in

1025
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
evolution. And there's still some big

1026
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
uncertainties and controversies in that area even with all

1027
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
this genomic information. Some of it's working

1028
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
extraordinarily unbelievably well. And as you can tell, I'm skeptical, but still

1029
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
the fact that you're saliva can find your second cousin

1030
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
in other countries is pretty astonishing. And the fact that Google

1031
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Translate is doing so well, even though it kind of cheated in some ways in the way

1032
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
but it's working immensely well, right? You just said

1033
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
probably everybody's using it. I wanted to ask the neuroscientists

1034
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
here just say a few words about how you go about

1035
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
to the degree the word decoding applies to what you're doing. How do you go about it?

1036
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Because you don't necessarily have a key.

1037
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
So we do have a key. At least I'd like to let me have a

1038
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
few. And the interesting thing you said, you're interested in mammalian evolution, so am I,

1039
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
but from a different aspect of you. Part of the most fascinating thing, but

1040
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
the brain for me is that in every

1041
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
memo what remains constant

1042
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
over the evolution time is timing.

1043
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
That is the brain reasons you might heard about alpha, beta,

1044
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
gamma oscillations and delta and so on. These are

1045
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
not only individual ones, but they form a hierarchical system

1046
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
in such a way that slow oscillations are

1047
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
modulating the amplitude of the faster ones and the phase

1048
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
of the faster one modulate the amplitude of the even faster ones.

1049
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So it's like the tie

1050
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
is changing and then upon the changes the

1051
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
amplitude of the

1052
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,000
beta is changing. Now this is good because

1053
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
when you ask how come that you scale up a

1054
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
system 50,000 fold from the small brain to the

1055
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
size of the brain of a wave,

1056
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,000
what is the rule of this evolutionly scaling? What should remain

1057
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
constant and what remains constant is timing through

1058
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
this oscillation because they are preserved. It would take

1059
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
the turn 30 seconds. Why is that? Because this is

1060
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
what they call the neural syntax. This is the

1061
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
time packages which allow that you said

1062
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
information if you want those piking activity from one area

1063
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
of the brain to another area of the brain because the other area of the brain is already

1064
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
given the cipher which is the time window. If you don't have

1065
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
that framework, this neural syntax, then brain areas

1066
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
cannot communicate with each other. We cannot communicate with each other. The reason why you

1067
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
understand me is because even though I have an

1068
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
accent and I have made so many mistakes is because I have a

1069
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
particular tempo which is about 4 Hertz which is

1070
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
characteristic of every single human language which is also not only the

1071
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
utterances but also the perception. And the reason for that is because both the utterances

1072
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
as well as the perception of these events are based on

1073
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
brain rhythms. So again we have to go inside

1074
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
and train in order to have the grounding and that's the grounding for me

1075
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
the grounding of the origin of language and classification

1076
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
and cipher. How much of this

1077
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
formal appreciation of these constant

1078
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
relationships? How much of it is

1079
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
a purely sort of mathematical

1080
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
1 over F distribution? How much is it divergent

1081
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
that? Does that help you? Because

1082
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
if it's very generic, it's very simple.

1083
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
It's not only generic, but you already know the content

1084
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
of these patterns. And if something is short

1085
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
it means that in a system which has

1086
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
constraints on the speed of communication, the brain is a very

1087
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
slow system. You know the conduction velocities of the

1088
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
neurons is on the order of 0.2 to

1089
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
several meters per second. Very, very slow. So given

1090
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
that if you have a short amount of time available it means that only your

1091
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
immediate partners can be involved. That is

1092
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
short means small number of neurons. More time

1093
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
means larger number of neurons. And then the

1094
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
cool goal of this communication is that whatever happens locally can be

1095
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
broadcasted globally as well as the global brain

1096
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
state. You know what the activity

1097
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
pattern in the brain is constraints how local communication or local

1098
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
cipher can be generated.

1099
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
If you take away the cipher, if you take away the

1100
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
voltage, if you take away all of these brain latins, the end of the day

1101
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
is that every single psychiatric disease is

1102
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
associated with one or other type of timing problems.

1103
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
It's difficult to differentiate diseases from

1104
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
each other because those are all arbitrary. But it's very

1105
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
easy to look at the brain even

1106
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
at a depressed patient with its depressed state or non-depressed state

1107
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
that is very different. So the timing, the communication

1108
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
is absolutely matters and that's what I'm

1109
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
pushing for that we have a sittactical system.

1110
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I'm thinking as a very general level this idea of extracting

1111
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
some understanding of meaning from either brain activity or

1112
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
artifact assumes a certain sort of background

1113
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
either it could be in the various mathematical descriptions of it. It could be noise.

1114
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
It could be a 1 over F frequency. These are background

1115
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
mathematically defined substrate

1116
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
and we think we find meaning when

1117
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
something diverges from that, something you give a stimulus is no longer

1118
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
it doesn't have that baseline anymore.

1119
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
That's a way of building a key. Isn't that in a way when you

1120
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
don't have the literal, you set it up so you're right

1121
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
but then there is a deviation. This is when many brain structures kick

1122
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
in and it happens to what's called phase receptor

1123
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
and all of a sudden the timing changes

1124
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
and that timing change is detected elsewhere. If that is not detected

1125
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
as happens in schizophrenia and then other diseases that's a big problem.

1126
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Okay, great. Wow.

1127
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Time went fast. All right. I guess the question is do we have

1128
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
any folks want to ask questions of our panel?

1129
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Thank you.

1130
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Thank you all so much.

1131
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Sorry everyone is sitting down

1132
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
so I'm going to sit down too. Hi everyone thank you that was really

1133
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
fascinating. My name is Celia Emery. I'm a museum architect

1134
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
and my concern relates to I guess

1135
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
for the politics of coding, the psychology of coding

1136
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
and where agency fits in. So in museum design we have

1137
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
two aspects of time space. One of them is the path

1138
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
of the visitor in the spaces of the institution

1139
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
and people enter into a building with a pre-existing idea of how they're going to use it

1140
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
because they're adults, they're free agents and they've already learned how to use buildings.

1141
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
So on museum institutions

1142
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
set up what that time space

1143
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
experience is going to be and yet there's a conflict, there's a schism

1144
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
within any use of any building which is that we as

1145
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
individual agents want to be able to act in our own way we want to be able

1146
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
to affirm. So your reference to the graffiti was so interesting I'm about to go to

1147
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Alula to visit the Hegra tombs and there's a lot of graffiti

1148
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
we'll talk. But apparently it was

1149
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
speculated that that graffiti was just journeyers writing down

1150
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
that they had arrived, in other words I am here, Joe was here

1151
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
and in fact that isn't, that is what much of the graffiti is. So that

1152
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
kind of need for us to kind of the ego to kind of exist

1153
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
somewhere and market somehow within a coding

1154
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
system. So the other schism that we have is that

1155
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
in a museum you have a relationship between a

1156
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
person and that artifact which was created in a different point of time. So it's in a different

1157
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
space, it's in a different time. So how do we, so there's two different aspects of this, I'm going to

1158
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
get to this point. In epigraphic and cuneiform

1159
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
the who was control, my question for the group is really

1160
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
who has the control of these forms of ideology?

1161
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Who is creating, who is benefiting from the

1162
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
cuneiform methods, why? And who was

1163
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
benefiting from written language and why? How come that

1164
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
didn't continue to exist? And then how do we as individual agents

1165
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
kind of fit in? Like aren't we, are we just obeying

1166
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
the ideological precepts that have been handed down to us?

1167
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Or do we have any agency within coding?

1168
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Sorry, can we do so long?

1169
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Well let me start with the specific question of who benefited

1170
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
from cuneiform. You can have a very materialistic

1171
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
interpretation and that's the usual interpretation. It's a

1172
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
way of dealing with a more complex system of especially

1173
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
economic interaction, therefore you need some type of record keeping

1174
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
that goes beyond time and space

1175
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
that can travel from one

1176
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
place to another place or is kept

1177
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
for a specific period of time.

1178
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
To take it to this greater

1179
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
level of, you know, when the

1180
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
writing system, what the writing system has a meaning beyond

1181
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
a purely practical writing system. Well, I wouldn't call it an

1182
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
ideology, it's a philosophy, it's an approach to reality.

1183
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
It's an attempt at understanding

1184
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
reality that yes, is shared by an intellectual elite just

1185
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
as today philosophical discourse is shared by

1186
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
intellectual elite but it frames a cultural

1187
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
you know, it creates a cultural setting

1188
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
that yes, the entire civilization

1189
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
if you can use that term, you know, is part of even

1190
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
a lot of the majority of people are not

1191
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
consciously aware of the elements of this.

1192
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I'd just like to say that, you know, one of the

1193
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
roles I have at the museum and I still have is I have oversight of exhibition.

1194
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
So I really understand what you're saying about what the visitor

1195
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
how does the visitor engage or how does the museum engage

1196
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
with the visitor and the question you have and who has agency there

1197
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
and there's always so the trend in recent

1198
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
years of course has been interactivity, interactivity,

1199
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
interactivity and they're generally many of them are experiments that fail

1200
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
because you make assumptions about what visitors

1201
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
really want and the problem is that's based on you

1202
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
European, you're not the visitor, you know,

1203
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and it's fascinating just to think about

1204
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
what's happening in a museum, what happens when a

1205
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,000
visitor encounters an artifact or a fossil or

1206
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
a piece of tapestry or whatever in that sense.

1207
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Well I think there are just many interesting

1208
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
questions that you raise and I'm very jealous of your

1209
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
that's true. I hope you'll open the university case.

1210
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
But that said, I think it seems you're a

1211
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
dependent in terms of proof benefits because it has to do with how

1212
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
communication works in individual societies and today

1213
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
in a global society working literally in code benefits

1214
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,000
very different people than at least

1215
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
geographically. It's sort of a more

1216
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
sense of something much more diffuse than when you're talking about individual

1217
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
ancient societies or medieval societies where certain practitioners

1218
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
were sort of deputized of being the record keepers and they could derive

1219
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
status from their roles as such or

1220
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
proximity to different ranges of literacy would allow people to sort of

1221
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
pen themselves accordingly in that order of status

1222
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
or esteem. And to go back to a point that you made earlier,

1223
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I mean this is why we literally have tons of

1224
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
whether we call them magical texts or texts of ritual power

1225
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
a lot of times they're total gibberish. At least

1226
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
us they seem to be and they don't seem to accord with any particular script

1227
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
that we know of because it seemed like it

1228
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
resembled writing to people who couldn't write they wouldn't know the difference.

1229
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And so there's a power to that and sometimes it was just something esoteric

1230
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
deliberately esoteric but I think the ways in which we relate

1231
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
to sort of dominant types of communication allows us to sort of

1232
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
fit into broader constructs of status, cultural

1233
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
economic and otherwise. But I think it's really sort of culture dependent

1234
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I think when we talk about antiquity again it's very different from

1235
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
today when we talk about code and coding and who's benefiting from their

1236
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
ability to be able to work with certain languages on computers

1237
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
it's you know many more people than 20 years ago

1238
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
but who are those people right and how do they use that information

1239
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
it's something that I can't possibly triangulate

1240
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
that others might but I think it's definitely indicative

1241
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
it's a symptom of something that's shifting in our global society that I

1242
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
can't interpret but because it's something

1243
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
sort of different it'll be interesting to see work.

1244
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
The key phrase you have is relate.

1245
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I think that's the most important thing in the museum and I'm looking for

1246
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
creations that allow me to go to a place and I lose

1247
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
my sense of time. All of a sudden I can devote

1248
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
my entire mind to what's going on there. Once I do that

1249
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I all of a sudden have

1250
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
first point of view rather than a third person, first person point of view

1251
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
rather than the third person point of view of everything.

1252
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Now you ask about the agency that I become an agent

1253
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
because somehow you transform me and I will be

1254
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
part of the participants of those events even though I had

1255
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
no knowledge about that if continents go together.

1256
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
But I use my imagination, I use my existing knowledge, I use my existing belief

1257
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
systems to relate myself to that situation.

1258
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Now the agency is not human

1259
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
every animal has the desire

1260
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
and everything to learn these boundaries

1261
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
we know that we have boundaries and that's the

1262
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
essence of even a mobile or every single creature that

1263
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
knows that it has boundaries and relates into everything else.

1264
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
That relatedness is the super important thing. If I go to a

1265
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
museum where I have to interact, this is what kids when they

1266
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
go to New Jersey, the science museum I see, it's the same thing as a physics class.

1267
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Plus maybe they can do more freely and the teacher is not watching.

1268
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
This is a fascinating thing because yes we are always saying

1269
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
the museum is important, it was important to reopen

1270
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
after COVID because this is a place, this is it gives people a sense of place

1271
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
but what's really interesting is for a lot of people this is their place

1272
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
this is there and increasingly

1273
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
and there might be a dichotomy in society maybe that will break down

1274
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
as people die and younger and younger people come up but

1275
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
you can see it in a daughter

1276
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
or somebody close to you that you know intimately

1277
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
what their reality is compared to

1278
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
what you're trying to do with visitors coming to a museum.

1279
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
So two examples that work for me very well, of course it requires

1280
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
the relatedness, the Japanese shinto goddess.

1281
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
It's simple but you lose the sense of the time immediately

1282
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
because you are just looking at the rock. The other one is an extreme

1283
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
other thing that Selena also knows about, you know, a marine abramovich

1284
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
when she was sitting in the over there

1285
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
there was nothing there except a pair of eyes and you were

1286
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
looking to see yourself in those eyes and all of a sudden

1287
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
you had a means of saying you can discover yourself

1288
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
if your museums spaces can create that

1289
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
thing that discover yourself you leave the museum with a better feeling

1290
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
or recreation then there's the look.

1291
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
The institution is really because the organization has telling you what's in the

1292
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:48,000
information. Exactly, they want to convey information. I don't need information, I have enough.

1293
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
My own personal experience which is

1294
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
taken for what is worth I'm not a I have nothing to do with PCMs except as a

1295
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
museum goer but you know a lot of what makes science interesting

1296
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
are controversies and challenges within a paradigm

1297
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
and the challenges within a paradigm can be small

1298
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
and they can be in the verge of some cataclysmic change

1299
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
and that's really I think interesting to people

1300
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I would think it's interesting to people. I think it's a mistake to use the word controversy

1301
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
for a devol. I would stay away from that word because I think it makes people think

1302
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
well there are experts and you're already distance from it. There are experts

1303
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
and the word controversy personally for myself sort of is off putting

1304
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
it makes it seem like this is a little bit good to be beyond me. I think it's really

1305
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
useful to say here that just lay out the different ideas

1306
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
side by side and don't refer to it as being some raging

1307
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
controversy among experts.

1308
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I just want to express appreciation for

1309
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
everyone who does this work and it partly relates to fun.

1310
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I found and this is also relating to what you asked before is there a difference

1311
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
to humans between something that's a million years ago or 10,000 years ago

1312
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
and I find that with my students anything that happened

1313
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
before the year 2012

1314
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
is ancient history. The time is completely compressed

1315
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000
and obviously my students are not as they're not working in the same capacity

1316
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
if you were to look with graduate students in your field or

1317
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
you with yours or you with yours because they're already very much aware

1318
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
of the stretch of time. But to me

1319
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
the ways that museums have the capacity to jar

1320
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
people from the present reality and to

1321
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
force them to confront chronology and

1322
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
time whether it's I feel like it's activist work

1323
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
these days and the power of losing yourself in those places

1324
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
being jarred from your phone. It's different when you're talking

1325
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
about academics or researchers or specialists in the

1326
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
general public. I think it's one of the only places where

1327
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
we can remind people that there's a world beyond themselves

1328
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
chronologically, culturally and beyond the human

1329
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
realm too and I think it's that is what I feel like is increasingly

1330
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
lost in the world of coding and it's just such

1331
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
important work. So anyway you can make people uncomfortable enough

1332
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
to be present in their spaces and learn is a contribution

1333
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
to everybody. Do you take your

1334
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
students in the field? Do you notice the difference? Absolutely

1335
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I am so extraordinary now.

1336
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I teach in a history department so not all my

1337
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
students expect to specialize in anything that relates to

1338
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,000
antiquity but I tell them that I think the tradition

1339
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
about museums is that you know it's from European tradition

1340
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
these are places to appreciate art and being able to appreciate it in a particular

1341
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
way. It's a status thing, it's an appreciation thing

1342
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
so I tell them these are libraries

1343
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
they're like visual libraries in a way not like not that that's such a

1344
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
great advertisement for them either but rather than being something flat

1345
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
and two dimensional it's something you get to enter and immerse yourself into

1346
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
and when it's really effective I remember because I teach

1347
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
in Brooklyn, I teach in Flatbush and some of my students have never been to

1348
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
the Met and I remember the first time when I started teaching Maron I

1349
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
brought a class in the Met and I remember the student who looked up the

1350
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
grand staircase and he just was like well you know

1351
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
because it's just a different environment, a different world

1352
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and when you don't approach it as art but you know objects that are

1353
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
artifacts that can teach us about different places in times that these

1354
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
you know that they can investigate it's totally transformative and it's something that a lot of

1355
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
people take for granted in lots of different places but

1356
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
I think it's again like a form of activism

1357
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
to remind people they're not the center of the universe and their phones are not the center of the universe

1358
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
but the world is not flat so

1359
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
sorry that's the thank you.

1360
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Is there another question?

1361
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
As I hear everyone talking about decoding it seems to me that there's a little bit of

1362
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
sort of an incompatibility of some fundamental

1363
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
assumptions that especially as I hear this coming out in the debate about consensus

1364
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
so it seems to me that there are kind of two different approaches here

1365
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,000
to what decoding actually is so

1366
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I've kind of like set out a number of binaries here trying to make sense of this for myself

1367
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
seems on the one hand there's a sort of approach to denotation and on the other

1368
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
an approach to connotation as it pertains to decoding meaning.

1369
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
You know you could say that there's a kind of idea here of

1370
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
this context or I guess thinking about

1371
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
what you were saying about the brain in a sense that there's a synchrony

1372
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
you called that synchrony a key but I don't think that that's a key to meaning that's just a

1373
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
condition of possibility for interpretation of meaning.

1374
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
So I guess I'm wondering in this discussion of coding one

1375
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
whether you all would agree that there are two different approaches

1376
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
to thinking about what meaning is and whether that's a

1377
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
disciplinary problem or something else.

1378
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
You ask an easy question please.

1379
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,000
So

1380
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
you said synchrony is not exactly the same

1381
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
as brain waves but nevertheless I didn't make a claim

1382
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
and nobody does that we can decide for the content

1383
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
that say it's a you know grandma has a large

1384
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
way of defining things but one of them

1385
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
is you could call it the phonetics of that and

1386
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
that's without content so that's what brain it was about.

1387
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Now the meaning is the essential thing of everything unless

1388
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
my students show me that that relationship between

1389
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
what the experiment that proposed to the brain and the responses there

1390
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
has a message for the rest of the brain or to the animal

1391
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
that's not there is no meaning. So meaning has to be

1392
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
generated only through utility at least this is what the view

1393
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
in evolution as well as in the animal world

1394
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
is that if particular thing comes with a plus or minus

1395
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
in the life of the animal that generates meaning. So

1396
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
many ways the way how today's neuroscience is studied

1397
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
we think that it's a like slate and then you just shovel

1398
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
information into this your brain and so on and you can

1399
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
with which means that the complexity of the brain whatever

1400
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
we do is growing as you learn more and more and more

1401
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
and that's exactly what happens in an AI system and it collapses

1402
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
very soon because there are so much stuff interfering with each

1403
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
other. Another way of thinking about this is that

1404
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
brain comes already with an equipped

1405
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
dictionary. Every single thing that exists in your future life

1406
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
is already there and the parents that

1407
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
we thought were generated in over in fact they

1408
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,000
pre-exist. So what happens is that out of this realm of

1409
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
possibilities you experience something that goes in

1410
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,000
one way or another positive or negative and that pattern that was present

1411
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
at the time when that experience happened becomes

1412
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,000
meaningful. It will have a utility for now or the future of the organism

1413
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
this is how we generate meaning. Now the linguist

1414
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
or a human person who thinks about may have another way of

1415
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
phrasing it but I think that would be just rephrasing the same kind of thing.

1416
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I'm going to drive you guys both of you crazy. I mean to me I'm not sure what meaning

1417
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
means here but there are I mean

1418
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,000
if it means something as simple as you know

1419
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
when I talk about brain rhythms I mean if I if you stimulate

1420
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
a synaptic input to a muscle

1421
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
fiber that muscle fiber will twitch and if you do it over here

1422
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
there's a couple of extra steps

1423
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
but no this muscle will twitch and if you

1424
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
go over here this muscle will twitch and if you just go

1425
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,000
a few you know bottom millimeter on the

1426
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,000
other side you will hear something or you will feel something

1427
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
and in a particular part of your body. Is that meaning? Because if it is then it's

1428
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,000
based in okay so rise it not meaning

1429
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
because it has no relation to experience

1430
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
but what if what

1431
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
it's remapping?

1432
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
So I'm going to press you on that it can change

1433
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
so we can we can remap

1434
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
this to hear instead of there and this happens

1435
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,000
all the time when people have strokes for instance.

1436
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Now is it meaning?

1437
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I would say it would be meaningful in the context

1438
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
that we understand how

1439
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I think we have to finish up. I always want both of you but

1440
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,000
here it becomes so there are things that are not there but when you have a stroke

1441
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
it becomes a meaning so when you touch your nose

1442
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
with your toe

1443
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
it feels it has a meaning for you because it feels at the same

1444
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,000
now that meaning is acquired through experience

1445
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
and because you feel at the same time I can show you that anybody can show you that

1446
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,000
it's not at the same time it's a much longer time to go from here

1447
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
or from my nose but that for me as a utility I don't care about the mechanism

1448
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I just know it's at the same time so that's a meaning for

1449
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,000
me because I can use that information

1450
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
anything that I can use utility determines meaning

1451
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
That's a really unsatisfying discussion right

1452
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
yeah that meaning is the most

1453
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:41,000
difficult thing. Yeah we have to move on right it's interesting it's an interesting question.

1454
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,000
So I've learned so much this morning and I'm very grateful

1455
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:51,000
and it has led to many different questions but I'm just going to bring it down to one.

1456
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I wonder what happens in terms of when emotion enters

1457
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
what happens to how people approach things and I'm thinking

1458
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
now at the Morgan Museum right now there's an exhibit

1459
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,000
on Erduana I'm sure you've already seen it you've probably been talking

1460
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
to Sydney Bactog about it or

1461
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
but it goes from agriculture being discussed in terms

1462
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
of bushels which you were mentioning versus

1463
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,000
handling of harvest through this highly

1464
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,000
emotive charged poem by this priestess about plow my

1465
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
fields plow my fields as an erotic

1466
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,000
situation so I'd love to know what happens in terms of

1467
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
the evolution of mind that brings that in

1468
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
or the world where we are a man in his bassel in Egypt

1469
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
you know where that's a whole other very highly

1470
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:51,000
emotive interaction.

1471
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,000
So are you asking within the context I mean

1472
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,000
the fact that it becomes something that it's

1473
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,000
written down? No that you

1474
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,000
can approach the harvest through the number of bushels

1475
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,000
or you can approach the harvest as a kind of analogy of becoming

1476
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,000
together of sky and earth, male and female what happens

1477
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,000
what's happened in the mind that opens it

1478
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,000
up to that kind of approach. Well, metaphorical

1479
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,000
language I don't know if that's, I assume it predates

1480
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
writing, metaphorical language where we

1481
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
connect something physical let's say

1482
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
that's physical in one area of life and metaphorically

1483
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,000
we connect it to another area of life I would imagine

1484
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,000
that that pre-dates the origins

1485
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,000
of writing one of the great things about poems like

1486
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
the American Epics is rich, it is with metaphorical

1487
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
language and what I find interesting about metaphorical

1488
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
language you mentioned in the Ishidwana poem is

1489
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,000
or metaphor or metaphors are contained within a

1490
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
cultural structure in order to make sense so

1491
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
abundance of fields makes sense in a particular type of society

1492
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
actually I discussed metaphorical language with my students

1493
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
only a couple of days ago living in New York City they have no connection

1494
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,000
at all to the metaphors that are being used in ancient

1495
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,000
poetry because they're mostly rural metaphors and so

1496
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:35,000
but I do that I think is yeah there is a system there

1497
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
of clothing as well you have to understand

1498
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
you have to understand the cipher you have to understand the system

1499
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
if I compare something to an

1500
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
object, an entity, a natural phenomenon that none

1501
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,000
of you have ever experienced you're not going to understand my metaphor

1502
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
but just also in terms of

1503
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
image making or expression and emotion I think that's more what I'm

1504
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
wondering about especially now with all the talk about emotion and cognition

1505
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,000
and what the interaction is between them and I just thought

1506
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,000
how do you express emotions?

1507
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,000
How do you render emotion

1508
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
orally or in a written form?

1509
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,000
You can only do so I think by using

1510
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,000
comparison, I mean love is a feeling of

1511
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:35,000
whatever fire etc etc.

1512
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I think we're also going to have the opportunity to reflect on some of this issue in her

1513
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,000
fiction, fiction, meta-fiction talk later today because I think

1514
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:47,000
really for me the answer and response in part to what you were asking is that

1515
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,000
there's a dialectic that goes back and forth between metaphorical

1516
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,000
poetic sort of meaning, phenomenological meaning and then

1517
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,000
the way it gets encoded and then the codes create the opportunity for more

1518
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,000
engagement with meaning because the codes themselves can have meaning

1519
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
so I think it's a

1520
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,000
very interesting dialectic did you ever know? Oh sorry

1521
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Hi, please. Hi. This last question

1522
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,000
sort of prompts me to rise.

1523
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I have this thought I've been developing for a long time and it seems to

1524
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:31,000
coordinate with a lot of the different themes that we've had this morning

1525
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Prior to the development of language

1526
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,000
there was a great deal of intelligence in

1527
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:43,000
early humans they survived and

1528
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,000
so the way. The thought

1529
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
just to make it very general is that

1530
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,000
the evolutionary pressure which leads eventually to the most powerful

1531
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,000
evolutionary movement which is the development of culture

1532
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:03,000
really requires the development of language because we have to

1533
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,000
express to larger groups over time

1534
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
over generational time

1535
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
the development of language seems to be

1536
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
a cognitive way of thinking which is

1537
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,000
pairs of opposites which is as you say positive

1538
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
or negative and so on. The metaphorical thinking

1539
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:31,000
is not it's more analog

1540
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,000
the earliest need

1541
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
for language I want to suggest or I think

1542
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
is the communication of what we would call mythic

1543
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,000
kinds of ideas it is what forms a

1544
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,000
group it's what gives self-identity

1545
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:55,000
to the group and the evolutionary pressure is in the direction

1546
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,000
of groups that are more tightly bound more coherent

1547
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,000
those are the successful ones.

1548
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,000
So how does that happen? Evolutionarily

1549
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
the thought that I have and I don't have your expertise to know

1550
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
whether it makes sense to you which is why I guess I am saying this

1551
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
is that we develop a

1552
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:23,000
the brain develops a sensitivity to certain

1553
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
kinds of narrative that we think of as mythic

1554
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
we recognize mythic ideas mythic

1555
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
narrative in a different way it's not about the content

1556
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,000
there is something that we feel is mythic which would

1557
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,000
require a physiological development

1558
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,000
evolutionarily based in the brain

1559
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,000
and so we end up with two kinds of minds a cognitive

1560
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,000
which is all linguistics are cognitive

1561
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
and the same intelligence that we had before we

1562
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,000
developed language and those two different minds

1563
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
are not being commensurate they cannot communicate with each other

1564
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
you can't be thinking about metaphor in a cognitive

1565
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,000
way and understand the power

1566
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,000
and if you try to translate it into cognitive

1567
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,000
forms you lose the power

1568
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:27,000
and so we have these two different minds

1569
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,000
just as a further development of that is the notion

1570
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
that that which can communicate

1571
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
is myth mythic stories mythic

1572
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
ways of thinking is what gives us

1573
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:47,000
a sense of wholeness where we can see the world

1574
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:51,000
with the two incommentral intelligences

1575
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:57,000
anyone?

1576
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,980
We were talking downstairs over coffee before a little bit about

1577
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:04,980
people have written books that are very similar to what you're saying

1578
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:08,980
and I guess you had Peter Pessick here with the polyphonic minds idea so

1579
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:12,980
you might want to check out his book he kind of thinks the way that you do

1580
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:16,980
and we were also talking about the bicameral mind which is very

1581
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:20,980
out of fashion but you know that book?

1582
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:24,980
Yeah so it's very similar to what exactly

1583
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:28,980
it's very very similar to what you're bringing up. Now I'm very skeptical

1584
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:32,980
of both of them and I'm friendly with Peter

1585
01:46:32,980 --> 01:46:36,980
but still I'm very skeptical I think they take a lot of

1586
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:40,980
impressionist to kind of stuff and try to come up with the whole theory but and just like I'm being a

1587
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:44,980
little skeptical of what you said but that doesn't mean you don't have a lot of depth there and that there's a lot to examine

1588
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:48,980
so we were talking about kind of the variation

1589
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:52,980
of what you were saying just before we started the meeting this morning.

1590
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:56,980
I take these two sides that you're describing as being

1591
01:46:56,980 --> 01:47:00,980
a non-incomensurate or at least they may be different but they're different ways

1592
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:04,980
of looking at the same thing where they're on a developmental

1593
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:08,980
historically on a developmental course and I think I mean the person

1594
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:12,980
that comes to mind for me is Ernst Kasier who wrote a lot about

1595
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:16,980
mythic way of looking at the world and has it became more

1596
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:20,980
rationalizing scientific not to say that's always better

1597
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:24,980
which is what people sometimes lament but that it's

1598
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:28,980
a further development of mythic thinking.

1599
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:32,980
I think you're saying there are two parts of the mind one of them is more modern

1600
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:36,980
and it can't exactly coexist simultaneously with the other part.

1601
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:40,980
I think we have them both at the same time.

1602
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:44,980
Our problem today is our inability to see them both at the same time

1603
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:48,980
to experience them both at the same time.

1604
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:52,980
Myth functions by just it doesn't describe

1605
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:56,980
it is a place from which you can experience

1606
01:47:56,980 --> 01:48:00,980
both ways of experiencing the world or seeing the world

1607
01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:04,980
and responding to it at the same time and gives us a sense of

1608
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:08,980
home. Myth becomes religion at a certain point.

1609
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:12,980
To me, myth plus politics equals religion.

1610
01:48:12,980 --> 01:48:16,980
I really had hoped in fact that's a very we have to finish and that's an interesting

1611
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:20,980
end note because no it really was my hope that that this would be

1612
01:48:20,980 --> 01:48:24,980
just sort of two-sided this decoding and demeaning

1613
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:28,980
connotation and denotation is something I was hoping we would be able

1614
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:32,980
to bring out here and I think we did a really pretty good job.

1615
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:36,980
I thank you all for your contributions.

1616
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:40,980
Thank you.

1617
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:44,980
Can I make a little correction?

1618
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:48,980
So I kept wondering

1619
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:52,980
if we could have this conversation two-thousand years ago

1620
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:56,980
and many of the things that we discussed here were discussed two-thousand years ago

1621
01:48:56,980 --> 01:49:00,980
in the exact same way and your answer about myth and so on

1622
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:04,980
was unanswered the same way.

1623
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:08,980
So now it's impossible but I think if you

1624
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:12,980
look at the grounding that is how you can make

1625
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:16,980
a judgment

1626
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:20,980
that there are two brains as you said, emotional and cognitive brains

1627
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:24,980
and this has been going on in humankind for a long time

1628
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:28,980
before DSM-5, DSM-4 actually had two axes

1629
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:32,980
and one set of psychiatrists that with the cognitive problems that

1630
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:36,980
have been with the emotional problems, now we know

1631
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:40,980
there is no part of the brain that would be dedicated to emotions.

1632
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:44,980
We know also there is no such a thing as fear center

1633
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:48,980
because negative and positive is the luck, context,

1634
01:49:48,980 --> 01:49:52,980
the stomach, the heart, wherever something bad is called it next to it

1635
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:56,980
or just to it is the good. This is how the relationships

1636
01:49:56,980 --> 01:50:00,980
are formed and that is just to show

1637
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:04,980
there is no part in the brain that you can look at. MRI is

1638
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:08,980
just like we can distinguish and separate cognition from emotion.

1639
01:50:08,980 --> 01:50:12,980
They evolve together. They are never separate.

1640
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:16,980
They have the beliefs that we can separate them and those beliefs

1641
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:20,980
can persevere and no amount of introspection can help.

1642
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:24,980
That's why I throw it back. But if you look into the brain

1643
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:28,980
the debate will become simpler.

1644
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:32,980
There are times where you have an emotion and you have no cognition

1645
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:36,980
onto you actually. Absolutely.

1646
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:40,980
How do you have a condition without a motion?

1647
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:44,980
No. Okay. So if I can't have a reaction to something

1648
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:48,980
just through emotions, yes you can.

1649
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:52,980
So that I call adaptive behavior and you can call it

1650
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:56,980
cognition. So if I avoid something because it's unpleasant

1651
01:50:56,980 --> 01:51:00,980
that's a adaptive behavior and that's the definition of cognitive action also.

1652
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:04,660
Now I'm going to have an out-p

1653
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:12,660
to go. You say hotel, motel, town?

1654
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:36,740
you
