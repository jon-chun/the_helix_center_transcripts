00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Welcome to this first of the poetry and music series.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm Ed Nursecien, director of the center.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
David Pollens, who is in charge of the poetry program

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,120
for the Helix Center will introduce today's program.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,400
And maybe he'll tell you something

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,700
about what else he has planned.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,000
I don't know.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,860
He hasn't given me his copy of his comments.

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,000
As I said yesterday, we are having a benefit

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,120
at the end of the month.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,320
But those of you who can't come, any donation of any size

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,560
is welcome.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,000
So with that, David.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,500
Thanks.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,120
Thanks, Ed.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,480
Well, as Ed mentioned, this is the first of our poetry events

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,160
at Helix.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,600
And I'm David Pollens.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,160
And we have a committee of people who have been helping

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,880
and providing suggestions.

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll mention their names.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,640
Heather Dubna, Rachel Haddis, Anne Rieleveen, and Polly

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,320
Rosenweg are all in the poetry committee.

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,840
And are all helping to organize the events.

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,640
We're hoping to have three, possibly four more events

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,280
between now and the summer.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,640
The next thing that'll be coming up in the winter

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,720
is going to be a roundtable on classical Urdu poetry

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,960
and Galib.

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,240
And then a little bit later on in the spring,

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,240
we're going to have a roundtable on ancient Mayan poetry

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,440
in the Popul vote.

33
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,160
And there are some other roundtables in the works.

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,280
And we'll let you know about them as they develop.

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,520
So we have two very special artists,

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,320
and with us today, Sean Singer, who

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,200
won the Yell Younger Poets Prize and the Norma Farber Award

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,520
from the Poetry Society of America for a first book of poems.

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,000
And Lewis Porter, a wonderful, wonderful jazz

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,400
musician and preeminent jazz musicologist.

41
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,800
Did you bring CDs with you today?

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Or?

43
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
No?

44
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,000
I have certain that car.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,480
OK, well, the Coltrane Biographies.

46
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,320
I can go.

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,960
I can go get it.

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,400
OK, the Coltrane Biography is on sale outside.

49
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,160
And so is Sean Singer's book of poems.

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,600
So if you're interested, please, please buy them.

51
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,920
So I'll segue poetically to their collaboration today.

52
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,320
I wonder if they'll help us to answer a question posed

53
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,000
by Sean in his poem inside the Keith Jarrett Trio.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,320
He asks, how does a hollow bone in your head

55
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,280
trace clear purple wavelets from waves of pain?

56
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,840
So we're going to go for about an hour and 15 minutes.

57
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,800
And we'll stop, and we'll have participation, questions,

58
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,360
comments from the audience.

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,040
Thank you very much.

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,160
OK, thanks for coming.

61
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,920
Nice to see you.

62
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Shall we just start?

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,760
The old record rolled out of the hot machine,

64
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,360
the scully automated lathe covered in oil.

65
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,120
Rigged to the metal ends, dying of spin, metal on black,

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,040
back to back thimbleweights, diamond

67
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,680
and rinse to a new shine, lunge and pull into circles,

68
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,400
100 grooves to the centimeter, calling it vinyl midnight candle,

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,880
drops onto the place with the push of the night

70
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,040
gift-figous turping needle, a bell-crank lead plant resting

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,520
in a red scissor over the lumps of steel,

72
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,840
then rising with rustle smoke, jazz dust,

73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,040
rumbly with the blues, the old rumor

74
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,920
monger taking us to the juke, the bambara word that is wicked.

75
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Douncing resin polymer, lost to the racy's stuff.

76
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,720
Baby, she got a phonograph.

77
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,680
Won't say alone some word.

78
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,160
Would evil have I done?

79
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,640
Would evil as the poor girl heard?

80
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Louderford.

81
00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:17,680
OK.

82
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,880
OK.

83
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,080
That's fine.

84
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
I should yell.

85
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Nice to yell.

86
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
OK.

87
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
OK.

88
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:51,080
OK.

89
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,080
Photo of Coltrane, 1963.

90
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,880
Otherworldly and outreaching, a pernastis of noise with the serious

91
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,080
clint of anestimal worry on his face.

92
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,080
O Coltrane, what will rank for your pious gleaming and trillion

93
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
euphonia?

94
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,080
So capable, swift with no trace, no trace of stillness.

95
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,080
The blur of the gray, gray, and gree-gree flows

96
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,080
onward to the black bell of the saxophone, with cylinder of joy,

97
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,080
and in purple sea of heaven, ebbing into hell.

98
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
OK.

99
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,080
I'll try to do that.

100
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:37,080
It's a small place here.

101
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
OK.

102
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,080
You can maybe even not be able to find the view.

103
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:52,080
I should use the natural value of the piano.

104
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,080
That would be very good.

105
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Oh, you don't want to hit it?

106
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Yeah.

107
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
I said, Janie.

108
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Can you put your picture for every being I know?

109
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,080
It's a piece of light.

110
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,080
OK.

111
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Sound check before the next poem.

112
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,080
You need to see this clearer?

113
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
OK.

114
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,080
I'll do it with me.

115
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
OK.

116
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Billie later.

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Boons etch themselves above and below, drink sober lungfuls of hush.

118
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Blood soap and well, the threadbare noises of an amber tube and a bird.

119
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Welcome to the district of snow loneliness.

120
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
My list.

121
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,080
A towel for redness, taboos for my dolls, spasms of a man,

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,080
something emerges from a cord, a pigeon egg, a snow-silent, resilient secret,

123
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,080
holding its hand toward you, holding its pink spotlight,

124
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
finding a Roosevelt dime.

125
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:12,080
I wake up to a new sun, a clear and tender quiet in each bone.

126
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Billie blew his momma's chinaberry tree, angry since the big being card,

127
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,080
and not in the early black, back of the club so thick with smoke,

128
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,080
and lady up front blowing blues till my hair hurts,

129
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,080
spurts of shying some tiny trouble you know.

130
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
In the black fracture of night, she's back,

131
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
hopped on cutie killer, diller faced like a brown egg,

132
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
begging the black like Jack the bear.

133
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Their lady baby, color of a chocolate dress,

134
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,080
juicy Lucy the Shazam, do a bank bang outflose,

135
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
as she called yes.

136
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
I had too many husbands.

137
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Last one beat me black and blue,

138
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,080
and he was out the door, he said,

139
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,080
baby better me than you.

140
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,080
I got good in trunk, I couldn't even see.

141
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,080
No matter how much money I make, I've never been free.

142
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,080
He used to stay out late, now he don't come home at all.

143
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,080
I know by that there's another mule kicking in my stall.

144
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,080
If you don't like my ocean, don't fish in my sea,

145
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,080
stay out of my valley and let my mountain be.

146
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Let me be your rag doll until you're trying to come.

147
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,080
If you beat me, ragged, I've got to beat you some.

148
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,080
If he walks out the door, he won't be gone long.

149
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:35,080
I'll be up on the stage in my needle of song.

150
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:58,080
I'll be up on the stage in my song.

151
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:27,080
I'll be up on the stage in my song.

152
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,080
Scott Joplin.

153
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Son of a slave, your birthday is no more exact than a petal.

154
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Sunflower, you have no need to worry.

155
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Your piano rolls have played in middle and upper class homes.

156
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,080
Maple leaf, across the plains, where is gold, we worry.

157
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Neither improvise nor play blues, but compose.

158
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Chrysanthemum, our ways of living differ, like worry.

159
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,080
The weaponized and visible boundaries of America keep you.

160
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Eugenia, there is a reason to worry.

161
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,080
You were composing, but not recording, only rolls with holes.

162
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Lily Queen, others have been pieces of worry.

163
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,080
The reason you asked and the reason I don't have the answer is the same.

164
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,080
Heliotrope, let's just not worry.

165
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Sifliss with his attendant dementia, paranoia, paralysis, pineapple,

166
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,080
your leaves each fear and heave toward worry.

167
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:33,080
From bone magic, the exeigencies of an interval, Igor Stravinsky.

168
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Ory's gooey nasty bone style with its slurs, gloss and muskrette does

169
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,080
reveals a muskrette in Aquatic Rodin and its fur all Louisiana

170
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,080
industry before worry relocated to Los Angeles.

171
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Thoreau described their nests not as things, but as dwellings, the border of

172
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Habitat and town.

173
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,080
The theme beneath the soly on dropping shocks, with corn shocks and their outside

174
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,080
maze used for toilet paper.

175
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Lil' Hardin's feelings were avenged during their divorce, dropping them on

176
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
Louis' head.

177
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,080
The raw umbrella, a bone facing backwards on a horse-drawn cart when the

178
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
sun sets there is not to do.

179
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,080
I saw you with your sweet man last night and I know you wasn't true.

180
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Just for you, low powdered color through a straw.

181
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,080
From the cave's vantage, feel the trestles and palms.

182
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,080
Be the flash lab, see a ball slow above the plate.

183
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Be the flesh lab too, the cream of your neck, the portion near the ear.

184
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Use your stylus, have no direct hand contact.

185
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Recall that utopia literally means not a place.

186
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,080
Punishment, right, I will not write this poem a thousand times in a wall.

187
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Then hinge that wall or singe it.

188
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,080
I think of Maxine sometimes, her inky bob, Ramones tea and negative definitions.

189
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,080
We would ride her blue Toyota behind the dunes.

190
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,080
Clear cell cancer killed her years ago.

191
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,080
She would take my hand in the mid-grade mall and we saw our liquid happiness

192
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:44,080
rising through bodies.

193
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Mountainous black garden.

194
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:35,080
What good is intelligence if you cannot discover a useful melancholy?

195
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Reading grapefruit, pray and fake grief.

196
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:44,080
Put on floret african and her arm drapes onto steel fibers along nerves.

197
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Her love fills the zinc bottle of its own body.

198
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:55,080
Peel me a woody base, wick the piano away from the sweet peak of Duke's pumade.

199
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,080
Black can be quiet and contain the whole thing.

200
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:16,080
What is a part, what is a part and not hard and hard and not a part?

201
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Welding Irvine, 1943 to 2002.

202
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Please forgive the long silence.

203
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,080
In my gut, which is the blue flame of the stovetop, the broken lands of fear

204
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,080
quakes my liver and my name means not celebration and critique, but concealment

205
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,080
with the dogon called Obea.

206
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,080
And so I take myself into myself, that long ribbon folded inside the cowry shell.

207
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
I'm a massive animal.

208
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,080
The torsion in the muscles of my neck serve up the image of a malcontented demon.

209
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,080
And I suck my own grave through my sinuous mantle groove.

210
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:59,080
First, tar's vinegar warmth euphoria nodding off, followed by automat cheeseburgers in vanilla milkshake.

211
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:05,080
The only black kid in the school picture far away swim look in the thread of his eye.

212
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,080
Japanese love cool struttin, white legs, black A-line fifth avenue.

213
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:17,080
As demons douse metallic nodules, a stylus pins, cold porter and a Pullman quarter.

214
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,080
What seems like a right hand with blue tabula is actually sunny Clark,

215
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,080
waking up from his vomit when he sees what he's leaving behind.

216
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Only the right cord is perfect labor.

217
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Everything with sunny Clark is weakness.

218
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,080
He's a city and a forest in folded quill.

219
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Tranquilize with the black lung and tar black the most aristocratic color of all.

220
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:24,080
Ten burns.

221
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:37,080
There's no such thing as bot music but there's such a thing as progress, Coleman Hawkins.

222
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Although jazzes sepia acetates and lacquers have dipped the black into silver nitrate and are faded little faders, they inflate like lungs.

223
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:55,080
The pink lung with its tortoise shell shellac appears to bulge and its inseam exhales purity and inhales spoonfuls of tempo.

224
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Purity and jazz sir is thwarted and unutilized.

225
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Two hundred years of minstrel snapping their red suspenders corrode and oxidize the air.

226
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,080
Mr. Tambo, what kind of a girl was she?

227
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,080
Zip, she was highly polished, yes indeed, her father was a varnish maker.

228
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,080
You see that rubber pork chop became something.

229
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,080
It's supposed to be funny, by the way.

230
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:27,080
Bishay shimmy shawable from its mold has been heated and mounted face to face with a hinge so that the machine opens up facing you.

231
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:33,080
It is not lighter or inter-metso frozen like trout beneath the flux and ratamacuing of ice.

232
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
It is not alpine.

233
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Aing and schlaff and olf der lauer, oben east der alte ritter.

234
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:49,080
Through the cracked photos breaking into creosote, superlatives doused the monoliths, virtuoso, genius.

235
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,080
But there is a siphoning off of licking pink jam from the knife.

236
00:23:53,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Negativities, the integrated bands, for example, of alcoholics, benzedrin, heads, and junkies,

237
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,080
or the deranged catastrophe of buddy-bold and feeding his hand to a ceiling fan,

238
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,080
or the wicks saturated with amphetamines, or buddy-rich telling the trumpet section of fuck faces

239
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,080
and plink them every seven bars like a neutered werewolf.

240
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,080
When Coleman Hawkins stood half nude like a mango and Friedlander's photo, 1956,

241
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,080
with his curved man-breast sweating from it may not be true, he appears modern.

242
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,080
He is not a man-cane nostalgic item logistical.

243
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:34,080
He, lung of air-rate, propulsive tub, urgently pumping 9ths,

244
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,080
is the living demonic fuse ripping through a blanket of vanilla radio.

245
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,080
Racial animus and tractable sources, faded scriptures,

246
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,080
the pinstripes of the story-ville mudheads, midwives, and the peach tin types

247
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,080
fitted into ladies' brooches are not jazz.

248
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,080
This strategy does not puff the uvula's blowpipe or bring an axe to the vanguard.

249
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Rather, it's shuffle-bucks, pantomimes, and dab slop with a hanky.

250
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,080
Meanwhile, as the onyx rattlesnake of the century slid by 1960,

251
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
the year the fedora went up the flu,

252
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,080
jazz, too, opened like a fire in a woman's ceremony.

253
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,080
It did not end.

254
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,080
Euler had yet to drag the black river into rivulets of need.

255
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,080
Unkempt skinny dips, red vinyl seats of the southern buses,

256
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,080
and the vinegar cloud of the tree's harpsichords were made too of a jazz.

257
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,080
As the bus ate the road's tape measure, the ballrooms closed,

258
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,080
the hickory house sewed 52nd street into a fly-trap enmeshed with liquid static.

259
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,080
The green river you ignore is realized by the black river,

260
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,080
growing wings beneath the shoulder blades of the hatchling.

261
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Coleman Hawkins, who morphs with allular quills into a hawk.

262
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Dark, pitagile marks on underwings, present on all ages and races,

263
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,080
conjured shadows beyond the last section of the long film.

264
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
You're afraid of listening to this lady?

265
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,080
He, too, with parade-flowed head, eyes like flashing Lindyhoppers,

266
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,080
lunging with the lumpy fabric of the past, pushing a gauge,

267
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:10,080
a deuce of blips, blood stream lushes of vipers more righteous than scumpthein codification.

268
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,080
In closing, sir, the reed was always remoisted while you were in the booth,

269
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,080
cutting the montage sequence, but the pink sequence of Bessie Smith quenched

270
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,080
with yielding limelight to disappear to dust like eighth notes.

271
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:33,080
My buttony jacks and the tongue spits out the disc's rainbow.

272
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:41,080
Empowered cadaver at Lewis Porter.

273
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,080
Absolutely.

274
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,080
He who travels learns, Rome a proder.

275
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
Django means I awake.

276
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,080
This verdon wheels its wood spokes through scrollwork indigos,

277
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,080
and a transparent red stove glows by the blanket when a horse clops to the center of the moon,

278
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,080
where Belgium is born, the Manusch, the Mecc King Jones.

279
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:15,080
To wake up in a caravan with a plower viola, canvas-covered hatch means to exist.

280
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,080
But if we exist at the frontier robbing chickens perhaps, flirting with the viola,

281
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,080
violet, or draca grape and sloshing around in purple liquid.

282
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,080
A hedgehog has barbed arter-chokes skin and hides under its anointed bush.

283
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,080
Stuff him with rosemary time and wild garlic over a roasting pit through the clay,

284
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,080
with lacho robin and a savory liver.

285
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,080
To awake to see the window and the horse-drawn air,

286
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,080
to awake to the dark muzet and the purple vaults.

287
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,080
A hedgehog winds his piston by the chimney,

288
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,080
and gripelli and Reinhardt screaming fragrant honey under the sky's purple canvas.

289
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,080
The sound gets to be part of your body.

290
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,080
Lester Young sleeping with his horns when Billy wasn't there.

291
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Black faucet, black suede, Django Reinhardt, the guitar superman.

292
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,080
His black moustaches sip the milk foam.

293
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,080
No one listening to him turn a girl into a puddle has ever complained.

294
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,080
Look to the side and he'll be there.

295
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Disassembled parts of the base clarinet.

296
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:55,080
One.

297
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,080
Aerophone, over-blow.

298
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,080
Grenadilla, cylindrical boar, sassafrass, Contra-based, orange tiger roar.

299
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,080
Harry, Carney, half-hole, Bitch's brew, resin, cousin,

300
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,080
Mary, Eric, Dolphy, grapefruit stew, Rosen.

301
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,080
Neither a dry sound or the white rice paper mask,

302
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,080
but swallowing the moon, the notes drink like grapes.

303
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:24,080
The Newark photographer says that when he was a kid, there were 12 or 13 movie theaters downtown.

304
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Now only a tiny porn theater, a spits distance from the museum shows octaves of skin.

305
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,080
Part of the lip stretches behind the knee, smooth as a mercury reissue,

306
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,080
and the precipice glistening like a roll glaze has been pushed up and down across

307
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,080
the surface of the surface.

308
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,080
The dough gone where purple fringes and their pearl millets

309
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,080
sing vessels of donkeys bearing caratatives.

310
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:58,080
Like the sandstone, bendigara, all rectilinear with masks secured by the teeth.

311
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Four flutes roll off their center.

312
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,080
The cakes filling plastered, not a sigh exactly longer,

313
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,080
but a piece of barbecued peaches.

314
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,080
White and red altars catch clouds.

315
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,080
As that with Braxton means, I shook hands with elven Jones

316
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,080
and with Lawrence D. Butch Morris, the cavernous filaments of the downtown room

317
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,080
like a limb soaking in a barrel.

318
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,080
An article said, the amount of female granaries is an indication

319
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,080
for the amount of women living in Guinea.

320
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,080
As nougat-like pomade yelled, the girl can't help it.

321
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Coltrane likewise said whatever he'd say about Eric Dolfi would be understatement.

322
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Newerks dry rot and magnesium flares show litter and the bare branches of a maple.

323
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:50,080
Some looters return with armfuls of candy, coolade, and water guns.

324
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:56,080
The late photo of Saravon shows black triangles arranged like Batman villainous.

325
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Years ago, her carefree loafers and red Parisian mime stripes swung easy.

326
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,080
The liner notes reveal that she could have succeeded in the classical field.

327
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,080
Wayne Shorter would say, what's happening?

328
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,080
And she'd say Newark, and that was enough because you know what Newark does to people.

329
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,080
Mel Torme reports that she kind of got huffy when he said operatic,

330
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,080
and then she said, do you mean jazz isn't legit?

331
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,080
You might say that powders are being crushed in the mortar

332
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,080
like some of the purple splay like limbs, the embracing limbs.

333
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:32,080
For a while, poetry did not interest me with its flailing, corruption, boredom,

334
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,080
obsequiousness, and general green color.

335
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,080
It was a cloak used for taunting by everyone, assholes all.

336
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,080
Flaubert thought the same thing about the bourgeoisie.

337
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Nothing is ever the same as they said it was.

338
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,080
Blue lights of her hair vertical, the gray pearls of her neck,

339
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,080
and the purple lights of her hair were very colorful to the place, better or worse,

340
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
where eyes penetrate.

341
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Bear forks, glitter, swan glasses hiding among the bushes, sort of feeling your way.

342
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,080
Arbus said the hand is the cutting edge of the mind.

343
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Flawed animals, meat, and buns and slaw, she sort of lifted up her hips

344
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,080
so the rims of the bones were elevated, a sort of hand clasp of braided chestnut.

345
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Rather than non-vocal to the bone, she pulled his shoulders forward hovering.

346
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:25,080
During rehearsal, the wordless word was loosely creased, where the lowest part of the hip is hooked to the curve.

347
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,080
Roland Kirk's no tonic press has a double meaning.

348
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,080
The first note in the scale in the double gin Lester Young was drinking without quinine water.

349
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,080
Circumference of lemon like the brim of the hat, blooming into focus in the film.

350
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,080
I gather dry kindling on the snowy mountain slope.

351
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,080
White where the branches gather in my hand.

352
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Wood has dropped its pieces with trees along the way, where the couple walks the trail inside the creamy sand.

353
00:37:53,080 --> 00:38:00,080
The bassist said the action on the bass was high, vertically so, so that the elastic boom made for instant decay.

354
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,080
Threadgill says tubas can control the decay and attack.

355
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,080
Tubas blend with everything, whereas the bass doesn't blend.

356
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,080
Brass will cut through anything, you have to wait on the bass.

357
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,080
A tuba player, he says, can shut it down because it's wind.

358
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,080
The bass player said during a long jam, he never gets a break.

359
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:25,080
The glass of Pepsi has water already dripping down the side of the glass, from the ice skating in the armful of warm air.

360
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:33,080
A woman bends to pat a multi-stripe cat, liquid gray, who prances between the aisles, listless and revolting with mystery.

361
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:38,080
She loves the horrendous creature, whose eyes glow, yellow like a vial of pernow.

362
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:44,080
Its tail upright plucking an e-minor because the story has become more complicated than when we left the house.

363
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:51,080
Miles played in Tokyo and then Berlin, former scorched sectors, alighted in the terror-bot scopes.

364
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:59,080
In Tokyo, in March 9, 1945, we, Americans, burned to death 100,000 people in a single night.

365
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
Men, women and children.

366
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:07,080
On July 14, 1964, Sam Rivers channeled T-bone Walker, among the velvet echoes,

367
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,080
a cosine Anken hall.

368
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,080
The dogan say that we should remember, God has no external ears.

369
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,080
She cuffs her hands.

370
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,080
Babies are like waterflowers who do cool leaves from the tubs of their eyes.

371
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,080
Our ways of living differ.

372
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,080
Two.

373
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
Think of swaggers on off switch.

374
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Weldon Irvine said many of the young rappers got disconnected from a tradition of protest

375
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,080
and decided to rap about mayhem in order to get paid.

376
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:47,080
You can tell the political orientation of the bus driver by whether he says Lenox Avenue or Malcolm X Boulevard when he announces the stop.

377
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,080
The large blue and white wheels slapped the painted curb covered with slush.

378
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,080
November 80.

379
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,080
I walked to school not knowing how to play with.

380
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,080
I decided not unlike John Gilmour at Birdland 1956 to play Contra.

381
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,080
We play against everything in the blaze of a hearth.

382
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,080
We got the concept.

383
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
We got the concept.

384
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
We got conceptual.

385
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,080
I'm on East 80th Street.

386
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,080
The whir of pigeons have delicate lavender pockets around their eyes.

387
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:22,080
They ground themselves in the spring of city dust as a pillowy aplomb among the air's granules.

388
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,080
Of a city in its puzzle pieces, many tongue embraceable.

389
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,080
Two men are dancing in a bar.

390
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,080
It's 1130 according to the wall's cold aged Genesee Beer clock.

391
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,080
They're dressed in 1980 styles.

392
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,080
Valor and floppy existential caps.

393
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:43,080
The shadows of the men's bodies are cast on the jukebox behind and their joy.

394
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,080
What do you know about the forgotten ones?

395
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,080
Try to understand the beautiful bodies, peeling pain and upturned peaches from a Marxist perspective.

396
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
Why this city?

397
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Dactritus, denitations and detonations?

398
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Why the snail shell, uncomfortable water?

399
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,080
The caramel tone of Saravon and the air is punctuated by wings.

400
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,080
Instead of limbs, wings slice through at 80 degrees,

401
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,080
assaulting through the sky's catapult, salted in polychrome.

402
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,080
I'd like to be away from 1980 for a while and see its chemical pinks

403
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,080
stripping from the unfeeling dinosaur eye of the iridescent pigeons.

404
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,080
Another time from above or below.

405
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
I will not take my father's footsteps.

406
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,080
A miner's helmet with its bulb pierced with a tack and driftwood.

407
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,080
Around a wall, the light bounces on a mirror with its white cotton.

408
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,080
You are encased in the city's steel tub.

409
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:43,080
Washboards scrap, empty grape drink bottle, frail, fall, literal, burnished.

410
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:56,080
Do you feel the calm chewing the marrow from the gains the city has made?

411
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,080
A half city moves along the mouth of a canal.

412
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,080
You are living inside its corridors, breathing the air shaft smell of a fish bone.

413
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,080
Your limbs reach across the threshold down the hallway of metal doors.

414
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:14,080
It is that multi-hued avenue that comes at the park's edge after a mollusks snowdrift away from the window.

415
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,080
Model jams coated in conceivable rust, the pigeons' peppery throats,

416
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:25,080
blushed like the sorcerers bending the tab rings of their cans and all echoes.

417
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:30,080
It is not only pushers and gathering places, storefront churches, crates of apples.

418
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,080
We should not be east of the park, but no one knows we're here.

419
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:38,080
If it is the paradise or the omni, swaying along the velvet curtain of the sky.

420
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:43,080
Beyond the rooftops, I see the families create a father's day picnic out of a card table,

421
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:49,080
boombox, a ginger ale, boxes of chicken, a dominoes game, clamped to a dude's lecture.

422
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:54,080
I would run from the 125th Street Station down the sustained line of the sidewalk

423
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,080
and wait for the elevator that stops to raise its pulley and flywheel

424
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:02,080
and drop my trapezoid body and raise to the apartment to caress your hair

425
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,080
or to let up or simply hold on.

426
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,080
It is a familiar curvature, the places of valley, the cathedrals east.

427
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,080
The same streets reach out in the same places to open the same mirrored lobbies.

428
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:20,080
We arrive at the place where the wife relaxes and folds her legs on the floor in conjecture

429
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
at all the sidewalks traversed.

430
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,080
She has me, a partner who knows that her memories are bubbles,

431
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:31,080
that we see a far-fetched capital lift and break through tenements and wish like a creed

432
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,080
we would travel along rifts and octaves to hear the doorbells and bird coos

433
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:41,080
or feel the extraordinary orange of the Florida sun, a woman clutching an orange pill bottle,

434
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:47,080
and we go along the snake like name-six and the keratin hooves of the city can always relieve us.

435
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:53,080
We have people sitting around understanding the bubbles gloss anywhere the fragile numb inheritances.

436
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:58,080
Answer the launching terrors, her axes and closet doors she remembers.

437
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,080
We will burst them all along.

438
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,080
A calm despair is the essence of wisdom.

439
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,080
This string, she's moved over an air current.

440
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:13,080
Now they rewind a latex balloon in Newark like a vacated building, the place rebricked for chump dimes,

441
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,080
its thrennities slicing hammer.

442
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,080
These strings preach at a husting.

443
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:24,080
Pluck your needs from their housings, dive with your funnel to the back of the land in deep

444
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,080
and fracture the unbodied air.

445
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:33,080
This is about thick blood for a ghost in hues of sickle shaped jets.

446
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:40,080
Listening to Cat Edmondson with R, Portis head in the car with N, but this quartet brings them back

447
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:58,080
when the tenor's potato mash-er explodes above the trench.

448
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,080
The clarinet.

449
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,080
All the klezmer bands used it when they eased themselves down from dark.

450
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,080
Down, down, down, down.

451
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,080
Prospero broke his black staff and Van Glorious light beamed out.

452
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:32,080
The fairy light, slave light, shallow mow blue, music foot flatted the New Englander barn.

453
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:37,080
Moon thin and rumbled bass, yeses and linets and sounded out vanilla sugar.

454
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:43,080
Quavers of cholera turas made tint and abulation and eler ganda was the valve trombone and guitar,

455
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:48,080
hush hush in the background and got cool quiet and wake the blues.

456
00:47:48,080 --> 00:48:11,080
Listen, listen and the light come through.

457
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:43,080
The sweet obsession bleeds from Singer.

458
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,080
Singer is dead today and in the ground forever.

459
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:52,080
How astonishing his blue vapor is seeping, not consuming itself outward from his honey and body.

460
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:57,080
He is buried in fine linen in the old style and his saxophone is engraved as a tiger lily.

461
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:04,080
There was love in him. His love was not a wild stag nor fragrant oils nor hills of cinnamon.

462
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,080
It was a light through the ocean, cool and content.

463
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,080
He handed this poem to me and was born, sifting up to the surface.

464
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:16,080
All the passions of my organs are soft doorways, the garden turns inside out.

465
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,080
One dreams white as a sky, one black and crowded as trees.

466
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:24,080
Each with a door, a rude odor, a reed.

467
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:29,080
Remember him, darkest eyes playing like hell in the mountains, love like that blue,

468
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,080
making up in depth for what it lacked in brightness.

469
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:36,080
We will not speak of love with him again.

470
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:57,540
Coming by a

471
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,080
You

472
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,080
You

473
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,080
You

474
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,080
Elintonia

475
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,080
In the lamp caught fire after he put a blue cashmere sweater over it

476
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,080
Settled as a Nance Obligado on Filmy Violin

477
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,080
Two brown curves and puss on

478
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,080
Perfling's ease sound out of the stank of violin parts

479
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:08,080
Belly, waist, chinrest, ribs, sound hole, peg box, tailpiece, rounded shoulder

480
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,080
Ellington was an expert on them all

481
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:17,080
Belly's straight round would wake up, composed for four hours, would wake Duke

482
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:22,080
Blood count or a ballad for very tired and very sad lotus eaters, for example

483
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:27,080
And he'd bring his golden torso up and finish off the rest of the composition

484
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:32,080
In the morning after composing all night, Duke would open the closet full of blue cashmere sweaters

485
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,080
Orkshrews playing the next morning

486
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,080
Plucky, plug ugly, pudselana, porous and perfect blues

487
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:44,080
Daffton, Dilea, Boulians, Diabutsu, Eir, Damsel, Fish, Ectogenesis

488
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:49,080
Darden, Ells, Edge, Darksamite, Demonax, Ellipse, Desirus, Empire

489
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:53,080
Dobelio, Hippis, Dove, Talis, Ballyar

490
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,080
Salieri, Ease, Drop, Mozart, Playing a word sex game

491
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:05,080
Just then the creamy squeezing oboe, Exalted unbolted, Kima, Philo, Omblada, Plum, Beautiful music, the color of blonde night

492
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:11,080
Red plum jam on Pumpernickel, a Puerto Rican hermaphrodite, putting on pink lip gloss

493
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:18,080
Wednesday night, Ellington, who could fulfill the slightest discolored saxophrage leaf, easing between two rocks

494
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,080
Heard through a catnap and half dozen chewed pencil tips

495
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,080
The baby green sweet pea, Billy exhale

496
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:33,080
Blue through blue duke, Dims passed on to accept that place which comes to each of us alone

497
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:05,080
Blue through blue, Ellington, Pumpernickel, Ellington, Pumpernickel, Ballyar

498
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:35,080
Blue through blue, Ellington, Pumpernickel, Ballyar

499
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,080
So

500
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,080
You

501
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,080
You

502
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,080
You

503
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,080
You

504
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,080
You

505
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,080
You

506
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,080
Thank you very much

507
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,080
Thank you

508
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,080
Thank you

509
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:39,080
I'm in the remaining time I'd be happy to address any questions you have or we would if there are any

510
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:56,080
Well, it's a work of fiction so it's a character but similar to the writer but sometimes

511
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:03,080
Not a tribute per se but sometimes in literature rather than

512
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:13,080
Confront unstable or unsavory or unpleasant topics you could do it through a character or a mask or some type of device to

513
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:20,080
Increase the psychic distance between the writer and the subject matter

514
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:27,080
So this character can be killed off he can do things that I wouldn't do

515
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:36,080
And also the double play on the meaning of the word singer was just a useful device so that's what that was

516
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,080
It's like Woody Allen they always ask him that is that based on your

517
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,080
Albie Singer from

518
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:47,080
But I mean even more recent films like his film from the 80s and 90s they always say that based on your life

519
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:53,080
You could say that it's just based on somebody who happens to go out with younger women

520
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:58,080
One of them happens to be a student of his or maybe a step door or something

521
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:02,080
But you could say it's a little like me but it's not really

522
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,080
Yeah

523
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:08,080
Please use the microphone if you want to ask a question or comment so we can get you out of hand

524
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,080
One other question

525
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,080
Ragi?

526
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,080
Yes?

527
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:17,080
I just want to say that I enjoy the music and poetry done together

528
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,080
But this is a question for the cast

529
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:25,080
Is the music original composition?

530
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,080
I'm just trying to hear if there were any other things to pick up from other songs

531
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,080
Which I didn't hear

532
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,080
But I don't know what all the compositions were you're on?

533
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:37,080
I made up all of them just now except for a few things

534
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:41,080
This one is kind of like a New Orleans blues

535
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,080
So even though I made it up it's within a very set format

536
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:50,080
And this was body and soul

537
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:01,080
And this is really based on all of me but I didn't really play it much

538
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,080
It really goes

539
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,080
Let's go

540
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:08,080
I'm not too old for me

541
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,080
Can't you see

542
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,080
But I didn't really play that

543
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:20,080
So it was all improvised but for those three I used so long forms that I'm familiar with

544
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,080
The rest I just made up and people sometimes tell me they say

545
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:27,080
Some of those were pretty good you should try and remember them and use them again

546
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,080
Maybe I'll listen back and see

547
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,080
You have a few other questions

548
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:40,080
I mean I do a lot of composing in fact I've done everything from short jazz tunes to symphony orchestra works

549
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:44,080
So I do a lot of composing it depends whether if I think it was good enough to save

550
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,080
Then I'll work on it and write it down

551
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,080
Rob you had a question?

552
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:54,080
Yeah, other questions for this kind of collaboration of a poet and a penis like this

553
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,080
Working together reciting and then

554
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:01,080
Whether it's jazz poetry collaborations since at least the 20s

555
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:08,080
Langston Hughes, Hart Crane, Kenneth Rexroth, Kenneth Patchin

556
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:13,080
Carowack and so on and so forth

557
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:18,080
But the two of us have done this a few times at various places

558
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:21,080
Cornelius Street once and I think at Rutgers once

559
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,080
So there's a precedent

560
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,080
This is more and more of it

561
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:29,080
My friend Vijay Arya who's a lately very successful jazz pianist

562
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,080
He used to do a lot of that in the 90s

563
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:37,080
He doesn't do that much anymore I don't think he's got a lot of gigs with his own band now

564
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:41,080
But the first time I saw him he was playing with a Mary Baraka

565
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,080
Exactly

566
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:47,080
But I will say this the thing about the earlier days

567
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:52,080
Through the 50s a lot of times what the jazz musicians did with the poets

568
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,080
It just played tunes that they had already rehearsed

569
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,080
So it's only more recently that you see people doing what we are doing

570
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,080
Where I'm just kind of listening and trying to see what will go with that

571
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,080
Some of the older collaborations are really just preset tunes that they just

572
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:09,080
Say okay here's a tune that we already play

573
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:12,080
So that might go well with this poem of yours

574
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:16,080
So to actually improvise at all is not that common maybe

575
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:21,080
I like the conversation

576
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:27,080
The problem was that it was frustrating not to go over words

577
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:34,080
So it was something about the balance between the piano and the recitation

578
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:38,080
Yeah that's why I kept asking you if we had it

579
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,080
Well it's an imperfect system

580
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,080
We could still work on that

581
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:47,080
You have to scream more when you're reading your poems

582
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:51,080
I would suggest something that you might want to prove of

583
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:59,080
And that is reading the poems before having the accomplished improvisation

584
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,080
You mean read it once and then once with the piano

585
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:06,080
So I think of that idea

586
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:10,080
Some of them don't want to hear the poem twice

587
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:14,080
How many people would like that idea of hearing the poem twice?

588
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,080
Some people would like that

589
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,080
How many people are too busy?

590
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,080
Life is too short they don't need to hear it twice

591
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:24,080
Come on, you're busy right? I understand

592
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:28,080
Another option might be to put the piano further away from the poet

593
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:31,080
And then you know the spotlight on you and your solvents

594
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,080
I had a really hard time hearing it

595
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:37,080
In addition to the logistics of the thing

596
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:43,080
They're very clearly dense complex things that I've written

597
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:47,080
So even if I read it twice I don't know

598
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,080
It might improve it a little but I don't know how much that would do

599
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,080
His poems are very erudite, they reflect a lot of knowledge

600
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,080
And a lot of knowledge of the history of poetry

601
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,080
So there is a lot of detail in them

602
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:03,080
It's not like poetry slam where you can understand it

603
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,080
The minute you hear it

604
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,080
I have a question for each of you though

605
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,080
That wasn't a question

606
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:13,080
In terms of when you play the piano

607
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:17,080
Are you improvising as you go along

608
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:21,080
Or have you already read the poems prior to

609
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,080
Is this the first time you're hearing the poems?

610
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,080
It's a good question

611
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,080
We actually talked about that because

612
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,080
You know I have the book

613
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,080
Which won all the prizes

614
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:35,080
And I have a chapbook that other thing of yours

615
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,080
So I have some of his poems

616
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,080
I've read them and enjoy them

617
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,080
I feel like I know something about poetry

618
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,080
I know something about the way poetry is structured and all this

619
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:46,080
But we actually talked about whether I should have the poems in front of me

620
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,080
Because I certainly don't know any of the poems

621
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,080
Well enough time I would know them by heart

622
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,080
You know so

623
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,080
And we decided that could actually be distracting for me

624
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,080
So we decided not to do it that way

625
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,080
And essentially I'm hearing the poems for the first time

626
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,080
Because you know I've read them once or twice

627
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,080
But it's not like I really know them

628
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,080
And a question from Mr. Sinner

629
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:09,080
I read in your bio your process of creating your poetry

630
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:13,080
I read about your own history

631
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,080
I read about your own history

632
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,080
But she says the question

633
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,080
I read in your bio the process of your writing

634
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,080
So you write down little snippets of observations

635
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,080
For a period of time and then it comes to you

636
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:28,080
With that process, how many poems do you generate per year?

637
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,080
What would you say?

638
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:34,080
Well the past several years not as much as I've been writing

639
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,080
Dissertation and doing under things

640
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:40,080
But ideally I would write as much as possible

641
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:44,080
But in my opinion there are too many already

642
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:50,080
Too many poems? Yeah, or too many of your poems?

643
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,080
Well in general but I'd rather just be open to it

644
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:56,080
And then have it come when it comes

645
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:00,080
But theoretically this has not existed

646
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:04,080
But I would write every day

647
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:08,080
But in reality I try to just do it

648
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,080
And then I try to do it

649
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:14,080
But in reality I try to just do it

650
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,080
As much as possible

651
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,080
I think maybe built into her question

652
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:22,080
Is the question is that a slow process?

653
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,080
Yeah, it takes years sometimes for a single poem

654
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,080
I'll work on it and you'll come back to it

655
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,080
I wanted to make a comment about the difficulty

656
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:34,080
Understanding some of the words as you were reading

657
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,080
I read your book of poems twice

658
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,080
And enjoyed the poems

659
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,080
And found myself enjoying the poems in a different way

660
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,080
Hearing them presented in this format

661
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,080
And I felt that missing out on some of the words

662
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,080
That you can get when you're reading

663
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,080
And there's silence around you

664
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,080
This was a different experience

665
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:56,080
In which in the fence getting all the words wasn't that important

666
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,080
And the sound of your voice was a kind of a music

667
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:02,080
And it was more notes than semantic units

668
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,080
I think if you...

669
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,080
This verdict is still out on what I'm about to say

670
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,080
It's my opinion

671
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,080
But I think if you've missed the rhythm in a poem

672
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,080
You've missed the whole ship

673
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,080
I mean the sound is

674
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:22,080
The pleasure for the ear is really what I'm there for

675
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,080
A lot of the times

676
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,080
So I like that

677
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,080
But I mean not in all cases

678
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,080
In all times I guess

679
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,080
I can't I just don't want to see the thoughts

680
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,080
And the fun is just because you're doing the poem

681
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,080
And you're about giving the non-inspirational audience

682
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,080
So that's one

683
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,080
I have a better idea

684
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,080
Everyone in the audience has to

685
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,080
Has to buy the poems

686
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,080
Yeah

687
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,080
Good one, huh? What do you think? Good?

688
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,080
I think the...

689
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,080
You know, one of my CDs

690
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,080
And then you play together when you get home

691
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,080
What the hell? Don't even stay for the performance

692
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,080
That's it, I'm going home

693
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,080
I mean ideally these would require multiple readings

694
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,080
Or whatever

695
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,080
We do

696
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,080
A kind of version of that

697
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,080
I have a two-part question

698
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,080
And I was wondering

699
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,080
The structure of jazz

700
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,080
As opposed to the context

701
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,080
You know of the poetry

702
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,080
And I don't know much about the structure of jazz

703
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,080
Could you just give us a little

704
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,080
Bit

705
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,080
An inter-dramaticism there

706
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,080
But I know classical music but I don't know

707
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,080
The structure

708
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,080
And does it go necessarily with the rhythm

709
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,080
Of the poetry

710
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,080
And then the context of subject

711
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,080
I'm going to ask that a little bit differently

712
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,080
From the way you asked it

713
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,080
Because

714
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,080
First of all, in terms of structure

715
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,080
The thing about jazz is that

716
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,080
You're improvising over a structure

717
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,080
The structures you're improvising over

718
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,080
Not so different from classical music structures

719
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,080
So we'll talk about the first theme

720
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,080
The second theme

721
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,080
But we're improvising really on the harm

722
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,080
And use of those themes

723
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,080
Jazz we always say

724
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,080
Goldberg variations

725
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,080
Are closer to jazz

726
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,080
Than most forms in classical music

727
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,080
Because he takes a harmony

728
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,080
And does 32 amazing

729
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,080
Different ways of playing over that harmony

730
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,080
So that's kind of what we do

731
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,080
But I also do free improvisation

732
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,080
Because I am a composer also

733
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,080
And I'm well versed in classical music

734
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,080
So one thing I did, I don't quite remember what it was

735
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,080
But it was kind of a debussy kind of thing

736
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:28,080
And I remember something like...

737
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,080
Music

738
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,080
Music

739
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,080
Music

740
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:42,080
Music

741
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,080
Debussy, you know, I'm thinking about Debussy

742
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,080
You know, Debussy was

743
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,080
A lot of composers will say he's the inventor

744
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,080
Of modern music, you know

745
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,080
And he composed of even Stavinsky

746
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,080
So Debussy was like a god to him

747
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,080
And I don't know if you know this

748
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,080
But Stavinsky showed the right of spring piano version

749
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,080
That he was using, not the orchestral

750
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,080
But Stavinsky was playing it on the piano to accompany the dancers

751
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,080
And he showed it to Debussy

752
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,080
And Debussy's site read it

753
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,080
He said, oh, this is rather good

754
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,080
And Stavinsky was looking at him

755
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,080
You can read that at site, you know

756
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,080
It was a whole new kind of music

757
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,080
But so it doesn't really...

758
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,080
Because the whole idea of Debussy

759
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,080
Is to get a sound that you like

760
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,080
And he would use something that I sometimes call them

761
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,080
Cluster chords. This one happens to be a diminished chord

762
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,080
This one happens to be a dominant chord

763
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,080
But it's...

764
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,080
This is not jazz

765
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,080
You understand? So you can't make that comparison

766
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,080
My point is when I do that

767
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,080
I'm not doing the jazz thing

768
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,080
I'm not taking a set harmony and improvising over it

769
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,080
I'm improvising the whole thing including the harmony

770
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,080
In the style that

771
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,080
It happened to be a little like Debussy

772
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,080
It was me, but it happened to be inspired by Debussy

773
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,080
It's like composition, but spontaneous

774
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,080
Not everybody can do that

775
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,080
I mean, I happen to be

776
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,080
A very familiar classical music

777
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,080
And I like doing that kind of thing

778
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,080
So that's different, that's not a jazz thing

779
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,080
I think with the poems also, I want to try to create

780
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,080
It's artificial to some extent

781
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,080
But I create a situation that seems like it was inevitable

782
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:12,080
But also somehow spontaneous

783
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,080
The context

784
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,080
Well, there's a way that it sounds

785
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,080
The way the lines are broken, etc

786
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:24,080
The subject, the context

787
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,080
Do you address that?

788
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:30,080
I try to, but I just want to say something about that

789
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,080
Which is that most poets, not only poets

790
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,080
But almost anybody who accompany

791
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,080
Whether it's a pipe work with dancers

792
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,080
You do things for film sometimes

793
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,080
Don't like it if you try to catch every nuance

794
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,080
Because then, could you read it?

795
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,080
When it's thunder and he plays it

796
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,080
You don't want that

797
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,080
They don't like it if you go and try to emulate it

798
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,080
He says, then I heard the blues

799
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,080
And then I heard some thunder

800
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,080
But then it started to rain

801
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,080
It sounds funny afterwards

802
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,080
It's like a desire of thunder

803
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,080
There's a skeleton

804
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,080
Yeah, it sounds silly

805
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,080
And by the way, in the film business

806
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,080
They used to call that Mickey Mouse thing

807
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,080
They maybe they still do

808
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,080
Because the idea is that in cartoons

809
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,080
You do that, but you wouldn't do that in a serious thing

810
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,080
So we have talked about that

811
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,080
Yeah, that's what I'm getting at

812
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,080
So we have talked about that

813
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,080
And so what I try to do

814
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,080
It's a little hard since I'm not so familiar with this poetry

815
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,080
And some of them are things I hadn't read before

816
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,080
But certainly the ones I read before

817
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,080
As soon as I heard the beginning

818
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,080
I kind of had a sense, okay, is this a dark mood?

819
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,080
Is it a light mood? Is it a blue?

820
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,080
I just mentioned the blues

821
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,080
You know, this kind of thing

822
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,080
So in that sense, I try to do the overall mood of it

823
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,080
But not try to catch every little nuance

824
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,080
And I was trying to play very softly behind them too

825
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,080
With the soft pedal on here

826
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,080
I have two comments

827
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,080
One is to combine

828
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,080
And you said make a CD

829
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,080
And you should combine it and make the poetry CD

830
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,080
So we could take it with us

831
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,080
Good idea

832
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,080
And the second part was

833
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,080
It's now for you

834
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,080
2%

835
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:10,080
The other part was, like other people mentioning, your words

836
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,080
Hard to pick up sometimes

837
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,080
And then you went into a kind of a

838
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:18,080
Philip Glass melodic piece

839
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,080
That tripped me out and I went to an altered state

840
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:24,080
I saw you altered

841
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,080
I noticed you altered when I played

842
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,080
I did it

843
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:30,080
Yes

844
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,080
Yes

845
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,080
Something like that

846
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:38,080
And then I was able to hear the words a lot clearer

847
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,080
Since I went into an altered state

848
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,080
And then you could hear it better?

849
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,080
Yeah, yeah

850
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,080
I dropped out and dropped in

851
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,080
So what's the problem folks?

852
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,080
Just alter

853
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,080
Come on

854
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,080
That's right

855
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,080
Well play more altered music

856
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,080
Is that so hard?

857
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,080
Come on

858
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,080
Yeah

859
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,080
You're only trying to

860
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,080
Just having out about the experience

861
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,080
What's the problem?

862
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,080
Hang on

863
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,080
Come on

864
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,080
Wait

865
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,080
Let's see

866
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:08,080
Somebody's happy that you saw an information about me

867
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,080
I don't think so

868
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,080
It's on the website I think, right?

869
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,080
David?

870
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:17,080
Well there's a description on the announcement of Dr. Zacharounds and Papa Caves

871
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,080
Yeah, and my site is easy to remember

872
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,080
LewisPorter.com

873
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,080
Do you have a site?

874
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,080
No

875
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,080
No

876
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,080
These two famous to have a site

877
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,080
Well, and

878
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:31,080
I also found myself drifting a lot in and out

879
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:36,080
And sometimes it felt like the reading was competing

880
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,080
With the music

881
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:44,080
And sometimes I stopped listening to the words

882
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:47,080
But then I'd come back and

883
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:50,080
I'm not sure what to say

884
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:56,080
I think it would be interesting to study what people hear

885
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,080
You know how much I would do that

886
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,080
And that's not the question

887
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:05,080
It's an interesting process

888
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,080
Listening to both things

889
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,080
And sometimes

890
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,080
You know, I wonder why people

891
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:15,080
Either go into altered states or trip out into reverie

892
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:21,080
What in the music, what in the poetry, what in their collaboration

893
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,080
I don't know, but just

894
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,080
I'm myself thinking of all these things

895
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,080
It was very pleasurable

896
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,080
All the time

897
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:33,080
Whatever, not understanding what I say about feeling that they were

898
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:36,080
In some instances competing for my attention

899
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:40,080
You know, I went in good places, I always came back

900
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,080
I never felt like, gee, I missed something, I don't know, I'm sure I did

901
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,080
I missed a lot of the poetry

902
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,080
I don't necessarily feel that the language or the words

903
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,080
Sort of takes supremacy

904
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,080
I think there's a deliberate interaction and a kind of

905
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:56,080
As you described, it was better, but give and take

906
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,080
Where you might hear that more certain moments

907
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,080
Or whatever

908
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,080
Yeah, and I think also, you know, maybe

909
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,080
When we're really successful

910
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:09,080
You'll hear both at the same time, but that certainly would be different from person to person

911
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,080
And another thing is that

912
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,080
But I am also doing certain specific things

913
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,080
Like you might notice, I don't do any of my fast stuff while he's reading

914
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:20,080
So certain rules, I just have certain rules for myself

915
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,080
Nothing really fast while he's reading some of those things

916
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,080
But my idea is slow is probably most people's idea fast

917
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,080
So I do play a lot of fast notes

918
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,080
What do you think is that a role to date?

919
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:35,080
Would be another way to do it like a couple of the verses

920
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:40,080
Well, I did that with a band called the John L. Eric Kelso

921
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,080
Quirt had its own YouTube

922
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:47,080
Oh yeah, I have a quirt, they're like, they play

923
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:51,080
I don't know what you call it, Dixie Land kind of style of music

924
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,080
But that's how we did it, that

925
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:57,080
Oh yeah, but I mean, I think he means like, line by line almost

926
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:00,080
Well, yeah, with that, I don't remember exactly what happened

927
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,080
Not necessarily

928
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:04,080
I think I read and they played and we kind of did it that way

929
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:09,080
Well, you know, again, it was my experience, which I didn't completely anticipate

930
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:14,080
That you felt more like a duet as if it were two instruments

931
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:20,080
And one of the instruments was a vocal chord vibrating

932
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:26,080
And the sense of the poem wasn't important, as important in this context

933
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,080
As it would be in a different kind of context

934
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:36,080
Okay, also it's important to know that poems really should not or can't be paraphrased

935
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:40,080
I mean, you've got to sort of experience the whole poem to get the poem

936
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:46,080
And say, what was it about, the time I journeyed over to Ithaca and well, you know, it doesn't make any sense

937
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,080
You don't get it that way

938
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,080
Well, that's a good point, because the whole point is the words that you're using

939
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,080
It's like I always say Dickens is such an amazing writer of fiction

940
01:19:54,080 --> 01:20:10,080
You can read the plot summary, if that's all the work to it, then there would be no point to write the novel, you know?

941
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:16,080
The writers spoke about working over the manuscript a great many times and changing things

942
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:24,080
But the pianist speaks about doing the improvisation right on the spot and not necessarily being able to repeat it

943
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:30,080
Now that's two very different views of how to perform this work

944
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:37,080
Now, would you be willing to write it out, to write out the music and keep changing it

945
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:44,080
Under different circumstances, or is this what's unique about this presentation

946
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:48,080
That you have a poem, let's say, that's been worked over many times

947
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:52,080
But a piece of music that hasn't been worked over many times

948
01:20:52,080 --> 01:21:01,080
Well, I mean, in that example, I think you're approaching sort of songwriting with musical accompaniment

949
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:13,080
I mean, like Cole Porter, for example, that we know his compositions, love for sale, or whatever it was

950
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:19,080
You know, every time, but like summertime, another example, I read there's 25,000 different versions of it

951
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,080
Recorded versions of it

952
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:25,080
Recorded versions of it, and each one is different, but they're all summertime

953
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,080
So that's how that would work

954
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:33,080
And also, I mean, a lot of these poems, I wrote them maybe 10 or 15 years ago

955
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:38,080
So I have no clue what my mind was like at that moment, I don't know anymore

956
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:44,080
But occasionally, when I'm reading, I kind of take something out or change it or

957
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,080
Just to amuse myself

958
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,080
Yeah, well, that's good, if you amuse yourself

959
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:54,080
But I would also say that that's a different thing, since I do compose

960
01:21:54,080 --> 01:22:01,080
We could certainly collaborate, I would say I'm going to write a setting of one of your pieces, either with a written out piano

961
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:09,080
Or a strinkled set, which could be great, hey, you might like that

962
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,080
On the other side, there are people who improvise poetry

963
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:15,080
But you can't improvise the same way that I couldn't write, I couldn't improvise

964
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,080
What do you want?

965
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,080
Some of my orchestral music

966
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:21,080
You couldn't improvise some poems that are very erudite

967
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:26,080
There's a certain kind of poem that you can improvise, which tends to be more on one level, it's not a multi-level poem

968
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:31,080
You're having the middle of it, some kind of a reference to something that T.S. Eliot did

969
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,080
They tend to be more one-level poems and more direct and easy to understand

970
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,080
But there is such a thing as improvising poems

971
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:41,080
Also, when you're hearing it, you're really missing a major component, which is the lines

972
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,080
Poems versus written in lines

973
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:48,080
There are prose poems, which is kind of a stupid name, but

974
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:52,080
That a lot of the information is contained in that

975
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:56,080
Where the line is broken and for reasons, and so on and so forth

976
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:08,080
Just one comment, generally in poetry, relatively modern poetry, anyway, there's a feeling of spontaneity

977
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,080
One feels as though the words were happening by themselves

978
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:18,080
Jazz is sort of similar in that improvised jazz has that feeling of being spontaneous

979
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:27,080
Even if organized, it's spontaneous, so I think the collaboration is very much equal in the sense that

980
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:36,080
You have two medias that are associated with spontaneity and therefore create their own sort of spontaneous interaction as they happen

981
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:44,080
So I'm sort of not in favor of overworking and over-preparing because that would certainly kill the goose

982
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:50,080
That's a point to that, that makes sense

983
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,080
I guess our time is up?

984
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,080
No, thanks

985
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,080
Thank you

986
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,080
Thank you

987
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,080
Thank you

988
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,080
Thank you

989
01:23:59,080 --> 01:23:59,080
Thank you

990
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,080
Thank you

991
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:00,080
Thank you

992
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,080
Thank you

993
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,080
Thank you

994
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:07,080
We have folks there, if anyone, medias, and if you have any questions, please let me know

995
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:13,080
Thank you
