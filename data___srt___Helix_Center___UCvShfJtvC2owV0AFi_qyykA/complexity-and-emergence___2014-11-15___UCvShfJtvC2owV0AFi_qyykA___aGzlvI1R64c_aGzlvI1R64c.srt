1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:57,720
I just want your attention for a moment.

2
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:05,160
We are going to do a very un-psycho-analytic thing and guilt you all into filling out

3
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
these surveys.

4
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,880
It's a very important part of what we're doing and part of the grant that was given

5
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:19,720
for these events depends on our having enough individuals filling out these surveys before

6
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,400
and after the round table.

7
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,000
So we're going to distribute some more of these and please just over the next couple

8
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,600
of minutes make an effort just to fill them out if you can.

9
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Thanks.

10
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,320
And we also have some more programs available that gives more information on the question

11
00:03:35,320 --> 00:04:00,840
for today and the participants.

12
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:27,120
Not too high because then keep banging on me.

13
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:41,240
So tell us about it.

14
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:50,200
Next slide.

15
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:57,280
Yes,azac.

16
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:07,280
I think it's...

17
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Is it too heavy?

18
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,280
It's like a couple of minutes.

19
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,280
No more.

20
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,280
No more.

21
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,280
If we're in, Julie looks, we can get more people kind.

22
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Exactly.

23
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:47,280
Okay, we're going to get started.

24
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
I'm Rob Penzer.

25
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,040

And for the benefit of the viewing audience,

49
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,220
could each of you raise your hand when I say your name?

50
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,100

focusing on the theater and stars and the ultra dense matter

56
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,420
that exists inside them.

57
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,360
After receiving his PhD from Harvard,

physics and society course, introducing the non-science

65
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,620
students to the methods of physics and their application

66
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,260
to questions that confront us as citizens of a developed

67
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,220
and developing world.

68
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,020

147
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,620
and media outlets, too numerous to mention.

148
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,620
Now, our panelists will begin.

149
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,300
Hi.

150
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,820
Well, perhaps I could start us off with a very general question.

151
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,900
What do we mean by the notion of emergence?

152
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,980
Emergence is back in vogue in discussion

153
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,340
about the nature of the physical world.

154
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,860
But it seems to me that different people

155
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,060
may mean different things.

156
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,460
There's a very uncontroversial sense of emergence,

157
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,340
which simply means that there are levels

158
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,820
of organization in the natural world that involve patterns

159
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,700
that are distinct and inclined from lower level patterns

160
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,180
of explanation and behavior and structure.

161
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,620
In that sense, it's uncontroversial

162
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,820
that there's emergence.

163
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,940
Chemistry isn't identical to fundamental physics.

164
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,700
Biology is not identical in form in its concepts,

165
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,700
its characteristic patterns of explanation to chemistry,

166
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,940
let alone psychology, further still,

167
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,220
from any of these fundamental sciences.

168
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,260
So in that sense, it's uncontroversial

169
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,860
that there's emergence.

170
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,060
The controversial question then is,

171
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,540
how do these different levels of explanation,

172
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,740
levels of organization, connect to one another?

173
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,460
And so I thought I'd just kick it off

174
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,420
by asking you to weigh in on that question.

175
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,580
We'd like to begin.

176
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,900
I don't mind taking that.

177
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,980
I guess one of the things that interests me

178
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,540
about the concept of emergence is this question

179
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,620
of causality.

180
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,620
And if you have bottom up causality

181
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,540
so that if you understand the fundamentals of the electrons

182
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,420
and the atoms that you can in principle

183
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,900
put the follows and the properties of any emergent

184
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,940
phenomena are ultimately predictable

185
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,740
from those simpler phenomena.

186
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,220
All this idea of bottom down causality

187
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,140
where the emergent phenomena alters, I guess in a sense,

188
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,260
it means altering the physical environment

189
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,940
in which more fundamental processes play out

190
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,500
and they then play out in a different way.

191
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,140
You fundamental processes emerge.

192
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,900
And I guess as a physicist, I tend to think

193
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,420
of things like superconductivity and stuff like that

194
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,420
where the structure of some solid substance

195
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,340
that will become superconducting alters

196
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,540
the fundamental characteristics of electrons.

197
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,300
It can form this maybe old physics

198
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,100
but koopa pairs and things that then have different properties.

199
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
And of course, so I guess for me,

200
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
that's a really interesting question,

201
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,380
something I have no answer to.

202
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,740
And I'm completely ignorant of this notion

203
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,780
of causality operating in two different directions,

204
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,580
perhaps even simultaneously.

205
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,060
So I think I can maybe build up your comments here

206
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,820
as an early universe cosmologist.

207
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,100
I tend to take things back to the beginning.

208
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,020
And something that I think about a lot is what,

209
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,020
so we think about the universe itself

210
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,780
as a complex emergent system.

211
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,820
If that's the case, it seems like we can go back in time

212
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,020
and sort of upward in energy

213
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,060
and think about what the conditions were

214
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,020
in the early universe that allowed

215
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,700
for a complex system to emerge.

216
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,180
Because in one sense, from a theoretical point of view,

217
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,180
we would expect that the universe was formed

218
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,220
in a symmetric state in which photons created

219
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,900
particle, antiparticle pairs and vice versa.

220
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,700
And if that had been the case,

221
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,700
then the universe would just be a sort of soup of photons

222
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,500
with a proton, antiproton pairs sort of here and there.

223
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,300
And there would be no complexity

224
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,580
and there would be no structure.

225
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,580
And it is because there were these violations

226
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,500
of early in the universe

227
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,580
that we actually have a complex system to talk about.

228
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,500
So I think that's where I tend to go

229
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,340
when I hear the word emergence

230
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,460
in the context of the physical universe

231
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,540
is way back and really thinking about conservation laws

232
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,260
and broken symmetries.

233
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,980
Okay, so what I find interesting is that emergence

234
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,820
is used in opposite ways.

235
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,900
The strong type of emergence

236
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,980
that Kayla was just talking about

237
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,660
is used to say that the whole is more

238
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,020
than the sum of the parts.

239
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,380
But then there's the weak kind of emergence

240
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,820
where you're saying that you can explain the behavior,

241
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,060
complex interesting behavior of something larger

242
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,740
in terms of its constituents.

243
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,700
And then it's got a sort of reductive feel to it

244
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,580
and you're using emergence, the same sort of idea

245
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,500
to say, well, there isn't really anything new here

246
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,260
to talk about, it looks interesting,

247
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,260
but it's actually just the same lego blocks,

248
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,300
arranged differently.

249
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,620
And so you can, depending on how someone's using

250
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,020
the word emergence, they can be cutting

251
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,020
in very different directions.

252
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,580
Yeah, one question that they have is,

253
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,900
in this definition, for example,

254
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,420
does it mean that the different levels

255
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,100
they're independent?

256
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,460
I mean, obviously, if the atomic physics is different,

257
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,020
so the physics is different, the chemistry

258
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,060
is going to be different.

259
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,580
So it's not going to be completely dependent

260
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,860
on the previous level.

261
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,780
So there from the, I mean, introduction is the way,

262
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,660
I mean, there are certain things that depend

263
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,860
on the other level.

264
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,740
So it is not completely new, completely free emergence,

265
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,700
I mean, it's dependent on the other ones,

266
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,340
the same way that economy depends on the biology,

267
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,620
I mean, you can not.

268
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,820
So if there is something that is completely new

269
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,100
that appears on a different level,

270
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,980
it's because we don't have the power within the theory

271
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,540
or within our machines or our simulations

272
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,380
to predict that there is something new

273
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,340
or it's because there is something really new there.

274
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,540
Well, if I could jump in there.

275
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,580
I think you're putting your finger

276
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,540
on a fundamental question, which is,

277
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,100
does the very idea that the universe is built up

278
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,460
out of some more fundamental stuff entail

279
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,860
that the only kind of emergence

280
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,980
that one could expect in the world

281
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,420
is this week's or that Mark was talking about?

282
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,180
Because of course we believe that complex objects

283
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,900
in our universe depend in some very strong sense

284
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,420
on their fundamental constituents

285
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,700
and the forces that govern the binding of those constituents.

286
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,340
And I take it that the person proposing

287
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,420
a stronger notion of emergence will say

288
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,860
that while there is that dependency,

289
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,420
you can't have the complex system

290
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,940
if the underlying stuff isn't there functioning

291
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,980
in the way that it does, still there may be certain properties

292
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,460
of the whole that are not wholly fixed by

293
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,900
the underlying arrangement and propensities

294
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,180
of the fundamental stuff.

295
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,740
So could there be in some sense

296
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,220
that you had a threshold level of organized complexity

297
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,940
and then a new feature of the whole appears

298
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,060
that's not a simple structural feature

299
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,060
like the shape of this table, but it exerts

300
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,700
some kind of causal influence subsequently.

301
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,980
Going back to the question of broken symmetry.

302
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,540
So if you have something that these

303
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,220
there are different solutions for the practical problem

304
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,220
and you choose one, I mean, because he started

305
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,300
got what happened or something like that.

306
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,180
Then I don't know, I would not say

307
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,500
that this is kind of emergent.

308
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,340
I mean,

309
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,660
would not, yeah, okay, well, question is

310
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,940
should we be thinking of emergence

311
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,940
in the same way in every context?

312
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,860
There's lots of complex system sciences

313
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,700
at various level.

314
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,540
You're talking about a very fundamental

315
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,140
or kind of big picture that cosmological distribution

316
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,340
of matter or something of that sort.

317
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,180
That's one very interesting area where

318
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,700
the question of emergence arises,

319
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,340
but then it arises in more specific kinds of sciences,

320
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,060
self-organizing systems, biological properties,

321
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,580
psychological properties, consciousness, right?

322
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,700
The mysterious nature of our own subjective awareness

323
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,300
as persons and perhaps the way we should think about

324
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,940
this, the idea of emergence in these contexts

325
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,220
could it possibly be different?

326
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,700
Is it an empirical question or is it

327
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,780
a purely conceptual question?

328
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,380
That is, might empirical data suggest

329
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,380
there's a stronger form of emergence going on

330
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,780
in relation to this specific phenomena,

331
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,620
whereas Marx's notion of weak emergence

332
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,380
is perfectly adequate in abstract terms

333
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,860
to capture what's going on in some other domain.

334
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,700
What do you think?

335
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,460
As a scientist, you just come with an a priori

336
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,540
presumption of weak emergence.

337
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,100
I think scientists always get to have weak emergence

338
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,100
because they always want to say that everything

339
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,860
everybody else is just a game with,

340
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,900
according to the rules and containing the ingredients

341
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,500
that the scientist, preferably the physicists,

342
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,700
lay down at the very beginning and then the people

343
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,860
at the high level or special scientists, whatever you want

344
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,740
to call them, would like to fight the reductionism

345
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,060
and the ultimate form of fighting it

346
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,060
is what you were just saying, where

347
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,780
you have some structure that emerges,

348
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,380
some high level structure that actually supposedly plays

349
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,060
a role, a causal influence.

350
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,460
It actually does something.

351
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,900
And it's not just all the swarm of molecules of which

352
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,700
is made up, all secretly, all doing stuff that somehow adds up

353
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,500
to something, right?

354
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,580
What you're hinting at is something beyond that,

355
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,660
not only is it not obviously obtainable

356
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,540
from the sum of the parts, it actually isn't.

357
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,300
That's what you would, that's the holy grail.

358
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,340
Is that the fair?

359
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,900
Yeah, and then the question is, is it for empirical reasons

360
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,020
that we might doubt there is such a strongly emerging

361
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,380
phenomena or is it just a kind of working hypothesis that

362
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,900
our native, our default setting as scientists,

363
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,300
when we approach a domain, is that ultimately there's

364
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,620
a kind of ability, so it's at best, weaker emergence.

365
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,900
Well, the default is certainly going

366
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,900
to be being able to do business as usual.

367
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,780
So I think you'd need some pretty dramatic evidence

368
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,700
to push people away from the idea that ultimately it's

369
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,420
all the standard ingredients operating according

370
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,740
to the standard rules.

371
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,180
And what we can think about would be interesting,

372
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,020
would be what if such evidence showed up?

373
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,180
What if you found something where it looked

374
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,420
as if you really couldn't, some actual phenomenon,

375
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,020
that you really couldn't explain it

376
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,260
by using the standard model of particle physics

377
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,500
or using whatever you usually did?

378
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,420
How would we react?

379
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,060
Yeah, what can be the best example of these strong?

380
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,100
How do you distinguish it from simply being ignorant?

381
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,820
Well, that's fundamental.

382
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,300
Well, so some philosophers and others

383
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,660
will point to conscious awareness,

384
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,860
subjective experience that we're all having right now.

385
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:39,020
As we think about the nature of the universe,

386
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,860
we seem to have this direct immediate apprehension

387
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,540
of our own conscious states and the qualities

388
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,380
of our experience, the looks of colors, the sounds,

389
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,300
given off by moving bodies.

390
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,700
These categories have no place in a physical description

391
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,460
of the world around us.

392
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,340
And yet they are an aspect of the way

393
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,020
we experience the world.

394
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,020
We think that we have a very good understanding

395
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,980
of how the neurons work and they are connected

396
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,500
and all these things.

397
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,220
We would not be able to predict something like that.

398
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,340
The Australian philosopher Frank Jackson

399
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,420
proposes, you know, a contemplate.

400
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,900
Philosophers are interested always

401
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,180
in the end game scenario, right?

402
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,900
Empirical science is ongoing.

403
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,660
So what we have to do is there's

404
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,460
some sort of strong reason for thinking

405
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,060
that no matter what the future development of science, which

406
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,980
of course is unknown to us right now,

407
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,780
there could not be a thorough explication

408
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,420
of conscious experience in physical terms.

409
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,780
And his argument is, you know, so positive,

410
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,260
we have a neuroscientist, call her Mary.

411
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:58,140
And Mary knows everything about the neuroscientific processes

412
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,500
underlying color experience.

413
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,060
So she knows what's going on in the visual cortex.

414
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,780
She knows how the light information comes into the eye,

415
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,780
how it triggers what's going on in the brain.

416
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,140
And she can do all that in neuroscientific terms,

417
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,180
enough so that if she sees a computer read out of somebody's

418
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,500
brain, she can tell you about the intrinsic character

419
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,300
of the experience.

420
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,020
But suppose Mary herself has never had color experience.

421
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,660
Suppose Mary grew up in a black and white room

422
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,740
and was imprisoned there by her diabolical parents.

423
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,700
But then she escapes as an adult.

424
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,380
And she suddenly goes out, she sees a bright red rose.

425
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,900
Her first ever non-monochromatic color experience.

426
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,220
And she says to herself, so that's

427
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,060
what it's like to experience redness.

428
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,540
It seems like she's learning something new,

429
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,260
not about the physical world, but about the character

430
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,460
of color experience, the intrinsic subjective character

431
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,100
of color experience.

432
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,060
And it would appear that simply having a picture

433
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,380
of the structure and dynamics of the brain

434
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,100
is not going to disclose that intrinsic quality.

435
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,540
A congenitally blind color scientist

436
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,260
can know everything about the structural arrangements

437
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,100
of the brain and the dynamical processes

438
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,940
that govern the unfolding of that.

439
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:23,020
But it seems intuitively to us is going to necessarily

440
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,660
lack acquaintance with the intrinsic character

441
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,780
of that color experience, some kind

442
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,780
of intrinsic property of the color experience.

443
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,500
Yeah, I can imagine the same experiment

444
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,540
and the experiences that are not humans, for example.

445
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,420
And then you don't need to postulate anything

446
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,860
like a consciousness for understanding

447
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,580
the reaction of this and the behavior of this animal,

448
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,020
for example.

449
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,740
Oh, sorry.

450
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,980
Can you hear me now?

451
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,500
Yes.

452
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,540
So if you take another animal that is not human,

453
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,940
and then you do a similar experiment,

454
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,060
that's probably more ethical.

455
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,300
So then, probably the assignment would realize

456
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,900
that they have some experience or not

457
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,380
being cautious of doing that.

458
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,940
But it's probably the same behavior.

459
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,700
I mean, we don't need to postulate something

460
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,740
like a consciousness at these points.

461
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,220
But don't we know that we ourselves are conscious?

462
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,340
Isn't that something given to us before any engaging

463
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,620
in science that's given to us more immediately

464
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,820
than anything else, that I myself am a conscious being

465
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,300
that I'm having experiences of a certain sort.

466
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,500
I'm wondering whether what you're suggesting is,

467
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,580
well, this consciousness notion is something

468
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,860
that mature science is going to do away with.

469
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,020
We can explain everything in terms of structure and dynamics.

470
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,500
And so no need to postulate consciousness.

471
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,780
But the consciousness doesn't seem to be something

472
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,700
that we postulate.

473
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,500
It seems to be something that we start with.

474
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,980
It's part of our data.

475
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,220
Yeah, my only thing is that if, I mean, it is the question.

476
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,940
If we forget about there is something like consciousness,

477
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,060
I think the world can be exactly explainable in the same way

478
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,420
or not explainable in the same way.

479
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,020
I mean, if there is a person here,

480
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,900
if that is not conscious or something like that,

481
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,500
then it can't react in similar way.

482
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,340
Who's the zombie?

483
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:19,660
I can't react in the same way.

484
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,180
I think there's a more fundamental problem

485
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,100
with what you're saying, which is that you're

486
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,620
sort of a first person thing.

487
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,220
You're saying there's this first person thing

488
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,740
that I have this conscious experience.

489
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,860
And could science ever capture that?

490
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,380
No, because science is inherently third person.

491
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,500
But actually, all forms of inquiry.

492
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,460
And then you could even say all forms of knowledge

493
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,100
are inherently third person.

494
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,340
But there's really almost nothing that you can say.

495
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,180
You have that experience.

496
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,860
You could say you have the experience.

497
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,740
But beyond that, it doesn't seem like there's anything

498
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,740
you can do or say.

499
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,540
So supposing that the strong emergentists dream came true.

500
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,100
And there were these phenomena.

501
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,460
And when somebody was angry, something

502
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,100
happened in the synapses of their brain

503
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,620
that wasn't because of other synapses firing.

504
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,260
It's coming from God knows where.

505
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,300
It seems like it's coming from outside the system.

506
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,100
OK, so now we've seen this sort of thing before in science.

507
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,620
We've had processes that seem to not conserve energy.

508
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,380
And we postulated the neutrino.

509
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,100
And you have little pieces of metal moving around on paper

510
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,980
with nothing touching them.

511
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,020
And you postulate a magnetic field.

512
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,540
So we'll go in there.

513
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,100
We'll postulate some other thing.

514
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,860
We'll try and explain what's going on.

515
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,620
We'll try and understand it.

516
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,340
All that's going to be third person.

517
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,940
And in fact, even a psychologist

518
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,340
is explicitly investigating feelings.

519
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,420
It's all third person.

520
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,820
You're investigating other people's feelings.

521
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,740
You're investigating how they behave, what they want, what

522
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,620
they do.

523
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,660
Psychoanalysis is inherently third person.

524
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,140
It's very hard, as far as I can see, to think up.

525
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,740
The first person thing that seems like the motivation

526
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,580
for emergence is actually a form of knowledge.

527
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,740
Another thing I think in science, one of the things

528
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,100
that we postulate that there is a magnetic field, for example,

529
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,540
there are some predictions that can be done there.

530
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,140
And going back to my point is that if we have an animal

531
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,260
and we want to know, is there a test

532
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,980
that we can do to the animal?

533
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,100
To know if this animal or this person is conscious or not,

534
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,220
we thought postulate in the existence of the consciousness.

535
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,060
I think we can exactly predict the same behavior.

536
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,820
Good.

537
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,700
Maybe we should just pursue a bit longer,

538
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,060
because I still think there's a little bit

539
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,980
about the case of consciousness.

540
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,300
But I think it's a special case.

541
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,020
So I think eventually we'll want to transition

542
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,020
to talking about other forms of complexity.

543
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,500
So the reason I say it seems like a special case is precisely

544
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,060
because in other domains, like you've been both

545
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:58,740
are indicating right now, it's when we get puzzling phenomena

546
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,460
that is observable physical phenomena

547
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:06,100
that are current inventory, or physical inventory of properties

548
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,260
and in forces doesn't seem adequate to capture

549
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,580
that we then have to broaden out our physical

550
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,140
understanding, so electromagnetism in the 19th century.

551
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,820
In the case of consciousness, it's

552
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,060
not the behavior of consciousness that

553
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,380
leads us to think we're going to need

554
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,500
some new fundamental explanatory principle.

555
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,140
It's in the intrinsic character.

556
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,980
We have this acquaintance with consciousness,

557
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,460
and then it's left for future theorizing to say,

558
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,900
what difference does it make?

559
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,740
Is it epiphenomenal?

560
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,580
Is it such that it's just there, but it's

561
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,940
an offshoot of the intrinsic character

562
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,740
of neurophysiological processes, but it

563
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,780
makes no fundamental difference to explaining

564
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,980
the behavior of the conscious person,

565
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,140
or does it impact, have an impact?

566
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,540
That's still an open question.

567
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,420
Once you take on board, consciousness

568
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,820
is a new fundamental kind of feature.

569
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,980
So it's a very sad taste, and Mark was saying,

570
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,740
but from the point of view of theoretical science,

571
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,220
to make progress in order to gain knowledge,

572
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,100
we have to take a third personal point of view.

573
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,220
And I think that's right.

574
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,740
In every other domain, other than conscious experience,

575
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,740
itself, precisely because what we're theorizing about

576
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:24,740
is a first personal experiential kind of state.

577
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,780
So to try to understand the solidity of this table,

578
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,300
your first personal experience as an investigator

579
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,420
is irrelevant, provided you have enough experiential powers.

580
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,580
Maybe you're blind, maybe you're deaf.

581
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,060
You have certain limitations on your sensory apparatus,

582
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,020
but it provided you have enough in order

583
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,740
to understand the theory of physical bonding processes.

584
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,260
Matter.

585
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,380
It doesn't matter that you lack knowledge of what

586
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,740
it's like as a normally cited person to see the table.

587
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,620
You can still understand completely

588
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,700
the physical dynamics of the table

589
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,660
and why it's a relatively stable, solid object.

590
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,620
But conscious experience itself is the first person phenomena.

591
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,340
So if you say, well, we're going to leave that out

592
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,380
of the picture and just talk about the dynamics

593
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,500
of neurons in relevant portions of the brain,

594
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,020
well, you're leaving out precisely what

595
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,500
is being put forward to for explanation.

596
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,500
So it's a first personal phenomena intrinsically.

597
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,260
So this is maybe taking it in a slightly different direction,

598
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,100
but it's also because I'm a simple person

599
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,820
and I'm getting very confused with all these discussions

600
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,500
of conscious.

601
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,820
But one thing that pops into my head as you're talking,

602
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,140
and I think it relates to the first question,

603
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,740
what does emergence and complexity mean to you?

604
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,780
You're assuming, I think, or perhaps when people talk

605
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,420
about consciousness that everyone has the same type

606
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,940
of consciousness.

607
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,140
Now, if we say that consciousness comes

608
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,100
as an emergent phenomena from an extraordinarily complex

609
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,740
biological system, electrochemical signals and so on,

610
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,860
there's no guarantee that it's precisely the same for everyone.

611
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,700
There are enough neurons and synapses

612
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,180
that every individual human, every one of seven billion

613
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,420
minds, human minds that exist on this planet,

614
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,460
actually have something that's slightly different about them.

615
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,980
Now, in a statistical sense, we can do

616
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,220
tests to examine consciousness and our reactions

617
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,660
to whether that's a red rose or a black and white rose

618
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,500
and so on.

619
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,260
But that's kind of a statistical test.

620
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,580
It's not getting to the core of one of the reasons,

621
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,020
I guess what I'm trying to say is that one

622
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,660
of the reasons something like consciousness

623
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,260
may be such a slippery thing, apart from our innate relationship

624
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,020
to it, is it may be different all the time.

625
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,900
It's something that comes out of enormous complexity.

626
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,220
And the same is true of other emergent phenomena.

627
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,460
And this is one of the things we may be having a hard time

628
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,740
getting hold of is that there's stochasticity

629
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,500
in this whole process, that's random, that's everything.

630
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,100
It's going to be slightly different in every single instance.

631
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,140
And perhaps that is one of the things

632
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,300
that is making this difficult for us to grow.

633
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,020
It's certainly making it difficult for me to grow.

634
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,860
But maybe that's just because I'm very simplistic

635
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,580
about these things.

636
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,740
Does that trigger any thoughts?

637
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,620
Yeah, I think it's not what you're saying.

638
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,380
I think it's not difficult to understand

639
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,100
because it's like planets which you understand very well.

640
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,340
Well, I don't.

641
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,580
OK, which come in.

642
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,300
Millions of different varieties and a very hard to pin down.

643
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,980
When you say everyone's consciousness

644
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,500
is different from each other.

645
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,220
Well, maybe.

646
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,740
Well, I don't think there's even a maybe.

647
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,140
It's not even clear there's a question.

648
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,380
There is no way.

649
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,500
There is a way to compare this planet to that planet.

650
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,300
Even if it's difficult, you can send the probe,

651
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,500
measure the spectrum.

652
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
There is no way, even in principle,

653
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,860
to compare your consciousness with anyone else's.

654
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,580
We don't even know what the question means.

655
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,980
What do we do to answer it?

656
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,260
I think that's what's actually so slippery and hard about it.

657
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:58,340
Not that it's very difficult, practically.

658
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,500
So my present conscious experience

659
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,780
is not just open to investigators to all look at,

660
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,540
verify that it has certain properties,

661
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,100
and then move on to the next subject,

662
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,020
and then do the comparison.

663
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,860
Each of us at the end of the day,

664
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:16,100
if we take the fundamentally of conscious experience seriously,

665
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,740
we're stuck with saying all we ever have,

666
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,420
any individual researcher has direct observational access

667
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,220
to is her own conscious experience.

668
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:30,140
And so then one could worry that there's

669
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,940
much greater variation in conscious experience,

670
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,620
even for people similarly poised, physically,

671
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:43,620
looking out at the same angle, how much variation is there.

672
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,220
It looks like we just have to make indirect guesses based

673
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,380
on physical similarity.

674
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,700
The brain scientists tell us about processes that are going on,

675
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,860
and they're being commonalities of types,

676
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,980
that there's perhaps no guarantee that that directly corresponds

677
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:06,060
to commonality of intrinsic conscious properties.

678
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,420
Yeah.

679
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,740
Well, I wonder whether we could shift from consciousness,

680
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,700
and maybe I could pass the baton, since I'm a philosopher

681
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,340
of mind, but there's all these other interesting physical

682
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:17,940
phenomena.

683
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,580
So I wonder if somebody could run with a form put out there

684
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,340
for the rest of us some form of complexity

685
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,900
in a domain that you study and with it.

686
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,220
So I think, for example, yes, that we were discussing before.

687
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,660
One interesting one is, for example,

688
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,020
something like the origin of life.

689
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,300
I mean, if knowing the fundamental physics,

690
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,420
laws, and the chemistry, and everything,

691
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,580
if we could predict that there is something like life,

692
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,980
and if the life would be in this form,

693
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,980
or there are several forms, or something like that.

694
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,620
I mean, obviously, life exists, and it can be measured.

695
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,460
So it's a well-defined problem.

696
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,180
So I think here we have an expert that

697
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,540
can give an opinion that is a little bit more solid than mine.

698
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,420
Yeah, I mean, I think origins of life

699
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:04,060
is an excellent example, because we've built.

700
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,100
What's interesting about the origins of life question

701
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,980
just to go back to very sort of practical terms

702
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,580
is that it's a bit like defining life.

703
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,980
There's a joke that goes on in circles

704
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,100
where if you stop a random scientist on the street

705
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
and you ask them, tell me what life is.

706
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,260
Define that.

707
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,460
You get a different answer each time.

708
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,220
And one of the excuses that we come up with,

709
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,660
well, life is a sort of emergent phenomenon.

710
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,780
It's a complex thing, and so, et cetera, et cetera.

711
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,740
But this directly impacts the quest

712
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:40,660
to understand the origin point of at least life here on Earth.

713
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,500
Is there a clearly defined origin point?

714
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,780
So we start to explore this, and we look, perhaps,

715
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,220
at the nature of biomolecules, how they might come

716
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,820
together and chain reactions to reduce polymer-like molecules

717
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,620
that then fold and do other things, and so on.

718
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,620
We might look at, we might look for origins of life

719
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,420
by studying inorganic templates on the Earth.

720
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,660
So, for example, looking at hydrothermal vent systems,

721
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,140
whether there are electrical and chemical gradients

722
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,940
that look remarkably similar to things

723
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,420
that we see across cell walls.

724
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,500
And the interesting thing about the origins of life question

725
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,460
is that much like defining life, there are probably,

726
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,580
right now, 100 theories out there,

727
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,700
or 100 investigations, each is different

728
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,660
than trying to answer what was the origin point of life.

729
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,140
And I think what's becoming clear from that, at least,

730
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,620
my mind, is that it's not unreasonable to think of life,

731
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,420
also, as some kind of emergent phenomena.

732
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,740
It's an emergent property of chemistry.

733
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,940
But it may have had multiple origin points.

734
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:54,540
And so this adds another layer to the issue of complexity

735
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,180
and emergence.

736
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,980
Maybe there are some phenomena that

737
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,220
are initiated in many different ways simultaneously.

738
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,180
And it's the combination of all those that come together.

739
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,020
So I think in origins of life research,

740
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,500
there's something that we might learn by understanding

741
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,420
what really is emergence.

742
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,180
And is there, sorry to come back to this.

743
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,980
And I'm a reductionist.

744
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,820
Don't get me wrong.

745
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,740
But I do believe that there are feedbacks, feedback loops.

746
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,940
And I think, a sort of intermediate way

747
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,020
of thinking about this bottom up to top down causality

748
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,380
is that there are feedback loops that are initiated.

749
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,140
You have an emergent phenomena, and it influences what's

750
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,380
happening at a more fundamental level.

751
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,820
But there is feedback, because at more fundamental level,

752
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,460
they turn influences the emergent phenomena.

753
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,020
And there may be stuff like that happening

754
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,780
in questions of origins of life.

755
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,140
So I know it's a little vague and nebulous.

756
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,620
But yeah, origins of life.

757
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,340
If there's an emergent phenomena that we're really interested

758
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,460
in, it's life.

759
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:02,980
So I don't know.

760
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,620
Does anyone have any feelings or thoughts about that?

761
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,740
Is life an emergent phenomenon?

762
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,740
You want to vote?

763
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,620
Well, there's only four of us.

764
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,740
Anyone is going to disagree with that.

765
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,020
But is it?

766
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,980
Then what type of emergent phenomena?

767
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,060
Yeah, so that's a good question.

768
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,820
I think weekly emergent, we would all probably go for.

769
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,900
Because there isn't this sort of classic argument

770
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,580
that it has to be something other than that.

771
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,940
So it could all come from the dance of molecules.

772
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,260
So that's probably enough for people

773
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,980
to say that's the default hypothesis

774
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,020
until you kick me off it.

775
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,860
Yeah, it's interesting that in the history of science,

776
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:52,980
in the late 19th and early 20th century,

777
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,260
there was a lot of very serious scientists

778
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,180
who thought that life was a strongly emergent phenomena

779
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,180
that they thought, well, just look.

780
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,140
Look at a living thing.

781
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,820
Look at the dynamical principles.

782
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,340
There's a kind of teleology there

783
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,740
that you don't see in non-living matter.

784
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,900
But that kind of perspective sort of completely

785
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:17,540
fell by the board with the rise of the DNA analysis of life

786
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,500
and coming to understand that one thing we know,

787
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,700
life is a very complex phenomena.

788
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,500
So this idea that it's a simple quality that just sort of appears

789
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,580
when matter is arranged in the right sort of form.

790
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,860
That's not taking seriously.

791
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,260
And yet it's interesting that you're

792
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,740
wanting to bring back in the question of,

793
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,940
in terms of the origin point of life.

794
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,260
So I think there are several things

795
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,020
that I think one should take this idea seriously also.

796
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,380
I mean, it's amazing that when life, I mean,

797
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,140
when the Earth was habitable, I mean,

798
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:51,740
a few million years or not even a thousand million years

799
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:56,500
after that, it was after that we started having science of life.

800
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,180
So it was very, very immediate that this happened.

801
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,300
So I don't know.

802
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,740
I mean, we have only one example.

803
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,780
So basically, we have two solutions to the problem.

804
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,940
One no life in some problem in some planets

805
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,340
and one life in ours.

806
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,580
So it's only one.

807
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:14,620
But I mean, it's interesting that it happened so fast.

808
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,620
So I think it could be that we don't understand exactly how

809
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,980
to connect the dots of something that is starting

810
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,220
from a soup of molecules.

811
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,820
They still have organized to arrive to something

812
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,420
that is kind of life-like.

813
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,500
And we don't know if the solution is unique as the one

814
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
that we have, or they have many different solutions

815
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,140
in each planet.

816
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,380
I mean, perhaps in a few years, we

817
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,740
will have a collection of planets

818
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:37,260
in a star wars reach of those with different creatures.

819
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,820
There is a request that you all have to evolve.

820
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,580
Oh, I say sorry.

821
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,940
Yeah.

822
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,460
So are any of us here fairly knowledgeable

823
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,900
about more general self-replicating systems that

824
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,940
are non-living and does this shed light perhaps on?

825
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,220
There's a lot of science going on,

826
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,660
treating of simpler non-living systems,

827
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,620
but nevertheless, share with living systems

828
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:05,820
this self-replicating dynamics and apparently

829
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,980
a kind of spontaneous emergence, but probably

830
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,780
of a weak form of emergence where we can actually

831
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,940
understand very well the underlying physical principles

832
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,180
that govern these systems.

833
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,420
And I just wonder for somebody who studies living systems

834
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,860
themselves, which are much more complex,

835
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,900
whether this is something that is potentially

836
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,460
going to shed light and provide the answer to your question.

837
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,340
I think people, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

838
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,140
back in, what's it, the 1970s, 1980s,

839
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,180
people got fascinated by cellular or dominant, right?

840
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,140
These little essentially computer codes

841
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,020
that had very simple rules.

842
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,540
And suddenly you could get all this complexity emerging

843
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,100
and so on.

844
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:52,020
I don't know what people work on today in that area.

845
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,220
Is there some particular field you have in mind where people

846
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:55,740
are?

847
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,540
Well, I just know that there are very

848
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,860
simple physical mechanisms that exhibit.

849
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,980
I don't know a great deal about it.

850
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,260
That's why I was wondering if any of you could speak more

851
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,340
to it.

852
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,620
But they can be studied.

853
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,540
So these aren't just computer simulations,

854
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,740
like cognitive life.

855
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,420
These are actual physical systems that

856
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,540
exhibit self-replication of a kind.

857
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:21,860
I think you'd have to have Stephen Wolfram to have that done

858
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,380
in detail.

859
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,060
So I think that I'd like to make a point about evolution,

860
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,380
actually, in connection with this.

861
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:34,620
And that is that, so just as there's

862
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,900
people who would like mind to be something more than the physical

863
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,340
body, there's many people who would like the development

864
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:48,100
of life culminating in us to be more than just random variation

865
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,620
plus natural selection.

866
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,900
And there's an overstatement that scientists are prone to

867
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:58,820
in this, that we have biology and we have a mechanism

868
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:03,980
by which you can see how random variation plus natural

869
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:09,820
selection could give you complicated organisms like us.

870
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,820
That's true.

871
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:14,900
What you often see scientists do is convert that into a very

872
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,940
different statement, which is we know that random mutations

873
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,300
plus natural selection gave rise to us.

874
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,380
In other words, they go from random mutations plus natural

875
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,060
selection would be enough to that's actually what happened.

876
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,580
We know that all the mutations that actually happened in

877
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:36,020
the history of the universe to produce us were random.

878
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,140
Those are two very distant statements.

879
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,340
And the second one is completely beyond what we know.

880
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,140
Of course, we don't know that all those mutations were

881
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:41,500
random.

882
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,700
We have no idea.

883
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,340
But you often find scientists saying that.

884
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:49,540
And then you get this big collision that people say, oh,

885
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,460
you're eliminating God, or you're eliminating something.

886
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:56,260
And I think as scientists, here physicists lecturing the

887
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,460
biologists, how dare I?

888
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,780
I think we should be careful what we say.

889
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,860
We say what we know.

890
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,420
And we don't say more than we know.

891
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,420
I think that's a good point.

892
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,700
I think it's very difficult sometimes.

893
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,300
I know that just the use of language as such that you

894
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,260
find yourself in a corner and you'll say something

895
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,780
after what you go.

896
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,500
No, I shouldn't have said that because I've opened myself

897
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,740
up to other things.

898
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:28,180
Yeah, it's often remarked that in physics, we had Newton,

899
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,220
and then we had Einstein.

900
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,660
At the state of play at the end of the 19th century, people

901
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,460
thought physics is basically done.

902
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,980
It's just mop up work.

903
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,820
And then we get this radical revolution in physical

904
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,780
understanding.

905
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:44,940
And as a result, physicists are perhaps more cautious

906
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,060
and tentative of their endorsement of even very

907
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,500
well-confirmed theories.

908
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,860
Biology's had its Newton in Darwin, but it hasn't yet

909
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:56,540
had its Einstein that potentially that could be out,

910
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,620
which isn't to say Darwin goes away, but it might say that

911
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,380
there's more to the picture here than simply this very

912
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,500
powerful explanatory mechanism that Darwin put forth.

913
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,060
I think that's true.

914
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:15,340
But this goes to the question of scientists inevitably

915
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,060
in formulating theories, they generalize from a limited

916
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:25,220
amount of data work with the theory and say, absent to some

917
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,980
reason to think otherwise, we think this perspective

918
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,820
generalizes.

919
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:34,540
So physicists confirm particle physics, basic dynamics of

920
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,420
how particles interact by treating relatively small

921
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,180
scale systems.

922
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,780
And I'm looking at you as a ocean, please correct me when I

923
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,980
say something that's just false.

924
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,940
But as I understand it, right?

925
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,860
And then we assume that, well, of course, the universe

926
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,380
involves, I don't know, 10 to the 90th power particles,

927
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:55,340
perhaps, but it's essentially just the same thing writ large,

928
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,460
just an unimaginably large number of interactions.

929
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,980
But the same principles that we observe in these systems

930
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,860
we've carefully isolated applies quite generally.

931
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,220
And that goes to the question of emergence, maybe at some

932
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,420
point of structural complexity out in the wild, outside of

933
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:17,020
our carefully constructed isolated systems, things

934
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,700
function a bit differently.

935
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,220
And then similarly, I take that to be the point Mark was

936
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:25,540
promoting with evolutionary explanations.

937
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,580
Yes, we do know this kind of mechanism is at play in the

938
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,020
biological realm.

939
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:35,180
But whether that's fully capturing what's going on is an

940
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,780
open question.

941
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:42,540
If you observe mutations that are always random, couldn't

942
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,100
you draw that conclusion?

943
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,980
Who's to say they're random?

944
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:51,380
Random means we don't have an explanation for why they did

945
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:54,220
this and not that.

946
00:49:54,220 --> 00:50:00,020
Well, OK, so an explanation might come along at some point.

947
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:04,820
All you can say is you can't explain why the mutations

948
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,180
did what they did.

949
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,220
So you are saying the concept of randomness is not valid at

950
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,460
all.

951
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,060
I'm saying it's a non-statement.

952
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,020
It's not a statement.

953
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:18,740
It's a statement that we don't know what happened there.

954
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,220
It's not a statement that we do know that nothing

955
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,940
interesting happened there.

956
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,780
So the fact that you can predict that there will be more

957
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:30,260
of those things happening in a fashion quote-unquote

958
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,860
random is not what you're saying.

959
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,820
Because this argument that we don't know, there's nothing

960
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:43,020
that we can state where we can say for sure that we know.

961
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,220
There's always we don't know in everything.

962
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,620
Well, the interesting thing about an evolution thing is

963
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,780
that you don't need to know.

964
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,060
Random, in other words, you don't need to imprint anything

965
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,420
on these variations.

966
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:57,460
If they were random, combine them with natural selection,

967
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,900
that would be good enough.

968
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,780
That doesn't need to be a purpose or pattern in them.

969
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:07,300
But that doesn't mean that there actually wasn't one in

970
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,460
the mutations that happened that led to us.

971
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,500
And of course, if you're a scientist, you say, why would

972
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,180
you bother postulating some crazy extra thing?

973
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,660
And yes, fine.

974
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:18,300
You don't have to.

975
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,300
That's the whole point.

976
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,700
But you're not forbidden to.

977
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:25,060
There isn't evidence to disprove it, right?

978
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,300
Just a point of clarification.

979
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,540
My understanding that the way evolutionary biologists use

980
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:34,300
the notion of randomness in terms of genetic mutations is

981
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,780
simply that there can be a very predictable, in fact,

982
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:43,140
quantifiable rate of variation for different types of genes.

983
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,860
Might be one in four million or whatever

984
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:48,380
to do a digital gene type.

985
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,380
So there's predictability there.

986
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:56,460
And the term randomness is used to say that the change is

987
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,420
they don't, there's no bias towards favorable change

988
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,780
towards the organism.

989
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,300
In that sense, it's random.

990
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,940
I think what we know from the data is that.

991
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:07,260
Yes.

992
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,620
What we know from the data is that the mutations, I mean,

993
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,740
their distribution of mutations, not all the mutations,

994
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:12,900
are created equal.

995
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,860
They happen in particular flavors.

996
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,740
And this is organism-dependent.

997
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,900
We know very well also.

998
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,980
We know a lot of things about what is the molecular understanding,

999
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,460
I mean, how these things happen.

1000
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,980
I mean, if there is the amination of a particular base,

1001
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,980
we know what is the chemistry that happens there.

1002
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,340
We know many of the enzymes that are down in there.

1003
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,700
And there is a huge research.

1004
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,700
I mean, in cancer, for example, one of the things

1005
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,300
that we are doing.

1006
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,500
We know that cancers are produced by random mutations.

1007
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,540
We have evolution happens all around us, in our bodies.

1008
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,420
And then we don't understand.

1009
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,260
We cannot predict exactly what is the mutation.

1010
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,340
But we understand very well what other mechanisms that

1011
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,100
happened.

1012
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,980
We understand some of the distributions.

1013
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,980
We understand many of the things that are there.

1014
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,940
And we have a lot of data.

1015
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,700
You understand by descending to the bio-physical level.

1016
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,700
Yes.

1017
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,620
It's not a part.

1018
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,580
We cannot predict what is going to be the base

1019
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,620
that is going to be mutated.

1020
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:04,100
But we can understand what are the mechanisms that are playing

1021
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:04,600
there.

1022
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,540
What do you think about the random?

1023
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,460
Randomness.

1024
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,340
I think randomness is critical.

1025
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:18,700
We wouldn't be sitting here if it went for randomness.

1026
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,380
It's interesting.

1027
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:24,500
In my field, one of the things that we come up against,

1028
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:29,020
I'm engaged with many people in the quest

1029
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,100
to understand whether or not there's life elsewhere

1030
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,580
in the universe.

1031
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,460
And I'm approaching it in a very practical way.

1032
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,940
We're looking for environments beyond the earth

1033
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,860
where life might exist, or life that we at least

1034
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,540
could recognize.

1035
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:46,540
And I think one of the interesting questions

1036
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:50,860
that we haven't really addressed yet is even if, let's

1037
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,700
suppose that the biochemistry that exists here on the earth

1038
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,620
and has existed for most of the last 4 billion years

1039
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,220
is indeed universal.

1040
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,820
And that actually, the evidence suggests

1041
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,620
that maybe correctly look out into the universe

1042
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:07,540
as astronomers.

1043
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:12,260
We find carbon-based molecules everywhere.

1044
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,900
It's the dominant type of chemistry in the universe.

1045
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,620
Carbon-based molecules are forming out in interstellar space

1046
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,500
over billions of years.

1047
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,260
70% of all the molecules you see floating between the stars

1048
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,740
are organic molecules.

1049
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,460
It's just the chemistry of the universe.

1050
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,340
That's the way it is.

1051
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,980
So at least very simplistically, you

1052
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:34,500
could perhaps connect the dot to say that there's not

1053
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:40,380
a coincidence that life here is based around carbon chemistry.

1054
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:46,580
But what are the possible outcomes?

1055
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:51,380
Let's suppose origin events for life, you mentioned this,

1056
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,460
we think that life got going pretty rapidly here

1057
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,940
on the earth following the final formation.

1058
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,540
The epoch of the planet.

1059
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,300
And statistically, it really doesn't tell you much

1060
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,060
because it's only one data point.

1061
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:07,420
So it's a little dangerous to say, oh, it started quickly here.

1062
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,820
And therefore, maybe it happens easily elsewhere.

1063
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,060
That's a very dangerous thing to say.

1064
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,420
But I'm coming to the point about random.

1065
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,780
That's one of the interesting things

1066
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,260
that I don't think any of us have really tackled yet

1067
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,420
because we don't know how to tackle it

1068
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,780
is even if the biochemistry is the same everywhere,

1069
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,820
wherever life occurs in the universe,

1070
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,380
assuming it does elsewhere, the biochemistry is

1071
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,100
basically the same.

1072
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,980
How different can the outcomes be?

1073
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,700
How random is this?

1074
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,500
I mean, OK, we're used to thinking of what life on earth,

1075
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,060
we have single-celled organisms, bacteria and archaea.

1076
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,980
That seems kind of fundamental.

1077
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,100
You have a cell structure.

1078
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,620
You have the DNA and the cell structure,

1079
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,980
et cetera, lots of things followed

1080
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,180
from that, and then at some point, complex cells like ours

1081
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,780
came along.

1082
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:03,900
Is it not clear to me at all that even things like bacteria

1083
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,700
are a necessary outcome of biochemistry?

1084
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,060
Maybe you could do it differently

1085
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,340
and have a completely different evolutionary history.

1086
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,980
And so in that sense, randomness, I think,

1087
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,220
comes in to this quest to look for life elsewhere in the universe

1088
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:21,100
because for all we know, we're staring at it,

1089
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,260
and it's the same biochemistry.

1090
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,660
It just turned out so radically differently

1091
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,660
that we're having a hard time spotting it.

1092
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,500
Now, I can qualify that statement.

1093
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:35,220
So in that sense, randomness plays a huge role

1094
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,620
in questions I'm interested in.

1095
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:40,100
It also plays, I mean, just to come to something

1096
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,780
not to do with life, just in planetary systems,

1097
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,860
what we've realized over really the, well,

1098
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,900
I guess we started seeing clues to this

1099
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,780
before we had discovered planets around other stars,

1100
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,860
which we have now done.

1101
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,020
In the last 20 years, we've discovered planets

1102
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,220
around other stars, and they are abundant.

1103
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:02,180
What we've also learned is that planetary systems turn out

1104
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,060
different every time.

1105
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,580
We have this sort of imprint in our heads

1106
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,620
that the solar system was the prototype,

1107
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,060
the template for how planetary systems should appear.

1108
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,460
You have the little rocky planets close to the star.

1109
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,940
You have your gas giant planets.

1110
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,220
You have other things out there,

1111
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,540
and it all sort of made sense.

1112
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,980
And we've had to sort of tear that up

1113
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,820
and throw that out the window, because it isn't true.

1114
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:30,820
Planetary systems are inherently non-linear,

1115
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:36,460
and the outcome of the formation processes of planets

1116
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,180
will spit out different stuff every single time,

1117
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,340
incredibly diverse.

1118
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,740
And that's something that is an enormous challenge for us.

1119
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,660
And essentially, it's randomness.

1120
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:51,820
The core is randomness, non-linearity, complexity.

1121
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:55,180
And I think, for me, one of the things that weighs on me

1122
00:57:55,180 --> 00:58:00,300
or that I have no good answer is we still think that way

1123
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,500
when we're looking for life elsewhere.

1124
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,900
We're still strongly imprinted with the notion, well, yes,

1125
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,620
we know the details will be different.

1126
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,900
Maybe it's a planet of chickens, or maybe it's

1127
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,980
it's a planet of octopus or something.

1128
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,180
But the truth is, we don't even know that.

1129
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,620
It could be extraordinary.

1130
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,060
Maybe.

1131
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:19,460
I don't know.

1132
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,420
Maybe you have.

1133
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,740
I would be interested if anyone has an opinion

1134
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:28,140
that somehow biochemistry and life

1135
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,820
is going to sort of converge on similar forms

1136
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:34,020
and similar mechanisms that we have here on Earth.

1137
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:38,580
Well, this matter is debated, yes, in theoretical biology.

1138
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,580
So Stephen J. Gould, a famous popular science writer,

1139
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:46,060
famously said, if you're rewound the tape of evolution

1140
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:49,940
and let it play out again, under slightly divergent

1141
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,020
initial circumstances, you'd get something completely different.

1142
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,580
And I think I think he was thinking it was so completely

1143
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,460
different.

1144
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:56,980
OK.

1145
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:59,980
But he tended to push this line.

1146
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:03,820
But then you have Simon Conway Morris, who's famously,

1147
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,060
I think he's off at Cambridge or Oxford, wanting to say,

1148
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,580
no, actually, we have a lot of evidence for convergence

1149
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:13,220
in evolution that certain types of solutions

1150
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:17,020
to certain kinds of problems for organism types, like the mammalian

1151
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:21,900
eye, I think, it's believed has evolved five times in the camera eye.

1152
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,740
The camera eye, the form of it.

1153
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:29,100
It's a neat solution to a certain kind of so-to-speak problem

1154
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,460
from an evolutionary point of view.

1155
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,380
Once you have organisms of a certain kind,

1156
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,060
that they're going to move in that.

1157
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,540
So there's a kind of landscape, a biased landscape,

1158
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,540
if you like, of biological organisms

1159
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,420
they're going to inevitably move in a certain direction.

1160
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:47,460
So I think one proof that randomness is important in biology

1161
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,020
is that you can prepare the experiment.

1162
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,460
In the same conditions, the other thing

1163
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:54,220
is that natural selection works in different conditions

1164
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,540
and then these things change.

1165
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,300
But if you prepare exactly the same conditions

1166
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:02,300
and you take copies of an organism that is identical

1167
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,380
and you put it in different plates,

1168
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,700
and then you move it forward, you can

1169
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,500
see that the mutations at the accumulate at the end,

1170
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,420
they are different.

1171
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,700
And then you give, I don't know, you give an experiment,

1172
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,740
you give some type of aiotic or something like that.

1173
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,220
Some of these survive, some of they don't.

1174
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,980
So starting from identical initial conditions

1175
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,460
and the outcome is different.

1176
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,140
So this is done in the lab.

1177
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:25,700
And then in that case, I think biology is random,

1178
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,740
I mean, in this sense.

1179
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,300
I mean, at least we cannot predict a priori

1180
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,380
given the initial conditions who is going to be

1181
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,460
resistant to the mitabiotic and who is not

1182
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:37,460
of this bacterium that they're identical from the beginning.

1183
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,260
So this is pushing back against the small global picture

1184
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,860
that someone like my Morris has in mind.

1185
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,780
As I understand it, so you're saying, look,

1186
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:48,900
we can, in a small scale trajectory of evolution,

1187
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,260
we can see it happening starting from slightly different

1188
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,740
initial conditions, things going in very different directions.

1189
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,460
What I'm doing is looking at evolution in real time.

1190
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:01,500
So we work with viruses, for example.

1191
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,580
I mean, viruses, they evolve every application,

1192
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,180
they have a mutation, cancers.

1193
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,500
This is evolution that's happening in real time.

1194
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,020
And there are processes that accumulate mutations

1195
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:11,940
and all these things.

1196
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,340
And one of the things that is very clear,

1197
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,900
I mean, especially in the last five years,

1198
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,980
that now we're sequencing tons of cancers,

1199
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:21,100
is that every patient that comes with the same type of cancer,

1200
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,540
let's say a glioblastoma, for example,

1201
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:23,980
they take different patients.

1202
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,260
The amount of mutations, I mean, the mutations that happen,

1203
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,580
they are different, each patient is a different constellation

1204
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:29,660
of mutations.

1205
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,180
So, and they start basically from similar conditions.

1206
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,820
We don't know exactly what are the conditions,

1207
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,660
but they have different paths.

1208
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,780
I mean, some of the key players, some of the genes,

1209
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,300
they are the same, but most of them, they don't.

1210
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,700
So, and then the game.

1211
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,220
What is the understanding, just randomness?

1212
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,620
So understanding that each individual has a different...

1213
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:54,060
The observation is that they are different.

1214
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:59,020
And then cellophorrhaging, and the idea

1215
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,300
is that there is a random process.

1216
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,740
There are several biological processes

1217
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,140
that can create mutations with different flavors.

1218
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:07,100
And then these mutations happen random.

1219
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,540
So probably if we take, we have like 10 to the 14 cells

1220
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:13,140
in our body, each of the cells, they have different mutations.

1221
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:14,980
Most of the mutations don't do anything.

1222
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,060
But some of the mutations, they contribute to the growth

1223
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,180
of the cell.

1224
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:20,620
And then when you accumulate the right or the wrong combination

1225
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:24,140
of mutations is when the whole clonal expansion happens.

1226
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,060
And then when we sequence the tumor at the end,

1227
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,140
what we have is a picture of what are the mutations

1228
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:32,500
that are accumulated in the history of this particular clone.

1229
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,740
And they are different.

1230
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,500
I mean, these in cancers we know that it's there.

1231
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,460
So in terms of complexity and the emergence idea,

1232
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:45,060
so if you look at cancers as the end product,

1233
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:50,660
as the complex outcome of what was happening,

1234
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:59,140
then the final outcome is determined by events

1235
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:03,700
that are all by mutations that are very different.

1236
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,660
But the outcome is the same.

1237
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,300
The outcome, I mean, one of the things

1238
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,900
I have to be cautious with that, I mean,

1239
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,780
one of the several mutations, they

1240
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:13,140
are exactly the same in different patients.

1241
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:16,180
And this is why, I mean, we are looking what is called,

1242
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:21,660
I mean, in cancer genomics jargon.

1243
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,780
This is this idea that if they are, for example,

1244
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:27,340
in glioblastoma, they are around 50 mutations

1245
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,700
in a particular patient, that they are protein changing

1246
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,660
from that.

1247
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,340
Most of them, they are passengers.

1248
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,140
So they are mutations that they don't do anything.

1249
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,100
They happen by random.

1250
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,980
I mean, they are in the background.

1251
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,140
So they don't contribute to the particular phenotype

1252
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,500
to this growth.

1253
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,300
And some of those, they are going to be drivers.

1254
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:48,100
So the whole regal of the field is

1255
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,420
trying to find of these 50, which are the ones that

1256
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,660
are really important for the tumor.

1257
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:56,620
The classical experiment or the classical method

1258
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:57,460
is recurrence.

1259
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,540
So if you see that, because you do the experiment,

1260
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,100
you have many different people, each of those

1261
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,380
with a different cancer.

1262
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,060
And you see that there is a mutation in a gene,

1263
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:04,940
let's say, P53.

1264
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:08,620
And another patient, they have mutation in the same gene.

1265
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:11,140
The probability that this is happened by random

1266
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,540
into the independent individuals is very low.

1267
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,460
And then you assess that this particular gene

1268
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,780
could be important for cancer.

1269
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,620
And then there are a lot of experimental follow-up,

1270
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,660
trying to understand what are the molecular mechanisms

1271
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,420
of how this particular alteration in that particular gene

1272
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,900
could contribute to the cancer.

1273
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:32,380
So that's a very standard method.

1274
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:36,500
So could I ask perhaps the appearance of the driver,

1275
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:41,820
type mutations thought that these two are just random.

1276
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,720
And they just, once they're, they

1277
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,460
tend to determine a phenotypic process,

1278
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,140
a process observable of that.

1279
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:53,620
So this is something about they keep showing up.

1280
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:56,220
So without going into the debate of all of our state.

1281
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:57,700
Is there something down random about that

1282
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,380
in biological terms?

1283
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,660
I mean, it depends on how you define random.

1284
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,620
So there are several, for example.

1285
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:05,140
I mean, if you go to the sun, then you

1286
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,260
get some radiation.

1287
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:09,980
And radiation, we know what is causing damage in some DNA.

1288
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,540
And there are several chemical processes,

1289
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:12,580
or smoking, or something.

1290
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,500
I mean, these are things that are kind of processes

1291
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,780
that in this background, they increment

1292
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,820
the rate of certain type of mutations.

1293
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:23,580
And these things contribute to those environmental factors.

1294
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:25,580
By us.

1295
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:26,580
By mutation.

1296
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:27,580
So you have a distribution.

1297
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,500
So you have the model that we work.

1298
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,220
Is that we have a probability of changing their four bases.

1299
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,540
And then, so you have, each of the four bases

1300
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:35,980
can change to the other three.

1301
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:39,060
So you can have a matrix of different possibilities.

1302
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,100
So there's a distribution.

1303
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:43,020
And this distribution is conditional on the environment

1304
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,180
that you have, and the molecular mechanisms that

1305
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:45,860
are beyond that.

1306
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:48,420
So you can see, for example, just counting the mutations that

1307
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:48,920
happened.

1308
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,740
There are some of those that happened more frequently

1309
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:51,860
than other ones.

1310
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,460
And then, one of the things that is very interesting

1311
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,820
is understanding, for example, if there

1312
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,580
are patients that they have different mutation

1313
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,980
patterns that other patients that can give you a clue

1314
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,540
of what are the molecular mechanisms that

1315
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:05,740
are acting at that particular set of patients.

1316
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:09,460
So there are many questions there.

1317
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,820
But the questions are very precise.

1318
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,500
I mean, in the sense that you can measure things,

1319
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,820
and then you have tons of data, and then you

1320
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:16,460
can fit distributions.

1321
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:20,580
And random means sampling from a particular distribution.

1322
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:23,580
So it's not a fit uniform.

1323
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,340
As a cosmologist listening to you,

1324
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:29,300
I feel sort of jealous that you have so many systems

1325
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,140
that you can study.

1326
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:33,060
Because in cosmology, we have our one universe.

1327
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,340
And I was thinking about this dependence

1328
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,060
on initial conditions.

1329
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,940
And this is such an essential point

1330
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:41,180
when we think about the emergence of complexity

1331
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:45,620
in the universe, which is that if the values of the fundamental

1332
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,300
constants were slightly different,

1333
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,540
we would have a very different universe.

1334
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,220
And of course, the wonderful thing

1335
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,500
about doing this kind of research today

1336
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:57,380
is that we can study sort of imaginary universes

1337
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,780
via computational analyses.

1338
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,820
And we can see that if we were to change

1339
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:06,460
the charge of the electron by a small fraction,

1340
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,620
the universe would look completely different.

1341
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,660
But how wonderful it would be to have all of these little

1342
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,500
universes and a multiverse to study and see, well,

1343
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:17,500
what fundamentally do we need to get this kind of emergent

1344
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,740
phenomena in our universe is the way that you can study

1345
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,580
the initial conditions in the DNA and the environment

1346
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:27,700
that create this kind of the beginning of a cancer

1347
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,540
tumor, for example.

1348
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,420
Yeah, I think one of the things that is interesting

1349
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,220
in biological systems, especially the ones that are

1350
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,660
evolving very fast.

1351
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,260
I mean, if you talk about human evolution,

1352
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,340
or it's much harder, but something

1353
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:41,740
that you can do in the lab is you can create a system,

1354
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,140
change conditions, and then try to see

1355
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,060
how the distributions, I mean, randomness

1356
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,100
can be quantified in a particular system.

1357
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,540
I mean, there's some distributions.

1358
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,260
And how these distributions shift when

1359
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,180
you change the parameters here.

1360
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:55,380
And that's something that is very cool.

1361
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:58,380
So I can see what you shifted from physics to biology.

1362
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:01,100
But in the early universe, you have lots of spectrums

1363
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,740
of fluctuation.

1364
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:03,240
Right.

1365
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,380
It's just that they all seem to give rise

1366
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,180
to similar looking galaxies.

1367
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:09,020
Is that a fair statement?

1368
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,060
The primordial fluctuations.

1369
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:11,460
Yeah.

1370
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,740
The post-inflation.

1371
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:13,740
Sure.

1372
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,180
That they're different as different as different mutations.

1373
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,620
And yet.

1374
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,740
I don't know if I would say that those fluctuations

1375
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:24,860
are as different as the sorts of things

1376
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,940
that we talk about in biology.

1377
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:29,780
I think what we're talking about in the early universe

1378
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:33,500
are fluctuating the original quantum field.

1379
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,460
These conditions then just give rise

1380
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:37,900
to these slight density perturbations.

1381
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:39,540
And then those density perturbations

1382
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:42,820
evolve with the expanding cooling universe

1383
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:46,020
to produce gravitational wells that

1384
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,500
tend to then produce galaxies.

1385
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:53,180
So I don't know if they're as different statistically

1386
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,060
as that system.

1387
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,380
But I don't know.

1388
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,060
It could be convinced otherwise.

1389
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:01,500
Well, so he's got four rungs in his ladder.

1390
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,460
And he can put them in different orders.

1391
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,420
And you've got this random field that

1392
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:07,620
can have a different value at each point in space

1393
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:09,900
across light years.

1394
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,020
It seems so bad.

1395
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:15,980
It's just interesting that you get very similar looking

1396
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,580
galaxies coming out of it.

1397
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,860
Is that right, though?

1398
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:21,060
All galaxies kind of brothers?

1399
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:25,740
I mean, galaxies are quite similar in a sense.

1400
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:28,820
I mean, they're different or slightly different

1401
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:29,980
evolutionary histories.

1402
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:34,020
But they are similar, certainly, in their properties.

1403
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:36,460
I'm just thinking back to these primordial density

1404
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:42,100
fluctuations, because what we find, of course, is that the early

1405
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:46,180
universe is incredibly homogeneous and isotropic.

1406
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:48,340
I mean, it's an incredibly homogeneous system.

1407
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:50,340
And then we have these.

1408
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:52,980
If we look at it from the point of view of temperature,

1409
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:57,180
temperature fluctuations on the order of one part in 100,000,

1410
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,580
those are the level of the fluctuations.

1411
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,060
And those little fluctuations are enough

1412
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:06,300
to give rise to this very interesting looking

1413
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,340
and beautiful looking universe.

1414
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:11,260
So I don't know if we can compare those with the base pairs,

1415
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:13,980
those tiny little temperature fluctuations.

1416
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:19,380
But on the very large scale, the universe continues

1417
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:22,620
to look homogeneous and isotropic on the scale

1418
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,860
sort of beyond galaxies.

1419
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:28,020
Superclusters, I suppose.

1420
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:33,860
So it continues just not sure if it's so different

1421
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:36,500
on the small scale.

1422
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:39,660
So could we affect the evolution of the universe?

1423
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:42,380
I mean, that would be the ultimate closure, right,

1424
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,540
where you have complicated things get rise to life.

1425
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,740
And then life goes back and changes the whole.

1426
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,540
So in practice, you mean not only?

1427
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,820
Well, let's dream.

1428
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,540
But the evolution of the whole universe

1429
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,300
or some part of it.

1430
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:55,780
Sure.

1431
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:59,180
Could we create a baby universe?

1432
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,980
I think we're going to have to start

1433
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:05,340
to define universe carefully if we're going to ask that question.

1434
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:07,820
Choose whatever definition makes it interesting.

1435
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,660
But there is something that I mean,

1436
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:13,940
in further down the timeline from the sort of cosmology

1437
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:17,300
that you focus on, sort of cosmology I used to do

1438
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:21,460
before I got into the planets was, yeah, there's this.

1439
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:25,420
There's a certain volume of the present day universe

1440
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:30,740
that you tend to say, well, that's kind of a fair sample.

1441
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:32,540
And I've forgotten the typical side.

1442
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:37,220
Maybe it's 20 million light years across or something.

1443
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,460
It'll contain enough galaxies that you

1444
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:44,020
have a cross-section of everything.

1445
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:47,060
And that's like your Petri dish, right?

1446
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,660
I'm saying, OK, I've got that experiment.

1447
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:50,300
And I've got another experiment over there

1448
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:53,940
that is essentially, there can be other than radiation

1449
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:55,500
passing between these two places.

1450
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,620
There's no other causal relationships.

1451
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,940
It's like having multiple experiments.

1452
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,820
But it's for things like galaxies.

1453
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:04,020
I think when you're talking about taking,

1454
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,900
yes, the properties of the early universe,

1455
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:10,020
I mean, you only have that one experiment, right?

1456
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,380
It's infinitely large.

1457
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:12,460
But you don't see all of it.

1458
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:15,740
Well, we only see to the edge from which light

1459
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:16,860
is at time to reach it.

1460
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,060
Yeah, we see what is it?

1461
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,660
10 billion, 100 billion galaxies.

1462
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:20,620
How many do we see?

1463
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,260
No, about 300 billion.

1464
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:25,060
No, people say sorry.

1465
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:27,860
It's sort of fascinating to me that they're all sort of looking

1466
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:31,620
like the uniformity is sort of weird.

1467
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:33,420
But the uniformity on that large scale

1468
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:37,060
reflects the uniformity of the early universe.

1469
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:42,620
So it's because we had this very uniform universe

1470
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:45,500
in the early days that the universe looks so uniform

1471
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,780
on the large scale today.

1472
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,220
But then, of course, from the perspective

1473
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:51,340
of the topic of this conversation,

1474
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:54,580
once you look at a smaller scale, so smaller than 100 megapar

1475
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:56,620
sex or whatever it is that we're looking at,

1476
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:59,420
that we get these much more interesting, complex

1477
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:00,260
sorts of structures.

1478
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:02,340
I'll go back to another experiment that happens also.

1479
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:04,620
There is the actual planets, for example.

1480
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:07,380
There you have different clouds forming stars,

1481
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:08,380
and then you have planets.

1482
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,500
And then, I mean, now we start looking at distribution.

1483
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,380
So each of those is a different experiment.

1484
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:14,300
And they are now, I don't know how many, they are like,

1485
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,740
5,000 or something like that?

1486
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:17,420
A little over 4,000.

1487
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:19,500
So then you have 4,000 experiments

1488
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,660
of similar things creating planets.

1489
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:22,820
And then you have distribution.

1490
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:23,980
I mean, you can do statistics.

1491
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,740
I mean, distribution of planets, what

1492
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:28,580
is the largest, the distances, and the alticities,

1493
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:29,300
and all these things.

1494
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:30,900
I mean, you can do a lot of things there.

1495
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,420
So I think in this aspect, I mean,

1496
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:34,940
it's becoming a very different experiment.

1497
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:38,420
I mean, you cannot produce them, but you cannot observe them.

1498
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,220
No, absolutely.

1499
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,140
I mean, it's funny when I started out

1500
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:42,740
as an astronomer, some people said,

1501
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:45,300
we are such an impoverished science.

1502
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,620
You can only look at stuff.

1503
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:49,100
You can never do the experiments.

1504
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,460
But it's extraordinary what you can do by just looking

1505
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,220
and observing.

1506
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:56,180
And the universe, OK, maybe the one universe,

1507
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:58,460
that's one experiment, but then the subdivisions

1508
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:00,580
of the universe are multiple experiments

1509
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:04,300
on the different phenomena that emerge in our universe.

1510
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:07,100
And it's extraordinary what happens.

1511
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:11,260
Actually, this may piss you off because it's sort of one

1512
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:14,620
of these top-down type things.

1513
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:19,900
But something we've learned to do with galaxies, for example,

1514
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:24,180
that I think nobody predicted and really

1515
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:26,580
comes from quite fundamental physics is the fact

1516
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:29,860
that the form and nature of galaxies.

1517
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:32,580
So galaxies are a great agglomeration of stars.

1518
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:36,660
The Milky Way has maybe 200 billion stars in it also.

1519
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:39,340
And there are all these other billions of galaxies,

1520
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,580
and they're all sort of morphologically different.

1521
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,860
And there are different histories.

1522
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:46,620
And when and where exactly the stars were made in those galaxies.

1523
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,420
Some of that we now understand is

1524
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:54,220
driven by the behavior of supermassive black holes

1525
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:57,020
that form perhaps contemporaneously

1526
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:00,140
with these galaxies way back 13 billion years ago.

1527
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:01,740
And they're huge things.

1528
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,900
Some of them are a billion times a million.

1529
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,540
And as matter falls into them, it generates energy

1530
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:09,300
that pours back out across the galaxy

1531
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:13,300
and influences subsequent generations of stars.

1532
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:18,380
And so it profoundly impacts the characteristics of the stars,

1533
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,420
the planets, everything.

1534
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:22,220
But who would have thought?

1535
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:23,660
This is coming from black holes.

1536
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:26,660
And it's the particular properties of black holes

1537
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:29,940
that give rise to that kind of interesting feedback.

1538
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:31,700
I mean, I find that kind of extraordinary.

1539
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:34,380
Because presumably you could have universes where

1540
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,820
you can't make black holes.

1541
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:39,100
Is that possible?

1542
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,420
I guess anything is possible.

1543
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,820
I think anything is possible depending on your physical law.

1544
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,500
If we have a law of gravitation the way

1545
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:48,420
that we have in this universe, then we could get black holes.

1546
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:51,180
But to go off your comment about black holes,

1547
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,460
even more fundamentally than that, the fact

1548
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:56,500
that actually the evolution of the universe

1549
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,900
seems to be affected so profoundly

1550
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:02,300
by the presence of dark matter and dark energy, which

1551
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,940
are these really mysterious substances

1552
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:07,060
that we've only learned about in the last, I mean,

1553
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:10,020
less than 100 years, even for dark matter.

1554
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:14,180
And yeah, so it seems like such a,

1555
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:17,180
and we know, of course, that dark matter gravitationally

1556
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:20,460
influences the formation histories of galaxies

1557
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:24,140
and dark energy really on the larger scale

1558
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:27,380
of the universe affecting whether or not a galaxy cluster

1559
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:29,820
can actually come together without being sort of pushed

1560
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:32,460
apart by the expansion of space.

1561
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:39,180
So there's so many factors, so much physics going into

1562
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:42,780
this seemingly simple process of galaxy formation even.

1563
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:48,660
Of course, the stuff we're made of is just 4% of everything.

1564
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:52,500
Start matter, dark energy, the total mass energy content

1565
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,980
of the universe, most of it isn't like us.

1566
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,860
That's right.

1567
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:02,100
With this tiny little sprinkling of normal matter

1568
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:05,980
and the periodic matter that's doing all this interesting stuff.

1569
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:06,900
But it's interesting.

1570
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,900
I mean, I don't know if you'd agree with this,

1571
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:12,620
but perhaps we're too ignorant of what dark matter really is

1572
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:15,980
and what it's actually, we can't see it directly.

1573
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:18,380
We can only see it through its gravitational influence.

1574
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,180
But the interesting thing is it's

1575
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:23,180
that tiny sprinkling, that 4%, that

1576
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,340
seems to have all this complexity.

1577
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:28,860
And I guess that's just the nature of it.

1578
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:29,980
That's just how it is.

1579
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:33,980
Well, it's possible, of course, that it's quite interesting

1580
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:37,500
these days because we know that dark matter is out there

1581
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:41,420
based on its gravitational influence on the visible matter.

1582
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:45,180
And we've never been able to detect it in either a space,

1583
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:47,900
space, or earth-based observatory.

1584
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:52,300
So when we create theories of what dark matter could be,

1585
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:56,100
we inevitably begin with the simplest possible situation.

1586
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:59,260
So my PhD thesis, for example, I postulated

1587
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:02,180
a Maverick dark matter where there was only one,

1588
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,580
all of the dark matter.

1589
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:06,460
So 95% of the matter in the universe,

1590
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:12,180
or that's not right, 80% of the matter and 20%

1591
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:15,020
of the matter and energy content was composed

1592
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,500
of one single particle.

1593
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,420
But of course, that's just a hypothesis.

1594
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,820
Given the complexity of the.

1595
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,300
You have one type of particle.

1596
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:26,780
One type of particle, yeah, not one particle.

1597
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:28,220
That would be quite strange.

1598
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,980
I think it would be a thesis.

1599
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:33,420
It would be quite strange.

1600
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:39,260
And given the complexity of the visible segment

1601
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:42,060
of our universe, I think it would,

1602
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:47,380
it's naive to assume that the dark section of the universe

1603
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:49,020
is simpler than that.

1604
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,420
So yes, we just don't know.

1605
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:55,460
It could be composed of a very complex spectrum of particles

1606
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,900
and interactions that we just can't probe.

1607
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,140
So that's a whole other level of complexity

1608
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:02,380
that may never be accessible to us.

1609
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:05,700
And we hope, of course, that it is in our present day

1610
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,580
experiments, especially at the LHC.

1611
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:15,780
I introduce consciousness as one place where science and philosophy

1612
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:18,380
sort of butt up against the chamber.

1613
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:23,340
Yes, well, and but now sort of your bailiwick

1614
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:27,180
is seems like contemporary cosmology is another.

1615
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:33,100
So you mentioned the way the universe seems to be,

1616
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:36,900
the fact that we can do computer simulations of assuming

1617
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:39,780
slight variations in the initial conditions

1618
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,740
or slight variations in the properties of fundamental

1619
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:45,860
particles, and then see how would things play out

1620
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:49,020
at a kind of macroscopic level.

1621
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:54,620
And apparently physicists say that an vanishingly small

1622
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:58,020
percentage of these possible variations

1623
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:00,700
is anything suitable for the development of life,

1624
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,220
so-called fine-tuning.

1625
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:04,820
So our universe seems exquisitely fine-tuned

1626
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:08,420
for the eventual emergence of life.

1627
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:12,300
What sort of you as a theorist, as a physical theorist,

1628
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:17,100
to what extent do you feel driven to look for explanations?

1629
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:20,300
So we get theoretical cosmologists speculating

1630
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:21,620
about multiverse.

1631
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:26,900
Maybe our universe just has what it has what it takes

1632
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,580
for there to be life.

1633
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,540
The reason that we see such a thing,

1634
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:32,140
this is such an extraordinary thing,

1635
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:36,780
is that there have been untold billions of such universes

1636
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:41,980
emerging or being given rise to by some premordial condition,

1637
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:44,780
most of which, almost all of which, have no life.

1638
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:46,980
And of course, we happen to notice it

1639
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:49,420
because we can only notice the universe that

1640
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:52,100
is capable of sustaining life.

1641
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:57,220
So to kind of try to explain away the surprising and seemingly

1642
01:20:57,220 --> 01:21:00,940
rigged character of the universe by postulating our universe

1643
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:04,580
as one of just a huge number of universes.

1644
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:07,300
Are you inclined towards that sort of thinking?

1645
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:13,300
And what's the state of play these days among physicists?

1646
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:16,940
From a historical point of view, you

1647
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:22,700
kind of want to take a Copernican principle to the extreme

1648
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,980
or something that first we discovered

1649
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:29,300
that the Earth was not the center of the solar system.

1650
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:32,420
And then the solar system was not the only system.

1651
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,900
And then our galaxy was not very special.

1652
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:38,060
And our galaxy cluster is not very special.

1653
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:40,420
If we take that to the extreme, then certainly

1654
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:43,460
it would seem like a reasonable proposition

1655
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:49,540
that our universe is not the only universe.

1656
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:52,580
From an experimental point of view,

1657
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:56,060
it's complicated because if there are other universes,

1658
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:59,380
and again, coming back to the precise definition

1659
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:04,340
of a universe, if a universe is everything

1660
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:08,700
that we can possibly probe, then another universe,

1661
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,420
by definition, cannot be studied.

1662
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:16,060
So from a scientific point of view that becomes complicated,

1663
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:19,860
that hasn't prevented everybody from not.

1664
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:22,140
Investigateing it, I think it's a very reasonable thing

1665
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:26,500
to study is are there theoretical physics models that

1666
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:32,300
would give rise to multiple universes?

1667
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,660
And people are doing it.

1668
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:35,980
And it's particularly interesting, of course,

1669
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,940
in the realm of string theory.

1670
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:41,580
Me personally, it just seems so, it's a little bit like even

1671
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,820
string theory within our universe,

1672
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:46,220
that if it's, and maybe you can speak to this,

1673
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:50,900
having been in that realm, if it's

1674
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:54,020
inaccessible experimentally, even within our universe,

1675
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:59,420
then for sure people should continue to study it.

1676
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:03,060
But is it science?

1677
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:06,980
If it's not a falsifiable theory, so maybe

1678
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,860
it will become such a thing.

1679
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:10,180
But it's not there yet.

1680
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,340
And with a multiverse, it gets even more complicated,

1681
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:14,860
because we go outside of this universe.

1682
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:15,460
So I don't know.

1683
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:18,700
Somebody who's been in string theory, maybe Roel can.

1684
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:19,020
Yeah.

1685
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:22,940
So when I was in the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,

1686
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:23,420
I was working.

1687
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:26,820
And there is a very strong group in string theory.

1688
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:28,700
And then there was also the debate,

1689
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:30,620
when there was all these landscapes, ideas, and all

1690
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:31,540
these things.

1691
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,380
And I have friends in the two fields.

1692
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:36,460
So I have my personal opinion that I'm

1693
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:39,740
not going to reveal.

1694
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:41,420
But I think it's a very interesting debate.

1695
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,940
So I think that debates would be there.

1696
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:46,860
Can I reveal my personal opinion?

1697
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,580
Since you're being coy.

1698
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:52,340
I think this multiverse explanation is extremely dangerous.

1699
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:54,700
I think it's a cop out.

1700
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:57,300
So there have been things in the past that were mysterious.

1701
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,900
Like at one point, all the electrons in the universe

1702
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,740
have the same mass and the same charge.

1703
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:04,380
My god, what an amazing coincidence.

1704
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:05,860
Who rigged that?

1705
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:07,900
Maybe there's a billion universes.

1706
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,460
We just happen to be in the one where they all

1707
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,380
happen to come out the same.

1708
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,380
Well, if you think that, that stops you

1709
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,940
from discovering what we now think

1710
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:16,540
is the real explanation, which is that there

1711
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:19,020
is one electron field everywhere.

1712
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,780
And these different particles are just

1713
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:24,620
sort of excitations of that one field.

1714
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:27,260
So a coincidence like that is a call

1715
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:29,660
to do good science to explain it.

1716
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:32,100
And things like, oh, well, maybe it just randomly came out

1717
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:35,900
because I postulated a billion, sorry, 10 to the 500,

1718
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,860
unobservable things.

1719
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:41,060
And we happen to be in the one which is the way that we see.

1720
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:46,140
It just seems to me, you might as well say, I think Zeus did it.

1721
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,140
Yeah.

1722
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,500
No, he's just.

1723
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,260
Yeah.

1724
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:52,540
I mean, this is exactly where the debate was at this time.

1725
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:55,340
And one of my closest friends, this person

1726
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:58,140
that is working in these things.

1727
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:01,660
But I think the difference is that, I mean,

1728
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:03,140
it's not a crazy speculation.

1729
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,420
I think there's an underlying theory,

1730
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:06,420
like a string theory, more than a theory.

1731
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:08,140
It's a framework of thinking.

1732
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:09,940
And then there you can do calculations.

1733
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:10,900
You can do distributions.

1734
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,260
You can do things that are more quantitative.

1735
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:16,060
If you could get evidence for this,

1736
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:19,620
and you weren't just postulating all those multiple copies,

1737
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:25,820
simply in order to get out of our copy, that's a problem.

1738
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,260
But if in our universe you can find,

1739
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,460
you were saying it's very difficult to observe, right?

1740
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,580
If, nonetheless, you can find some sort of evidence

1741
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,260
that all these other things exist,

1742
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:36,500
independent of needing them to explain this.

1743
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,740
That's fine, of course.

1744
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:40,460
And maybe I can just add one.

1745
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,380
This is a slightly more mundane point.

1746
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:45,820
But you talk about the apparent fine-tuning

1747
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:47,060
of the universe for life.

1748
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:50,700
And I think often that gets a little blurry,

1749
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:53,620
because the truth is the details of it

1750
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:58,180
are that you could actually tweak the fundamental properties

1751
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,460
of the cosmos.

1752
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:01,980
Fair amount, and in principle, still

1753
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:06,860
have the sequence of events that led to life here on Earth.

1754
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:10,380
So for example, you can tweak properties a little bit

1755
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:14,900
and still get stars that produce carbon in some quantity.

1756
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:19,180
So it's just something about this notion.

1757
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:22,340
Oh, it's perfectly tuned for life.

1758
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,580
It's not actually true.

1759
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:26,740
I mean, it is tuned in such a, oh,

1760
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,740
there is a coincidence of fundamental properties

1761
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:34,020
such that in at least one place it was possible for life

1762
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:37,900
to emerge, that is different than saying

1763
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,660
universe is somehow perfectly, perfectly tuned.

1764
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:44,500
You can go and you can play with cross-section of interaction

1765
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,580
for nuclear processes in stars.

1766
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,940
Fair amount, and still make carbon and still have stars

1767
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:53,860
that basically look like the stars that we see in our universe.

1768
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:57,180
So in a sense, for me, the more interesting question

1769
01:26:57,180 --> 01:27:00,260
and this I'm totally biased is what

1770
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:02,860
is it that determines the total amount of life

1771
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:05,700
in the universe, not just the fact

1772
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:08,100
that there is one instance of life.

1773
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:11,060
There must be something, at least within our observable universe,

1774
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:15,740
which is a finite thing, that determines how often and how

1775
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:20,420
much life, how many living organisms or things

1776
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:22,220
are there in the entire observable universe.

1777
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:26,700
That's a fixed number, any given cosmic time.

1778
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,140
That, to me, is the boy.

1779
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:30,580
Anyway, sorry, that's going off on a slight tangent.

1780
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:33,180
I mean, just as I understand it, we're

1781
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:37,540
talking about different sorts of independent factors that

1782
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:41,340
are relatively fundamental, at least in the current physical

1783
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,100
framework.

1784
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:45,100
And some of them have more play, right?

1785
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,380
You could still get life with some.

1786
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,540
And then others are exquisitely fine tuned.

1787
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:50,900
So there's variation.

1788
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,860
And the estimates vary.

1789
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:54,300
There's a little bit of controversy

1790
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:57,620
about how independent some of these are of others.

1791
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:01,220
So two to three dozen, perhaps as many of independent fine

1792
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,060
tuned factors.

1793
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:05,060
And some of them, I'm told, are exquisitely fine tuned.

1794
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:08,220
You really can't play with it very much at all.

1795
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:09,500
A number of like the engines.

1796
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,300
Yeah.

1797
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,300
Yeah, that's one.

1798
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:11,800
Right.

1799
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,100
Is there the cosmological concept?

1800
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:13,940
Are you having a company too?

1801
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:14,940
Yeah, it does watch.

1802
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:17,300
And the concept is another fine tuning problem.

1803
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:20,940
But the whole fine tuning thing is absurd.

1804
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:23,140
Who is to say, the knobs, we think

1805
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:24,660
that the labeling we have on the knobs

1806
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,540
when we write the physics textbook is somehow

1807
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:29,740
the label that God uses to decide, well, what mass

1808
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:32,900
electron I get given, what cosmological.

1809
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:36,020
The whole point of science is to understand things

1810
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,060
and explain things.

1811
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:39,180
And so firstly, if you think there's a miracle,

1812
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,260
you should be coming up with a real explanation for it.

1813
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:45,860
And secondly, maybe the laws of physics

1814
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:47,380
just are what they are.

1815
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:49,300
And that's a great achievement, right?

1816
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:50,820
To be able to explain all sorts of things

1817
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:55,620
from snowflakes to whatever on the basis

1818
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:58,420
of a fairly simple set of laws with 19 arbitrary constants.

1819
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:01,020
Well, I think good.

1820
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,580
Well, it may not be a question.

1821
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:05,820
If that turns out to be the state of the fundamental theory,

1822
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:07,580
right, we can't simplify.

1823
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,420
Actually, that gets to an interesting question

1824
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,940
that we ought to talk about.

1825
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:12,460
Maybe there is no fundamental theory.

1826
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,100
Maybe it's always emerging from something,

1827
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:16,620
your elephants all the way down, right?

1828
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:17,620
Turtle.

1829
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:17,620
Turtle.

1830
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:18,620
Turtle.

1831
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:21,340
Different religion.

1832
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:22,340
So that's all the way down.

1833
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:23,540
It's about passing all the way down.

1834
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:24,540
So call it.

1835
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:27,540
If the properties of my body, the causal capacities

1836
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:30,860
I have biologically are derived, in some sense,

1837
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:33,900
from the interaction of my cells and their arrangement

1838
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:38,740
and so forth, they're not fundamental physical force

1839
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,620
properties that I have.

1840
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:42,740
But if it's derived, can you can causality

1841
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:47,460
be forever passed on and nothing ever has it intrinsically?

1842
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:51,660
Has any kind of inherent capacity to do things?

1843
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:53,380
Can you forever borrow?

1844
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:56,580
It sounds like it's analogous to borrowing money.

1845
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:58,100
Somebody's got to have money originally,

1846
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:01,980
because it can't be infinitely borrowed.

1847
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:02,500
Yeah.

1848
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,500
One of the things that is, I think,

1849
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,900
what is different in physics is that.

1850
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,620
So now I don't have the microphone.

1851
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:11,100
So one of the things, I think, in fundamental physics

1852
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,820
that is different is that what the 20th century has been

1853
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:16,820
is basically unifying, finding frameworks.

1854
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:20,060
I mean, you have a way of computing things.

1855
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:21,900
I mean, you have field theories.

1856
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,900
You have ways of understanding of how to do calculations.

1857
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,300
You have a few fundamental blocks.

1858
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,060
And the fundamental blocks, they have been reduced

1859
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:30,700
to something that is a very small number.

1860
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:31,820
I mean, it's good.

1861
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:34,340
And the number of constants, I mean,

1862
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:36,220
I can say they are 20 something or something.

1863
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:38,780
It's kind of not very large.

1864
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:39,900
But it has been this trend.

1865
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:42,420
And I think this dream of many physicists, especially,

1866
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:45,780
I mean, from the 50s to the 70s, and these things,

1867
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,580
it was this idea that you can, every,

1868
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:50,660
this tendency would be to finding a unifying theory,

1869
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:54,260
that it would be the only one that can explain everything.

1870
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:55,060
I mean, it can be that.

1871
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:57,060
I mean, there is another fundamental theory

1872
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,820
that instead of in four forces, I mean, you have like 25.

1873
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:03,340
And then you go back to something that is more complex.

1874
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:05,020
So, but this has been this tendency.

1875
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:07,460
And I think this has been the dream of finding something

1876
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:08,820
that is unifying.

1877
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,340
And it was an expectation.

1878
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,620
And I don't know, I mean, how is it going?

1879
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:18,140
And an interesting thing that happens there in our quest

1880
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:24,260
for, shall we say, one of these interesting properties

1881
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:28,580
of the universe is that physics manifests very differently

1882
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:30,620
at different energy scales.

1883
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:35,420
So as we've been seeking unifying laws,

1884
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:36,940
physics has also changed.

1885
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:39,580
So we started in this classical universe

1886
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:42,580
and entered the realm of special relativity

1887
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:43,620
and quantum field theory.

1888
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:46,500
And then we look at what happens with the four

1889
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,660
fundamental interactions as we increase in energy.

1890
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,220
And they begin to unify.

1891
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:54,580
And they become different, more unified interactions.

1892
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:57,300
But it's so interesting that the physics changes fundamentally

1893
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:58,700
with energy scale.

1894
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:01,580
So that, I think, also is related to this notion

1895
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:03,340
of complexity and emergence.

1896
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:06,140
But actually something, I don't know

1897
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,580
if I can use the word unexpected,

1898
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:10,220
but something new happens at certain energies.

1899
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:13,220
Actually, different physics emerges.

1900
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:16,500
Yeah, so I wanted to go back to the notion of randomness,

1901
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,860
because I think we can be a little bit more

1902
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:20,900
quantitative in these things.

1903
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,260
I think, for example, in the experiment

1904
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:24,940
that was describing of the cancers of the bacteria

1905
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:27,420
in getting antibiotic resistance or something,

1906
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:30,100
I mean, you prepare identically the same thing.

1907
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:32,020
And at the end, you cannot predict

1908
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:35,260
which of these 20 experiments that you, identically prepare,

1909
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:36,460
is going to be the one that is going

1910
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:39,300
to give antibiotic resistance in this particular thing

1911
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:41,260
or the person who is going to get the cancer or the cell

1912
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:42,820
that is going to get the cancer.

1913
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:44,820
But you can get things about distributions.

1914
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:48,020
And then on understanding what are the basic mechanisms

1915
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:49,660
that happen there, that's very useful.

1916
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:54,780
I mean, you can get what are the mutational factors

1917
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:57,060
that contribute to that.

1918
01:32:57,060 --> 01:32:59,180
What are the mutations happened?

1919
01:32:59,180 --> 01:32:59,940
What are the genes?

1920
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:02,060
How are these mutations in these genes

1921
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:03,780
confer resistance to the antibiotic?

1922
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:05,300
So you learn many things about what

1923
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,300
is the underlying thing that happens.

1924
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,900
And they are distributions, and you learn things

1925
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:10,700
about distributions.

1926
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:14,460
That is very useful because you learn many, many different things.

1927
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:16,300
In the planets, for example, in the exoplanets,

1928
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:18,780
now that we are observing many, is basically

1929
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:19,940
similar thing of the galaxies.

1930
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:21,780
I mean, you start with similar conditions,

1931
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:23,180
and then you can try to see starting

1932
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,300
from the similar condition.

1933
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,980
You have the same experiment.

1934
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,740
Even if you cannot predict exactly what

1935
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:29,220
is the exact position of the planets,

1936
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:32,500
if you can get to kind of a distribution of laws,

1937
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:33,860
the probability of finding something

1938
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:35,900
with the mass of the Jupiter in one

1939
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,700
astronomical unit is this one, something

1940
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:40,180
about probabilities and how these things happened.

1941
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:40,820
So that's it.

1942
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:42,180
This is a very powerful tool.

1943
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:44,820
I mean, even if we don't know exactly the deterministic answer

1944
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:47,540
to something, I think to predict distributions

1945
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:48,900
is very, very useful.

1946
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:51,900
And even if this is an emerging, I mean,

1947
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:55,020
if the distribution per se is an emerging phenomenon,

1948
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:58,980
that you cannot compute exactly from the initial conditions,

1949
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:03,460
I think this is very useful, and it's used a lot.

1950
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:07,500
OK, before we go to questions, I should tell you

1951
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:10,660
that we are having a round table on consciousness in March.

1952
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:36,180
Questions?

1953
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:39,660
Great presentation on astrophysical astrobiology.

1954
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:41,540
I'd like to get back to emergence,

1955
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:45,340
and I was hoping that each of the panels could describe

1956
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:50,180
in a thumbnail their definition of emergent consciousness.

1957
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:52,740
And then if you could really reassure me

1958
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:58,340
how machine emergent consciousness will not

1959
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:00,260
be man's most dangerous invention.

1960
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:07,460
Oh, really?

1961
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:10,620
That's for an example, for example.

1962
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:16,020
Yeah, so I do, as my remarks perhaps suggested,

1963
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:20,100
I do tend to think of animal consciousness,

1964
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,220
subjective consciousness that we have,

1965
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:24,300
that presumably other mammals have,

1966
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:27,900
and who knows how far down the life scale it goes,

1967
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,580
that it's a strongly emergent kind of phenomenon.

1968
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:35,820
It involves giving rise to fundamentally new features

1969
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:40,860
of the whole organism, that are structural features,

1970
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,780
but that are sustained, certainly,

1971
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:45,020
by the physical properties of the organism.

1972
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:48,660
So that's how I think about emergent consciousness,

1973
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,860
and it gives rise to very difficult questions

1974
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:53,180
about how one could ever theorize about it scientifically.

1975
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,220
I appreciate it.

1976
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:58,740
But I guess to quote the early 20th century emergentist,

1977
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:02,580
Samuel Alexander, Scottish emergentist, scientist,

1978
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:04,860
we have to approach these things with the piety

1979
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:07,380
of the natural investigator.

1980
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:10,620
That's how mysteriously we find ourselves

1981
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,940
as conscious beings in a world that's

1982
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:15,700
driven fundamentally by physical forces,

1983
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:18,300
and then it's our job if we want to theorize about it

1984
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:22,220
to figure out how that could be, but it's true.

1985
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:26,300
Now, the business of scientists who

1986
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:30,700
replicate forms of life that perhaps could be conscious,

1987
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:33,980
could be purpose of forms that might

1988
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:39,420
be less prone to irrational and behavioral than ourselves

1989
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:43,660
and get organized and take over or something like that.

1990
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:45,940
I can't provide any reassurances on that score.

1991
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:47,780
I just don't know what the possibilities are.

1992
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:50,420
I think we just don't know what the possibilities are.

1993
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:53,180
Thank you.

1994
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:54,220
So you have to ask her.

1995
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:56,140
Anyone else who might want to jump?

1996
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,220
I don't know if anyone else wants to.

1997
01:36:58,220 --> 01:36:59,220
That was a good answer.

1998
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:01,340
I want to say one thing, but I'll go after you.

1999
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:04,340
So yeah, I don't have anything intelligent to say.

2000
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:06,700
That's fine.

2001
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:11,860
So I think if some man-made creature behaved

2002
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,980
in a sufficiently sophisticated way,

2003
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:15,500
we would have to say it was conscious.

2004
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:18,300
If it really, if it cried when it's offspring

2005
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:21,700
were lost in the mall or whatever,

2006
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:24,540
I'd, I think, be very difficult to deny that it was feeling

2007
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:28,980
things and I think that would be impossible to avoid.

2008
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:31,300
As to whether that would translate into danger to us,

2009
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:33,620
that we simply can't tell.

2010
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:35,060
Cura's actually your answer.

2011
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:38,540
Does that mean that you think that this sort of strongly

2012
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:44,060
emergent new thing wouldn't exist built the thing?

2013
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:46,380
Instead of it evolving naturally or being just descended

2014
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:50,620
from us, if we built a very complex robot,

2015
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:52,300
an artificial intelligence, and it behaved

2016
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:56,860
in a sufficiently like or even doglike way,

2017
01:37:56,860 --> 01:38:01,180
do you think that would mean that the stuff that the emergent

2018
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:03,740
mental stuff was actually emerging in it?

2019
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:08,100
I think we'd have that we can't say for sure

2020
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:09,580
a priori, right?

2021
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:12,700
All we know about is that there's consciousness associated

2022
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:15,340
with a certain kind of biological form of life

2023
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:18,460
rooted in neurophysiology just because we have direct

2024
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:20,540
acquaintance with that phenomena and we know it's

2025
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:23,060
intimately associated with our neurophysiology.

2026
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:25,940
Whether something that was sort of functionally equivalent

2027
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:28,380
to neurophysiology, but say silicon-based,

2028
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,940
something artificial, whether that would give rise

2029
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:34,540
to subjective experience or simply something that would

2030
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:38,460
mimic, but not actually involve conscious experience,

2031
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,780
but would mimic the kind of behavior that conscious

2032
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:44,500
being such as ourselves engaged in, like crying and so forth.

2033
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:47,860
That's a deep question and it's hard to say.

2034
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:49,940
We couldn't answer it.

2035
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:53,420
We couldn't necessarily verify what would be our best theory

2036
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:56,860
based on the behavior.

2037
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:58,140
But yeah, it's a difficult question.

2038
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:58,660
Yeah, I don't know.

2039
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:00,140
I'm just wondering if there is something

2040
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,540
like a Turing test or something like that for consciousness.

2041
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:04,940
Well, basically, I'm saying I believe the Turing test

2042
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:08,020
and he's saying he doesn't completely buy it.

2043
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:12,220
Yeah, so can we postulate that there is,

2044
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:13,780
imagine that there is no consciousness.

2045
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:16,500
And if there is an animal, they were

2046
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:19,100
saying before something that there is no consciousness

2047
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,340
and it's behaving exactly in the same way.

2048
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:23,060
And then the other thing that I think

2049
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:25,020
I found very problematic about consciousness

2050
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:27,140
is that when you think evolution in an evolution,

2051
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:29,460
when you think the relationship between different

2052
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:31,580
organisms in an evolutionary way,

2053
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:33,540
I mean, it's very hard to make a cut.

2054
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:37,460
When evolution happens, so when consciousness happens or not,

2055
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:39,820
it's a very problematic concept.

2056
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:43,140
Yeah, any notion of strong emergence

2057
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:46,340
implies a certain degree of discontinuity

2058
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:48,740
and natural evolution of process.

2059
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:51,420
But I think that's just not very well defined.

2060
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:53,300
I don't think it's particularly useful.

2061
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:55,300
And it's problematic.

2062
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:58,340
I mean, this is the problem with consciousness, I think.

2063
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:04,420
But concerning the origins of life here, maybe elsewhere,

2064
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:07,220
why can't we answer that question by just creating

2065
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:12,500
it in the laboratory from fundamental elements?

2066
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:13,820
It seems like the initial condition

2067
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:15,420
shouldn't be that hard.

2068
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:19,020
You know what they were when the Earth started.

2069
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:22,180
And it seems like we were a lot cheaper than going

2070
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:24,980
to some very places trying to find it.

2071
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:27,780
Is it just that we don't have the biggest idea how it was done?

2072
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:29,420
Well, yeah.

2073
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:32,220
So I have to say that you've got to search the universe

2074
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:36,220
because that's my career that's a place for life.

2075
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:37,300
But no, you have a point.

2076
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:40,260
And so there are people whose approach to this question

2077
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:43,900
is to try and build life in the lab

2078
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:47,580
or have life merge out of whatever they're doing in the lab.

2079
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:51,740
So the people looking at the sort of more complex level,

2080
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:55,940
there are people building cells from scratch, building DNA

2081
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:58,380
from scratch and trying to make that function.

2082
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:01,260
And then at a lower level, there are people looking at,

2083
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:04,940
as you intimate, if you take the mix of chemistry

2084
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:06,900
that we think perhaps existed on the early Earth

2085
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:10,620
4 billion years ago and you put it in the right conditions,

2086
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:11,540
what happens?

2087
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:15,780
And I think part of the problem is we don't actually

2088
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:19,140
know precisely what was going on 4 billion years ago.

2089
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:22,100
We don't know what the start of mix

2090
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:24,260
was on the surface of the early Earth.

2091
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:28,700
It perhaps was more complex than we previously thought

2092
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:32,140
because we're now realizing that during the process

2093
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:35,500
of star and planet formation, there's

2094
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:39,020
this great swirling disk of material

2095
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:41,220
that's there for a few tens of millions of years.

2096
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:43,620
And there's an enormous amount of complex chemistry

2097
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:44,940
that happens in that.

2098
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:47,700
It only really happens then.

2099
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:50,980
It doesn't happen in the sort of tenuous nebula

2100
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:51,820
between the stars.

2101
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:54,500
And it doesn't probably happen in the same way

2102
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:57,460
once you've got a planetary surface.

2103
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:59,860
So it's, yeah, I'm biased.

2104
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:01,900
This is my sort of take on this.

2105
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:05,580
There may be something special, special is a bad word.

2106
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:08,660
There may be something that goes on in a forming planetary

2107
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:12,980
system that puts a far more rich and complex chemical mixture

2108
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:14,020
down now.

2109
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:16,380
So what people are seeing with these experiments

2110
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:20,740
where they have, for example amino acids and certain catalysts

2111
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:25,820
and ultraviolet light in a simulated marine environment,

2112
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:29,060
stuff does start to happen.

2113
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:33,740
Problem is making the conditions right so it keeps going.

2114
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:36,620
And we don't know how long it took.

2115
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:37,940
So simulating this in a lab.

2116
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:39,860
Maybe you need to run the simulation

2117
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:41,340
in the lab for a million years.

2118
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:41,820
And don't know.

2119
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:45,740
Maybe you need to have many cubic miles of material.

2120
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:46,240
Right.

2121
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:48,180
In one little corner which the right thing happens,

2122
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:49,260
one's in a billion years.

2123
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:50,740
So I think it's a great question.

2124
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:53,820
I think people are definitely doing that.

2125
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:57,020
My bias take is we need to do the other thing too,

2126
01:42:57,020 --> 01:43:00,140
which is to look for finished examples.

2127
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:02,220
Yeah, I think the difference in just in volume

2128
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:04,260
and the difference in time is so many orders

2129
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:07,260
from magnitude away from the lab and the things that,

2130
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:09,500
I mean, you cannot extrapolate.

2131
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:10,140
It's difficult.

2132
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:13,620
I mean, there may be ways to sort of accelerate opportunity.

2133
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:15,220
Yeah, but these many orders of magnitude.

2134
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:15,720
Sure.

2135
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:19,740
Yeah, absolutely.

2136
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:22,820
I was glad to hear you were channeling Yogi Vara.

2137
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:24,740
And you've said it was remarkable how much you could do

2138
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:32,060
just by looking at his quote was, I think it's amazing how

2139
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:34,580
much you can observe just by watching.

2140
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:35,460
So very similar.

2141
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:37,780
He was a wise man.

2142
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:40,980
The first planetary scientist, I'm curious.

2143
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:42,980
Something struck me when I was a child,

2144
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:47,340
and it wasn't my parents, in the Museum of Natural History,

2145
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:49,740
and that was the giant T-Rex skeleton.

2146
01:43:49,740 --> 01:43:53,060
And I looked at it and I said, it has a pelvis.

2147
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:53,900
It has a spine.

2148
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:55,820
It has a skull.

2149
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:57,820
It's got arms, legs.

2150
01:43:57,820 --> 01:43:59,020
Owns look sort of similar.

2151
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:00,820
The muscles.

2152
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:03,900
Is that the galaxies coming together?

2153
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:06,340
Is there a common ancestor that I'm unaware of?

2154
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:08,940
Or is it just the environmental pressures coming up

2155
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:12,780
with some kind of a similar result, even though dinosaurs

2156
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:15,500
and mammals are quite different?

2157
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,100
So that's still my question.

2158
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:17,740
Yeah.

2159
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:18,740
My eight-year-old question.

2160
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:19,860
A common origin.

2161
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:20,300
I'm sorry?

2162
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:24,820
We have the common ancestor that has all the features.

2163
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:25,660
Thank you.

2164
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:37,900
Very briefly, just to answer Dr. Alfred's question

2165
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:40,900
why do most of the galaxies look similar?

2166
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:45,020
It's because the laws of physics are the same in all

2167
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:47,500
of our known universe.

2168
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:52,980
In a multiverse, as alluded to by string theory,

2169
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:55,940
for example, the physical constants

2170
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:59,860
might be different than you would have different formations

2171
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:01,220
or not at all.

2172
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:05,940
Anyway, getting back to the emergence of consciousness.

2173
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:08,060
Seems to me that consciousness is just

2174
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:11,180
a response to our environment.

2175
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,940
Nothing special except that it's on a very complex level.

2176
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:19,220
No different from an amoeba responding to its environment.

2177
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:21,660
It seems that the entire conversation

2178
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:27,460
was very egocentric and also geocentric, earth

2179
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:29,820
centric.

2180
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:33,660
I think everybody in this room is conscious.

2181
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:35,100
And I think most of us would agree

2182
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:40,460
that most mammals are conscious, although that was not accepted

2183
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:43,060
until the 20th century, still not accepted

2184
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:46,940
by some religious fanatics.

2185
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:50,580
But would you say a worm is conscious?

2186
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:52,540
Would you say a plant is conscious?

2187
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:54,700
Plants have been known to respond differently

2188
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:56,340
to different types of music, for example.

2189
01:45:56,340 --> 01:46:10,780
And as Dr. Scharf stated, there are complex organic molecules

2190
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:12,340
in interstellar space.

2191
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:19,140
In fact, most of the essential amino acids

2192
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:23,740
have been found in meteorites that have landed on earth.

2193
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:27,780
So life and consciousness unique to planet earth

2194
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:29,940
is not necessarily the truth.

2195
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:37,940
But my question is, what is your threshold for consciousness?

2196
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:42,500
Humans are obviously conscious by our definition of mammals.

2197
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:50,540
As a worm, as a flower, is a molecule that can self-replicate.

2198
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:52,540
Is that conscious or not conscious?

2199
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:56,140
What is a threshold?

2200
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:57,220
Good.

2201
01:46:57,220 --> 01:47:00,660
So distinguish two things that have come together

2202
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:02,300
in certain complex ways.

2203
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:09,460
One is goal-directed behavioral response

2204
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:13,940
to some kind of stimuli of your sense organs.

2205
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:15,340
Worms engage in that.

2206
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:17,140
Plants engage in that.

2207
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:20,980
There's a responsiveness, behavioral responsiveness.

2208
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:23,340
But the idea of consciousness is something

2209
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:28,100
that mediates stimuli and certain kinds of behavioral response.

2210
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:29,740
So you asked me a question.

2211
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:30,860
I'm consciously aware of that.

2212
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:31,780
I'm thinking about it.

2213
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:33,700
I'm having conscious thoughts.

2214
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:36,940
And then that has now led to my verbal behavior.

2215
01:47:36,940 --> 01:47:39,220
That's the observable thing.

2216
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:39,700
It's my speech.

2217
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:45,020
So you say, well, what's the definition?

2218
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:46,260
When do we have consciousness?

2219
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:48,980
Well, we have consciousness when there's something

2220
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:52,460
it's like to be that kind of organism.

2221
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:55,740
It has a point of view.

2222
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:59,260
Non-living things, we assume, like tables,

2223
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:00,220
have no point of view.

2224
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:00,900
They just are.

2225
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:04,300
They have intrinsic properties that

2226
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:07,580
can be described in third personal terms.

2227
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:11,260
Plants we typically suppose, maybe biology

2228
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:13,980
will surprise us one day, but we typically suppose there's

2229
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:16,620
nothing it's like to be a plant, although it does engage

2230
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:20,460
in an organismic response to stimuli.

2231
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:22,900
There's no subjective experience associated

2232
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:25,300
because it doesn't have the right

2233
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:29,820
or best understanding of where do conscious states,

2234
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:30,900
where are their origins?

2235
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:32,460
Well, it's for us.

2236
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:35,420
Its origins is in a functioning neurophysiological system

2237
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:36,900
of a certain kind.

2238
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:39,260
And then things get a bit obscure.

2239
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:42,820
How does functioning neuronal interactions

2240
01:48:42,820 --> 01:48:44,980
and large-scale neural assemblies

2241
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:47,380
give rise to subjective experience?

2242
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:49,020
That's the difficult question.

2243
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:49,540
Yeah.

2244
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:50,540
Please.

2245
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:56,220
On an atomic scale, particles governed

2246
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:59,380
by quantum physics, which is really everything,

2247
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:01,420
do not respond in a deterministic way.

2248
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:05,820
So can't we say that an electron has an opinion?

2249
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:07,780
You say consciousness is an opinion.

2250
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:10,060
An electron could, if you shoot an electron out

2251
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:12,700
of a cathode ray tube, it could land over there,

2252
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:14,820
over there, over there.

2253
01:49:14,820 --> 01:49:17,260
We could say that's an opinion.

2254
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:19,100
Why is that not conscious?

2255
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:20,100
There's no no no no.

2256
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:22,900
What makes our consciousness so special

2257
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:24,620
and what is the threshold level?

2258
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:26,220
I think one can do the weight gain

2259
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:28,540
might serve in the next step, question.

2260
01:49:28,540 --> 01:49:29,860
The subject is conscious.

2261
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:31,100
I want to say one thing about it.

2262
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:32,460
It's like wealthy.

2263
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:35,900
Wealthy is 10K a year more than me.

2264
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:39,260
And conscious is a little bit simpler behavior than mine,

2265
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:41,780
but not too much simpler.

2266
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:44,060
This is an ego section.

2267
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:48,260
Well, who sets the definitions of the words?

2268
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:49,460
Not the words.

2269
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:50,860
LAUGHTER

2270
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:51,860
Thank you.

2271
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:55,060
Kind of related.

2272
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:58,100
I hope it comes out coherently.

2273
01:49:58,100 --> 01:50:01,580
So the beginning of consciousness, self-consciousness,

2274
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:04,700
and the beginning of life from non-life,

2275
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:07,060
even the emergence of a complex universe,

2276
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:10,220
seems to require the input of some kind of information.

2277
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:13,220
So when an infant becomes self-aware,

2278
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:15,740
he's talking to his parents, parents are speaking to,

2279
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:18,180
it seems to correlate when infants become self-aware.

2280
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:20,460
There's information exchange happening

2281
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:22,820
from inanimate to animate.

2282
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:23,900
You have a genetic code.

2283
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:26,140
That's a genetic language.

2284
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:31,180
Something about language systems seems to inherently arbitrary.

2285
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:33,180
The rules of grammar of the English language

2286
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:36,060
don't derive from physical laws.

2287
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:38,380
So can you guys bounce that around?

2288
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:42,340
What does that imply about the emergence of life

2289
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:43,660
and self-consciousness?

2290
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:50,380
I mean, maybe I was going to say this before to the previous question,

2291
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:52,580
but it was perhaps more appropriate here.

2292
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:55,900
I mean, what's interesting when I hear people talking

2293
01:50:55,900 --> 01:51:00,180
about consciousness, and is there a threshold beyond which

2294
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:03,340
this is conscious in the way that we've seen, and so on?

2295
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:06,060
I wonder if you could just forget about all that for a moment

2296
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:09,220
and ask, well, OK, so why is there consciousness?

2297
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:11,580
Now, obviously, the easy thing to say is, well,

2298
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:15,460
it's because there's some sort of evolutionary advantage.

2299
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,740
It's to do with, yes, our response to stimuli.

2300
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:21,380
It's to do with our ability to make abstractions

2301
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:25,900
and it's due to the ability of other things to do that.

2302
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:29,940
So perhaps somewhere in here, there

2303
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:33,340
has to be talk about the origins of consciousness.

2304
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:35,820
What point in evolutionary history

2305
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:37,780
and why was it suddenly advantageous,

2306
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:41,260
or was it just a chance thing that some organism mutated

2307
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:43,820
in the right way, there was some point mutation

2308
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:47,740
in the piece of DNA, and you had enough complexity

2309
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:52,180
and neuronal growth or whatever to give rise this?

2310
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:54,900
Because I haven't heard that piece of this at all.

2311
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,380
Yeah, the other thing, how independent,

2312
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:57,460
going back to the question, I thought

2313
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:59,100
it was very, very interesting, is

2314
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:01,900
that how dependent is on language,

2315
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:03,660
the definition of consciousness?

2316
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:05,620
I mean, you are saying that we are kind of aware,

2317
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:07,980
and then we are talking the whole time with ourselves,

2318
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:11,820
and we are internalizing kind of a speech for ourselves.

2319
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:15,340
So if there is a person that cannot talk

2320
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:20,100
and has been isolated from the world of communication,

2321
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:23,180
is there a way of saying that this person without access

2322
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:25,780
to any language, this person is conscious?

2323
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:30,060
And I would certainly think so, right?

2324
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:34,340
Language may be, it's a difficult theoretical question

2325
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:37,700
that cognitive scientists theorize about,

2326
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:41,820
but the dependency of abstract reflective thought

2327
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:44,700
on language and how the two are bound up.

2328
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:47,460
That's one question, but consciousness itself, right?

2329
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:49,940
There are animals that we have reason to believe

2330
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:51,580
do not have a language capacity,

2331
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:55,860
but presumably because they're basic neurophysiology,

2332
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:58,060
sufficiently similar to us, and their behaviors,

2333
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:02,060
indicates they are engaged, they do have conscious space.

2334
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:03,460
With this communication, there is conscious space.

2335
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:04,780
In non-linguistic ways, right?

2336
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:07,380
That's why we think dogs are conscious.

2337
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:10,380
Because it doesn't have to be language.

2338
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:14,060
Yes, but now the question of the original question

2339
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:15,700
that was being asked about the relationship

2340
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:17,620
of information to consciousness,

2341
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:20,700
this is something that some cognitive scientists do think,

2342
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:23,900
right, they puzzle, what is the function of consciousness?

2343
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:27,180
Why do you need this intermediary, subjective,

2344
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:28,020
mental aspect?

2345
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:30,580
What would that be doing biologically,

2346
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:34,180
presumably it has to have some kind of advantage?

2347
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:36,900
Surely it's not just a mere chance mutation,

2348
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:38,660
it's such a remarkable thing.

2349
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:42,780
And so some scientists do theorize

2350
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:45,580
it has something to do with information

2351
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:48,460
that is had by different modules

2352
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:50,220
in our neurophysiological system,

2353
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:51,860
in some sense, coming together, right?

2354
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:54,060
So right now I can have visual information,

2355
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:56,700
auditory information, I can be thinking about the topic

2356
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:58,460
we're talking about, all this information

2357
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:00,340
is coming together for me, somehow,

2358
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:03,660
in one overarching, complex conscious state.

2359
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:06,740
And there's usefulness of a kind of a free sharing

2360
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:11,460
of information that perhaps this is just the beginning

2361
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:14,660
of a spectrum, that consciousness seems to be a place

2362
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:18,700
where a lot of information that we derive both

2363
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:21,340
from our senses and internal thought processes

2364
01:54:21,340 --> 01:54:22,420
comes together.

2365
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:26,740
And so perhaps it is actually very relevant,

2366
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:27,580
but we don't know.

2367
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:31,780
A lot of my questions were already asked,

2368
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:34,780
so I'm making one up as I go along a couple.

2369
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:37,020
But first, a couple of cool observations.

2370
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:40,940
I think some of the trouble of discussing this

2371
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:44,140
is that we have a predilection to name our experiences

2372
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:47,980
and our observations and then treat that idea as an idea,

2373
01:54:47,980 --> 01:54:51,020
as a real thing and then proceed to give it properties.

2374
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:54,220
So to me, that's one of the real difficulties

2375
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:55,900
in consciousness.

2376
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:57,700
That's not really part of my question.

2377
01:54:57,700 --> 01:54:59,660
But I'll just point out that the reason the conversation

2378
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:02,540
goes nowhere until there is a physical substrate

2379
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:04,780
that we can point to and work with,

2380
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:08,100
it's in a self-enclosed area of neural philosophy.

2381
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:09,780
So that's as far as it goes.

2382
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:12,540
However, the question related that,

2383
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:14,860
and then I have another similar couple

2384
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:16,300
of observation and question.

2385
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:22,060
The neocortex generates a weak electromagnetic field

2386
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:26,820
that's been implicated in relatively recent research

2387
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:30,380
as being the mechanism for synchronization

2388
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:31,540
between distal brain areas

2389
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:33,780
because the axonal propagation speed of 100 meters

2390
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:36,260
and second doesn't account for it.

2391
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:41,380
So I'm hoping to hear any response at all

2392
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:44,260
based on someone I'm with my lead in.

2393
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:48,700
Or perhaps you might think about that,

2394
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:52,300
about the experience of consciousness

2395
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:56,500
is possibly the experience of the electromagnetic fields

2396
01:55:56,500 --> 01:56:00,060
field and interaction with the neocortex,

2397
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:01,020
something like that.

2398
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:02,460
So that's number one.

2399
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:04,620
Number two has to do with dark matter,

2400
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:08,140
which is also guilty of being an idea,

2401
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:09,300
not an idea just yet,

2402
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:11,540
although we observe the physical phenomena.

2403
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:14,900
So the question I have there is that,

2404
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:17,420
my understanding of the standard model

2405
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:20,060
and some of the more troubling new introduction,

2406
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:23,300
supersymmetry, some other areas,

2407
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:26,020
indicate that if dark, a dark,

2408
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:29,300
mathematical, perhaps other than a weakly,

2409
01:56:29,300 --> 01:56:32,100
a strongly interactive, massive particle,

2410
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:33,460
if it's something different,

2411
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:36,580
then the standard model has to,

2412
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:38,340
it can't accommodate that.

2413
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:40,140
So that was a question for you.

2414
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:41,820
Okay, thank you.

2415
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:43,780
So two questions.

2416
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:45,660
One is for you, one is for you.

2417
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:48,940
Oh, I'll just say a little bit that I do know

2418
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:52,860
about your first question about synchronicity

2419
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:54,860
in the brain, maybe connecting.

2420
01:56:56,780 --> 01:56:58,340
Well, I know how much synchronicity is,

2421
01:56:58,340 --> 01:57:03,340
I think what you're talking about, I'm sorry.

2422
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:06,340
I think I was intending the word in the sense you have in mind.

2423
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:11,340
So this was an idea that was put forward by Christoph Koch,

2424
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:15,340
a computational biologist at Caltech together with Francis Crick

2425
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:19,340
of Crick and Watson fame that maybe this is the biological,

2426
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:23,340
the physical substrate to consciousness and chanting it now.

2427
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:26,340
I'll pass it over to my colleague who actually knows this stuff,

2428
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:31,340
perhaps, that this idea has sort of died away,

2429
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:36,340
that Francis Crick himself has now latched onto a new different sort of iPod.

2430
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:40,340
But there wasn't. There was another paper that was in the last couple of years ago.

2431
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:46,340
Okay, I'm not a biologist, so I can't speak with any authoritaviveness.

2432
01:57:46,340 --> 01:57:47,340
You understand?

2433
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:51,340
So I think to say about that, because I don't know the topic very well.

2434
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:55,340
So also, I mean, I'm very skeptical about many consciousness things.

2435
01:57:55,340 --> 01:58:00,340
Going back to the dark matter, and this is something that I think they are very different things.

2436
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:03,340
The dark matter has been observed. I mean, it has not been observed with photons,

2437
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:06,340
but it has been observed with their gravitational...

2438
01:58:06,340 --> 01:58:11,340
And they are kind of very nice experiments, I mean experiments by nature that happens to be there,

2439
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:13,340
and you can explain very good things that are there.

2440
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:19,340
So I think it's there, it's observed, and the only thing is that it's not interacting with light.

2441
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:24,340
And consciousness, by... I mean, has not been observed.

2442
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:29,340
So on the dark matter, and let me just see if I understand your question.

2443
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:36,340
So it sounds like what you're asking is the...

2444
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:40,340
How our models of dark matter fit into the standard model?

2445
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:41,340
Is that the essence of the question?

2446
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:46,340
Essentially, when I was at the LHC conference, there was some pretty robust discussion about

2447
01:58:46,340 --> 01:58:55,340
the understanding that depending on what, if and what the dark matter particle turns out to be,

2448
01:58:55,340 --> 01:59:00,340
if it does, that it would not fit into very nicely the standard model as we have it now.

2449
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:05,340
Completely correct, and in fact, it does not fit into the standard model at all.

2450
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:08,340
So what does that mean, that aside from the physics?

2451
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:14,340
Well, there are a number of issues with the standard model.

2452
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:19,340
We know that it's not a fundamental theory of the universe, and there are a number of problems with it.

2453
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:25,340
The first one being that it does not contain a quantum theory of gravity.

2454
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:26,340
That's the first issue.

2455
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:31,340
It does not account for neutrino masses, which seems like this is a standard model problem, right?

2456
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:36,340
We have neutrinos in the standard model, and in the standard model, they're massless.

2457
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:40,340
Third, there's no viable dark matter candidate within the standard model.

2458
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:45,340
And then fourth, there are a number of mathematical issues that are a little bit subtle with a standard model.

2459
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:57,340
So the fact that there must be, it may be a strong word, but all of these experimental pieces,

2460
01:59:57,340 --> 02:00:04,340
plus the theoretical piece on the mathematics, certainly suggest that there is a more fundamental theory.

2461
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:13,340
And I would say that when we talk about supersymmetry, for example, supersymmetry is sort of one more fundamental,

2462
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:20,340
like one fundamental step down from the standard model in the sense that we now invoke a new symmetry between fermions and bosons.

2463
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:22,340
So it's a more fundamental theory.

2464
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:28,340
However, even supersymmetry in its simplest form does not necessarily involve gravitation.

2465
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:30,340
Now, there are superstring theories, right?

2466
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:34,340
String theories that involve supersymmetry.

2467
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:40,340
So even supersymmetry is an effective theory of some more fundamental theory.

2468
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:47,340
That's what's driving theoretical physicists right now, is the sense that we will have some unified theory in the bottom.

2469
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:49,340
So we're just one really quick follow-up.

2470
02:00:49,340 --> 02:00:51,340
Have you listened to?

2471
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:52,340
I'll talk to you.

2472
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:54,340
Sure, we can talk about biceps too.

2473
02:00:54,340 --> 02:01:01,340
The first indication is that it may not be dust.

2474
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:02,340
Is that true?

2475
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:07,340
I thought it was dust.

2476
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:16,340
And event that reductionist scientists claim as a great victory for their team is that many phenomena that were catalogued and

2477
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:25,340
described by classical thermodynamicists were subsequently explained at a microscopic fundamental level by statistical mechanitians.

2478
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:30,340
So this is a very inviting target for champions of strong emergence.

2479
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:37,340
And a particular crack at it that I've heard recently goes like this.

2480
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:41,340
I think this is from a physicist named Sean Carroll.

2481
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:49,340
He was a very important phenomenon occurring in physical systems everywhere at all different levels, all different energies,

2482
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:52,340
involving many different substances.

2483
02:01:52,340 --> 02:02:02,340
And he says that when you examine these closely, it appears as if the way they happen is the same, no matter what the system is made of.

2484
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:06,340
In other words, it really doesn't depend on what the nature of the particle is.

2485
02:02:06,340 --> 02:02:15,340
So then how can you say that the microscopic particulars of what the constituents of the system are?

2486
02:02:15,340 --> 02:02:20,340
Is there any way determining what's happening at the higher level?

2487
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:26,340
I have my own reasons for not being impressed by that argument, but I want to know what the members of the panel think.

2488
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:27,340
Thank you.

2489
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:36,340
It would be an example of weak emergence. It would be successfully explaining large-scale behavior in terms of little...

2490
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:41,340
It's true that sometimes changing the little stuff doesn't make much difference to the big stuff.

2491
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:46,340
And galaxies may be an example of that. Any old fluctuation will give you the same thing.

2492
02:02:46,340 --> 02:02:49,340
So can you...

2493
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:51,340
I think you're a very critical experience.

2494
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:53,340
Critical exponents and all these things.

2495
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:59,340
Critical exponents where they are phase transitions, trying to see... you can classify the phase transitions, but some exponents of...

2496
02:02:59,340 --> 02:03:14,340
I think that what the argument was was that if properties of the microscopic constituents are determining what's happening,

2497
02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:21,340
then the way it happens should in some way depend on what those particles are.

2498
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:23,340
In some way, but it may be very little.

2499
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:25,340
So sometimes you'll find that much the same microscopic...

2500
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:33,340
Sorry, wildly different microscopic inputs give you much the same macroscopic output, but sometimes, like mutations, it makes a huge difference.

2501
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:36,340
So... is that... is that on?

2502
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:41,340
I think probably... I mean, you have in mind, like in statistical mechanics, when you imagine that you change...

2503
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:48,340
I mean, you can't describe, for example, the casting of this room with temperature, and pressure, and volume, and these different things.

2504
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:55,340
And you don't have to know what are the details of the molecules. So if you just change hydrogen or nitrogen by whatever it is, I mean...

2505
02:03:55,340 --> 02:04:02,340
Then basically you can describe the same system with a few variables that are independent of what is the microscopic details of the gas that is in the room.

2506
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:08,340
Is that... is that... and then there are distributions that you can do statistics on the same.

2507
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:19,340
Well, I think you've essentially recapitulated what my own objection was to the... to what I thought when I first read this.

2508
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:22,340
I thought...

2509
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:24,340
So...

2510
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:25,340
Yeah.

2511
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:30,340
Next question, and then you can...

2512
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:37,340
I just wanted to thank all of you who have been a tremendous discussion with wide-ranging input from different fields,

2513
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:40,340
and I'm sure everybody else have greatly enjoyed it.

2514
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:45,340
My question really goes back to the fundamental question of...

2515
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:52,340
...mergence. I take it most of you have staked out a position as weak emergence proponents.

2516
02:04:52,340 --> 02:05:01,340
And I'm just trying to get my arms around what that means. I mean, a cloud, when it produces rain, I guess we don't think of rain as emergence,

2517
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:08,340
but if it's a little colder and it produces snowflakes, and each one of them is unique and has this extraordinary crystal structure,

2518
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:11,340
we think of it as an emergent phenomenon.

2519
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:16,340
But I think it's something... I don't know enough about meteorology to know,

2520
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:22,340
but I assume it's something that science can replicate in the laboratory and understand thoroughly.

2521
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:29,340
Is that really... is it just something that's very neat that we... that comes out as something simple,

2522
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:34,340
like bees produce... have this extraordinary society or starling...

2523
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:37,340
...I produce these amazing patterns.

2524
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:43,340
I'm ruling out the strong version of emergence, which seems to me just sort of got to the gaps to some extent.

2525
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:51,340
Is there more to emergence that it's just really cool stuff that comes out of simple stuff that we either understand thoroughly

2526
02:05:51,340 --> 02:05:56,340
or at least have the possibility of understanding thoroughly?

2527
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:59,340
I think that's about it.

2528
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:04,340
I think that's about it for most...

2529
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:11,340
I would say that's about it for a lot of the phenomena in question.

2530
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:15,340
That is, just because I do think of consciousness as strongly emergent,

2531
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:18,340
that doesn't give me any tendency towards thinking of any of these other...

2532
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:23,340
I think that's part of the one thing that's distorted, thinking about emergence this way,

2533
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:28,340
we gravitate towards one simple overarching sort of explanatory paradigm.

2534
02:06:28,340 --> 02:06:31,340
Is it weak emergence or strong? And I think we've got different phenomena,

2535
02:06:31,340 --> 02:06:36,340
and it's an empirical question in every case, and maybe we need to theorize about it differently.

2536
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:43,340
There is a commonality. The reason we use the word emergence in all these cases is just the idea of new,

2537
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:52,340
interesting patterns that involve forms of behavior and property instantiations that are different from the kinds of patterns

2538
02:06:52,340 --> 02:07:01,340
describable in lower level sciences, the different properties concepts than one invokes in lower level science.

2539
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:07,340
And so in that sense, that's emergence, that's uncontroversial, but the details,

2540
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:12,340
and whether or not it amounts to something much stronger than merely that,

2541
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:15,340
that becomes an empirical question.

2542
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:24,340
I have a question about, not just mamme in the sense of mamme outside of us,

2543
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:30,340
but also our own instrumentation as in how much we understand our senses,

2544
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:36,340
and how that plays into how we think of what we know.

2545
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:41,340
And it seems that during the discussion there was...

2546
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:48,340
Well, there was no mention of it, I'm sure it plays into the consciousness of what you study and what you measure,

2547
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:53,340
because sometimes I feel like we forget that.

2548
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:59,340
And in terms of... It goes... I want to link it back to the idea of consciousness.

2549
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:09,340
You know, one thing about communicating our consciousness is not just language in the sense of human language.

2550
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:14,340
If you put too much stuff on that table, it will break, is that communication.

2551
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:18,340
Isn't that feedback? Is it feedback communication?

2552
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:29,340
So how do we know that... I think we're losing the sense that we have a limited capacity to understand that

2553
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:35,340
if you can talk about measuring and the idea of instruments and how that limits us.

2554
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:49,340
It always feels like that we forget that we have this limitation would continue to be limited by not only our capacity to understand,

2555
02:08:49,340 --> 02:08:55,340
well, ultimately our capacity to understand, but also our instrumentation, the instruments that we use.

2556
02:08:55,340 --> 02:08:58,340
So if you can talk about that a little bit.

2557
02:08:58,340 --> 02:09:00,340
What's up, you're up.

2558
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:08,340
Yeah, I think it's an interesting point. As you were saying, I was thinking, well, the funny thing is we live at a time where we're now

2559
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:13,340
construing tools and instruments, particularly in terms of software and computers,

2560
02:09:13,340 --> 02:09:21,340
that greatly extend our ability to understand things, to understand particularly things like emergent phenomena

2561
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:29,340
where, I mean, you talked about, you end up thinking about distributions of things rather than an individual instance of a particular

2562
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:31,340
vent or whatever.

2563
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:37,340
So, you know, this is just what popped into my head.

2564
02:09:37,340 --> 02:09:41,340
The conversation is constantly changing.

2565
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:48,340
And perhaps it's always... we're constantly augmenting capacity.

2566
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:54,340
We used to do it by grinding lenses and peering into test tubes or out at the stars.

2567
02:09:54,340 --> 02:10:02,340
And we're still doing that, but now we're also constructing software and machines that greatly extend our capacity to

2568
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:12,340
build and conceptualize vast amounts of data that otherwise would appear extremely unstructured to our raw sensors.

2569
02:10:12,340 --> 02:10:17,340
So I... yeah, I don't know. That doesn't really answer anything. I just put that.

2570
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:24,340
I think there's a deep and difficult question here. So we have our basic five senses.

2571
02:10:24,340 --> 02:10:30,340
I'm looking at this tabletop which has a cylindrical, shallow cylindrical shape.

2572
02:10:30,340 --> 02:10:34,340
I can learn about that perceptually through vision.

2573
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:40,340
It has a certain look to me from a certain angle. I can get tactile information about its shape.

2574
02:10:40,340 --> 02:10:48,340
We... these... the tactile information and the visual information, they go together so constantly in us that we forget if we

2575
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:52,340
stopped and isolated. Those are completely different forms of information that are coming in.

2576
02:10:52,340 --> 02:10:57,340
And we've just learned to associate them so that if I close my eyes and have that check, I can picture before my mind

2577
02:10:57,340 --> 02:11:01,340
something that will look like what it will look like when I open my eyes.

2578
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:07,340
But in fact, these are two just very different. And as you say, they have a certain degree of precision.

2579
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:15,340
They have certain limits, our senses. So then theoretical science sort of tries to abstract away from these things

2580
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:20,340
and give kind of formalized pictures of reality, kind of very, you know,

2581
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:27,340
mathematically dynamical theories. But then when it comes to, yeah, but do we understand what the theory is saying?

2582
02:11:27,340 --> 02:11:31,340
It seems like the formalism isn't enough. I mean, quantum mechanics is the great case, right?

2583
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:36,340
It's this beautiful mathematical formalism, apparently. Notice you understand it well.

2584
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:42,340
And it's extremely predictably accurate. I'm told the most accurate theory in the history of science, right?

2585
02:11:42,340 --> 02:11:49,340
And yet you say, but intuitively to understand, it's one thing to work with the theory and say, okay, apply the formalism,

2586
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:55,340
do the measurements of a certain sort, and you can predict not individual outcomes, but distribution of outcomes.

2587
02:11:55,340 --> 02:12:00,340
And it all comes out right. But then you say, yeah, but what is it saying about the deep structure of matter?

2588
02:12:00,340 --> 02:12:05,340
And because we can't visualize it, we can't connect it to our senses, we feel like there's a barrier.

2589
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:14,340
We can't really understand it. So for us, understanding is bounded by our ability to picture and visualize.

2590
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:19,340
So it raises deep, I think, deep philosophical questions about the limits of understanding.

2591
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:26,340
Yeah. And it seems like because we think from our own perspective, and we very seldomly think of things from another perspective,

2592
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:31,340
maybe even another animal's perspective. Forget the table's perspective.

2593
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:41,340
You know, that sometimes that limits us from understanding from a different way and seldom the egotistical aspect of ourselves

2594
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:48,340
refuse to let us think from other perspectives in some ways. And that limits our understanding as well.

2595
02:12:48,340 --> 02:12:50,340
Thank you.

2596
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:57,340
Thanks for this amazing discussion. You really have blown my mind.

2597
02:12:57,340 --> 02:13:03,340
And so I wanted to ask a couple, two quick questions. I make it quick.

2598
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:09,340
Dr. Robodon, you really bummed me out when you shot down the whole consciousness idea.

2599
02:13:09,340 --> 02:13:16,340
I thought we were going to talk about all different kinds of consciousness, and you're like, no, there's no such thing.

2600
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:23,340
So this question is for you. I read some really interesting stuff about how our thoughts and our moods and stuff can be influenced

2601
02:13:23,340 --> 02:13:30,340
by the flora in our intestines or that. That parasites and other things can influence our thoughts, or maybe even our thoughts.

2602
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:39,340
So I've kind of been feeling like that consciousness or thought, if that's a better word for you, is,

2603
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:46,340
a consensus of different things happening and maybe even of different living things happening.

2604
02:13:46,340 --> 02:13:53,340
And so I wanted you to maybe share anything that thoughts you have on that concept.

2605
02:13:53,340 --> 02:13:58,340
And then the question was for Dr. Khrushberg.

2606
02:13:58,340 --> 02:14:04,340
I noticed in your bio, and it must be in here because you didn't want it taken out.

2607
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:11,340
So I figured it's fair game that you're a Buddhist.

2608
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:18,340
And so I really wanted to know your perspective on your thoughts of emergence and all of this particle physics and stuff.

2609
02:14:18,340 --> 02:14:23,340
And how does that fit with Buddhism? And do you see any similarities or kind of those two?

2610
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:29,340
Because to me, as a layman in both the language sometimes sounds the same.

2611
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:36,340
When I think of emergence and when I think of the singular mind, I'm not a Buddhist.

2612
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:40,340
But you know what I mean. So those are my questions. Thank you.

2613
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:49,340
So regarding the democratic thought in theory of consciousness, because I don't know what consciousness is, or thought.

2614
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:58,340
So no, I don't think thought is true. But I think there's some very interesting data that can be quantitatively

2615
02:14:58,340 --> 02:15:07,340
be precise. For example, if one of the things that I think is fascinating, if we just look in the genome of any of our cells,

2616
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:11,340
so this is like two copies and they are 3 billion letters of those.

2617
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:17,340
Only 1% is called in genes, so only 1% is doing proteins, most of the proteins that we know.

2618
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:22,340
But this is like 10% that they're dead viruses, many of those they are alive.

2619
02:15:22,340 --> 02:15:26,340
So there are things that happened in our history. They came and they infected us.

2620
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:29,340
They stay there, many of those they die.

2621
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:38,340
And we carry this cemetery. Each of our cells, they carry a cemetery of viruses that is more than the protein coding part of our genome.

2622
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:45,340
And this is fascinating. And you see there are a lot of exchange of genomic materials between different species also.

2623
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:52,340
And in bacteria it happens very often. But through different mechanisms, for example, these things, we have a lot of things even in our cells.

2624
02:15:52,340 --> 02:15:56,340
And then, as you were saying, in all the microbiome, in all the...

2625
02:15:56,340 --> 02:16:03,340
This is a very active field of research. It's trying to connect many of my colleagues. They are trying to connect the microbiome and many different things,

2626
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:09,340
many different health conditions. And it's a very active field of research.

2627
02:16:09,340 --> 02:16:14,340
And it's very challenging from many technical points of views.

2628
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:19,340
But I can discuss with you in detail many of these things. It's very, very interesting.

2629
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:25,340
And the other thing is, I think, just saying that we are a very homogeneous type of organism and all these things.

2630
02:16:25,340 --> 02:16:31,340
Even from the evolution point of view, I think it's fascinating. I mean, we know that some of our genes, ones that are important for us,

2631
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:45,340
and they were coming from other organisms. So this is fascinating. I mean, that we have this migration of different information between different species that have been blocked by our traditional viewpoint.

2632
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:52,340
And in animals, it's usually kind of the idea of species that they are kind of isolated reproductive units is true.

2633
02:16:52,340 --> 02:16:57,340
But when you go to plants, for example, you see that many of the plants that we drink and smoke every day, I mean,

2634
02:16:57,340 --> 02:17:02,340
they are the combination of merging of different species and all these things. This is fascinating.

2635
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:11,340
Now that we are reading a lot of these genomes, we realize how these amounts of information from different places is coming together.

2636
02:17:11,340 --> 02:17:18,340
All this is fascinating.

2637
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:25,340
So...

2638
02:17:25,340 --> 02:17:29,340
First you have to meditate.

2639
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:34,340
Exactly.

2640
02:17:34,340 --> 02:17:53,340
Let me begin by saying that I'm a practitioner of Buddhism, and I'm not a thinker of Buddhism, which means that I'm a meditation practitioner,

2641
02:17:53,340 --> 02:17:56,340
and I practice meditation regularly.

2642
02:17:56,340 --> 02:18:13,340
And your question is very interesting because in my experience, my first-person experience, there are analogies between what I know about theoretical physics

2643
02:18:13,340 --> 02:18:21,340
and my experience in meditation and consequently in daily life.

2644
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:30,340
One example, and this is something that I've thought a little bit about, is the notion of space in theoretical physics and in Buddhism.

2645
02:18:30,340 --> 02:18:40,340
Of course, we've talked a little bit about space, but space, from a physics point of view, is actually very complicated.

2646
02:18:40,340 --> 02:18:46,340
If you take out all of the stuff that's in space, that's in the universe, and you're just left with space,

2647
02:18:46,340 --> 02:18:51,340
that space actually has some fundamental energy to it.

2648
02:18:51,340 --> 02:19:05,340
You have this ability to create particle pairs just from the vacuum, and from those energy fluctuations, we get the emergence of particles.

2649
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:11,340
In fact, these fluctuations give rise to structure in the universe.

2650
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:27,340
And again, this is very experiential, but something similar happens, I think, with our experience, in the sense that it emerges from what we would say in Buddhism, is the Dharmakaya, the vast space of experience.

2651
02:19:27,340 --> 02:19:41,340
And Dharmakaya, there is a Sambo Gakaya, an energy fluctuation, and out of that emerges our experience, which is the Nirmana Kaya.

2652
02:19:41,340 --> 02:19:56,340
So there are some similar, I mean this is, I could really go on for a while here, but that's one thing that from my experience, kind of one analogy between physics and the experience of reality

2653
02:19:56,340 --> 02:19:59,340
that we kind of tap into through meditation.

2654
02:19:59,340 --> 02:20:04,340
So let me stop there, and we can talk more about it after, but it's...

2655
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:06,340
Last question.

2656
02:20:06,340 --> 02:20:15,340
So I'll just ask the question first, and I don't give my reasons for asking the question, but the question is, so we've talked a lot about different things.

2657
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:24,340
What is actually an example of strongly emergent phenomena in the science, and this is why I'm asking this, so you're pointing.

2658
02:20:24,340 --> 02:20:35,340
It's because we've talked about a kind of philosophy of mind, so the problem of consciousness, and we say it's like specifically in the nature of consciousness itself that we can't, that it's not reducible.

2659
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:49,340
And then we kind of came up with one example, and with you with physics, that was that the idea of multiple universes, and we get to the definite, if we give a really specific, precise definition of the universe, then we can't say that there is more than one.

2660
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:51,340
It's just logically impossible.

2661
02:20:51,340 --> 02:21:02,340
So then, my question would be, is strongly emergent phenomena only in those two cases or in a case where it's just definitionally impossible?

2662
02:21:02,340 --> 02:21:20,340
I'm up with phenomena that explains the higher level, and on the other hand, like with environmental, biological science chemistry, do we actually have examples of strongly emergent phenomena?

2663
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:29,340
Even if you don't believe in them yourself, I can tell you're all rejectionist, but if you don't believe in what are the examples?

2664
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:49,340
I think there might be a problem with strong emergence in principle, which is that if you see some new thing that is apparently strongly emergent, your first effort is going to be to create new entities, to subsume it into a new framework,

2665
02:21:49,340 --> 02:21:53,340
and then it'll just be part of the whole theory you already have.

2666
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:58,340
It won't have emerged. It'll just like the magnetic field or neutrino, you'll just add it to the inventory and keep it.

2667
02:21:58,340 --> 02:22:04,340
And then the question is, what kind of thing could that not apply to?

2668
02:22:04,340 --> 02:22:12,340
And the poster child for that was conscious experience, but then my suggestion about that was that it's decoupled from everything.

2669
02:22:12,340 --> 02:22:19,340
It's sort of unreachable in principle, and so, yeah, it's decoupled from being able to be subsumed into that, because it's decoupled from everything.

2670
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:23,340
You're going to disagree with that, so you get airtime.

2671
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:31,340
But so maybe strong emergence is a difficult thing to actually really have.

2672
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:43,340
Play-off Mark's comment. First, an advertisement for a different way of being a realist about conscious experience and saying that it's fundamental without being emergentist is to say it's ubiquitous.

2673
02:22:43,340 --> 02:22:48,340
This so-called old panpsychist idea, which is getting some new play again.

2674
02:22:48,340 --> 02:22:57,340
So then you say, our conscious experience is just a full-blown particular form of something that's there in matter everywhere.

2675
02:22:57,340 --> 02:23:02,340
You treat it as something fundamental. Maybe it's the intrinsic character of the physical more generally.

2676
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:06,340
Lots of ideas. Flossers like to run play with this idea.

2677
02:23:06,340 --> 02:23:11,340
I'm not myself disposed in that direction, but a lot of people are.

2678
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:21,340
But the other thing, the only other thing I wanted to say and really to kick it to some people with the physics background is we haven't talked about quantum entanglement, right?

2679
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:27,340
And that seems like it could be naturally, this is very low-level physics, right?

2680
02:23:27,340 --> 02:23:47,340
Where particles need to be treated in a certain way and the rough idea is that you cannot describe, you can't decompose the coupled system in terms of the intrinsic properties and the relations among them of the individual particles that entered into this system.

2681
02:23:47,340 --> 02:24:00,340
There's some sense of systemic property of this entangled system that isn't, you can't think of it as in some sense just built up out of the individual properties, items in isolation.

2682
02:24:00,340 --> 02:24:06,340
And then some people say, going space-time, looking at you, this is all up your alley, I assume.

2683
02:24:06,340 --> 02:24:14,340
Some people say, well, if quantum mechanics is ubiquitous, then the whole universe becomes possibly needs to be thought of theorized as.

2684
02:24:14,340 --> 02:24:21,340
And then one great big quantum entangled system is an accessible, strong emergence perhaps.

2685
02:24:21,340 --> 02:24:24,340
But with that, I'll just pass it over to you.

2686
02:24:24,340 --> 02:24:30,340
I don't think that's a tangled medicine example of...

2687
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:42,340
Okay, so for entangled man, you have a particle that can be up or down, another particle is up or down, and then you have a way of describing this thing, which is a vector space, another one.

2688
02:24:42,340 --> 02:24:45,340
And you construct a new one by taking the tensor product of the two.

2689
02:24:45,340 --> 02:24:53,340
So taking the units, you can construct a hidden space, you can construct a space that is the space of everything.

2690
02:24:53,340 --> 02:25:01,340
So taking each of the units, you can take a new definition or a new definition in a space that you can describe the whole system.

2691
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:08,340
I think as an example of what I was saying, the wave function, right, we say, oh, that's the wave function and that captures all this entanglement.

2692
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:16,340
And then we talk about the wave function, that's how we do physics now. So we just added a new entity to capture that thing.

2693
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:29,340
But if this new entity is a global thing, it's not an atomistic thing, then in what sense have we not embedded some kind of strong notion of emergence into the fundamental theory thing?

2694
02:25:29,340 --> 02:25:39,340
So we have to drive by the individual. So if there are these bottles here and each of those, you have the definition of, I mean, a way of quantizing the system,

2695
02:25:39,340 --> 02:25:43,340
you can combine the whole system by taking the product of all these different things.

2696
02:25:43,340 --> 02:25:46,340
So this is a very well-formal way of doing these things.

2697
02:25:46,340 --> 02:25:47,340
I'm not going to debate.

2698
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:52,340
It makes a sense of the connection between things and there was presence in classical physics before you had wave functions.

2699
02:25:52,340 --> 02:25:53,340
That's true.

2700
02:25:53,340 --> 02:25:57,340
Okay. Please feel your questioners and thank you very much.

2701
02:25:57,340 --> 02:26:02,340
Thank you.
