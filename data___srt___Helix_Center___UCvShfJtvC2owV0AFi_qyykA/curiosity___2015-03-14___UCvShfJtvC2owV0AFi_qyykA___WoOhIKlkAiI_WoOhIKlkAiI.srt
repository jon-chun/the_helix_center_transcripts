1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
These are the, well, these are on order for everyone, but they instructed me to use this

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
one for the announcement.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No moderation.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, no moderation.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm just going to start us off with a question.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Someone's not speaking all in court.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is you, okay?

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, no, this is me.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, and then, is this okay?

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Other ear?

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, I got it.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Is that all right? It's too high.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It might be more comfortable.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sorry.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No, no, no, that's so quite all right.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Can you hear me?

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's okay.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There we go.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, thank you.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I figured I needed one.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank you so much.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay, we're going to get started.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Everyone can take a seat.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I have a few announcements to make.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
My name is Rob Penzer.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm the associate director of the Helix Center, and I welcome everybody on this dreary Saturday morning, but I promise you this will be anything but dreary.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And a few announcements about upcoming programs. On April 18th, we're having a John Templeton Foundation sponsored Roundtable on the mind of a child.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
On April 25th, another Templeton Foundation Roundtable on the changing nature of free will.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Then on May 2nd, trauma and its after effects part one, war and genocide.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And watch for announcements for our Helix Center benefit on May 8th at the Lotus Club.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now I'd like to do the introductions for today.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:51,000
To my right, Siri Housfed, the author of a book of poems reading to you, three books of essays, a work of nonfiction, the 2010 The Shaking Woman or History of My Nerves, and six novels including her 2003 What I Loved, shortlisted for the Pre-Femona Etrange, and her most recent,

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The Blazing World, longlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize and nominated for the Caracas Prize.

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:13,000
She has a PhD in English literature from Columbia. She has also published papers in scientific journals, including Neuropsych analysis and clinical neurophysiology.

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In 2014, she was appointed a lecturer in psychiatry at the DeWitt Wallace Institute for the History of Psychiatry at Wile Cornell Medical College.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Her work has been translated into over 30 languages, and Siri participated in the October 2013 Helix Center Symposium, AB Warbur, Science and Psychonalysis.

38
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:42,000
To her right is Alberto Mangoel, Canadian writer, translator, editor and critic, but would rather define himself as a reader, whose novels include news from the book,

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,000
news from a foreign country came, and all men are liars, and nonfiction writings including the history of reading, The Library at Night,

40
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and together with Gianni Guadalupe, the Dictionary of Imaginary Places.

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He has received numerous international awards among them the Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters from France,

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and is Dr. Honoris Causa of the Universities of the Age in Belgium and Anglo-Ruscan in Cambridge, United Kingdom.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Just last month he was a participant in the Helix Center Roundtable entitled, Particle Fever the Quest, and with today's Roundtable, we celebrate publication by Yale University Press of Alberta's new book, Curiosity.

44
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:38,000
To his right is Marie Howe, author of Three Vimes of Poetry, The Kingdom of Ordinary, The Good Thief, and What the Living Do, and she's the co-editor of a book of essays in the company of my solitude, American Writing from the AIDS Pen.

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
She has been a fellow at the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College and was a recipient of NEA and Guggenheim Fellowships.

46
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Stanley Koonitz selected her for a labor and younger poet's prize from the American Academy of Poets, and her poems have appeared in The New Yorker, The Atlantic Poetry,

47
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Agni Plowshares, Harvard Review, and the Partisan Review, among others.

48
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Marie is the 2012-2014 poet laureate of New York State.

49
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:19,000
To her right is Paul Brody, psychiatrist and teaching faculty in the Department of Narrative Medicine at Columbia University, whose work explores space and the reciprocal relationship between listening and telling through the ethical stance of narrative therapy.

50
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He is co-creator and performer of Two Men Talking, a live, unscripted personal storytelling performance of identity, friendship, mortality, and forgiveness, which has brought to hundreds of audiences internationally, including at the Edinburgh Festival, in major theaters in South Africa, on the West End of London, and off Broadway.

51
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:54,000
A TEDx talk entitled The Power of Two explores the methodology that informs the performance of Two Men Talking and his clinical work. As co-founder of the storytelling company Narrative, Paul has worked closely with Open Society Foundations, teaching advocacy through listening

52
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and personal storytelling, including international work with sex workers, people with intellectual disabilities, recipients of oral substitution therapy, Roma doctors, and AIDS activists.

53
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
To his right, Edgar Truery, professor of applied physics at Princeton, where he's director of Princeton's engineering physics program.

54
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He's director and chief scientist of Princeton's electric propulsion and plasma dynamic laboratory, where he's been working for more than two decades under NASA Fan Funding on developing advanced plasma rockets to propel human piloted systems to moon, Mars, and beyond.

55
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So if there are any volunteers, we'll be taking your names later.

56
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He also heads Princeton's 3D audio and applied acoustics laboratory, where he has developed new virtual reality audio techniques for reproducing music in 3D.

57
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He has the research, his honors, and awards, and was the subject of a recent profile by Adam Gopnik in The New Yorker.

58
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Edgar participated in the January, he looks at a roundtable on music and embodied cognition, and in last November's Synchronicity and Other Mind Matters.

59
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So I thought just to prompt the conversation with an inter-rockative reading of the book's title, not a question about why the title Curiosity, but the recursive question, why Curiosity?

60
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Maybe I should start because of the title of the book.

61
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Curiosity drove me to Curiosity.

62
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I have always been conscious that questions interest me much more than answers, and I think that my fondness from fiction comes from the fact that fiction, poetry, ask questions, and is not interested, or partly interested in the answers,

63
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
because answers have a tendency to become dogma.

64
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They belong to catechisms, why questions lead to other questions, put our thoughts into words, and continue to open doors.

65
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So that is the reason for the book. However, because I have always felt that as a reader, I find my guides in literature.

66
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I decided before attempting this quest to be guided by another writer, poet, character in his own fiction, and I chose Dante.

67
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I know it was presumptuous of me, but I thought since Dante had no qualms in choosing Virgil and St. Bernard and Beatrice as his guides, he would understand my need for a leader companion in the world of these questions.

68
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So the questions, I try to find them in the community, and because you can find everything in the community, you can find these questions, whatever they are, and then take them into different realms, whether it's the question of why we divide our

69
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:11,000
six qualities into two, and look onto Olamp de Guz in the French Revolution, a character who is one of the marvelous secret characters of our histories, the woman who looks at the declaration of the right of man and says, what about the declaration of the right of woman,

70
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and is, of course, beheaded for that. Marguerite Atwood said at one point that men are afraid that women will leave them, and women are afraid that men will kill them.

71
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So these are parts of the realms that my questions took me to.

72
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I want to amend to kill them a lot.

73
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Did you read the UN report this week that 43% of the women in the world have been hurt by a man physically or sexually hurt by a man? I just have to look at everybody, because this is, I've never been here before. Can you hear me?

74
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Let me try. I have the hair. Can you hear me now? No? Oh, get it higher, maybe. Can you hear me now? No. Can you hear me now?

75
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Can you hear me? Yes. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes. Good.

76
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's quite a splash. I've just never been here before, so I just want to look at you. It's strange to have people behind me. So hi everybody behind me.

77
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I just had to say that about men and women. Marguerite Atwood's right. I just want to introduce myself and say, I feel a little daunted being here. I'm just a poet.

78
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And poets don't know anything. I want to make that perfectly clear.

79
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Round two was just a poet. Yes, I know. That's right. Perfect starting place for curiosity.

80
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I am. So because I don't know anything, everything is worth a question. Rilka said a great thing about, we feel so, we don't feel at home in this world really, us humans.

81
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We're so uncomfortable. We have so much anxiety and fear. But yet he suggested we're set down in this world as exactly the place for us to be.

82
00:13:43,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And part of what we, our job, our nature is to feel our way around as a prisoner does in a darkened cell, you know, to try to understand the world we live in, to find out who we are, where we come from, where we going.

83
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Like these essential questions. Who are we, where did we come from, where are we going? You know, talking to Edgar, where are we going, the moon for a weekend, right?

84
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But really, who are we and what is our relationship to the rest of nature and to the soul and to beauty and to truth and to whatever you might think of as God.

85
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:35,000
These have always been the questions of poetry as you point out.

86
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I have thoughts about sort of, so what's the urge, right? There is an urge that Marie just talked about to, well, whether you're in a cell or, you know, take a dog on a car trip, right?

87
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You open up the door, the cars, the dogs never been there before and what does he or she do? Run out and start sniffing around.

88
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So there is, you know, Yacht Panksup, who's been here, has a whole neuroscientific theory about the seeking system, capital, S-E-E-K-I-N-G.

89
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's very, very particular that they've capitalized. But that said, this urge, which we see in infants and, you know, the great exploring babies, you know, it starts just on your face and then as they become mobile, they move around the world.

90
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:47,000
There's something profound about this movement outward that is not only about getting food or getting comfort, but seems to be about finding things out there.

91
00:15:47,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If we extrapolate, I think you can probably take this urge, a drive, if you will, can be Freudian, a drive and take it all the way up to the most abstract intellectual questions that concern us.

92
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I think he's careful to make a distinction between that seeking system and goal-oriented endeavors. It's sort of akin to a kind of Emersonian journey, not destination.

93
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Which is very much your book too. That's what art is. I mean, art is a goalless journey. If you have a goal, there's no, you can always give it up.

94
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:43,000
If you know what you're going to do, I do it. Many of my students say what I was trying to say was when they're trying to write a poem. And I'll suggest that they just give that up right away.

95
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I was thinking as much as we were asked not to prepare for this, just having that word curiosity as the frame for my life over the last few weeks since I had the invitation.

96
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I've been dreaming about it, I've been thinking about it, I've been noticing curiosity in my life and what's the place of it.

97
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And I think that curiosity has been, it's been a way of life. It's been a necessity for me. Given the life that I've had, there've been choices to go into darkness and habitual stories or to choose curiosity.

98
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And I've come to think of it as a place that we can go. And as a psychiatrist, I've been thinking of late that what a lot of people struggle with, who I consult with, is the loss of curiosity.

99
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
People know the way that it is, and often the way that it is is dark, it's hopeless, there's no way out.

100
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So what I've seen my role as of late in the last few weeks, it's a new way of seeing myself, and I have a new way of seeing myself every few weeks.

101
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's been a good one. But this is the way that I guide people to the place of curiosity with me.

102
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So can I lead people to that place? And the way that I do that is through how I listen.

103
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So it's very clear to me that we listen to one another, shape each other. And so I'm very curious about the role of listening and the effect of listening on one another.

104
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,000
As I listen to you, I first realized that I did not get the email but not preparing.

105
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So as a token research scientist, I felt that I have a duty to find out what research has done on curiosity from a scientific point of view.

106
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And let me first start by saying I have zero credentials in this field. I'm a physical scientist.

107
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But I learned, and I was going to report to you what I learned, and I'll be able to tell you in some way, that there are newer scientists who studies curiosity from a mechanistic level.

108
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:06,000
At lunch, we were talking about the problems of doing so on, and challenges, and how few to it is to describe these complex phenomena mechanistic.

109
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Nonetheless, they point out to a specific release of dopamine in the brain, some areas of the brain, as you were talking, SEK, particular novel information.

110
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And it's actually pleasure. It might not be as you said, what did you say? It's not goal oriented, but it's pleasure oriented.

111
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And the word pleasure, yes, it's actually a use the word pleasure. And it turns out the word pleasure, and that's what I'm going to argue that, and the word novelty come out a lot, both from the scientific research, ironically, but also in many discussions of curiosity.

112
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:56,000
To illustrate what I mean by novelty and pleasure, first novelty, imagine we live in a world where there are no seasons.

113
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So there are continuous spring, you pick whatever your favorite season is, this fall.

114
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And then suddenly, we all experience seasons for the first time, we see winter, snow, and suddenly everybody is talking about.

115
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And then everybody wants to know what is the reason for the seasons. And some scientists will figure it out, by the way, it's a very, very simple reason.

116
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And taxi cab drivers can explain to you what the seasons are. However, today, speaking of lack of curiosity, I do not want to put anybody on this part, but I can't tell you, as a professor, if I give all of you here, and I'm sure there are many wonderful, everybody's wonderfully educated,

117
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:45,000
you'll be surprised how many people among any collection of highly educated people can explain how the seasons are, why there's a winter.

118
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So there's complete lack of curiosity about daylight and light, we don't know, most of us do not know why there's winter.

119
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:04,000
In the morning, we open the fridge, we pick up something, close the fridge, I guarantee you 99% of highly educated people have no idea how the fridge works.

120
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Now, if you face them with lack of curiosity, they'll claim always too complicated, but I guarantee you that anybody can teach you how the fridge works in exactly two minutes.

121
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And if you put alcohol on your hand and evaporates, if you score. However, we go about life, opening the fridge, closing it, millions times, and I will have no idea how it works.

122
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
However, for the first time you wake up in the morning and see your fridge and your house, open it, you might be curious about it, you might go chat.

123
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So the fact that novelty somehow plays a big role. The second thing is pleasure, apparently pleasure is tremendous, and I try to find people quotes, and almost every quote I could find refers to pleasure.

124
00:21:47,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And before I close, I'm going to read you the opening passage of Albertus' book, which hints directly at pleasure and novelty in experiencing curiosity.

125
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So Albertus starts his book with this little story. One day, when I was eight or nine in Buenos Aires, I lost my way coming from class.

126
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The school was one of many that I attended in my childhood and stood a short distance from our house in the tree line neighborhood of Belgrano.

127
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm skipping a few lines. After a few blocks, I realized I didn't know the way.

128
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I was too ashamed to ask for directions, so I wondered, more astonished than frightened.

129
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
For what's wrong with me, it's a very long time.

130
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I don't know why I did what I did, except that I wanted to experience something new, so I'm glad the word new.

131
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:54,000
To follow whatever clues I might find to mysteries not yet apparent, as in the Sherlock Holmes stories, which I had just discovered.

132
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Quote, the world is full of obvious things, which nobody by any chance ever observes. Said the master.

133
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I remember becoming aware with the feeling of pleasurable anxiety that I was engaging in, an adventure, different from the one on my shelves.

134
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And yet I experienced something of the same suspense, the same intense desire to find out what laid ahead, without being able, without wanting to

135
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:34,000
tell what might take place. But nothing happened. At long last, I turned the corner and found myself on familiar ground.

136
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
When I finally saw my house, it felt like a disappointment.

137
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So the moral of the story is somehow pleasure and novelty come.

138
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So I want to go back to the question to you. You mentioned that poetry and fiction do not necessarily answer a question, but they do the right with curiosity.

139
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I come from a book that we do try to answer questions, and, um, and, um, and, um, and, um, it could possibly play a big role.

140
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And I'm fascinated about the, uh, the role of curiosity in each.

141
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Somehow it's common, but this practice is quite different.

142
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yes, I, but I wasn't fair to, to essays because you can find, of course, in any kind of writing, uh, the questions that are so exciting.

143
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Um, the, when you, when you mentioned novelty, um, I distrust novelty because it's, it's seductive in the moment that it appears.

144
00:24:44,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And then immediately loses its seduction. There is a wonderful novel by Thomas Love Pico Crochet Castle, where, um, the owner of a mansion is showing the grounds to a friend.

145
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And he's very proud that, um, when you turn a corner, he's recognized by a folly that he has constructed there.

146
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And he says to his friend, this is what I call the element of surprise.

147
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And his friend says, and what do you call that element the second time that you've worked with?

148
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.

149
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Um, curiosity, as Robert was saying, I think is, is in, in every area, a much younger impulse.

150
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Um, as Siri mentioned, this, uh, this drive, this, this need, I think it has to do with our consciousness of being alive in the world.

151
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Um, English is a very rich language, except when it comes to the verb to be. In, in, in Spanish or in Italian, you, you, you have the difference between to exist and, and, and to be in a certain place, Siri, so, so, the Hamlet's question doesn't hold.

152
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You have to, you have to choose.

153
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Um, the fact that we know that we exist, I think leads to the question of, um, where we are, the second part of the verb to be.

154
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Um, and then reflects back on the question of who we are, and where we are and who we are, um, appear, um, as in a corridor of questioning mirrors.

155
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Um, you never come to a real answer, but, uh, you progress in the quality of the questioning.

156
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Maybe the difference between physics, I mean, we were talking about this at lunch, that you really can in physics arrive at a kind of conclusion, which then is carried along in theoretical physics, you know, as it, as it develops.

157
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But at the same time, there is no theory of everything. Yeah, right? So there are nevertheless holes in the pattern.

158
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And, uh, you know, listen, I'm not a physicist, I'm just looking from the outside.

159
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The difference, I think, in the arts is that, um, you never get there.

160
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I mean, Dante gets there, of course, in the comedian. Um, and you talk about that.

161
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's the end of language.

162
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:15,000
That's the end of language. Um, but it, it, this question, which ties together, I think, uh, uh, from a psychiatric point of view, and maybe even a mammalian point of view, why is it that some people are so much more curious than others?

163
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What is this actually about? I am endlessly curious, and I am never bored. But when I was, um, a volunteer writing teacher in a psychiatric hospital, pain Whitney, right here, for four years, it wasn't the psychotic patients.

164
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And I had some really psychotic patients who were hard to work with, was the depressed patients. People with clinical depression are profoundly uncurious.

165
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And the big effort was to instill some curiosity about what's going on. And listen, I don't have the answer to this question, as usual, but it opens up a way to start thinking about, what are we dealing with here?

166
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:27,000
This, you know, yeah, we talked about this at lunch, you know, one aspect is fear, and courage. Well, I was struck by your story as the boy, because it's been terrified to be lost.

167
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Um, and there's reasons for that.

168
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:49,000
For girls to be lost. Um, but also I was just a frightened child, you know, but to, to, to, I've noticed at least in my writing students that would keep them from being curious about what they've just written, for example, is often fear.

169
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
But they think there's nothing else. Like they got that line out, and that's good enough, and they can't question it or wonder about it or wonder about the next thing.

170
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It limits, it limits all of us when we're afraid, more anxious.

171
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Or fear can also drive your curiosity.

172
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
How so?

173
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Well, in Bluebeard, it's the fear that drives the bride to open that door.

174
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Um, it's a different curiosity from Little Red Riding Hood, who, who goes off the path because he wants to pick the flowers.

175
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:41,000
But, but in many of the stories, it is fear that drives the curiosity of finding what has been forbidden.

176
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And so you, you go beyond the edge of the world, like Ulysses, uh, to experience that which has been forbidden with fear, of course.

177
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Yeah, well, then the nature of narrative suspense is, of course, to be in a band.

178
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And this drives curiosity, very simply, a detective novel.

179
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah.

180
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Right? You're, you're hanging, and you want to get there to the end.

181
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, but as a questioner, it's not fear that drives me, necessarily.

182
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
No.

183
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I mean, and I'm thinking now about what you were saying about listening.

184
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah.

185
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And what, how does that help someone, for example, in a depressed state become less afraid or less shut in?

186
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You know, how does it?

187
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Well, I think, I, I agree with you.

188
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Depression is one of the hardest states to be with with another person.

189
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And for me, it's where the communal view of human beings has to come in.

190
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So if you have no hope and you are shut down, can I have hope for you?

191
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yeah.

192
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And can I be curious for you until you're able to have it again?

193
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And can I sit and just be with you?

194
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And it's, it's an ongoing practice to just, to be able to do that.

195
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You know, I'm just, I kind of thinking of last year, I, I put myself through an experience because I became a person.

196
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Because I became aware of how afraid I am.

197
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And actually, you'd have to say was, because I'm less afraid since the experience.

198
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And I decided to confront my deepest fear.

199
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It wasn't pleasurable.

200
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
There was no, but there must be in it.

201
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Some people are not looking forward to it.

202
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I was terrified.

203
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I was to go and spend several nights alone in a canyon in Utah.

204
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
With no food, just water.

205
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
For me, this was an unthinkable thing to do.

206
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I have trouble staying alone at night in a house with, I grew up in South Africa.

207
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
A lot of fear.

208
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But I did it and I went with a particular group of people that organize these things and you go in a group and then you go off on your own.

209
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And you recreate what Native Americans call division quest.

210
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Oh yeah.

211
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But you sit in one place and it was four days.

212
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And I was all very well curious, enjoying myself until the very first night when suddenly alone the sun was setting.

213
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And I faced that terror.

214
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And I watched the mind.

215
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I watched my mind.

216
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And I wasn't curious in that moment.

217
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I wanted to get the hell out of there and just run home.

218
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
But I couldn't have hiked up a river to get there.

219
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Where was everybody else?

220
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
They had all gone off on their own.

221
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It was a huge canyon.

222
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I was like...

223
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Where did somebody else?

224
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
No, there was no one around.

225
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That was the point.

226
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I was alone.

227
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And I was lost.

228
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So because there was nowhere to be other than where you were.

229
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Did they come and pick you up then at the end?

230
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
No.

231
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Once a day you would leave a stone on a pile.

232
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You'd go and walk to a pile, leave a stone.

233
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
A stone pile with a buddy.

234
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
He was at least 10 or 15 minutes away from you.

235
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh my god, it's like Hansel and Gretel.

236
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You see there your mind is going.

237
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You're going to get eaten.

238
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
All these things.

239
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
But what I saw was...

240
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I befriended fear.

241
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I actually was able...

242
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I talked out loud and I asked fear to join me.

243
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I actually asked invite...

244
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Realized that what I was really afraid of was death.

245
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
That ultimately I was afraid of dying.

246
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I saw psychotic killers coming to kill me.

247
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Lions, bears, whatever.

248
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And I eventually just said death.

249
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Come and sit with me.

250
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Just let's sit together.

251
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm sick of being stalked by you.

252
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Join me.

253
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And it helped.

254
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And by the third day, by the third night I lay outside.

255
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I watched the sun set.

256
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I watched the moon rise.

257
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I watched the stars.

258
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Something had shifted for me.

259
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
In my relationship with everyone.

260
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And that was curious.

261
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
They're now I'm curious about the experience.

262
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I have a funny question but it's quite...

263
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Could you read?

264
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah.

265
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You are not allowed to bring books.

266
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You're just...

267
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You could write.

268
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You could write.

269
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And I filled the journal.

270
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But no reading.

271
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You wrote the...

272
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You are allowed to bring a book.

273
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You can write.

274
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But no reading.

275
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And I recited.

276
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I learned poems of Baphark before I went.

277
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So that I could recite them and I never got to it.

278
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
No food.

279
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
What did you do for eating?

280
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Water.

281
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
That's it.

282
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh my God.

283
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You can pick some berries.

284
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
No.

285
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Well, I won't go into it in too much detail.

286
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But I actually was so panicked about the no food that I cheated and brought food.

287
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Oh yeah.

288
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
With me and made up a whole reason why I needed to have food.

289
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And I had it.

290
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
But I kept it in a tree.

291
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And it ended up...

292
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
How honorable.

293
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But to go back to fear, seems to me fear gets a bad rap, but fear is central to many of these

294
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
mechanisms.

295
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Under different names.

296
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
My fear has a lot of bad connotations.

297
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But the instant of survival, which goes back to the dogs that you'd mentioned in the series,

298
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
when they entered that room, I lived with a cat.

299
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And whenever I brought an object to the house, I'm sure you put a little bag.

300
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
She would come in.

301
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
She would come in.

302
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Oh sorry.

303
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
She would come in in the room and directly go to that bag for a few seconds.

304
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Sniff it.

305
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Sniff it and test.

306
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And within a few seconds she would lose her curiosity.

307
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And after reading...

308
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Sorry.

309
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's better.

310
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
All right.

311
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So basically, just to summarize what I was saying, I'm trying to argue that does play

312
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
a central role, maybe not under the name, fear exactly, but the instant of survival, which

313
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
is also linked to pleasure.

314
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
The dogs that Siri mentioned that sniff right away when they enter the room, the cat I

315
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
lived with, would do the same thing when I brought a new object.

316
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It could be a bag of mysterious bag or even something inanimate.

317
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
She would come right away and notice there was something new, which is a novelty part.

318
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Go smell it.

319
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Sniff it.

320
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Check it out.

321
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Lots of them.

322
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Kids do that, by the way.

323
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
They lose curiosity.

324
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And there will be some kind of mechanism which some newer scientists attribute to some release

325
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
of, you know, chemical, dopaminos, whatever.

326
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And there's a sense of satisfaction that you obtained that new information that you

327
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
seeked.

328
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But it's somewhat related to the fear of dying.

329
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
This is a mechanism of defense.

330
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So it seems to be the pleasure, novelty, fear of dying, or somewhat in curiosity or somewhat

331
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
related.

332
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
An exchange.

333
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Like when you asked death to sit with you and your cat gets to know the thing that it

334
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,000
fears and becomes then acquainted with it, no longer fears it.

335
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And I think that it's a pact that perhaps we make with the thing we fear in all of the

336
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
fear in order to say, well, now show your face.

337
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:22,320
There's a wonderful poem by Louise Bogan about her confronting a fierce white horse that

338
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
arrives.

339
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,680
And she feels the fear that it's going to hurt her.

340
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:34,400
And a voice says, give it something to love.

341
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:44,000
And then out of the fear, she gives it a glove and the horse lies down and puts its

342
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,960
head on her lap.

343
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,320
It doesn't answer the question of what the horse is or why does she fear it.

344
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:01,960
But it allows for a relationship with the thing you fear in order to engage in a dialogue

345
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,080
that allows you to lead to a question.

346
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:12,360
This seems very crucial now in our country given the circumstances that are arising from

347
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,080
racial conflict.

348
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,320
And I was so impressed with your story.

349
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,600
I'm just so moved by your story.

350
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,480
I grew up within a violent house and so I have a lot of fears.

351
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:33,560
Many of them have gone away but we were talking about how psychoanalysis helps you to change

352
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:40,800
your story and how much fear freezes a story so that the story cannot change.

353
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,720
The story cannot change.

354
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,360
So one of the things I'm afraid of is the subway because it's a locked room with people

355
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,440
I don't know in it and so I'm afraid of violence in it.

356
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,480
But today I took the subway because I'm trying to get over this fear.

357
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:07,240
And I became curious, well what happened was I confronted the frozen story and then was

358
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:13,400
surprised by it and I'm embarrassed to tell the story so I'll tell it.

359
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,400
So I got on the subway.

360
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,720
I tried to get on an empty-ish car so I won't feel so claustrophobic.

361
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,960
And there was a big, very big man with dark skin.

362
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,400
I saw it and I'm like, oh he's scary.

363
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,000
But then somehow because my natural white person racism came right up, you know, big

364
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,600
black guy, he's scary.

365
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,080
I'm admitting this.

366
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:44,040
I get on the car and I see that the man has a sleeping child in his arms, right?

367
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,040
Story changes.

368
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,040
Not so scary.

369
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,040
Not so scary.

370
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,800
Sleeping child in his arms.

371
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,320
Beautiful face, right?

372
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,480
The person I first saw was never there.

373
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
There's that man.

374
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,000
Then a woman gets on and she says, I'm homeless, I need money.

375
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,120
Everybody bows their heads.

376
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:09,280
And I see another person of color in a hood, you know, the famous hood.

377
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,320
And I take out some money and I walk over to her and he's also taking out money to give

378
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
her money.

379
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,360
So there's two surprises, right?

380
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,240
I'm thinking of all the people on this car, certainly this guy is not going to give her

381
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,840
money and he does.

382
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,560
And the guy who looked like he was never going to speak to her ended up speaking to

383
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,560
her.

384
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:36,080
What I'm trying to say is I realized in that five minute ride, all the stories I carry

385
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:46,240
that are not true, that, that, right, any instant and freeze me and freeze the world,

386
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,280
you know, the world goes dead.

387
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:54,000
And then all of a sudden when I got on the darn car, the world became animate and alive

388
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,520
and surprising.

389
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,920
And everybody acted completely differently, including myself from what I imagined.

390
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:07,520
But I think this is really interesting because it's possible then to start thinking about

391
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:15,640
curiosity as a dynamic process that facilitates movement of all kinds.

392
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,440
I mean, the cat and then, you know, once this is mastered.

393
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,560
I mean, there's also an aspect of curiosity that has to do with mastery and then withdraw

394
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:33,680
and returning to another, as you said, always the next question is generated, at least in

395
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,680
my case.

396
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,960
But there is something about mastery too.

397
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:47,840
We can formulate a test like a called CQ, curiosity quotient, like an IQ where you can

398
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,840
rank people.

399
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Yeah, that was great.

400
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,320
You were mentioning that I have a very rough version of it, which I did at lunch today.

401
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,760
When people know that I work on space travel, I give them this test and I tell them, will

402
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:07,000
you, if you go to spend a week on the moon, if it can be done in a weekend or a week?

403
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,840
Because we can see people really worry about their cats at home.

404
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,520
But I have a wonderful answer today from Mary.

405
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,000
She said, yes, if there's enough, is it an axis?

406
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,320
It's right.

407
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,280
Just to apply.

408
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Just to apply.

409
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
That's right.

410
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:32,960
Yeah, but why do people, not only why are we often terb you not curious?

411
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,200
Why do we open that fridge and close it and not bother to just Google how do things work

412
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,040
or ask them about life.

413
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,560
How can we go about life?

414
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,480
Experiencing daylight and not only I'm talking about material things or things in general,

415
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
but ideas and not question them.

416
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,840
But it's interesting because sometimes ideas can limit curiosity.

417
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:58,440
So one of the things that I see as a therapist, and I was trained as a psychiatrist and when

418
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,920
I was doing my training, it was Freudian analytic teaching.

419
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,560
Halfway through my residency, I remember distinctly the professor of psychiatry standing up and

420
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:15,200
giving a lecture to the whole program saying, that's no longer true.

421
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,520
Biological model.

422
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,120
It became biological overnight.

423
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:26,000
And then I discovered narrative therapy, which is another completely different view of how

424
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,800
the human being works.

425
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,240
And what I find is that if I'm really curious about the person sitting in front of me, those

426
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,280
theories get in the way.

427
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,520
And psychiatric diagnosis can really get in the way because it's very limiting.

428
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,320
It's a whole narrative on its own.

429
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:49,960
So if you sit and make a diagnosis of someone has depression, what you go along with is all

430
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,240
the things we're saying about people with depression, but that doesn't give room for

431
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,000
those outlying moments that are not necessarily characteristic.

432
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh, absolutely.

433
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:07,120
And in fact, one of the reasons to read medical history is simply to understand how the category

434
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,680
shift over time.

435
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:15,400
I mean, this is a wonderful way to loosen up your sensibility.

436
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,520
And I absolutely agree.

437
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:24,960
And my new theory is that there isn't a single theoretical model that can encompass any question,

438
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,240
not one.

439
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,080
And that what you have to do is take multiple theoretical models, look at the same bit

440
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,080
of business.

441
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,280
You will not get a single answer.

442
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:45,280
You will get multiple answers that will provide you with what I call focused zones of ambiguity.

443
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,800
And this may be the best we can do, but that is not so bad.

444
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,680
And so that a lot of questions, not necessarily questions in physics, but a lot of questions

445
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:07,600
involve a prismatic reality which cannot be caught from a single perspective.

446
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:16,520
Do scientists work in that way too, or do you have an idea towards which you go?

447
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:21,160
No, doubting is skepticism has a very important role in scientific discovery.

448
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,920
First I want to tell you that one of my heroes will agree 100% with you about the danger

449
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,360
of formalism to the curiosity.

450
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,720
Albert Einstein once said, it's a miracle that curiosity can survive formal education.

451
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,600
Which is remarkable.

452
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:45,080
And yes, but in general in scientific, doubting is very important.

453
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,320
We teach to be skeptic.

454
00:46:48,320 --> 00:47:02,120
Dante, I mean, I'm going to quote in 110 quoting Dante saying that he loves knowledge, but

455
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:08,040
he puts downing just right there next to knowledge.

456
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,880
So knowing and doubting are essential part of seeking knowledge.

457
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,160
The ambiguity is part of discovery.

458
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,080
But there is something when you kill the ambiguity which happens more often in science than in

459
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,160
a poem, you transcend it, it becomes boring, I have to admit.

460
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,280
We really ever pick up a paper written in the reading.

461
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,280
He was a genius.

462
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,280
So it was Einstein.

463
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,000
Really my students pick up Einstein's paper.

464
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,520
We use his theories every day.

465
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:42,320
So there is something that can kill when, and you mentioned that you defended, well,

466
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:47,440
actually you attacked, in the notion of novelty.

467
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,120
I want to defend it a little bit by saying that novelty is essential to some extent.

468
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,360
But it gets really defined.

469
00:47:53,360 --> 00:48:01,080
I mean, if you read a boring text, it stops, it's novelty dies and it's curiosity will

470
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,080
be.

471
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,080
But you can.

472
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,440
It's not necessarily, it might become deeper.

473
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,400
Just not about the superficial surprise.

474
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,880
I said a boring text.

475
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,000
But if you read the Divine Comedy, it can spend your lifetime really discovering it.

476
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,320
And therefore the novelty is always there.

477
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,320
Yes.

478
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,320
Yes, absolutely.

479
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,160
It's new every time I read it.

480
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,000
I think there's a little bit of a language problem because the novelty idea, I mean,

481
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,560
there are people now who are talking about the brain as a predictive organ that basically

482
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:40,000
uses expectation, patterns of expectation established in the past, and that we often

483
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,880
see the world through those expectations.

484
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:51,960
And it's only novelty that jars us into seeing well, new in a way.

485
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:59,440
And if you were talking about our prejudices and typecasting arise from those predictable

486
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:09,520
patterns of expectation and not failing at times to recognize the novel, the thing that

487
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,480
pops out and is different.

488
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:17,000
And when that novelty pops out, we have to investigate it.

489
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,600
Or we're very depressed and we don't want to go over and sniff the thing, right?

490
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,200
The new object.

491
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:29,680
But yeah, I think there's a way to look at novelty as, you know, you're looking at it,

492
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,240
the word from this, a very literary position, which I appreciate, and you're looking at

493
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,400
it from a more scientific perspective.

494
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:52,560
I would tell you that the idea of novelty, either in science or in art, let's take those

495
00:49:52,560 --> 00:50:06,680
two traditional fields, seems to me misleading because I have the suspicion that whatever

496
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:13,760
is new is never really new because if it were completely new, we wouldn't see it, we wouldn't

497
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,760
recognize it.

498
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,880
It would be unrecognizable.

499
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,880
That's right.

500
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,200
So the idea of novelty, I like this.

501
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,440
A relative novelty.

502
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:30,240
I mean, I think the curiosity as the final dictionary is something to extend seeking the

503
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,640
urge to seek new information, seek new information.

504
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,160
I'm not saying this is a great definition.

505
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:42,920
But there's always, even in these mechanistic, newer scientific models of curiosity, there

506
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:48,600
are always an emphasis on the fact that there's some kind of first encounter with an object.

507
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:53,440
So in other words, boredom, which is something I want to inject in the conversation here,

508
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,960
seems to be a place in the opposite world.

509
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,840
We get bored, we become less curious about something.

510
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,840
So what happens?

511
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:08,120
And the must be related, if boredom kills our wanting to seek.

512
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:13,040
I understand the word.

513
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:23,440
The field that includes boredom, depression, melancholy can be also very creative because

514
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:32,760
if traditionally you look at the discussions on melancholy as a state in which the artist

515
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:39,240
creates, it's a curiosity driven inwards.

516
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:47,160
So you are not looking to ask questions about the new, but you are driven to ask questions

517
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:55,760
about the old because that will always continue to feed your own in a different state.

518
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:08,120
Well, the question is, and I don't know whether people who suffer of depression are cut off

519
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:18,120
any communication or just towards the outside world, do they continue to ask questions or

520
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,880
is the dialogue with the world interrupted?

521
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,200
Well, I'm sure we could answer that, there's enough people in this room who have experienced

522
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,200
depression, right?

523
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,800
But I don't know if we could answer it as one unified answer.

524
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,880
So I think that the whole thing is that when we start saying people who are depressed or

525
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,880
anything, that becomes a dominant narrative.

526
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,800
And then people feel often actually feel obliged to stick to the narrative.

527
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,000
Like your man in the hoodie.

528
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,760
Yeah, what is someone who is depressed?

529
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,480
The number of us that raise our hands and every one of those experiences would have

530
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,680
been different.

531
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:04,400
But what I want to interject into this conversation is the word imagination.

532
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,400
I keep thinking of Blake.

533
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,880
What is now proved was once only imagined.

534
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:18,720
But the imagination is, isn't this, you know, God, whatever.

535
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,360
What part does the imagination play in curiosity?

536
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,920
What is the reality of imagination in scientific work?

537
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:36,800
It was a center, but in the mechanism, in the drive behind the curious, it cannot play

538
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:45,560
if the cat who is storing that bag or that new object might not be indulging a lot of

539
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:51,480
imagination, imagining a threat, which is not really a very deep imaginative thing.

540
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:57,360
So to some level of curiosity in my mind is a place of different role than imagination.

541
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,440
But in scientific inquiry, they're both essential and they could be related.

542
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,640
I think they're related in the sense that what is the imagination, right?

543
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,880
I mean, what is the point of it?

544
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:14,560
It's probably to project oneself into the future, right?

545
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:21,760
And that this is probably deeply related to curiosity and asking the next question.

546
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:28,920
Because if you're unable to project yourself into another place, so there's a certain dynamic

547
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:36,600
relationship, if you will, between curiosity and the imagination, because it is a road,

548
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,320
a trip, a voyage.

549
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:43,720
You rather use the word quest on another panel, which I find so useful.

550
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:51,360
This traveling towards something, you may not know what you want to find, but in the traveling,

551
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,880
you continue to be curious.

552
00:54:53,880 --> 00:55:00,000
And it's probably deeply related to the construction of narratives, right?

553
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,200
That these patterns become organized and then projected.

554
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,800
And that's, you know, you can't have imagination if you don't have memory.

555
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:18,720
And also in the neuroscience on curiosity, it seems one little interesting tidbit is

556
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,480
that the hippocampus is activated.

557
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,480
And that the state of curiosity, and this is probably dopamine, is involved as well,

558
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:36,120
kind of a, you know, a high thing, that it seems to consolidate the memory of the thing

559
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,080
you found out.

560
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,360
And for readers, this is terribly interesting to me.

561
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,720
I forget a lot of things.

562
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,360
I have a tendency not to forget what I read.

563
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,360
I don't know how I remember it.

564
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:53,600
I think I remember it because I'm so damned interested and it sticks.

565
00:55:53,600 --> 00:56:00,680
But don't you find you remember what you read, you edit it in your mind, you extend it,

566
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,680
you improve it, you know.

567
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,800
I don't remember word for word.

568
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:10,880
No, but what I mean is more than word for word, it's changing your memory and swearing

569
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,440
that Madame Bovari didn't commit.

570
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,720
Maybe not quite that dramatic, but definitely in that realm.

571
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,720
Yes, I have misremembered books.

572
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,800
The theory is why we remember what, when do we remember things very well?

573
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,160
It's a very important, new scientific question.

574
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,600
It is related to fear and dopamine creation.

575
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:39,600
And also what we explain is during creativity, apparently, people have shown that, well,

576
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,040
there's never 100% consensus.

577
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,400
But for a while, the theories of learning were based on enhancing dopamine creation.

578
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,280
For example, as a professor at Brown, who was teaching French, and I saw him one time

579
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,720
in the little film, he had six students in his office.

580
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:00,920
He wanted to go over the vocabulary he had last week and he said, okay, let's go over

581
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,800
what is the word for egg in French?

582
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:10,840
He asked one student and he took an egg from his pocket and he said, it's ef and broke

583
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,480
it on the head of the student.

584
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,480
And had eggs.

585
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,080
Now, you can bet for the rest of the life of the student, you will never forget us.

586
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,600
And the question is why.

587
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:25,080
And apparently, when you fear and when you experience pleasure also in reading can be

588
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:29,720
a tremendous amount of, there is a release of some, according to some neuroscientist,

589
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:35,520
these highlight, you know, substances that will give you a high, entrench things in your

590
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,520
memory.

591
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:41,320
I wonder how he taught a better.

592
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,320
Just as.

593
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,320
Or worse.

594
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,320
Or heavier.

595
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,320
Done.

596
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,560
But can you, can you, I want to ask you something about what you just said, Siri, because we

597
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:57,400
were talking about earlier about composition and how the best times writing are when something

598
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,160
is writing through you.

599
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,800
That there's not, there's that strange, people are nodding, you know, there's that, that

600
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,520
strange, exhilaration of, at all.

601
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,520
Right.

602
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,520
But being there enough to write down what something else wants to say.

603
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,520
Yeah.

604
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,960
I mean, you know, it's the experience of taking dictation.

605
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,960
Yeah.

606
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,080
The old, old notion.

607
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,000
And it's something Dante used it.

608
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,800
And there, and Blake.

609
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,600
And that, yeah, Blake, absolutely.

610
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:34,760
I think these are, you know, I think there is actually some kind of mechanistic way of

611
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,760
thinking about this.

612
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:44,240
I think these have to do with very old bodily and emotional patterns that are established

613
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,920
pre-linguistically.

614
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:53,800
And of course, they are resting on one's ability to write and all the experience one

615
00:58:53,800 --> 00:59:00,400
has had writing and all the other writers that have been feeding you for years and years

616
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:11,000
and years, but that in a state of relaxation and openness, these patterns repeat themselves.

617
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,400
It's a very rhythmic experience.

618
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,200
It's physically rhythmic.

619
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Yes.

620
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,040
And I, and it's dialogical.

621
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:23,160
And I think it's rooted in our very early relations with the other, you know.

622
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:29,600
Well, what you just, excuse me, just what you said a minute ago was, when you write, when

623
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:36,920
you arrive, let's say, when you find such sentences coming out of you or lines or whatever, you

624
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:44,200
refer to, you said, then some other animal part of yourself or old part of yourself recognizes

625
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,200
it.

626
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,200
You said?

627
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,280
I think, you know, I've said this a number of times about, for me, writing fiction is

628
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,200
about, not literal truths.

629
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:59,640
And when you hit it, you know, when you see it on the page, it's answered by something

630
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,920
inside you that's very old.

631
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,440
It's a gut feeling.

632
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:10,800
Now I have to use my Einstein quote because when Jacques Hadaba asked Einstein how he

633
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:18,080
worked, he answered, this is not a direct quote, he answered in a very beautiful way.

634
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:28,960
He said, none of my work has anything to do with signs, either mathematical or linguistic.

635
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:36,240
My work is visual, muscular and emotional.

636
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,240
Yeah.

637
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,040
Many physicists think it's beautiful.

638
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,560
Yeah, very much so.

639
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:48,320
And Neil's board, you know, when he was coming on his atoms, had a very Dickensian image

640
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:52,040
of plum puddings with bouncing raisins.

641
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:57,520
I'm not going to teach quantum mechanics today of the atom.

642
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:04,760
We start by board's model because it's completely visual and leads you to the right place eventually.

643
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:10,000
But that brings me to, I proposed a while ago to start, see if we can formulate the QC.

644
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,840
And see curiosity quotient.

645
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,840
Curiosity quotient.

646
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,840
Curiosity quotient.

647
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,480
Basically, how do you accuse people?

648
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:24,600
But I want to propose now if you can come up with a scale where we can rank activities

649
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:29,240
that we do on which of them is more conducive to curiosity.

650
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:36,440
Now we can all agree that drinking glass of water ranks low on that curiosity scale.

651
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,440
CS, to some extent.

652
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,800
Every example you will give will come with.

653
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:47,080
But one of the puzzles me the most is I want to bring it up because we have an expert here

654
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,080
on it.

655
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:53,600
It's the one of reading and Albert made a career of saying wonderful things about reading.

656
01:01:53,600 --> 01:02:03,280
So you quote in this book that the entire comedy can be seen as the quest of one man's

657
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,400
curiosity, which is Dante's.

658
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,400
That's fine.

659
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,400
I see that perfect is incredible.

660
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,520
That's true and clear.

661
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,280
But what about reading?

662
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:20,880
I'm talking about reading purely fiction, which is a pleasure, number one.

663
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:28,080
It doesn't require on the surface an act of curiosity except submitting to the act of

664
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,560
curiosity of the author.

665
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,560
How come?

666
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,560
I wouldn't agree.

667
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,120
Actually, I want you to say that.

668
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:45,880
I'm needing you to say that so I'm taking reading which is the least, which reading fiction,

669
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:50,200
not reading a book on nonfiction, which by definition you're curious about a topic.

670
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:57,160
But if you pick a book that's purely novel and read it, to what extent you are curious,

671
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,640
why would you rank this activity as high on the CS?

672
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,640
Because you do.

673
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:10,440
If you start reading in a place of Lamancha whose name I don't want to remember immediately

674
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,240
you want to say why?

675
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,240
What is this place?

676
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,960
What happens there?

677
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,240
And you're constantly curious if the writing is good.

678
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,760
If you turn the page you're curious.

679
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:30,520
I'm not curious when I read Dan Brown, but I am curious when I read Cervantes and Dante.

680
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:35,600
I guess the turning of the page is a measure that you're curious about.

681
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,600
Absolutely.

682
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:43,160
I actually have another quote from a lesser writer, Mickey Spillane.

683
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:47,640
But I was there and he said, this is a person.

684
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:53,440
Nobody reads a book to get to the middle.

685
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,600
And any novelist who does not listen to that advice is lost.

686
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:06,320
But you're talking about what I'm interested in is how do you generate curiosity?

687
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,520
So you said something at the very outset of this, it really interests me.

688
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,120
You said, I don't know what boredom is.

689
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:18,640
So there's something that you know that is really important when it comes to curiosity.

690
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,960
It's a knowledge you have about how not to get bored.

691
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:28,240
And how do you generate interest as it's happening?

692
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,440
So we could be curious right now about this very moment.

693
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,800
If we're not, then we're not doing our job.

694
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,920
And so I'm really interested in how we do that.

695
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,400
And as writers, you generate curiosity for the reader.

696
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:50,480
The reader has to meet you, but you're doing something to lead them into that place, would

697
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,480
you say?

698
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,880
Well, most of us are in here, right?

699
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,520
Most of the time, we're somewhere else.

700
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:04,520
We're in the past, we're thinking about something.

701
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:10,480
So to actually actually be here is already a radical receptivity to what's actually

702
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,720
happening.

703
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:18,160
And one of the things that I try to do and I ask my students to do is just to do that

704
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,600
to practice being here.

705
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:25,440
Yeah, to actually have them write like 10 observations a week and they keep looking

706
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,240
for something you can write about.

707
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,960
One of the greatest stories, they're like, I can't do this.

708
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,520
I said, just tell me something you saw on the way here.

709
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,400
And by the way, in my office, this young woman said, I saw a puddle.

710
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,600
And I said, okay, tell me about the puddle.

711
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,360
And she said, well, there was a piece of paper in it.

712
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,760
And I said, what was on the piece of paper?

713
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,760
She said, I don't know.

714
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,760
I said, where's the puddle?

715
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,760
She said, right out there.

716
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,760
She said, go look.

717
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:54,440
She went and she looked and it was someone's term paper on the meaning of life.

718
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,720
I'm floating in the puddle.

719
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:07,160
No, but this is actually, this brings us though to, I think it brings us to phenomenology.

720
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:16,320
And I once wrote an essay on Miranda, the Italian artist, who it's really, I mean, I

721
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:22,000
went to review a show in Venice and it was beautiful late Miranda.

722
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,840
And while I was there, there was a couple, an American couple walking around and they

723
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:34,320
were on either side and the man yelled over to the woman and he said, it's just more bottles.

724
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:40,400
And indeed, if you like or care about Miranda, it is a lot of bottles, you know, with a few

725
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,440
other things thrown in.

726
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:50,360
And while I was writing it however, I took the bottle of perrier that was on my hand

727
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:54,960
and I decided to do a kind of phenomenological exercise.

728
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,560
And I spent not 10 minutes maybe looking at the bottle.

729
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:03,600
And of course, the first thing to drop out is actually the word bottle.

730
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,880
That just seems to go away.

731
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:10,600
And then you start seeing how the light is hitting the bottle and that the light begins

732
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:15,160
to change if you're there for 10 minutes and there's condensation on the inside of the

733
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:18,360
bottle and it's like your puddle.

734
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:23,080
Well, Elliot said we can't bear too much reality, right?

735
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:28,040
And a lot of what I try to get my students to do is to bear reality, to actually encounter

736
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:32,760
it, to really look at the bottle now of course is absolutely gorgeous.

737
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,960
I'm looking at the bottle, we're all looking at the bottle.

738
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,640
And it's more light than bottle, you know?

739
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,440
I mean, what, how does that happen?

740
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:47,920
That to actually be wherever we are is to be receptive and curious about what's happening

741
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,480
and what's around us is...

742
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,120
I'm sorry, I'm still stuck on something.

743
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,800
You know that bottle with the paper and the puddle?

744
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,760
What was the answer?

745
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,760
What did it say?

746
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,160
She didn't go back at the interesting.

747
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,160
We stopped there.

748
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,160
We stopped there.

749
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,720
We didn't mean the answer.

750
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,320
Because questions were more interesting than answers.

751
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,920
What that paper said.

752
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:15,680
But there's so many stories like that when these kids do these so-called observations,

753
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:25,320
just in the day, that they end up seeing things and it's a great joy.

754
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:29,080
But I also loved what you were saying about that enforced boredom.

755
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:34,080
I'm like Siri, I can't imagine being bored.

756
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,080
There's just so much to...there's never enough time for everything.

757
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,840
But I also know that in my periods of most generation, I'm a very slow writer.

758
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:47,960
I've had no TV, no Netflix, no computer, no nothing.

759
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,840
I mean, everything has to be blocked out.

760
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:54,120
So there's nothing there to distract me.

761
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,640
So I'm driven in, you know, driven inward.

762
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:06,840
But you can surely do that being receptive to the questions.

763
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:12,480
Always think of Kafka working in that corridor in his house with people passing and people

764
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,480
talking and being able...

765
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,200
He was less permeable than I am.

766
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,200
I mean, I think that your permeability is...

767
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,760
Well, that has to do a lot with...

768
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:22,760
With what?

769
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,760
To finish that sentence?

770
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:31,440
Well, that has to do a lot with how you create and what you create.

771
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:39,920
And the questions you ask, the permeability of the world, of the world filtering through

772
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,040
you is obviously of the essence.

773
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:49,920
I was very struck by a poem that you wrote on the death of your brother that seemed to

774
01:09:49,920 --> 01:10:03,560
me to ask the question of the essential questions of love and death in a context that made the

775
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:15,440
reader extend those questions into areas that I had not thought about.

776
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,880
What are you just saying?

777
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,760
I'm waiting for you to say something, but you're just taking it in.

778
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,000
I'm just thinking about John.

779
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,640
My brother, actually, thank you for bringing him up.

780
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:36,720
I feel like the poems I love are poems that cannot resolve these questions, but embody

781
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,280
them.

782
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,520
And we feel that...

783
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,600
Yes, it's like that.

784
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,600
It's like that, isn't it?

785
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,920
We feel that recognition.

786
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,200
We don't feel alone.

787
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:51,160
We feel accompanied in our curiosity and in our bewilderment.

788
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,600
Emily Dickinson's like that from me.

789
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,200
There are so many great poets.

790
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,080
You feel a kin.

791
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,080
You feel with them, accompanied, I guess.

792
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:08,840
But what's fascinating is a kind of recognition that could not exist without the work of art.

793
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,360
In other words, there's lots of dull recognition in the world.

794
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:15,240
I mean, advertisements are doing this all the time.

795
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:18,160
Oh, yeah, I eat cornflakes or whatever.

796
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:27,640
But artistic recognition happens when the artist has made something that in which you

797
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:35,080
recognize yourself, but you had that recognition without that work of art.

798
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:42,080
So it's pushed you somewhere else, which also is a generator of more curiosity.

799
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,080
You mentioned Emily Dickinson's presentiment.

800
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:53,840
Is that long shadow on the lawn indicative that suns go down?

801
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:59,760
A notice to the startled grass that darkness is about to pass.

802
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,000
That we all have felt that, but I wouldn't know about it without Emily Dickinson.

803
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,560
Yeah, she says it.

804
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,640
And you feel, yes, it's like that.

805
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:14,280
Well, I guess that's Eliot again where he says you arrive somewhere familiar in discovering

806
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,560
it for the first time.

807
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,280
That sense of, yes, it's like that.

808
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,960
I've been here before, but I didn't know it.

809
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,920
No one said it like that.

810
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,400
Yes.

811
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,960
And then we're not alone.

812
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:33,040
Then there's that sensation of being somebody, but also being connected.

813
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,000
Yeah, so here's a question.

814
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,720
Is there curiosity without some kind of dialogical position in human beings?

815
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,280
Can you say that again?

816
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:49,280
Is there curiosity without an other?

817
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:54,320
Well, I mean, I don't know.

818
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:59,560
This is a genuine question, not a question that I have, you know, not rhetorical.

819
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:04,600
Well, can we be without the other ever?

820
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,600
No.

821
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:14,080
So I think that's right, that if you're going for essences, then there is never one being

822
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:18,440
without another, and there you can't have one brain without another.

823
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,240
You can't have any of it.

824
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,720
What's a paradox?

825
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,720
One's self.

826
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,720
Yeah.

827
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,720
Yeah.

828
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:32,040
We talked about fear as a mechanism for curiosity, but there's also the fear of curiosity, which

829
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:37,320
is a, which can be another word for political oppression.

830
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:43,840
In your book, you mentioned, you know, it's also, it's a major theme in religion, in

831
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,320
apocryphal writings.

832
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,400
Apocryphal curiosity and bad cutiocity.

833
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,400
Yes.

834
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,400
Yes.

835
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,400
Yes.

836
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,400
Yes.

837
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,400
Yes.

838
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,400
Yes.

839
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,400
Yes.

840
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,400
Yes.

841
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,400
Yes.

842
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,400
Yes.

843
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,400
Yes.

844
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,400
Yes.

845
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,400
Yes.

846
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,400
Yes.

847
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,400
Yes.

848
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,400
That's a beautiful book of the Bible.

849
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:08,000
Do not try to understand things that are too difficult for you, or try to discover what

850
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,120
is beyond your powers.

851
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:14,760
So religion is replete of examples where, of course, the opposite is true.

852
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:20,920
Well, you're not supposed to be curious, and fear of curiosity is a, is political oppression,

853
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,720
is it, you know, political speech, and so on.

854
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:29,520
The question is that are we, what about fear of discovering oneself, which is very common?

855
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,820
Absolutely can relate to, I'm thinking about, I always use myself as the instrument of

856
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,240
understanding of life.

857
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:45,120
So I look back at my own life and I remember very clearly my body betraying me when I found

858
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:52,920
it was not attracted to women at the age, at a very young age and I was, I did not understand

859
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,020
this at all.

860
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,720
There was no frame of reference.

861
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:02,200
There was no such thing as gay people in my world, I knew nothing about it.

862
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:08,800
And I just remember the terror of this and it was unconscious, but I knew that fear and

863
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,360
it lasted many, many years and it shaped so many of my actions over many years.

864
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:19,760
And it took tremendous courage at a certain point to start being curious about it, to

865
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:28,480
allow myself the curiosity and I think there are many ways in which our body literally wants

866
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:35,000
things that the curious mind can't face, including death.

867
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:41,360
You know, one of your people speak to me, I just feel they hit me in the gut and the

868
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:45,720
one about your brother saying to you, I'm dying.

869
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:50,200
And you say, I know, and he says, no, I don't think you do.

870
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,200
And you say, I do.

871
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,360
I know you're dying.

872
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:55,600
He says, yes, but you don't know that you're dying.

873
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:03,840
It really hit me because that being able to accept that, I mean, you know, I've dealt

874
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:08,160
with being gay many years ago, but now I'm having to deal with other things.

875
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:13,760
And what I'm having to deal with is this mortality, which the body knows and which

876
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,320
is and it's hard to be curious about it.

877
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:18,320
I want to.

878
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,320
I noticed.

879
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,280
Yeah, it's hard to be curious about that.

880
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,280
I agree.

881
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:26,640
I also think it increases urgency and curiosity.

882
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:38,440
I mean, I turned 60 a couple of weeks ago and my sense of fitting it in has gotten enormous.

883
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,440
You know, I have much greater urgency.

884
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:47,040
But you've done the answer to your question that you have to do self discovery and curiosity

885
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:51,920
is there, which as you're speaking, I came up with this analogy, might be completely,

886
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:57,800
I mean, appropriate, but it seems to me what masturbation is to sex is what self discovery

887
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,800
is to curiosity.

888
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,800
Yeah.

889
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,560
So here's a nice little question.

890
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,480
Good morning.

891
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,960
We don't do another to masturbate.

892
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,880
We need another to do the curiosity.

893
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,400
We can solve this cover.

894
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:16,560
It's true that we can self discover the, the, the, or question, you know, for people are

895
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:26,400
interested in infant research is obviously it seems very clear that you can't become

896
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:30,040
a human being without an other, right?

897
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:35,360
Not just the uterine environment, but then, you know, we'd all be dead if someone had

898
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,840
been taken care of us.

899
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:46,640
And that early life is very important, I think, to what happens to us, to those early rhythmic

900
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:54,680
patterns and emotional, motor sensory, emotional realities that are probably involved also

901
01:17:54,680 --> 01:18:01,840
in how curious, how daring, how frightened we all are.

902
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:09,640
Which, because we are constantly confronted to those others who try to tell us who we

903
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:16,600
are, the, the, the, the, Robert, the quest, the, the journey is one that Jung calls in

904
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:22,480
the situation, trying to find out who you are in, in the end.

905
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:27,320
And Alice is confronted to that in, in Wonderland.

906
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:35,200
She has a wonderful solution, she says that she has fallen down the hall and know who she

907
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,200
is.

908
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:40,840
And she says, what if I'm somebody that I don't like?

909
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:44,800
So she says, I'll wait here till they call me.

910
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:49,440
And when they call me, they'll ask, who are you calling?

911
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:54,400
And they will say, and if I like who they're calling, I'll come up.

912
01:18:54,400 --> 01:19:00,200
And if I have not, I will wait till they call the person that I want to be.

913
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:09,600
Well, it's probably this idea of some authentic self, you know, this can be questioned too,

914
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,600
right?

915
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,200
I mean, that it's a kind of act of becoming.

916
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:19,600
I mean, if, if we are dynamic, then we're never, we're never there.

917
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,200
Absolutely, yeah.

918
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:26,880
But I think that the idea of individuation is an active one, the one of becoming.

919
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:27,880
Absolutely.

920
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:35,480
I keep thinking what you were saying about Einstein and curiosity not surviving a formal

921
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,480
education.

922
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:44,280
And my, my daughter, you know, they were doing a poetry unit and she was, had to write a paper,

923
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,280
she's 14.

924
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:50,320
And whose wids these are, I think I know, his houses in the village love.

925
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,480
And she said, you know, this poem's about, and I said, honey, you know, the poem's not

926
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,480
about anything.

927
01:19:55,480 --> 01:20:00,320
And she said, mom, I know that, but this is school.

928
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,320
Wonderful.

929
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,320
That's so wonderful.

930
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:13,760
So sad, you know, she goes, I know, I know, mom, but this is school.

931
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,760
I just, I wanted to write it across.

932
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:22,000
My daughter, you know, stop it.

933
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,240
She suffered.

934
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:29,360
But I think that thing of, you know, maybe the love to, you know, that you fall in love

935
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:34,320
with books or writers, that you have attachments.

936
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,840
And my own daughter, when she was 11, they had to write an essay, wrote about reading

937
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,880
Jane Eyre.

938
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:49,840
And at the end of the essay, she wrote about how she really would like to meet Charlotte

939
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:58,440
Brontë and crawl into her lap and, you know, and hug her.

940
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:03,880
And it was elected the best essay and she read it aloud and of course the kids were merciless.

941
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:04,880
Why?

942
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:10,520
Well, because they thought it was so tacky that she wanted to sit in Charlotte Brontë.

943
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:14,720
But because this happens in school.

944
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,760
But it was a very good essay indeed.

945
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,080
What a beautiful thing.

946
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,440
Charlotte would have loved that.

947
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,440
She would have liked it.

948
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:25,360
I feel like that many times.

949
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:34,360
So attachment is somehow connected to curiosity and the feelings is what you were talking

950
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:43,040
about earlier, this feeling of satisfaction which generates the desire for more satisfaction

951
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:46,920
on that order.

952
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:52,080
One of the places that I'm really interested about how to stay curious is when people

953
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,840
have been in relationship for a long time with one another.

954
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,240
Where they have the illusion that they know one another.

955
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,160
And so there's little curiosity.

956
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:04,000
You know exactly what the way things are going to go.

957
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:10,880
And how do you start relating to that person as someone becoming, someone who's not fixed

958
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,880
or said?

959
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:19,240
Well, in every case, you can be very curious every day about what is going to happen.

960
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:26,880
My partner says that you have to renew the contract every day in order not to wake up

961
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,280
in the morning and say, who is this person?

962
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:40,400
So you have to balance the knowledge of the person with a curiosity that grows out of

963
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:47,560
a fascination which renews the act of falling in love.

964
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:51,040
And I find that it grows.

965
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:56,120
Awaken up next to a person saying, who is this person?

966
01:22:56,120 --> 01:23:01,240
It's not as dangerous as waking up next to a person saying, I know everything about this

967
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:02,240
person.

968
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,240
Oh, I agree.

969
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,240
Absolutely.

970
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,520
And of course, it has to be a falsehood.

971
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,520
Yes.

972
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,080
It is impossible to know everything.

973
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:16,640
And that does create, I think, domestic boredom.

974
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:20,280
But if you think that, you're lying to yourself.

975
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,600
Well, it's also an act of violence to the other person.

976
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,600
It's an act of violence.

977
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:30,680
I mean, my marriage ended when, man, I still love very much said to me, I know everything

978
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,520
there is to know about you.

979
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,120
And I said, we can't live together anymore.

980
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,760
If you think that, that's an act of violence.

981
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,760
You can't possibly.

982
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:47,480
But Simone Vay, the great theologian philosopher said, the only question we really ever have

983
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:51,800
to ask of each other is, what are you going through?

984
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:52,800
What are you going through?

985
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,280
What are you going through now?

986
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,640
What is happening to you?

987
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:03,240
And to be deeply curious about each other.

988
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:11,160
It is true that with another person, but also with a group of people, the place where

989
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:21,880
you're not allowed to ask questions, the place that limits your curiosity is a place of death

990
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:34,160
that is to say, Timor Levy tells this very moving story about being in Auschwitz.

991
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:44,640
And they were standing in their uniforms in a very cold wind blowing through the window

992
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,600
and they were terribly thirsty.

993
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:56,440
And he s*** out of the window and grabs it, breaks it and starts to suck on the icicle.

994
01:24:56,440 --> 01:25:03,560
And the guard hits his hand and hits the icicle out of his hand.

995
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:09,000
And Levy says in his bad German, why?

996
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,960
And the guard's answer is, here is kind, here, there is no why.

997
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,560
And the place where there is no why is death.

998
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:25,400
However, there are questions that are completely devoid of curiosity.

999
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,400
We made them such.

1000
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:30,240
I mean, your books has a wonderful question, Mark, even before the title.

1001
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:34,920
But you were talking about meeting somebody and asking, what are you going through?

1002
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,280
We asked the question, how are you?

1003
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,880
And we have to be needed at nothing at all.

1004
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,760
Of course, 100 years ago when people asked, how are you?

1005
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,680
Because you could be sick and die.

1006
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,640
You can sick and take a pill and you'll find.

1007
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:52,360
Of course, I come from New Jersey and New Jersey, there is a mafia parlance.

1008
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,480
You can say, how you doing?

1009
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:58,720
And the answer I learned for how you doing is, how you doing?

1010
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,720
You don't answer.

1011
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:07,360
It's a question that is answered by a question, neither of which, have any curiosity whatsoever.

1012
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,440
As a, as a.

1013
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,440
What's up?

1014
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:16,000
As someone who moved to this country, a lot of people say, what's new?

1015
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:22,600
And I always take that literally and I start racking my brain for something new.

1016
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,120
And I realize you just got to come up with one thing.

1017
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,520
You just have to remember this.

1018
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,520
Just say one thing.

1019
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,520
Oh, I'm working on a project.

1020
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:35,040
The Chinese apparently don't say, how are you?

1021
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,040
But they say, have you eaten?

1022
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,040
Yes.

1023
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,040
Yes.

1024
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,040
I'm very important.

1025
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,040
Have you eaten?

1026
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,040
Have you eaten with us?

1027
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:49,480
I think we're going to open it up to the audience now, so if you could line up at the

1028
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,480
microphone and.

1029
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,480
Do that again, Andrew.

1030
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,480
How you doing?

1031
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:53,480
I don't.

1032
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,480
I don't.

1033
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,480
I'm sorry.

1034
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,680
Share your questions with us.

1035
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,480
Hi, I'm Sophia.

1036
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,480
Very good.

1037
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:05,000
Event goes from the Brainiacs Meetup group.

1038
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I'm also actually building an online knowledge sharing and learning network.

1039
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,240
So this discussion was really fantastic and interesting.

1040
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:24,200
I'm also interested in role curiosity plays on the interactions between humans.

1041
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:31,200
So one would think that between two equally curious humans, the one that will be greater

1042
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:38,640
than the learning between one curious and one non curious human.

1043
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:47,040
But what if the pair with the non curious and curious human, there was a transformation

1044
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:51,680
where the non curious person started becoming curious?

1045
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:59,160
Would the that person actually become more curious than the ordinarily curious person?

1046
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,160
What are your thoughts?

1047
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,160
I think you're taken away.

1048
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,160
Oh gosh.

1049
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,600
There's no small sense.

1050
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,480
Absolute, I think was a curiosity is contagious.

1051
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,080
I know it myself.

1052
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:16,400
Yes, I don't have any children, but I live in a laboratory or I have graduate students.

1053
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,440
And if we weren't for them, I'll be really a very dull person.

1054
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:24,440
So it is a being with a curious person and elevate you to becoming curious.

1055
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,000
What about it?

1056
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:32,320
It definitely surpasses your average, whether you surpass theirs is another question.

1057
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:32,880
Thank you.

1058
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,840
Thank you.

1059
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:40,240
Thank you very much.

1060
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,040
Okay, there we go.

1061
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:43,040
Thank you very much.

1062
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:46,520
I really appreciate it hearing from everybody.

1063
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:52,240
And when I heard about this presentation today, I looked up the etymology of the word curious

1064
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,160
before I came here.

1065
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:58,880
So I'm just curious how you react to this and the question I have.

1066
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,720
The curious originally comes from the word care.

1067
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:11,960
And then a cure-rater was somebody who was a guide to providing you with care how to

1068
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,440
get to care.

1069
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:23,480
And it was connecting to me that the word cure-cure-cure-osody to be cured is connected to that.

1070
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:33,040
So my curious question about healing and care is that somebody like Eric Fromm escaped from

1071
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:38,920
freedom written in 1940, he said, psychologists and psychiatrists have basically replaced

1072
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:44,440
priests to guide us to meaning and understanding how to find yourself in the situation.

1073
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:51,840
So when it comes to education, which is where everything comes from and where probably the

1074
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:58,760
greatest crises is today, that a psychiatrist, including Eric Fromm was saying, psychiatrists,

1075
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:05,600
psychologists have a responsibility to take the initiative in bringing meaning and understanding

1076
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,920
out of the little behind the curtain the mighty eyes are spoken, out into the public

1077
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,600
with children because you know.

1078
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:20,840
And I'm just wondering, my curiosity, what is one step that a psychiatrist or psychologist

1079
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:26,480
or as me as a lay person, what can I do to inspire a psychologist or a psychologist

1080
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:33,920
to step out of his little safety box and open up his knowledge to where the community, not

1081
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,280
just one person needs it.

1082
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:40,680
I'm very cure-ecity about that.

1083
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,680
Thank you.

1084
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:50,800
Well, as a psychiatrist who's done that, so I have felt very strongly that if I accept

1085
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:58,240
people to open up and speak who they are, I need to be willing to do the same.

1086
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:03,960
And I've done that in the form of performing my own personal story on a stage.

1087
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:11,840
And my personal story is, has got certain pieces to it that are very, this is very personal.

1088
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:17,600
They've been parts of my life that have caused tremendous pain and then tremendous healing.

1089
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:25,920
And I have along the way met many, many different people who work as therapists who do that,

1090
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,400
who do it in different forms.

1091
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:31,320
So writing about their lives, talking to people about their lives.

1092
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:39,040
But I do think it is a willingness to break through the taboo of self-disclosure.

1093
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:45,660
For me, the whole idea that we, that I understand very well why it's, why the therapeutic relationship

1094
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:47,680
is for the client.

1095
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:52,600
So when sitting in a room, it's not about me speaking my story, but my willingness to

1096
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:58,840
do so and my having done so, I think allows me to listen in a way that's very different.

1097
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:03,520
So I don't know how to spread the word of people doing that other than saying that it's

1098
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,720
something I've done and at a cost.

1099
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,840
It's a very frightening thing to do as a therapist.

1100
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:16,560
And particularly as a psychiatrist, I think, I have felt humiliated and ashamed at telling

1101
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:21,360
my own story publicly because there is a taboo about it.

1102
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:28,120
But I think that the idea of caring, my caring for the world and for making a difference

1103
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:32,640
in the world is greater than my feeling of shame.

1104
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:41,200
And so the particular story is so related to your poetry is that I'm HIV positive and

1105
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,960
I have been for 30 years.

1106
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:50,120
And at the time that I became HIV positive, no one was speaking about it and no therapist,

1107
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:52,640
no psychiatrist was talking about it.

1108
01:32:52,640 --> 01:33:01,440
And I was watching people dying and your brother was among a whole generation of people who

1109
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,440
died.

1110
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:08,800
And to me, the curiosity about why I didn't will never leave.

1111
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,880
I can't understand why I'm still here.

1112
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:16,000
But I do feel like there is a purpose to my still being here and part of the purpose

1113
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,520
is to speak about that.

1114
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,320
And I encourage other people to do it.

1115
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:25,000
I have a company that teaches people how to tell their stories, their personal stories.

1116
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,680
And I encourage people to just keep doing that.

1117
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:32,200
I think that is a way of changing the world.

1118
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:33,200
Thanks.

1119
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,360
And I just want to say the person before you.

1120
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,680
Thank you so much for the work that you're doing.

1121
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:42,360
It's so wonderful to hear young people doing the kind of work that you're doing and creating

1122
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:46,920
the venue for people to do what you're doing.

1123
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,000
So thank you.

1124
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,440
Hi, my name is Robert.

1125
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:56,120
I happen to be a psychiatrist too.

1126
01:33:56,120 --> 01:34:01,160
But I guess I wanted to just comment, when I think about the word curiosity, I think

1127
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:06,520
of it more in terms of something that's not just in a femoral state.

1128
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:11,720
Even an animal might want to know what's behind the door if they smell something.

1129
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:17,800
But I like to think of it in terms of as human beings where we ask questions like how did

1130
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,760
something come to be?

1131
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,560
How does something work?

1132
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,800
Or how can it be improved upon?

1133
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:29,520
And I think that separates us from the kinds of questions that an animal might have and

1134
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,040
the way they may use their senses.

1135
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:36,680
At least I'm not familiar with an animal who's asked those questions and somehow demonstrated

1136
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:39,000
answers to them.

1137
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,360
But I think curiosity is a fascinating phenomenon and I don't think that everybody is equally

1138
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:45,920
curious.

1139
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:51,560
So I guess number one, I mean in terms of how I look at the word, I do like to think in

1140
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:57,440
terms of how we work with children and how we work with adults so that number one, we

1141
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,680
don't quash curiosity.

1142
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:05,120
I'm always concerned, not necessarily about how we stimulate it, but what we do to quash

1143
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:11,160
it because I think that's extremely dangerous and that we can create safe spaces in which

1144
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:17,280
people can explore their curiosity, give them the freedom to do it.

1145
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:22,600
But I just want to add one thing too is that for people who may not be terribly concerned

1146
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:28,120
about how a refrigerator works, I think each of us is curious about certain things.

1147
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:33,600
Musicians, artists, poets, all of us have areas of curiosity.

1148
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:38,320
And to me the most important thing is not necessarily that we're curious about everything

1149
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:42,160
but that we find something that we have a passion for.

1150
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:47,520
And in working with patients, I'm not so concerned about whether they're curious about my life

1151
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:53,120
but if I can engage them so that they become curious about their own lives and how they

1152
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,960
can make their own lives better.

1153
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:55,960
Thank you.

1154
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:03,760
I think that addressing what Edgar was saying about not knowing how a fridge works was not

1155
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:11,720
that Edgar meant and excuse me Edgar Ford explaining you that we should be curious only

1156
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:22,920
about the mechanical side of life but that our range of curiosity should spread to things

1157
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:29,320
that we do every day and that we don't know that we do every day.

1158
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:36,840
So opening a fridge might elicit the question of how does this thing work.

1159
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:45,040
It's true but I have to say I agree with you that people who are passionately addressing

1160
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:51,240
certain questions, there's an avenue that you take and it can lead you out of your frame

1161
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:57,840
of reference into something completely new which for me has been terribly exciting but

1162
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:06,240
that one question generates another and it might not ever arrive at the refrigerator.

1163
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:13,240
And it's still okay.

1164
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:22,600
Okay so I'm terrified right now and I just want to tell you that so that I can be in

1165
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,600
my body.

1166
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,600
Do I take this out?

1167
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:26,600
What do I do?

1168
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:27,600
No, I'm okay.

1169
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:28,600
Good bye.

1170
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:29,600
All right.

1171
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:35,400
Hi, my name is Shula Meet and I have a nursing background so I understand from a scientific

1172
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:43,960
perspective I have a psychotherapy background with psychosynthesis so psychology and spirituality.

1173
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:49,720
I'm an energetic healer and intuitive and empath and I love consciousness and I could

1174
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:50,720
go on.

1175
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:52,400
I'm a pragmatic metaphysician.

1176
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:58,280
Okay so I just share that as just a little bit of my background but more importantly

1177
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:06,680
and why I'm terrified is going to be incredibly vulnerable right now and say that the reason

1178
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:07,680
can everybody hear me?

1179
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:08,680
Can I take this out?

1180
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:09,680
Yeah, I hear you perfectly.

1181
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:10,680
Hello?

1182
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:11,680
Yeah, I feel better.

1183
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,680
Thank you.

1184
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:18,600
If you see this move I have an essential tremor, I think that's a really sucky word but anyway

1185
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,840
it's not fair.

1186
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:26,760
So nobody has talked about something I'm going to say and if they've talked about it and

1187
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:33,200
I don't know about it please let me know and grab me afterwards but I had an experience

1188
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:41,920
of enlightenment where I experience that I am nothing but that and that that is love

1189
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:47,360
and that that is me and that there is nothing but that and that I am all of you and you're

1190
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:54,680
all of me and I am the walls and I am the light and I can never die because I don't

1191
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:58,480
exist as an ego concept.

1192
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:04,280
However, having had that experience, this is fear, I'm utterly vulnerable right now.

1193
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,760
Can somebody hold this?

1194
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,080
So I can at least stop this thing.

1195
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:15,200
Okay, coming from an experience especially for anybody who knows about psychosynthesis

1196
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:20,480
there was something called a spiritual crisis in the literature and I'm not a reader, I'm

1197
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:27,480
a listener, I remember a lot of what I hear but hardly anything about what I read.

1198
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:36,480
Nobody felt the disorientation and the disorganization that comes after a spiritual enlightenment.

1199
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:42,960
I have been dealing with a discomfort and a struggle in me knowing that there's a magnificence

1200
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:48,320
in me that can come out and share with the universe what happened with me but also knowing

1201
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:55,120
that there's no reason to, knowing that there's many places I could be and I can go and knowing

1202
01:39:55,120 --> 01:40:01,160
that there's nowhere to go, knowing that I don't have to worry about death anymore because

1203
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:08,400
there is no death and at the same time wondering what I'm doing here.

1204
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:16,560
So I came today because I noticed my curiosity was gone but I didn't know the word.

1205
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:25,000
I never thought of the word curiosity, a passion, an excitement, an exhilaration, an expression,

1206
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:31,800
yes but I couldn't figure out what was wrong and I cried to my husband, there's something

1207
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:32,800
wrong.

1208
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:39,600
I set up a session in the summer with my psychosynthesis teacher many, many years ago and he didn't

1209
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,560
understand.

1210
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:47,160
He said, oh this is because you want to teach from this experience and I said no, I'm in

1211
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:53,400
my backyard looking at the clouds, I am the clouds, what's wrong?

1212
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:59,880
And so I started looking for meetups and I thought well maybe if I just experience a

1213
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:08,160
bunch of stuff then something will happen inside me and I feel so blessed to be here.

1214
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:15,760
I feel so divinely led to be here, to find the word curiosity, to excite me enough to

1215
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:20,840
come here to say maybe there's some kind of answer here and I don't really know what

1216
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:29,920
I'm trying to say except that there's no place where somebody is not broken, like I am utterly

1217
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:35,720
not broken and I help people all the time.

1218
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:44,040
But there's a place of being out of skew because we don't talk about the spiritual nature of

1219
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:45,640
curiosity.

1220
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:51,280
Like to me I've been looking at what is curiosity and to me it's about getting out of the way

1221
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:54,640
for God to come through.

1222
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,000
Thank you for, thank you for sharing.

1223
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
You know what I'm saying.

1224
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
It was very great to stop you.

1225
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,280
And so I feel like we need to have a place for the spiritual issue.

1226
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:06,640
Does anyone have some thoughts about that?

1227
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:12,640
I was thinking of her as you were speaking.

1228
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,640
Do you know her?

1229
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:14,640
Do you know that?

1230
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:17,000
That theologian, philosopher, writer?

1231
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,880
Her name is Simonvee, W-E-I-L.

1232
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:26,840
She died in the mid 20th century.

1233
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:33,040
She's written extensively about her experience, about the very thing you're talking about.

1234
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:39,360
She calls it Decreation, but it's about getting out of the way so God can be.

1235
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:46,760
Yeah, she, I mean I think what you're addressing are mystical experiences that you know, that

1236
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:52,560
you share with really a lot of people.

1237
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,200
And Simonvee is certainly one of them.

1238
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:05,640
But you know there's a whole rich literature on mysticism in many different religions.

1239
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:12,520
That's not what I'm saying is that I was very drawn to Paul and wanted to do a session

1240
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,520
with you.

1241
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:21,520
But from the place of spiritual confusion, and I don't think we talk enough about that.

1242
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,520
Well maybe I.

1243
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:23,520
And I don't want to take up the time for it.

1244
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:28,000
I understand, I think what's relevant for here, and you can talk to me afterwards, but

1245
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,440
I think what's relevant here is how you are listened to.

1246
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:37,320
And so as you speak what you spoke, everybody has a particular frame of reference through

1247
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:39,640
which they listen to you.

1248
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:45,280
And I think in terms of curiosity, what's really interesting is can we just put aside

1249
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:51,120
any frame of reference and hear your experience as what has happened to you.

1250
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:57,760
And you know there is a whole lot of literature about non-ordinary states.

1251
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:03,920
So states that people go into, that psychiatry tends to call one thing, but there are not

1252
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,160
necessarily that at all.

1253
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:11,000
People do have spiritual crises that can look like mania, but they're not.

1254
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,760
They're different.

1255
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:18,040
And I certainly through my own experience can relate to what you're saying.

1256
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:21,520
So yeah, perhaps afterwards we can have conversation.

1257
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,520
Yeah, come speak with us.

1258
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:24,520
Thank you.

1259
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:25,520
Thank you.

1260
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:29,920
It's a hard act to follow obviously.

1261
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:33,720
But you know I think what you just did for her was to create a sense of safety and now

1262
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:38,400
we're all thinking about spiritual experiences and how they might really be very interesting.

1263
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,960
You know and I was sort of thinking a lot through this about the word safety.

1264
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:46,040
We saw this really beautiful demonstration where you talked about your time in the canyon

1265
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:48,720
and two people said what about food, what about water?

1266
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:53,360
And you said well okay, yeah, and that was fine and you settled everybody down and you

1267
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:57,480
settled down in your canyon and you had this kind of expansive mystical experience.

1268
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:00,720
And I think about animals who come in, they're too terrified.

1269
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:02,280
They start to move around.

1270
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:05,280
They settle themselves down motorically, right?

1271
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:09,760
And then they open up an ability to think and learn once they feel safe enough.

1272
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:14,360
And what you guys said about looking at a bottle in a situation of great safety.

1273
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:18,080
I guess I don't have the question in here but the question is sort of the relationship

1274
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:24,160
between safety, movement, expansions of consciousness and learning, right?

1275
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:28,280
And in what situations are we safe enough to be curious?

1276
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,720
And what is the relationship between that and fear?

1277
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:34,760
Yeah and I'm just going to tell two anecdotes for fun but you know I have a daughter who's

1278
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:39,680
perhaps the most curious person in the world that I know and when she was five months we

1279
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:43,520
disappeared to take care of a neighbor's fire and she was curious enough to get off

1280
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:48,840
the bed, figure out five turns and end up almost at a staircase at age five months.

1281
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:51,760
And she's somebody who can spend days in a canyon alone.

1282
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:56,800
I myself can't watch a movie unless I know the ending before I start watching it.

1283
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:01,880
So it's like within these sort of safe or risk environments there's this play of curiosity.

1284
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:04,840
So I was curious about your comments about that.

1285
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:06,840
Thank you.

1286
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:13,040
I think safety is important and I mean you mentioned animals but also children.

1287
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:21,560
You know if children aren't given a safe environment questions are not asked.

1288
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:23,400
I mean you know that.

1289
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:26,720
You look at traumatized children.

1290
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:32,440
Trauma is a form of rigidity, right?

1291
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:38,040
And motor sensory repetition says in flashbacks which I had after a car accident.

1292
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:45,120
I'm almost grateful that I had them because it was so fantastically interesting to experience

1293
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:51,920
that kind of bodily trauma without any text, no language, nothing.

1294
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:58,920
And to realize that I went into shock and what was missing from the experience was precisely

1295
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:02,520
the trauma that then repeats itself later.

1296
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:10,240
I mean I was a grown up but I think you absolutely in education.

1297
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:14,360
I mean all of us, many of us in school, I went to horrible little public schools in

1298
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:19,800
Minnesota where you were terrified in the classroom half the time.

1299
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:20,800
This does not help.

1300
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:25,000
No and you're too afraid to ask questions.

1301
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,040
So yes safety is a huge issue I think.

1302
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:32,680
I was curious after the role of repetition, right?

1303
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:37,960
Because I can be endlessly repetitively interested in hiking the same nature trail and seeing

1304
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:40,600
it anew every time.

1305
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,720
And I can be endlessly repetitively interested in the same piano piece.

1306
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:48,200
So what is the balance of those two things versus the sort of traumatic repetitive.

1307
01:47:48,200 --> 01:48:04,240
I just have a quick question about dissonance and dissonance as a cause for curiosity.

1308
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:08,880
When something like the past, present or future doesn't align with your projection of the past,

1309
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:09,880
present or future.

1310
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:13,120
I mean I feel like that's kind of a huge cause for curiosity.

1311
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:16,440
That kind of encompasses a lot of what you've said.

1312
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:24,480
So about the idea of possibility and imagination as a product of the curiosity to kind of deal

1313
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:25,960
with that dissonance.

1314
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:32,240
You create this imagined world based on possibility rather than what is or what isn't.

1315
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:37,760
I don't know I'd be curious to know what you guys think about dissonance as a cause

1316
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,760
for curiosity.

1317
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:41,360
Can you say a little bit more about that?

1318
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:43,280
Why that occurs to you?

1319
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:44,280
In what context?

1320
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,280
As far as dissonance.

1321
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:47,280
An example.

1322
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,280
Yeah, give us an example.

1323
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:54,280
When you say past, present, future dissonance, how do you experience that?

1324
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:55,280
Sure, sure.

1325
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:59,600
Well, okay, so maybe an example, maybe through art we can use an example in music.

1326
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:11,080
You listen to music and a lot of great composers have used dissonance as a technique or tool

1327
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:15,320
to keep the interest of the audience in a piece.

1328
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:20,480
For example, I don't have an exact example but using really strong major chords that are

1329
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:25,000
really comfortable and then putting a piece of dissonance inside of that to really discomfort

1330
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,840
the audience and then having that draw them into that piece.

1331
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:34,120
I don't know I think that's probably the best example but to go with the past and present

1332
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:39,880
future just so if you think of something in the past.

1333
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:45,600
It doesn't align with something that is happening right now.

1334
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:53,280
So let's say, I don't know, I'm struggling for examples right now.

1335
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:58,720
Or like future wise, you have this idea of the future of where you're going to go and

1336
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:00,920
your future ends up being vastly different.

1337
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:06,640
It causes a very strong dissonance within yourself that causes you to say, hey, why

1338
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:07,640
is this occurred?

1339
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:08,640
What's the reason?

1340
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,640
I don't know.

1341
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:16,360
I'm very happy to ask that question because I wanted to have an appendix so to speak

1342
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:18,560
to a serious question.

1343
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:24,320
The previous question was safety necessary for curiosity and Syria I think very rightfully

1344
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:25,840
in my opinion answered this.

1345
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:31,160
We need a safety environment to explore but I think by the same amount you need to pull

1346
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:37,760
that safety net out of quite a bit which what you call the nature of dissonance for there

1347
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:42,040
to be curiosity which relates to the major theme of fear that we kept referring to.

1348
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:49,840
So I think completely safe environment is not conducive for curiosity but you need some

1349
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:53,720
amount of safety not to worry about exploring.

1350
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:57,800
But if you put if you so dissonance, I'm glad you brought this up because I was itching

1351
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:59,840
to tell Siri you need some fear.

1352
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:03,800
Well of course but this is a kind of developmental trajectory right?

1353
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:10,360
I mean a one year old needs a lot more safety than a 30 year old.

1354
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:18,960
And if you the fact is that children who have had safe early lives are more curious

1355
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:24,720
and more exploratory and you know there's even research on this that you know if you

1356
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:30,480
do these studies on you know the maternal infant dyad at you know two months you can

1357
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:37,720
actually project depending on how those proto dialogues are going that at 18 months if you

1358
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:45,640
have had a good secure attachment that that's going to help you be a lot more exploratory

1359
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:47,200
and curious in the future.

1360
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,880
You know go back to the cat.

1361
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:52,960
The cat was threatened by the new object.

1362
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:57,040
It's curious until it discovers it's safe.

1363
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:58,920
Then it's not curious anymore.

1364
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:07,440
So it makes me think if curiosity kills the cat it's the lack of safety that can kill

1365
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:10,320
the lack of curiosity of the cat.

1366
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,840
So in some way you need both.

1367
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:18,920
And the dissonance is a kind of beautiful idea and I like that you talked about music

1368
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:27,120
because art in general I think there's no excitement without dissonance.

1369
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:35,480
I mean nobody wants that well some people do but you know the formulaic reproductions

1370
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:41,120
of artworks that go on all the time and I think they provide comfort.

1371
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:46,240
But if you're really looking for artistic experience you're looking precisely for that

1372
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:53,080
kind of dissonance that's going to get you all riled up and curious and move you elsewhere.

1373
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:58,560
I think the same is true of being a therapist so I think that as a therapist people have

1374
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:04,520
dominant narratives about their lives and they could keep, there's no dissonance to those

1375
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:09,920
narratives they just are and they've got lots of evidence as to why life is that way.

1376
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:13,720
And you could think of a therapist as someone who's listening for the dissonance.

1377
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:16,880
They're listening for something other than the dominant narrative.

1378
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:22,240
But some people call it subjugated narratives which are tiny little pieces of narratives

1379
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:24,800
that may show through for just a moment.

1380
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,920
So someone thinks they're a terrible mother and they've got a whole lot of reasons for

1381
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:33,360
saying that and you hear an action that they took which really contradicts that and your

1382
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:39,320
job is to really grab onto that and start thickening that narrative and so you get dissonance.

1383
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,320
You get two stories now.

1384
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:46,120
Yes, pix, curiosity of both people.

1385
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:52,600
Yeah, but I'm also thinking about us as a national entity or a global entity as well.

1386
01:53:52,600 --> 01:54:00,080
Did you anybody here see after the events of 9-11 as we call them now?

1387
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:06,360
The Andre Gregory and Wally Sean dialogue at Cooper Union?

1388
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:12,200
Well one of them played the United States and one of them played the therapist.

1389
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:18,320
And they were trying to explain to the United States that somebody hurt me.

1390
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:19,320
Why?

1391
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:21,080
I'm mad.

1392
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:26,560
And the other person said, well, maybe you could ask yourself some questions.

1393
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:29,640
You know, why would somebody want to hurt you?

1394
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:33,400
And this dialogue when it was brilliant, just brilliant.

1395
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:37,720
But I'm thinking of the dissonance between, for example, what we thought the world was

1396
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:40,360
and what we are now knowing what it is.

1397
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:45,720
Even in the climate crisis.

1398
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:53,960
And what's needed now is a deep imaginative response, imaginative response that we've

1399
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:58,320
seen many of us paralyze and unable to provide.

1400
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:04,960
And that we keep imagining the absolute destruction of the world and over again.

1401
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:09,560
And all the Hollywood movies, how many times has New York been destroyed?

1402
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:10,560
You know, flooded.

1403
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,920
You know, a million, we see that.

1404
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:13,920
We can picture that.

1405
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:21,320
We can't picture, you know, grass on all the roofs and windmills and, you know, a new

1406
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:23,080
kind of life.

1407
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:28,040
And what I beg you to do is to do that.

1408
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:35,240
It's for us all to begin to be curious about the future in an imaginative way that creates

1409
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:36,240
a future.

1410
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:38,040
This is what Blake would say, right?

1411
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:41,000
That we imagine it, it will come true.

1412
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:45,560
What we choose to imagine about the future often does come true.

1413
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:50,880
And we keep, we're being pulled toward Thanatos, Thanatos, death destruction over and over again,

1414
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:57,160
instead of imagining a whole new breakthrough dissonance now of understanding who we thought

1415
01:55:57,160 --> 01:56:02,320
we were, what we in fact have done, and now what can we can do about it?

1416
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,360
Thank you.

1417
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:11,160
And there are four of you to ask questions that will have to be the last four questions.

1418
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:15,720
Okay, so, can you hear me?

1419
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:16,720
No.

1420
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:17,720
No.

1421
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:18,720
Just pick it up.

1422
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:19,720
Just take it.

1423
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:20,720
Put it close to your mouth.

1424
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:21,720
Okay.

1425
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:22,720
Oh, there we go.

1426
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:25,800
So, I'll try to make this not too nebulous.

1427
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:32,520
I feel, I may also be the clouds as well.

1428
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:40,200
So one thing is, as I'm listening to this wonderful conversation, I'm sort of attuned

1429
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:46,080
to the distinction between the kinds of questions being asked when one refers to curiosity and

1430
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:55,960
sort of this distinction between the what and the how and the why and this idea of, you

1431
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:03,800
know, even at the point of when we first emerge into the world, we are primarily concerned

1432
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:11,000
with the question of what and then, you know, as we progress, as we gain levels of comfort

1433
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:19,240
and, you know, and moments of peace and, you know, or we are acted upon by outside forces

1434
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:32,120
to force us to ask a question of how and why that it's, you know, the how and the why is

1435
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:40,560
not a necessity, but that it doesn't, the what is not, not curiosity and just this, what

1436
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:46,000
I'm interested in is this function of sort of the inattentional blindness with which

1437
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:53,400
we go through our lives, this hyper focus on the what which, you know, or the necessity

1438
01:57:53,400 --> 01:58:04,720
of focusing on the what, which, you know, perhaps precludes our asking of, you know,

1439
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:13,200
the perhaps more incisive gradations of, you know, what is possible when one manifests

1440
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:21,960
curiosity. So, and as an extension of that, I'm curious to hear what all of you think

1441
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:33,680
of this relationship of this, of these different kinds of manifestations of curiosity in a modern

1442
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:43,880
environment in which information and the the ability to to ask those other questions or

1443
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:54,520
complicated questions is is almost prohibitively overwhelming. This idea of information being

1444
01:58:54,520 --> 01:59:01,080
so incredibly accessible is that, you know, do you believe that in a way that manifests

1445
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:09,720
as a kind of micro macrocosm of inattentional blindness in so far as it is so possible for

1446
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:16,200
us to so readily access or to seek answers to those greater questions that perhaps we

1447
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:23,760
don't and also as an extension of that, the fact that it is possible for us to ask those

1448
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:30,800
questions in such a disembodied way and how we there's been so much discussion about the,

1449
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:38,320
you know, the acute importance of, you know, the at least the, you know, if not the actual

1450
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:45,960
manifestation of an other at least the, you know, conception of an other that what consequences

1451
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:57,560
you believe, you know, the having those questions answered by non sort of a non human disembodied

1452
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:03,480
force of what implications that has for the connection that we have to each other.

1453
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:14,440
Thank you. Yeah. You know, I think we shouldn't undervalue what it means to pose a good question.

1454
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:23,080
I mean, this is a huge thing in her nine, seven diaries Simone de Beauvoir writes, I know nothing,

1455
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:34,720
nothing. I don't even know how to begin to shape proper question. I mean, the life of

1456
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:41,520
the intellect is not about, you know, looking up when someone was born. We can all do that.

1457
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:46,800
And, you know, thank heaven for Google. I love to check that I have my date, right? But that's

1458
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:55,560
not shaping a question. That's not part of, of, you know, shaping a good question is one

1459
02:00:55,560 --> 02:01:04,080
hell of a job. And whether you get your eventually find some part of your answer on the internet

1460
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:13,080
or at a lecture or out of, you know, 500 different volumes. I really, I mean, I'm with you on

1461
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:21,200
this one. It's how to make the question. And it's not about facts, how to form a really good

1462
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:26,760
question. On a much louder note, as you were saying this, I'm imagining this cartoon that I'm

1463
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:31,520
going to submit to the New Yorker right after this session. It's going back to New Jersey. Imagine

1464
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:38,080
this bar full of wise guys and another one wise guy comes in and the caption is, he's

1465
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:45,120
an existentially minded wise guy instead of saying, well, how you doing? You ask, why you doing?

1466
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:56,880
Why you doing? Actually, I think that's the interest we have to allow it. You can, you can

1467
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:02,160
come up afterwards and ask your follow-ups. I'm sorry. It's just in the interest of time we go

1468
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:15,880
forward with the other questions. I got up in response to the woman who asked about the

1469
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:23,040
relationship between safety and curiosity. And I wanted to say a couple things about that and

1470
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:30,800
maybe pose a question. My question at the moment is less important. I'm afraid. Namely, that

1471
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:39,600
you all touched in the discussion on the relationship between curiosity and pleasure and curiosity

1472
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:48,240
and fear. And it does seem to me that both have to be present in every movement of curiosity that

1473
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:55,880
takes you toward the world. An adventure, after all, is a mixture of both excitement and anxiety.

1474
02:02:55,880 --> 02:03:04,240
You don't get one without the other. And a big question for a psychotherapist of, I belong to

1475
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:13,760
that bizarre clan, is how much anxiety can a person tolerate that enables them to move toward

1476
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:19,720
the world and to be curious. I've never been in the business of eliminating all anxiety because

1477
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:26,440
anxiety has good energy in it and it can be transformed and it's a shame to medicate it or

1478
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:34,400
thermopize it out of existence or try to. You can't. It's in the human palette of feelings. But the

1479
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:41,880
thing is that you do need to feel safe enough, which means supported enough, both self-supporting

1480
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:50,120
and supported by the environment in order to risk going toward the unknown, which is where

1481
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:59,000
curiosity takes you. In relation to that, I wanted to just say another comment, which is,

1482
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:09,000
I think that most of the patients that have come to see me over the years have come in

1483
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:17,360
exactly feeling not at home, not at home in the world, not at home in themselves, and maybe

1484
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:23,080
particularly not at home in the present moment, so that they live more or less in the past or

1485
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:32,760
more or less in the future. And part of that being able to make oneself at home is being able to

1486
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:41,560
domesticate some unknown experience through going to it with curiosity. And it's not only the depressed

1487
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:48,760
patients who are not curious and they're profoundly not curious about the world because they've

1488
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:55,720
disconnected from it, but also the repressed patients and the oppressed patients. And then

1489
02:04:55,720 --> 02:05:04,320
curiosity can get broken and distorted in some very specific ways. For example, a person that we might

1490
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:10,920
think of as paranoid is someone who can only be curious about the dangerous and threatening aspects

1491
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:22,560
of an experience, of a coming experience, and not the pleasurable or joyful or even safe-making

1492
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:29,840
ones. Somebody who is obsessive can only be curious in a way about what they already know,

1493
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:36,800
and they're endlessly curious about what they already know, but they can't go towards the unknown.

1494
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:41,680
So I just wanted to thank you.

1495
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:52,360
One more. Next question.

1496
02:05:52,360 --> 02:06:03,840
I was kind of reminded with some insight that I had when I was skiing. I used to go skiing a lot,

1497
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:10,000
and when I would be going down in the hill, I found that if I was going too fast, I felt out

1498
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:17,520
of control and scared. And if I was going too slow, it became kind of boring. And so finding

1499
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:24,960
that middle place where I was kind of like skiing at the edge of my ability was a place that was

1500
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:33,680
very satisfying for me. It kept me aroused and energized and testing my ability, but at the same

1501
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:39,680
time, not so out of control that I started to be fearful for my safety, running into a tree or

1502
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:47,040
something like that. And with time, I've kind of learned a little bit about the brain, and it seems

1503
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:56,080
that slower state, that boring state, kind of like living in that habit system and doing this stuff

1504
02:06:56,080 --> 02:07:01,520
where expectations equals outcomes. And then suddenly when you get to dissonance like in the

1505
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:10,560
music or dissonance, you have a little dissonance. It triggers your access to the prefrontal cortex,

1506
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:17,120
and you start to do a kind of a pattern optimization where in terms of the predictive of mind,

1507
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:22,440
you're starting to develop a, you're developing model, you're pushing your model, but you're pushing

1508
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:30,520
it just enough, just a little bit, so that you are creating something that leads to something you

1509
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:37,960
becoming more effective. But then you get to a point where you may like in a traumatic experience,

1510
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:45,880
where you have an experience which is so outside of the usual, so outside of expectation that it

1511
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:54,920
actually becomes a disintegration. It actually starts to trigger a bottom-up reactive process that

1512
02:07:54,920 --> 02:08:00,480
does not engage the prefrontal cortex, and therefore it doesn't lead to pattern optimization,

1513
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:08,040
and this is what happens with the traumatic victims or individuals who, through chronic suppression or

1514
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:15,000
neglect or living in unsafe situations, never get to that point where they can start to access

1515
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:22,000
the prefrontal cortex and improve their models and become more effective. And so as long as you

1516
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:32,440
can keep that process going, that integration, then you maintain a healthy curiosity, which I think

1517
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:41,440
is probably critical for human organisms who come into the world without more like a

1518
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:53,480
tabularaza than other organisms. Thank you. Hi there. I want to start by saying thank you very

1519
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:58,440
much for your time today. It's been fascinating hearing each of your perspectives on this, and I'm

1520
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:04,440
very much forward to looking forward to reading your book. My questions regarding discrepancy in

1521
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:10,600
curiosity across the general population, and I'm wondering if you think that that is attributed

1522
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:17,480
mainly to biological reasons, for instance, the genetic makeup or wiring of each of our brains,

1523
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:23,680
or if you think it's based more on experiential things that were referenced earlier, such as safety

1524
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:31,720
and the type of environments we are brought up in. I have very strong feelings about this. My very

1525
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:41,400
strong feelings are that we have to start rethinking biology, right? So biology includes of course

1526
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:49,320
genetic makeup, genetic predispositions for disease, and probably personality and many things,

1527
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:57,560
but that biology is also learning to read as a biological process as well as a cultural one. So

1528
02:09:57,560 --> 02:10:04,360
really making those distinctions are almost impossible, and if you talk to people working in

1529
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:13,080
molecular biology and really working on genetics, it just doesn't go. They're both clearly involved

1530
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:21,160
in what happens to us, and you know there are even studies now that seem to suggest that for

1531
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:28,440
example stress, this is all animals, but stress on animals, of course will not change your DNA,

1532
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:37,240
but it can change parts of, it can make molecular changes, one of them is called methylation,

1533
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:43,960
and those changes, it seems, can actually be inherited up to four generations. This is very

1534
02:10:43,960 --> 02:10:51,320
interesting work, so that here is a little place in molecular genetics where this is coming together.

1535
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:57,320
They need a lot more repetitions to make this clear, hard science.

1536
02:10:58,360 --> 02:11:06,520
When it comes to curiosity, I think there are an innate capability that's in all of us,

1537
02:11:06,520 --> 02:11:11,560
that's much more so than for example analytical power. I have graduated students, some of them

1538
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:17,320
are incredibly brilliant, and some of them have uncanny analytical power, and I don't buy the

1539
02:11:17,320 --> 02:11:23,560
argument that if you, you know, you can take anybody, make them be as analytical as that person.

1540
02:11:23,560 --> 02:11:27,720
There's something innate, genetic or what about have you. However, curiosity is a bit different,

1541
02:11:27,720 --> 02:11:32,520
and that goes back to the earliest question about whether curiosity can be contagious,

1542
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:38,280
and I really think it is. So you take a mildly curious graduate student, you put him among some

1543
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:45,560
terribly curious ones, and suddenly she becomes curious, and that doesn't happen with intelligence.

1544
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:47,560
So I've noticed that, and I just want to make it up, there is.

1545
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:56,120
I think that demonstrates the correctness of your thesis more than the experience that I think the

1546
02:11:56,120 --> 02:12:05,320
audience has had today, thanks to our participants and particularly Alberto for stirring our curiosity.

1547
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:15,320
Thank you so much.
