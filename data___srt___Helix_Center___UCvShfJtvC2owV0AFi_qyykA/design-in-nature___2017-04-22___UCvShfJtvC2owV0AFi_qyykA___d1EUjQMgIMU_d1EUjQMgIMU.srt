1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Have you done one of these people?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,640
No.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,800
How about you?

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,920
Good afternoon, everybody.

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,520
Welcome.

6
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,240
I'm Rob Penzer.

7
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,560
I'm the Associate Director of the Heelics Center.

8
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,200
I have an announcement for an upcoming roundtable

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,760
on Saturday, May 20th on complexity and emergence.

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,120
It's the second of our roundtables on the subject,

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,200
called Visions of Cosmic Order from Particles to People.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,680
And our discussants will be William Grassi, who's

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,520
the founder of Metanexis, David Grinspoon, senior scientist

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,840
at the Planetary Science Institute,

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,600
Iliya Tampkin, Professor of Biology

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,280
at Northern Virginia Community College

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,480
and Research Associate at the National Museum

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,800
of Natural History, and Tyler Volk, Professor of Biology

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,600
and Environmental Studies at NYU.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,480
So today's topic, Design and Nature,

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,840
let me introduce our participants today.

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,480
And when I announce your name, if you can raise your hand.

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,960
Elizabeth Alter.

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,280
Adrian Bejan.

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,480
Robin Collins.

26
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,240
Mark Norel.

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,240
And Caleb Scharf.

28
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,200
And without further ado, I turn this over to our participants.

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
You look at him.

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
OK.

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Well, I get to talk about design and nature.

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,520
And design and nature has always been one of these things

33
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,400
that people have questioned since the origins of modern science,

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,920
especially in Western Europe, in terms

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,200
with the origin of the enlightening.

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,760
And design and nature can be boiled down

37
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,960
into two different things.

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,600
One, is there a creator?

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,720
Is there some intelligent being who

40
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,400
figured all this stuff out?

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,280
Or are we just the products of physical constraint?

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,360
I mean, is it the reason that knees look like hinges

43
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,200
is because that's the way it works?

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,800
Is the reason that we have so many

45
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,920
of the same kinds of eyes and everything

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,000
from giant squids to ourselves?

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,320
Is that just because of things that

48
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,600
are embedded within our developmental patterns in our DNA

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,440
and with evolution being an optimizing process,

50
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,080
that that's just what ends up under different selective

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
regimes.

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,360
So this has always been two different kinds of things

53
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,880
which people have looked at myself.

54
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,040
I'm more on the kind of just replicating piece of DNA.

55
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,560
And this is just the way that it works out as far as

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,960
the way that we deal with the world either through constraint.

57
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,560
When I say constraint, I see that it

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,960
through physical constraints from the external part

59
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,680
or through constraints just on the basis of what

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,760
that our genetic material is possible

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,800
to be able to do within certain kinds of things

62
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
along with our developmental channeling.

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,520
But some other people have some different opinions.

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
So let's open it up.

65
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,800
I would see that as not you kind of painted those two

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
as confouries, but you might ask about the constraints

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,280
themselves whether there's a design-like pattern

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,600
in those constraints.

69
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,240
And so you could have it and you have

70
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,120
to look at physical reality in different levels.

71
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,720
You've got the biological level down to the chemical level.

72
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,800
And the biological level seems to be, at least,

73
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,400
a lot of accidents seems to be one of the governing

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,080
principles.

75
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,080
But when you get all the way down to, let's say,

76
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,760
the physical level, that's where I think a real big question

77
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,040
comes in.

78
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,000
To what degree does that look random,

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,120
or is that have a design-like character?

80
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,680
And by design in a very general sense,

81
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,480
I would say that the parts, so you can invoke a crater,

82
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,580
but I think there's even a more general sense in which

83
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,880
the parts are arranged in some intricate way

84
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,240
so that they realize some easily recognizable

85
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,600
overall property.

86
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,280
And so in the case of, like, I work in the area,

87
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,920
fine-tuning of the cosmos for life,

88
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,840
and so there, things do seem to be extremely well-adjusted

89
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
so that life can exist.

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
I disagree.

91
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,840
I'll go ahead.

92
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Go ahead.

93
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
You go ahead.

94
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
Come back.

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,280
Well, I get the thing.

96
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,600
I know this understanding of design as you stated it,

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,760
but it is a novelty because English is, in fact,

98
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,120
a very, very young language.

99
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,640
Design is a very old concept.

100
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,120
The Council on Latin, the word signal means sign.

101
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
It is something that's discernible,

102
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,760
meaning to us, the observers.

103
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,480
And this observation, the sign, conveys a message,

104
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,800
which if followed, it means that it's useful to us.

105
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,480
Engineering, which is my education, comes from that.

106
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,960
It is about, OK, making better drawings.

107
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,880
And so that's design.

108
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,280
And where the image comes from, for example,

109
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,600
the shape of a leaf or the bend in a river,

110
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,760
is the observation.

111
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,520
Has nothing to do with who made that?

112
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,240
It is all about the observer getting the idea

113
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
that that observation is useful.

114
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,520
So that the observer with it, with the observation,

115
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,600
and with the artifact that comes from doing something,

116
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,480
acting, based on that observation,

117
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:38,360
the observer becomes a more empowered mover of itself

118
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,920
or himself on the landscape.

119
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,680
So that's design.

120
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,160
And so design is one of the most universal phenomena,

121
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,760
the most universal phenomenon of value to us that exists.

122
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,840
It's right there, or down there with gravity,

123
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,960
and with the irreversibility, the second law of dynamics.

124
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,640
That is design.

125
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,960
I agree with that entirely, but isn't that a lot,

126
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,160
because of its just constraint, that there's physical constraints?

127
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,040
Quite the opposite.

128
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,280
It's about freedom, not constraints,

129
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,480
without freedom.

130
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:20,440
On the contrary, without freedom, there's no discernible image,

131
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,240
no change in that image, no evolution.

132
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,280
And I think it speaks to this better than anyone,

133
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,920
because certainly, there is constraint

134
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,640
within the physical world, and stuff,

135
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,960
of what organisms are capable of doing

136
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,120
and not capable of doing.

137
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Sure.

138
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,640
I mean, the classic example of this

139
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,600
is the laryngeal nerve in the giraffe,

140
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,360
which this is a sort of a case study in evolutionary biology.

141
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,240
The laryngeal nerve in the giraffe branches off

142
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,760
the vagus nerve in the brain, travels all the way down

143
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,240
through some arteries in the heart,

144
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,200
and then back up the neck of the giraffe,

145
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,720
where it innervates the larynx.

146
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,280
Why would it travel all that way down and all the way back?

147
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
Well, it's just because of the constraint

148
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,800
from its ancestors.

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,480
So that design, if you could call it that,

150
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,400
evolved in our fish ancestors, and that constraint,

151
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,560
that physiological constraint remains in the giraffe,

152
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,400
even though it causes this bizarre morphology.

153
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,400
One of the, I think when you're speaking about freedom

154
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,360
that comes as part of design, and as an evolutionary genomist,

155
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,560
I think of that as variation, the raw variation,

156
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,120
that is necessary for adaptation.

157
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,880
And I think one of the interesting aspects

158
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,840
to consider when we think about nature

159
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,920
and whether, as the da Vinci quote that we were provided with,

160
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,880
suggests that nothing is extra in nature

161
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,520
because it's so finely designed for its environs.

162
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,400
If we look at the genome, say the human genome,

163
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,120
3 billion base pairs, 50% of that,

164
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,840
fully 50% of that is repetitive DNA with no known purpose.

165
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,000
So there's a lot of extra stuff out there in nature.

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,440
And surely it's shaped by constraint,

167
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,400
but it's that variation that allows freedom to adapt.

168
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,600
I think there's one we have, but we haven't spoken.

169
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,360
So I'm just biting my time.

170
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,120
Well, maybe just to, so I'm trying to understand

171
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,400
when you talk about freedom.

172
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,400
So I guess, you know, I come out of physics.

173
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,800
And so to me, all that we're talking about here

174
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,080
and what you've talked about, what you've talked about is,

175
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,720
you know, boils down to, well, the constraints,

176
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,400
there are constraints of, I don't want to use the word design.

177
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,480
Wow, that's terrible.

178
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,760
I don't want to use the word design.

179
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,600
Everything is finding its way through a complex energy landscape.

180
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,760
I mean, as a physicist, we always resort to this.

181
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,800
We always say, well, it's all about finding free energy to do work.

182
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,160
So our molecules are doing that all the time.

183
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,560
Our DNA is doing all that all the time.

184
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,120
It's the root of biological evolution at some level.

185
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,960
It is these organisms there.

186
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,720
They're exploring this vast chemical landscape

187
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,200
and where there is opportunity to extract free energy and do

188
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,920
work, it will happen.

189
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,760
And why is that?

190
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,000
Because the whole universe is driven

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,560
towards dissipation of energy, right?

192
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,880
And moving towards a higher entropy state.

193
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,680
And so I guess, is that the freedom that you see

194
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,240
is this vast energy landscape that everything

195
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
from the river to the molecule is exploring?

196
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,320
I will, OK, since I like that you stick the language

197
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,720
of thermodynamics.

198
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:08,120
I'll try to make it more readable to everybody.

199
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,640
The first of all, I like the title of your blog, Life Unbound It.

200
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,200
Here's a comment on the so-called constraint.

201
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,040
It does not exist, OK?

202
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:27,600
There's the space is to be accessed by these flows

203
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,400
that you bring up.

204
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,360
The flows that are driven by the power

205
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,960
that you bring up.

206
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,120
The so-called free energy, a much better name for that

207
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,280
is fuel or food for those of us who live on this planet,

208
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:46,880
is converted into the power by engines.

209
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,320
And most of the engines are natural, OK?

210
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,760
Animals are basically engines on the tracks.

211
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,720
And of course, we are now very likely

212
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,720
to be riding on engines made by smarter humans

213
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,080
20 years ago in Britain.

214
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,880
And in propelling as much, much more cheaply.

215
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,200
But the question that is not being addressed until now

216
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,600
is, what is that power coming from the free energy useful

217
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,320
for to what end?

218
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,120
And the end is, for greater, easier movement,

219
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,560
movement into this free space, NES, available time,

220
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,680
because obviously here I speak autobiographically,

221
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,480
I would like to live longer.

222
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,880
And so I could move more easily all over

223
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,840
and bring others along with me, you see?

224
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,160
So that's the tendency.

225
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:59,600
As Neil's board said, nature is about us.

226
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,040
It's about what we say about nature.

227
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,200
That's what's interesting.

228
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,680
So that's the beginning of a more inclusive picture

229
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,000
of the topic.

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,560
I read parts of your book.

231
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,280
And I had a question for you.

232
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,440
The constructional laws that things constructive.

233
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,600
Constructive.

234
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Constructive.

235
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,400
If you can say fractal, OK?

236
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,240
Constructal.

237
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,400
It's constructed.

238
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,000
So long is that things systems move towards more easier

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,520
and easier flow.

240
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,120
Use your greater access.

241
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,400
I like to, yeah.

242
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,720
So I mean, just a couple of really everyday examples.

243
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,120
My drain gets plugged up.

244
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,640
It seems like it's went from less easy flow

245
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,360
for easy flow to less easy flow, or arteries get clogged.

246
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,240
So how do you deal with examples like that?

247
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,480
Those examples are very different.

248
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,800
Your drain gets plugged up because your drain,

249
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,480
the pipe is not natural.

250
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,920
It is not free to morph, to morph,

251
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,840
to live with the incidental blockage.

252
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,680
The pipe is your artifact.

253
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,000
The drain is you, you're the human and machine specimen.

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,040
The river basin is the natural counterpart of your example.

255
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,760
In the river basin, I grew up under Daniel.

256
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,480
And I've been observing as a kid going fishing.

257
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,920
The river basin gets the tree log out of the way.

258
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,280
Tree logs do block the flow.

259
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,760
It does the sunken ship.

260
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,760
But the river, because it is free to morph,

261
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,720
because it is alive, is a flow architecture,

262
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,280
is a sign, is a thing that impresses you,

263
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,320
has the natural, the intrinsic property

264
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,280
of evolving to flow more easily.

265
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,920
So what about arteries?

266
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,400
Arrays?

267
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,600
Yeah, like people.

268
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,440
Same thing.

269
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,040
The artery also does its best until it's old enough

270
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,240
to split, to basically cause an aneurysm, to do all sorts of things.

271
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,200
But it seems to have gone from when you're younger,

272
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,120
your arteries are, there's more free flow.

273
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,760
So the evolution there seems to be from more free flow to less.

274
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,440
And that's what...

275
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,680
No, no, the life of a human being is no devolution.

276
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
It's called growth.

277
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,480
Many people in science confuse the life of the individual

278
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,040
with the evolution of the species.

279
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,640
No, evolution is about the...

280
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,160
Not sure we confuse it.

281
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,920
That's what we think is.

282
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,400
Right, it's part and parcel.

283
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,680
A single organism is one instance out of a vast evolutionary landscape, right?

284
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,880
And it's playing...

285
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,680
So I hear...

286
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,400
Are you suggesting that there's agency in a river or an arteries?

287
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,600
I mean, that's the sort of...

288
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,600
I hear that in the language, but I'm not sure that's what you're suggesting.

289
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,040
What is your definition of agency?

290
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,840
I mean, literally the dictionary definition of agency.

291
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,160
Well, you don't know, I'm asking you.

292
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,000
Are you saying...

293
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
No, I've used the word.

294
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,160
Because here's the word.

295
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,000
Is the river somehow deciding?

296
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,360
No, no, agency doesn't mean that.

297
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,240
Agency is essentially power.

298
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,280
Power, which is that that makes action possible.

299
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,560
Agency is not about the direction in which the design change

300
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,760
happens because of the power that is used.

301
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,000
The direction of the change in flow architecture,

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,760
because of that power you brought up the engines earlier,

303
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,920
that is actually the phenomenon of the evolution,

304
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,240
which is of all physics, and which is summarized by the constructive law of physics,

305
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,920
which is really the statement of everything that is...

306
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,360
that is finite size, not the quirk,

307
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,040
where you can tell some more invisible, finite size,

308
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,560
including the solar cell bodies,

309
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,320
has the...

310
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,160
In order to persist, which is to...

311
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,760
That means to live in physics,

312
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:18,040
it must evolve freely, freely, toward greater access.

313
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,480
Or in your example of the universe, toward the faster route to equilibrium,

314
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
which means death.

315
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,480
But why in a biological or an evolutionary context then?

316
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,560
I mean, if you take it back to looking at how evolution works,

317
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,960
why are there then unoccupied ecological spaces?

318
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,440
Because it's that if you...

319
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,280
I mean, we just did it for our students, we just did something

320
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,160
for an exhibit that we want to do,

321
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,560
and you can look at like a three-axis graph of...

322
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,560
Of it?

323
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,000
A three-axis projection of a bird egg, for instance,

324
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,840
and you can...

325
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,000
Like one axis is size, one axis is shape,

326
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
and the other axis is color.

327
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Okay.

328
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
The third is what?

329
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
Color.

330
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Color.

331
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Yeah.

332
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,400
And if you would look at it that from...

333
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,280
It could say, yeah, you know, that evolution is a great optimizing thing,

334
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,000
you would expect that the whole kind of thing would be filled in universally,

335
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
but it's not.

336
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,040
There's big, empty spaces in a lot of it.

337
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Right.

338
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Of where...

339
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Or just unoccupied ecological spaces.

340
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,560
And that's just one example.

341
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,160
I mean, people have recognized that for a long time,

342
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,840
and then once in a while some major evolutionary event happens,

343
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,000
I mean, previous to about 325 million years ago,

344
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,160
there was nothing that weighed over 20...

345
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,480
25, 30 grams that flew.

346
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,400
And then all of a sudden is that flying reptiles,

347
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,000
charasars evolved, and then also birds evolved,

348
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,920
then later on.

349
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,480
And then all of a sudden that was unoccupied ecological space

350
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,640
that became filled in.

351
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,840
And because of whatever happened, but nevertheless,

352
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,800
is that it's very...

353
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,760
It just doesn't go with this kind of thing,

354
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,760
it is always just that this undercurrent of...

355
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,600
I can respond to you by speaking a language that most people know,

356
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,560
which is that of looking at the river basin morphology, the map.

357
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,720
The wetland, the rain keeps falling, is wide open.

358
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,280
By the river channels, fall hierarchical,

359
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,800
happen only in the sun places.

360
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,720
There is lots of space that's not invaded by...

361
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,520
I mean, you call it design space.

362
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
It were...

363
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,480
Okay, for that my energy landscape.

364
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,720
There are lots of...

365
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,680
Most of it is actually not bathed.

366
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,680
And the reason is that in order to bathe with flow,

367
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,760
an area or a volume, the easiest,

368
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,400
meaning the greatest access to the entire space

369
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,600
is offered by a vasculature.

370
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,440
A vasculature.

371
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,840
This is why all these things that come up are happening.

372
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,840
You mentioned repetitive DNA in this theoretical infinity,

373
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,920
infinite space of DNA combinations.

374
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,600
The reason is that all DNA is not equal,

375
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,840
just like the words in a language.

376
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,680
Most of us speak basically hierarchy of words.

377
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,880
All of them, very few.

378
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,880
It's much smaller than the number than the main vocabulary.

379
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,720
Because that is the way to speak easiest

380
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,160
and the way to communicate with everybody else the fastest.

381
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,440
So you talk about these things that look the same,

382
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,520
that have two eyes, well, they had no eyes

383
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,440
before the Cambrian explosion.

384
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,280
But then...

385
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,960
But they're still limited by like the Aristingular history.

386
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,240
Is it all why I've said it from a common ancestor?

387
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,840
So we're stuck with that.

388
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,440
But let me just say one more thing, which is the punchline.

389
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,080
So when the eye occurred, obviously two eyes were better

390
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,760
because the world is flat.

391
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,760
These beings were perceiving the ambient, which is flat.

392
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,760
The two eyes were oriented this way, not this way.

393
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
And that's right.

394
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:10,760
And as soon as that happened, movement became immensely easier,

395
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,760
easier, safer, farther, just like after the invention of radar

396
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,760
in military aviation.

397
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,760
And so that's why you talked about the nature of optimizing things.

398
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,760
That's why this trade stayed.

399
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,760
The traits that are in fact inferior to existing alternatives

400
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
do not stay.

401
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
What works is kept.

402
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
That's evolution.

403
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,760
And it's a random up to a point.

404
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
That's kind of weird, Bill.

405
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,760
I find it a lot, I mean, you know, not an example.

406
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
You know, why are the...

407
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
I mean, we had...

408
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,760
It was bilateral symmetry in organisms, I think,

409
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
before complex eyes evolved.

410
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,760
I mean, there are other reasons for that.

411
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,760
I'm not an expert in evolution, but...

412
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Well, I mean, like, you know...

413
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Yeah, in terms of the repetitive DNA,

414
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,760
talking about the reason that exists in the genome,

415
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,760
certainly not all organisms have the degree of repetitive DNA

416
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,760
that mammals have, but it's thought that that's the result of

417
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,760
viral elements, viral DNA that, you know,

418
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,760
that actually come and insert genomic elements

419
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,760
that will copy DNA over and over,

420
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
and that's what they do for a living.

421
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,760
So, viral infection into your genome can result in many of those events.

422
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,760
So, you know, I think most people consider that to be a random process.

423
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Yeah, I mean, like birds, when it's since have tiny genomes

424
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
compared to mammals, and their ancestors' crocodiles have genomes,

425
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,760
which are not ancestors, but the closest living group to them

426
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,760
have genomes, which are far larger than birds are.

427
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Look, there is the river basin that has no genome,

428
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,760
yet it looks just like the human lung, okay?

429
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Yeah, but that's not a consequence.

430
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,760
That's nothing to do with it, because it's like that it doesn't have a singular history.

431
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,760
It's not related to every other river basin in the planet.

432
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
I think that's an example of...

433
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,760
So, people who study complex systems are always talking,

434
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,760
I'm sure you know this, that talk about scaling laws,

435
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,760
for example, that exist across all sorts of things.

436
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,760
So, there are scaling laws in biology between body mass and metabolism, right?

437
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,760
And it's across all organisms, and it's probably it's a result of some

438
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,760
approximate optimization process, but it's still playing out

439
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
over billions of years of evolution.

440
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,760
It's the same scaling law that exists in language.

441
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,760
It's called the Zip Law, right?

442
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,760
It's the word use frequency versus, you know,

443
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
the...

444
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
So, you know, these are all...

445
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,760
I think as a physicist, I would say that a lot of what you're talking about,

446
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,760
the rivers and so on, yes, there are similarities to biological systems,

447
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,760
but they're for slightly different reasons.

448
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,760
They're not because of inherited traits, right?

449
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
They're because of...

450
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,760
And this perhaps gets back to the universal idea of design,

451
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,760
that there are these emergent scaling laws, these emergent relationships,

452
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:22,760
because of the underlying nature of systems driven by, you know,

453
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,760
finding their way through some energy landscape of optimization,

454
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
of efficiency and so on, right?

455
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
I mean, the same...

456
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,760
I think these scaling rules also apply to a circulatory system, right?

457
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
Right.

458
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,760
And things like the species area curve, how many species you find in, you know,

459
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,760
one square meter versus 100 square meters?

460
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
Right.

461
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Let me try to clarify the words we speak.

462
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,760
These scaling laws that you mentioned are not laws of physics.

463
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,760
They are compact mathematical summaries, also known as correlations,

464
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
of observations.

465
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,760
The law of physics is the purely mental viewing that empowers one to predict

466
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,760
such correlations.

467
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,760
And that is what I do.

468
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,760
And along the way, what I predict is not only the correlations,

469
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,760
and all these things you bring up, including zips,

470
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,760
I predict why, at one point, the so-called correlation should break down,

471
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,760
because, yes, there is a scaling law to the many, many ramifications

472
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:29,760
in the human life, but with a constructive law, I predict that the cutoff should be 23

473
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
branching levels.

474
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,760
That is the power of a law of physics.

475
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,760
So, yes, most of my colleagues use the word law when, in fact,

476
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:46,760
they're talking about an empirical activity, which is that of making a more

477
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,760
compact, a huge volume of observations.

478
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,760
The law of physics does that one better.

479
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,760
It makes even more compact a huge number of these correlations.

480
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,760
I'm just going to go back to something previous.

481
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
I said you disagree about the finding too.

482
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,760
I want to further take on it.

483
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Well, I mean, would it be useful if you explain, do you want to explain a little

484
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
bit what point is and then I can.

485
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,760
OK, so what's been discussed pretty much since the 70s has been what's called

486
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,760
anthropic fine tuning, and that the universe is, in many ways, the fundamental

487
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,760
structure precisely set so that life can exist at least somewhere

488
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
in the universe.

489
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,760
OK, and I usually like to refer to the kind of life is what I call embodied

490
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,760
conscious agents, which would be a generalized version of what we are.

491
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,760
And so you could do this on different levels.

492
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,760
There's the laws of nature, the very general principles like the law of

493
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,760
gravity or that, unlike charges repel each other.

494
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
And there has to be the right set of those.

495
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,760
If you like pulled off the law of gravity, there wouldn't be any masses

496
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,760
when clumped together and obviously you wouldn't get highly complex beings like

497
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,760
us and would also be stars, which are the energy sources for them.

498
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,760
And then another, the post-discussed area of this is on what they call the

499
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
fundamental parameters of physics.

500
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:27,760
So those would be like the mass of the proton or even more fundamental than that

501
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,760
is the mass of the up and down quarks, which compose the proton.

502
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,760
Other examples would be the strength of gravity as not just the strength on any

503
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:47,760
given planet, but that constant g in Newton's law that f equals g, the mass,

504
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,760
first mass times the second mass divided by the distance between m squared,

505
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
that's all.

506
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,760
There's a number for that and you can express that for those who have physics

507
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,760
training, you can express that in what's called dimensionalist units.

508
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
You don't actually have to refer to units there.

509
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,760
But anyhow, it's a number that gives the strength of gravity.

510
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,760
There's a number that gives the strength of the electromagnetic force, the strong

511
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
nuclear force, et cetera.

512
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:19,760
And those have to be precisely adjusted over vast ranges of possibilities in order

513
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,760
to have a universe that allows for what I would say would be life more

514
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,760
generally stable, reproducible complexity.

515
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,760
And I can give more examples than those.

516
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,760
There's lots of examples you can give, but that's the general idea.

517
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Right.

518
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,760
And I think, yeah, what I'll get to why I sort of made my squeak of that objective.

519
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,760
What's so interesting about that as part of this topic of design and nature is that

520
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:57,760
it could be construed to mean that everything was set up, as you say,

521
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,760
to be just so in order to enable the production of things like stars in the

522
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,760
cosmos, which in turn produced heavy elements in just the right abundancies

523
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:12,760
to ultimately make planets with chemical compositions that allow for the sort of

524
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,760
complexity that life can emerge from.

525
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,760
And I've been interested in that for a while.

526
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,760
And what's interesting to me, actually, is that now we come back and look at it

527
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,760
with a little more scrutiny.

528
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:35,760
And I'll explain this as well, that fine tuning is probably not so fine at all,

529
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:43,760
which negates some of this idea that the universe is perfect for life or just

530
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,760
appears to be perfect for that one instance of, you know, cognizant life that

531
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
you talk about.

532
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
So I have two things to say.

533
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,760
And one is to do with people's investigations of that quite recently that

534
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,760
seem to suggest the universe is not fine-tuned particularly well.

535
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,760
And the other piece of it is, I think you can flip it around and, you know,

536
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,760
it's predicated on the notion of life being a very particular thing, right,

537
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,760
carbon-based organisms somewhat like us.

538
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,760
And the truth is we don't know whether you can build life out of other

539
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
building blocks or not.

540
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Suppose you can't.

541
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,760
Suppose life can be more general as a phenomenon.

542
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,760
It can come together out of any set of building blocks that allow for

543
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,760
sufficient complexity, right, and maybe that's, I mean, everybody always says

544
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,760
silicon, but silicon probably isn't a very good element to be involved in this,

545
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
but it could be.

546
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,760
You know, then that could conceivably change the perception of the universe

547
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,760
being particularly well-fined-tuned.

548
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,760
But I just wanted to say, and this is why I sort of, you know, got excited when

549
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,760
you mentioned it, that, you know, so the hands are very, very

550
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
important.

551
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,760
You know, so there has been recent work on this from the physics end.

552
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,760
You may well be aware of it, but for example, you mentioned the relative

553
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,760
strength or the strength of gravity, right, and so one of those

554
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,760
dimensionless quantities is the strength of gravity to the strength of

555
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
electromagnetic forces.

556
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,760
That ratio has been deemed in the past as something that if that was changed

557
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,760
just a little bit, you couldn't make things like stars, right, because a star

558
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,760
is essentially a competition between gravity and electromagnetic forces.

559
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,760
It's in a sort of dynamic equilibrium as matter comes together.

560
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,760
And so the argument has been, well, if you changed gravity a little bit or you

561
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,760
changed electromagnetic, magnetism a tiny bit, you just wouldn't make stars,

562
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,760
and all that then follows.

563
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,760
But recent investigation of that suggests that in fact, you could still make

564
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,760
stars, even if you change the strength of electromagnetism by maybe a factor

565
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,760
of a thousand, and if you change the strength of gravity, the G constant,

566
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,760
by up to a million, or maybe even 10 million, that space, that parameter

567
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,760
space still allows for stars to form in the universe.

568
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Now they might be different than the stars we used to, they might be about

569
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,760
bigger, but they would still go through the same cycle of nuclear

570
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,760
fusion and element production.

571
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,760
And to me, that's really interesting, if that's true, because it means that at

572
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,760
least one piece of the fine tuning argument, I know there are other factors

573
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,760
to that, other fundamental properties, if you tweak them a little bit,

574
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
would be seemingly problematic.

575
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,760
But that suggests to me that it's, first of all, maybe the universe isn't

576
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,760
particularly well tuned for life as we know it.

577
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,760
I mean, we don't actually know, because we've only got the one instance that we

578
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
know about right here on the Earth.

579
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,760
So we don't know whether this is a fertile universe or not a fertile

580
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
universe.

581
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:09,760
And that, to me, would change, suppose 500 years ago, or 400 years ago,

582
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,760
first telescopes, we just saw life everywhere.

583
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,760
Everybody had big neon signs out across the universe saying, we are here.

584
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,760
What are you up to?

585
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
Oh, yeah, Renaissance.

586
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
Lovely.

587
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,760
We had that, you know, a thousand years earlier.

588
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,760
Then we'd have lived with a universe replete with living organisms,

589
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,760
and I'm not even sure the question would come up that the universe was fine-tuned.

590
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,760
If what, I didn't quite catch the last scenario.

591
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Suppose the universe, we knew we had known that the universe was packed with

592
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,760
life, that the planet everywhere, and all of them had life, and it was all

593
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,760
sophisticated, technological, it had evolved in many different ways, and so on.

594
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,760
I just wonder whether we'd even ask the question.

595
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,760
And the thing is, we don't know how fertile the universe is.

596
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
So sorry, I'm loading this with lots of...

597
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,760
One thing I want to say, okay, start with a response to your second point you made

598
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
about assuming carbon-based life.

599
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Most of the arguments actually don't.

600
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,760
For example, the fine-tuning of the cosmological constant, which governs the

601
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,760
expansion rate of space, that simply, if it wasn't within a very small range,

602
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,760
typically estimate as one part in 10 to the 120th power, very, very small number,

603
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,760
that the universe would expand too rapidly for galaxies and stars to form,

604
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,760
so there just wouldn't be planets, there wouldn't be stars, and then you're not even

605
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,760
going to get any kind of complexity.

606
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Or if you looked at the level of laws, if you didn't have like this,

607
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,760
strong nuclear force was long-range force, wasn't just right, you wouldn't have atoms.

608
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,760
And concerning your case, so first of all, I say, the more general, if somebody's

609
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,760
correctly formulating this, most cases won't involve, are not simply focused on

610
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
carbon-based life.

611
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,760
There was that case with Fred Hoyle initially with the carbon and oxygen,

612
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,760
but most of them aren't.

613
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:14,760
And the second thing, in the example you mentioned of the star, I don't think that

614
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,760
it's just whether stars could exist or not with the gravitational-constra-fying

615
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
structure constant.

616
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,760
It wasn't just a matter of whether stars could exist, but whether they would have

617
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,760
right temperature last long enough for life to exist.

618
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,760
And there's also, if you change those, there's planetary effects, like the ability to

619
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,760
retain an atmosphere if you increase the strength of gravity, it can fairly easy

620
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,760
to show that you're forced into increasing the surface force on a planet to retain

621
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
an atmosphere.

622
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,760
And so, you know, gravity is very weak as a force.

623
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,760
If you didn't dimensionless units, about one in ten to the 38th power of the

624
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:06,760
strong nuclear force, and if you increase gravity by, let's say, a thousandfold,

625
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:14,760
then only planets have 30 times the surface force strength of experience, it would be

626
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,760
less, a lot less, I think, ideal for our kind of life.

627
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,760
So, I think you can, the argument actually, when you start talking about the conditions

628
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,760
being even optimal, you might even be able to get light, but it's going to be, as you

629
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,760
increase the surface force, it's going to be a lot harder to do much of anything.

630
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:41,760
So, I would agree that figuring out all these secondary ramifications is tough, right?

631
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,760
And it may be that you would eliminate regions of this expanded parameter space.

632
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,760
But, no, I mean, the example I gave, that range, and I'm sorry, is just getting into

633
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,760
sort of horribly specific physics. So, we should veer off from this again.

634
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,760
That range I gave for strength of gravity, strength of electromagnetism, is the range

635
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,760
from which you would derive sufficiently long-lived stars with the right sort of

636
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,760
properties to produce, as far as we can tell, I mean, you'd have to run a lot of

637
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:23,760
physics simulations, an abundance of heavier elements, not so dissimilar to what we

638
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,760
have at the moment. No, I mean, I raised it, not really just to sort of attack this idea,

639
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,760
but it's interesting to me that, you know, and maybe this almost relates to what you

640
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,760
would say, I mean, we impose design on things, right? That's us.

641
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,760
The universe may have nothing to do with that, right?

642
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,760
We tend to impose design more than anything else.

643
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,760
Here's Adam, this is what you just look at, a range of physically possible values,

644
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,760
and then you look at those values that are allowed for complexity, and some of them are

645
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,760
very straight, much more straightforward, you don't have to run the kind of simulations

646
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,760
which we like the concept. Yeah, I mean, I think the cosological concept is a good one.

647
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,760
It's much more straightforward. Right, right. And the other ones are the

648
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,760
planetary effects of change in gravity are pretty straightforward.

649
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,760
But, we bring it back to this idea just how messy all this stuff is, basically.

650
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,760
I mean, the best example of that is, I mean, even if you bought into the creator

651
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,760
kind of stuff, that Adam and Eve, everything, I mean, it's looking around, we all look

652
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,760
different, we wouldn't, because DNA replication is incredibly

653
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,760
messy, and that there's, you know, all of these things,

654
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,760
whether it's, you know, talking about things within the aspect of the beginning

655
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,760
of the universe, to, like, you know, things that, like, you know,

656
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,760
e.coli mutating in petri dishes around the city in different labs.

657
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,760
I mean, there's a lot of messiness and a lot of stochastic kind of things that just

658
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,760
happened to all of these things. And if it weren't messy, we wouldn't beat him.

659
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Exactly. Well, let me, I don't know if you were.

660
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,760
No, I was just going to add to that. And we, as I think you're saying,

661
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,760
are predisposed to see the design and everything, even if

662
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,760
it's created by random processes with, you know,

663
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,760
additional constraints on top. And that's part of not just our brains, but animal brains

664
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,760
in general, that are designed to look for pattern. That itself is adaptive.

665
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Because the brain or any other

666
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,760
such organ is the finite size and

667
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,760
can only do this little in order to enable the moving

668
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,760
vehicle. I've been listening to your discussion.

669
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,760
I don't, I don't, I don't use a lot of our brain. Well, so if you say it's

670
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,760
too small, why don't we use more of it? No, the point I'm making is

671
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,760
that from one generation to the next, we

672
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,760
were exposed to more information, more observations,

673
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,760
reams and reams of this. And of course we

674
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,760
absorb it in the forms of principles and the correlations, but not

675
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,760
number by number in the immense volumes of

676
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,760
tables of data. We, we become

677
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,760
more knowledgeable through, through hierarchical

678
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,760
not through mindless accumulation of volume.

679
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,760
That was the point I was making. I wanted to contribute this discussion

680
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,760
because several points were made here.

681
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,760
The, first of all, I was learning from the

682
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,760
exchange between the two of you, which is basically about physics. The topic today

683
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,760
is Design in Nature, which is something that is familiar to everyone.

684
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,760
It's something for us mortals here, somewhere halfway

685
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,760
between the stars and the protons and the quarks.

686
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,760
Now, many people, as you

687
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,760
implied, equate the

688
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,760
quark, the proton and the infinitesimal with, quote,

689
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,760
even more fundamental. Smaller

690
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,760
does not mean more fundamental. Fundamental fundus in Latin means

691
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,760
at bottom. Look at the Statue of Liberty, the pedestal

692
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,760
is bigger than the statue. The thing,

693
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,760
or the fire brick in Roman architecture, is

694
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,760
finite size. You can kill a man with it. And it is fundamental

695
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,760
because before that, the buildings are really,

696
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,760
really miserable and crumbling earthquakes and so forth.

697
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,760
Most of them, but not after the fire brick. You have

698
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,760
these vaults. You have architecture of a different kind. After the fire

699
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,760
brick came, the steel reinforced concrete all over this country,

700
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,760
skyscrapers and iron bridges. Okay? So

701
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
that's fundamental. A

702
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,760
finite size elemental construct,

703
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,760
this thing, the brick, the steel in the cement.

704
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,760
These are fundamental because they are

705
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,760
literally at the bottom of

706
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,380
the

707
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,760
surface. So, in science, unfortunately, language

708
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,760
basically has a life of its own.

709
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Some words are so useful that they end up being used,

710
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,760
actually misused in other places.

711
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,760
The life

712
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,760
carbon based. Of course, that's the view if you

713
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,760
equate the design nature only with

714
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,760
animals, with the biosphere, you see.

715
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,760
But the design nature is general. It's not about that.

716
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,760
So, there's a famous question, what is life?

717
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,760
And I think the answer is very easy if you know

718
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,760
thermodynamics. Because in

719
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,760
thermodynamics, this is the part of physics that had to be born after

720
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,760
the steam engine, the

721
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,760
heat engine, 200 years ago.

722
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,760
So, this is actually Maxwell in Cambridge.

723
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,760
One of the key concepts in physics is that of

724
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,760
the dead state. Death is

725
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,760
resolved as an answer to a question in physics.

726
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,760
Dead means in a system, which means this that you're discussing.

727
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,760
That system is in the dead state. If in it, nothing

728
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,760
moves. That also means nothing morphs. Nothing changes.

729
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,760
Well, the antonym of that is the

730
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,760
life state of a system. It is a system in a

731
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,760
state occupied by flow, meaning

732
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,760
movement. And the change. Change in configuration.

733
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,760
I mentioned earlier change cannot happen without freedom to change.

734
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,760
That's another basic concept in physics.

735
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,760
Process means change. Change of state from this

736
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,760
being of, say, the part of water

737
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,760
to this other being of the part of water.

738
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,760
So, all these things together, taking us from what everybody

739
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,760
understands and accepts, which is dead state in physics.

740
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,760
Life state, the antonym of the first. And then

741
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,760
change in state, which happens because of freedom. That change is evolution.

742
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,760
And the direction of that change is not the haphazard.

743
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,760
It is in one direction, which is that of

744
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,760
changes that facilitate

745
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,760
the occurrence of configurations that

746
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,760
offer greater access. Or all the way to

747
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,760
more efficiency, to smarter economics,

748
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,760
to faster speech, or cheaper communicating between entities that want

749
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,760
to communicate. Or the fact that it is

750
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,760
called economies of scale. The fact that it is easier to move as a group

751
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,760
not as individuals. And on and on, and this is the

752
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,760
river water, the two people entering the stadium,

753
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,760
this is physics. It's everything

754
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,760
showing the same tendency to morph and to surprise the observer

755
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,760
with surprisingly the same kind of pattern.

756
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,760
Pattern is not designed.

757
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,760
Design is a flow configuration with

758
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,760
freedom, but also with a message.

759
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,760
I get the impression the way you talk

760
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,760
is that all of these questions

761
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,760
that are being raised and all of the debates that are happening

762
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,760
that you seem to present it as if you already have all the answers.

763
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,760
And I'm a little bit puzzled by that because

764
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,760
obviously these are unsettled issues.

765
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,760
Well look, since you put it that way, I have to respond by the way.

766
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,760
That goes without saying.

767
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,760
No. On the contrary.

768
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,760
I'm the ignorant who

769
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,760
came to this very old and big

770
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,760
table of discussion. I'm talking about in physics, in biology.

771
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,760
I'm from engineering. I'm a person who

772
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,760
basically was not supposed to be here. But it so happens.

773
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,760
You are here. No, I'm talking about the

774
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,760
in... It is only now that I published, meaning

775
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,760
20 years ago, I published in physics in biology. Previously I was preaching to the

776
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,760
choir. My peers in engineering

777
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,760
get it. They are simply not invited to discussions on

778
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,760
design, even though the word meaning

779
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,760
design is what people do. Incidentally,

780
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,760
this thing with the signal in Latin, then it became

781
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,760
design in Italian. The west got

782
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,760
the science that we cherish today from

783
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,760
the Renaissance. That's how we really got it. And then through the French,

784
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,760
so it means the sign. It doesn't mean

785
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,760
the act of designing something and making it.

786
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,760
That's something totally different. Design happens.

787
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,760
But to finish your point, when I started

788
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,760
to talk about the physics of evolution,

789
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,760
in this most general sense, not as chemistry of carbon,

790
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,760
in the most general sense, I was surprised

791
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,760
to hear from my peers, those who came to the construct

792
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,760
a look from physics in biology, that what I'm telling them from

793
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,760
my direction is in fact

794
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,760
not only familiar to them, but it covers

795
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,760
what the contemporary scientists regard as known

796
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,760
in their various compartments like departments on a campus

797
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,760
that do not talk to each other. So that's the reason... I think good questions.

798
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,760
I want to go back to a previous comment.

799
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,760
You made about that the brain is

800
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,760
programmed to see design in nature.

801
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,760
Now, one could take that as the brain is

802
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,760
programmed to mislead us because there's not near as much design

803
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,760
in nature as the brain seems to want to think. In certain areas

804
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,760
that's certainly true.

805
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,760
But I would want to point out that from the

806
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,760
time of the scientific revolution, you can, I could cite Morris Klein on this

807
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,760
who said the assumption everybody was making

808
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,760
was that

809
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,760
since the time of the Pythagoreans that nature was mathematically designed, meaning

810
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,760
in particular mathematically put together to realize

811
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,760
elegant mathematics. And that, during the

812
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,760
last century, ever since then, has been just enormously fruitful.

813
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,760
You have people like Paul Dirac, one of the

814
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,760
major founders of quantum mechanics, says, you know, the equation must be beautiful.

815
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,760
It's more important than even that experiment because sometimes when they pursued

816
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,760
beauty in the equations and they seemed to conflict with the experiment

817
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,760
later it turned out to be correct. That was Einstein's approach.

818
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,760
It was...look, he would actually, as

819
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,760
major biographer said, he would think of it. Even though he didn't believe in a

820
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,760
idea that he would think to himself, if I were God, what would I do?

821
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,760
In other words, how would be the most beautiful mathematics

822
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,760
to put this together? And that was a guide for him.

823
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,760
And it's been a continual guide and a very successful one.

824
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,760
So I wouldn't want to make the inference that a brain being...

825
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,760
I think we have to resist the inference. That means it's going to mislead us. It's actually amazing

826
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,760
that that kind of idea has been so successful.

827
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,760
At an area we wouldn't expect it because if

828
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,760
it was programmed to...for reproductive

829
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,760
success to see design and everything and to see these elegant

830
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,760
patterns, we wouldn't initially expect

831
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,760
it to work at the underlying level when the mathematics is

832
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,760
far removed from what we see

833
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,760
on the everyday level.

834
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,760
I think I would also understand you that some of the mathematical

835
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,760
beauty may not be as...

836
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,760
I think there is enormous

837
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,760
beauty in this context for mathematics. I think it's very interesting

838
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,760
point that you raised. As you were talking, I was thinking about this

839
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,760
and thinking, okay, so why do we do this? Why do our brains

840
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,760
do this? Is it because, you know, again,

841
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,760
we've evolved presumably like other species

842
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,760
so that our brains are part of a data

843
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,760
processing system, right? And we're bombarded

844
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,760
by millions of pieces of information all the time for every

845
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,760
nerve ending, everything we see, everything we hear, smell,

846
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,760
you know, pheromones that are floating around

847
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,760
in this room that triggers what's the thing. And it's a lot to handle, right?

848
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,760
But, you know, there's a tiger waiting to eat me over there

849
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,760
so I'd better make some good judgment decisions

850
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,760
and I just... you know, this is a very naive way of thinking about it.

851
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,760
I suspect, but is that... does that seem like a plausible

852
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,760
reason why we see patterns, we see

853
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,760
beauty in certain equations? There was some

854
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,760
report very recently talking about the study of people doing math

855
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,760
and I think even looking at FMRI scans, why they were solving

856
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,760
mathematical puzzles and getting that pleasure,

857
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,760
I don't know if it was dopamine or whatever, does that

858
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,760
make sense? Yeah, I'll just mention a quick example

859
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,760
from Fish. Obviously, where our brains are

860
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,760
more complex and understanding our predispositions

861
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,760
is more complicated, but there's a very lovely

862
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,760
long-term study of guppies in Trinidad and these guppies,

863
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,760
I'm sure a lot of you have had guppies as pets, they have these beautiful

864
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,760
tails, very colorful, and the tails are...

865
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,760
the males have the colorful tails and it's thought that these are to attract

866
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,760
females. The females choose the males based on the color of the tails, which are

867
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,760
kind of this bright orange color in this particular area.

868
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,760
And so for a long time the research was completely focused

869
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,760
on why the females prefer these beautiful colorful

870
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,760
tails, and it's lovely, they look designed, right?

871
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,760
And then some smart team came along and thought

872
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,760
to examine what the guppies were eating and it turned out that

873
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,760
these guppies prefer these orange berries that

874
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,760
fall into the river that have a very similar color and

875
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,760
pattern to the males' tails. So it turned out the females,

876
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,760
some neurological level, had a preference for orange, for this bright orange color

877
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,760
of the males' tails, and that on an evolutionary time scale got translated

878
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,760
into a preference for males with these bright orange tails.

879
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,760
So something that looks completely unrelated, turns out...

880
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,760
How does that apply to humans? Yes, good question.

881
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,760
Maybe somebody with a...

882
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,760
So how does that connect up with our brain spin program to see

883
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,760
that there may be at an evolutionary time scale some

884
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,760
predisposition due to selective

885
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,760
forces that we don't see around us anymore,

886
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,760
but that may have been part of our evolutionary history.

887
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,760
It still would be the case that why would we expect that to work

888
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,760
in areas that are so far removed from

889
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,760
what helps us in our long evolutionary past

890
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,760
survive, namely at this fundamental mathematical level, which is actually

891
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,760
very abstract. That's why people have a lot of

892
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,760
difficulty learning quantum mechanics or general relativity

893
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,760
because the mathematics is far different from even...

894
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,760
It's a difficulty explaining how we can even do mathematics in the normal

895
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,760
from an evolutionary perspective. People have worked on that.

896
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,760
But that's the ordinary counting fractions.

897
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,760
That sort of mathematics is very far removed. And as Eugene Vigner wrote a famous essay

898
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,760
on this, as you pointed out, it's chosen. The mathematics

899
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,760
is chosen for its elegance and fruitfulness mathematically

900
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,760
in being able to, let's say, solve equations. And so why would it work so

901
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,760
well there? That's the puzzle I'm pointing to.

902
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,760
I guess, I mean, you know, quantum mechanics...

903
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,760
Right, I mean, to do quantum mechanics you have to know...

904
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,760
I mean, mathematics as we have it.

905
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,760
And so I'm just...

906
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:08,760
Yeah, we see quantum mechanics

907
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,760
but that beauty wasn't arrived at like that.

908
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,760
No, but the mathematics, using that mathematics with the complex numbers

909
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,760
was developed before the arrival of quantum mechanics

910
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,760
and it's essential, either that or something isomorphic

911
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,760
to it, is essential for quantum mechanics. And that was developed because it was

912
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,760
enormously fruitful and complex numbers are real number, plus

913
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,760
an imaginary number which you could think of as a square root of negative 1.

914
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,760
And so they were developed because it was enormously one reason

915
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,760
you can solve like third order or more

916
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,760
or any polynomial using imaginary numbers, but you can't using the real numbers.

917
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,760
There's no... And so the normal...

918
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,760
enormously fruitful algebraically and in other ways.

919
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,760
And it was developed all independently yet for aesthetic reasons

920
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,760
because of its mathematical fruitfulness and yet that's just the system

921
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,760
that nature is

922
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,760
the mathematics that suits nature.

923
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,760
I wanted to just... you didn't finish your point about the fish.

924
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,760
No, it was pretty much finished.

925
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,760
Yeah, I'm hoping that somebody that used a little bit more about the fish and brain

926
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,760
could take it a little further.

927
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,760
The conclusion being that in terms of

928
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,760
what was making the female fish choose

929
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,760
that, that that was...

930
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,760
was not really a design, it was more something else.

931
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,760
Right, there was a predisposition that looked to us to be

932
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,760
sort of design related at first glance but turned out to have

933
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,760
a deeper evolutionary history that shaped

934
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,760
this preference based on food.

935
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,760
So the ability, maybe the thrill of adding

936
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,760
two numbers together is related

937
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,760
to the ability to think, oh, if I go over there I get

938
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,760
two berries instead of one berry.

939
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,760
I'm going to talk to our colleagues at Columbia and say, very

940
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,760
Candel and stuff is like that he's made his career.

941
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,760
One was in the world prize just on the basis of how that

942
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,760
every single interaction you ever have, everything you ever look at,

943
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,760
not just changes your brain chemically, it changes it physically,

944
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,760
is that new synapses become larger and hotter.

945
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,760
And that there's been a huge amount, I mean, basically we know about the brains of

946
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,760
three things, kind of, we know some about humor, we know some about

947
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,760
mouse, we know a little bit about sea elegance, if you want to say they have a brain or not,

948
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,760
and then a little bit about zebrafish, but certainly I mean they've been

949
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,760
able to demonstrate that in some experimental organisms as well. So like that

950
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,760
we can talk about this set of complex mathematics but

951
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,760
these are relatively new things that are basically the things that have come since

952
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,760
Newton's time. And that, so our brains, when we look at mathematics

953
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,760
today, look fundamentally different than somebody who would have thought

954
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,760
about those same sorts of problems before those mathematics were different.

955
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,760
And not just in a chemical way, I'm just studying and understanding it, but in a physical way as well.

956
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:28,760
I wanted to bring the discussion back to

957
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,760
design and nature and respond to

958
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,760
things you brought up or actually both of you. Why

959
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:40,760
is the brain program as well to

960
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,760
detect pattern? You see that, by the way,

961
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,760
right now in the famous story about the NSA

962
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,760
using big data in order to discern

963
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,760
patterns that are useful. And that's the answer to your second point

964
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,760
about beauty, okay? Why is the pattern useful to the

965
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,760
NSA so that the government could act faster

966
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,760
in the direction of protecting all of us. The same with

967
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,760
the animal, obviously one million years

968
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,760
after another million learning that what is good

969
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,760
for it is actually

970
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,760
pleasure because to live is the option that we all like as opposed

971
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,760
to becoming the victim. And so beauty

972
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,760
in physics is a part of this evolutionary

973
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,760
design, meaning changes that we make

974
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,760
every day and how we move in order to get going, to go

975
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,760
through life easier. We like a simple equation

976
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,760
because we get it and we move on. My best example

977
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,760
is why statistics has been proven that most people

978
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,760
like to look at images shaped like this. Like

979
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,760
the business card where like the computer screen or like the screen of the cinema.

980
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,760
The shape happens to have a length to hide ratio

981
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,760
approximately the same as the golden ratio. That's a

982
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,760
coincidence. But why do people like this shape?

983
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,760
Why? Because this is the area that's the easiest, the fastest

984
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,760
to scan with two eyes, okay? This is the animal

985
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,760
in the business of surviving and getting out of the

986
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,760
way of the predator and looking at the world which is flat.

987
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,760
This is why the animal has two eyes on the horizontal and by the way

988
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,760
the area, the ocular area of the two eyes

989
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,760
is an area approximated by this shape. And that is

990
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,760
then the beauty which goes hand in hand with locomotion

991
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,760
and with greater access and with the survival.

992
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,760
So you have the intangibles like beauty as of course

993
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,760
all the way to economics that actually belongs in physics,

994
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,760
so I'm sorry.

995
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,760
I'm just wondering if anybody comment

996
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,760
on evolutionary biologists. On

997
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,760
Simon Conway morosis thesis I'm just wondering which, because that's I think

998
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,760
very relevant to the discussion here of that.

999
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,760
That the built in constraints already there from physics,

1000
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,760
chemistry, etc. makes certain, almost inevitable

1001
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,760
certain kinds of organisms. So he's bucking the idea

1002
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,760
particularly popularized by Stephen J. Gould

1003
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,760
that if you ran the evolutionary tape over again

1004
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,760
you'd get very, very different types of life forms and

1005
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,760
that would be a miracle to get, a miracle in the sense of being

1006
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,760
a very, very improbable occurrence to get beings like us

1007
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:52,760
with our level of intelligence. But he thinks that

1008
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,760
the evidence of convergence of things like the compound eye occurring

1009
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,760
independently many different times in evolutionary history

1010
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,760
indicate that these sorts of things

1011
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,760
are much more inevitable than we once thought.

1012
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,760
So there is a sort of inevitable set of patterns that are going to occur in nature

1013
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,760
despite a lot of the

1014
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,760
accidental character of mutations. And I'm wondering what you think of that piece

1015
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,760
and the comments you have on. I would certainly agree with Simon on that one

1016
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,760
because I think that the evidence of convergence is so great that we can see

1017
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,760
that the same kinds of teeth of occurring

1018
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,760
in different kinds of vertebrates who eat similar kinds of things

1019
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,760
that are totally unrelated from one another. We see that the same kinds of

1020
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:44,760
what I was alluding to before of these empty ecological spaces that are occurring

1021
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,760
and lots of different groups be they insects, be they bats, be they birds

1022
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,760
which occur over and over and over again. I mean that there is

1023
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,760
something which is just some physical constraint which is keeping

1024
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,760
it out of that select that

1025
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,760
we see things like that the sizes and shapes of eggs something that

1026
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,760
our lab has studied and things that you see that

1027
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,760
different groups which have lots of different sizes, lots of different kinds of things that they

1028
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,760
come up with the same shapes all the time. So they don't go way out of bounds.

1029
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,760
So it's really a

1030
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,760
I mean I think that if you were having the evolutionary tape over again

1031
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:28,760
we might not be mammals, we might not be related to things. Maybe we

1032
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,760
wouldn't exist but the kinds of biodiversity you see on the planet would be partitioned

1033
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,760
pretty much the same way. Just like what was partitioned with totally different animals

1034
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:40,760
during the Paleozoic period 200 million years ago and then when

1035
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,760
the big extinction at the end of the Paleozoic it came back

1036
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,760
during the Cretaceous period with the same kinds of reefs that came back again in the

1037
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,760
Cenozoic as well with the same kinds of reefs the animals to a

1038
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,760
non-biologist would look pretty much the same but they're totally unrelated to one another.

1039
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:00,760
I would add I contribute

1040
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,760
the addendum that it's

1041
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:09,760
this thing that you're describing is actually predictable and it's not only about the population of these beings

1042
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,760
but actually the movement of these beings

1043
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,760
the locomotion is in fact the physics. The shape of the egg is

1044
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,760
physics is predictable. The frequency of the egg laying

1045
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,760
is physics and is predictable.

1046
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,760
And the as the configuration of animal mass movement on the globe is

1047
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,760
no different than the vascular configuration of

1048
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,760
the movement of all the other water which is much older which is the water in the river basin

1049
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,760
or the movement of air currents on the

1050
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,760
surface of the globe. It's hierarchical and

1051
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,760
with design. I did some reading

1052
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,760
about my colleagues here and I developed

1053
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,760
the questions and one is to you if you'd like to address it because time is running short.

1054
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,760
Would you comment on two things. One

1055
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,760
I hear my colleagues in academia

1056
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,760
ringing their hands about the conflict between science and religion

1057
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,760
that's one and second about your own interest

1058
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,760
and specialty and a theory of atonement.

1059
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,760
Well I think the theory of atonement

1060
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,760
is going to be somewhat off topic but if you want me to comment on it I can

1061
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,760
but in terms of is there a conflict between science

1062
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,760
and religion I would say no I think science and religion

1063
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,760
at a deeper level there's a superficial conflict. For example young

1064
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,760
earth creationist with their literal interpretation of Genesis

1065
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,760
is in conflict with what we know from

1066
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,760
science that human beings

1067
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,760
apes and other creatures are genetically related so there's

1068
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,760
the common ancestry thesis but at a deeper level

1069
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,760
I think the kind of let's say the belief in God in particular

1070
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,760
and if you want to go more particularly Christian

1071
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,760
the belief in logos the reason

1072
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,760
that the world is an intelligible

1073
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,760
whole and order in an intelligible way

1074
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,760
is deeply consonant with science in fact most people

1075
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,760
in fact all the people who began the scientific revolution

1076
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,760
believed that and thought that Galileo thought that the

1077
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,760
universe was written in the language of mathematics and likewise

1078
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,760
Kepler but what you have to be careful of is

1079
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,760
what level you're looking for this in

1080
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,760
what level you attribute to chance and what level you

1081
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,760
attribute to a more fundamental kind of design

1082
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,760
for example Kepler in he spent

1083
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,760
the early years trying to

1084
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,760
figure out a mathematical order to the actual

1085
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,760
distance the planets were away from the sun so we look for the

1086
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,760
5 platonic solids and that never worked out because

1087
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,760
the distance of planets are that's a matter of chance not necessity

1088
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,760
but they're actual elliptical orbits and the speed in which they

1089
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,760
go that's a matter of physical necessity so he finally eventually found the

1090
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,760
three Kepler's three laws of motion which led to Newton

1091
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,760
at that point so I would say no there's no

1092
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,760
at a deep level there are consonant there's only this superficial

1093
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,760
um conflict

1094
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,760
I'm sorry what would you say but it sounds good to me

1095
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,760
so I don't think the conflict

1096
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,760
but I mean what we get from the popular image

1097
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,760
is this conflict and it was also a thesis promoted by

1098
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,760
which the historian friends of mine say and people are history

1099
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,760
in the history of the science of religion whether or not

1100
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,760
their believers are and god or not

1101
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,760
like Anderson Dixon White I think he's the first president

1102
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,760
of Cornell University promoted this perpetual conflict

1103
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,760
thesis and history was really really bad history

1104
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,760
the footnotes didn't go anywhere and so that

1105
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,760
from the historian's perspective it's way more complex than that there's been

1106
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,760
skirmishes but there's also been a lot of support for

1107
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,760
science from the religious community so

1108
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,760
it's it's it's it's

1109
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,760
that would be my religion I mean

1110
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,760
I would agree with all of this history absolutely I mean someone like Kepler

1111
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,760
was deeply religious that's my understanding but

1112
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,760
he also felt that that was perfectly compatible

1113
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,760
with this this empirically studied quantitative

1114
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,760
universe but I mean

1115
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,760
he was even capable of taking quite risky

1116
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,760
steps because my understanding is before Kepler people

1117
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,760
assumed that the movement of planets was all in perfect circles

1118
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,760
and Kepler took this leap to say well maybe they're ellipses

1119
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,760
which is pretty shocking for someone

1120
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:25,760
who was motivated by the idea of

1121
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:29,760
the underlying idea of elegance that heavens were elegantly ordered would give you

1122
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:33,760
perfect circles the most symmetrical but he was willing to break that but

1123
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:37,760
it was still that underlying idea of an elegant order to the universe

1124
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,760
it's just you can't be you can't get too fixated

1125
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,760
on a certain version of that I mean Einstein got fixated on a certain version

1126
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,760
of that and never could really accept quantum mechanics so

1127
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:53,760
and sometimes a religious motivation

1128
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:57,760
can be very helpful I mean the developer the Montre who developed

1129
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:01,760
the big bang theory

1130
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:05,760
was religious and it was people like Fred

1131
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:09,760
Hoyle who opposed it

1132
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:13,760
strongly until the evidence came in in the 1960s even then he opposed

1133
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:17,760
I think he never did accept it he

1134
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,760
couldn't imagine the universe having a beginning but somebody from

1135
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:25,760
a kind of theistic perspective that was much easier to imagine

1136
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:29,760
Einstein couldn't imagine the universe having a beginning and that's why he

1137
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:33,760
introduced originally the cosmological constant to make to get an eternal

1138
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,760
universe so in that particular case you can see that

1139
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,760
actually the religious believed actually helped the acceptability

1140
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,760
of that the big bang theory so you are saying

1141
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:49,760
that the universe on a surface level religion and science

1142
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:53,760
may seem not compatible but on a deeper level

1143
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:57,760
they are compatible right how are they compatible

1144
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,760
there I mean the idea of

1145
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,760
theism that's what I was saying the idea that there's a god who created

1146
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,760
the universe and intelligence behind it would lead you

1147
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,760
to expect that there'd be in the structure of the universe would be

1148
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,760
intelligible it would lead you to expect it would be an

1149
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,760
elegant elegantly structured at a fundamental level so

1150
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,760
and that we could understand and that's then a mainstay of science is that we

1151
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,760
could actually understand the universe which wasn't given to us that we

1152
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,760
most cultures didn't assume we could really understand the underlying nature of things

1153
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,760
but how would you ever like as a scientist when you work in two

1154
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,760
domains you work in mathematics where you work with mathematical proofs

1155
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,760
then you work within the construct of an observational list which you test hypotheses

1156
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,760
how is the idea of god a testable hypothesis

1157
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,760
I mean how would you test that? well I mean the thing is you're demanding

1158
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,760
that everything all your what you're assuming is

1159
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,760
all knowledge is scientific knowledge and all the hypotheses you have about the world

1160
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,760
can be gained by science I mean a simple reputation

1161
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,760
of that is your own consciousness you'll never get to your own consciousness by a

1162
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,760
scientific study you know your conscious because you're aware

1163
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,760
I'm not sure I know my consciousness by a certain your conscious okay

1164
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,760
or moral if you hold a moral throughs you're not getting them by means

1165
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,760
of scientific investigation so I wouldn't subscribe to god

1166
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,760
as a scientific hypothesis I think that's a big mistake to do that

1167
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,760
so you can't

1168
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,760
test god to test the god hypothesis isn't that a slippery slope

1169
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,760
when it comes on to other things then and say well this is really scientific

1170
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,760
well there could be evidence for things without being scientific evidence I mean

1171
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,760
I think you have evidence in mathematics which is not strictly speaking empirical evidence

1172
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,760
there's evidence I mentioned for but as a formality to it at least to

1173
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,760
still prove so there's a difference between evidence and scientific evidence

1174
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,760
scientific evidence is a narrow one particular area that's been very successful

1175
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,760
of kinds of evidence but there's other kinds of evidence or reasons

1176
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,760
that people could have let me clarify why I asked you about

1177
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,760
science and religion both in the evolution

1178
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,760
of Homo sapiens are add-ons they are

1179
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,760
human constructs things we attach to ourselves

1180
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,760
and the vice versa obviously in order to live

1181
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,760
more easily science is obviously that

1182
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,760
why do you think now in your own

1183
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,760
specialty and domain why do you think

1184
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,760
religion was

1185
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,760
obviously invented, discovered and adopted by humans

1186
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,760
a long time ago not the Simono Theis and

1187
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,760
to which you are referring why is religion

1188
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,760
that's a very complex question but I think it has two

1189
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,760
there's a huge question but I would say

1190
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,760
two things I think people do have a sense of the transcendent and so

1191
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,760
on one side the philosophical side

1192
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,760
they have a sense of the transcendent they have a sense of

1193
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,760
moral value and once you have the sense of moral value

1194
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,760
if you see let's say evil in the world

1195
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,760
people that commit evil often

1196
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,760
live better lives than those that do good then it seems morality

1197
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,760
in many people's minds require that you know the

1198
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,760
good ultimately are not worse off at least

1199
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,760
than the evil are better officers there's a sort of what happens to a person

1200
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,760
and but their moral character is eventually must

1201
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,760
coincide so then you either get just on naturalistic

1202
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,760
basis from those kind of things you either get a having a hell or reincarnation

1203
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,760
system and then there's a sense of

1204
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,760
transcendent reality I mean that counting

1205
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,760
for maybe the order you see in the world that the world exists at all

1206
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,760
but then on the there's a whole bunch more religion than that and there's a lot of

1207
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,760
in sociological explanations religion helps

1208
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,760
group cohesiveness and

1209
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:23,760
we see that throughout the world so then there's a whole bunch of sociological issues

1210
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,760
that arise which is another

1211
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,760
big factor in religion and then if you believe in revelation then there can be

1212
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,760
you know the revelatory side but if you just give a naturalistic or merely

1213
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,760
philosophical account I think those are the two two big ones

1214
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,760
and group cohesiveness from an evolutionary perspective is going to help the survival

1215
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,760
of the grid but but there you go these things these good things that you're

1216
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,760
enumerating could be contributed by a lover of science

1217
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,760
all the way to wonderful mathematics better

1218
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,760
engineering how to build the city

1219
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,760
how to stay away from danger your name

1220
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,760
the place okay so the urge the human

1221
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,760
urge to live more easily save for longer

1222
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,760
is in the very beginning and the earliest

1223
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,760
version in my view at least the word knowledge of the history of man

1224
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,760
the earliest way to

1225
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,760
to put that urge to use meaning to use nature

1226
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,760
to live with nature to live with the environment

1227
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,760
was to was through religion

1228
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,760
so I am I was curious to know whether

1229
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,760
like many of my colleagues you you regard that you think that

1230
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,760
people in religion should fear science and vice versa

1231
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,760
people in science should fear religion to me they're all

1232
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,760
in fact human religion being older

1233
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,760
and a religion with science is definitely a much better

1234
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,760
add-on than religion without science

1235
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,760
why I agree religion with science is much better

1236
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,760
than religion okay I'm going to go to questions

1237
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,760
please come up to the microphone

1238
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,760
please come up to the microphone and

1239
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,760
thanks be gentle to the questions

1240
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,760
and keep your comments in the form of a question

1241
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:35,760
how you doing?

1242
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,760
so the question that I have is

1243
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,760
I guess pretty much I kind of like going off the last

1244
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,760
thing given the fact that

1245
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,760
okay so the question being couldn't mathematics itself be

1246
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,760
quote unquote god right I'm putting in air quotes for a reason

1247
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,760
or couldn't the not couldn't knowledge itself

1248
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,760
be quote unquote god or couldn't sort of

1249
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,760
the idea of like what you were saying before

1250
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:11,760
in terms of like that transmutative

1251
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,760
nature of things in and of itself

1252
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:19,760
or pattern itself that we sort of

1253
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,760
assign understanding to

1254
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,760
couldn't that in and of itself be god like does

1255
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,760
god necessarily have to be personification or

1256
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,760
anthropomorphization of what we see

1257
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,760
like couldn't the intelligence itself be god

1258
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,760
thank you you want to tackle that yeah I'll tackle that

1259
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,760
I think in the I mean the kind of popular image you get

1260
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,760
of god as a god out there that's very anthropomorphic image and molding

1261
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,760
things etc I mean when I think of god

1262
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,760
I think of it just as that an underlying intelligence

1263
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,760
that grounds everything so that the idea is is that if you

1264
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,760
ask the question what is and I know you

1265
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,760
have comments about fundamental what's when you go all the way back to reality

1266
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:15,760
what do you find is reality ultimately impersonal is that the ultimate

1267
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,760
story so is it just matter in motion for instance

1268
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,760
or so and then consciousness arises out of matter

1269
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,760
so consciousness is sort of an epiphenomenon of the material

1270
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,760
or is that consciousness

1271
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,760
is the most fundamental and then when you get consciousness you get mind

1272
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,760
usually goes along with it and will and intelligence

1273
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,760
and mathematics

1274
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,760
has been the conceptualizations of that intelligence that's one view

1275
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,760
of mathematics and so

1276
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,760
in that conception of god then it's really thinking

1277
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,760
that it's not an anthropomorphic conception of god out there but

1278
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,760
a reality a conscious reality that's underlying and sustaining

1279
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,760
everything and so that it's a question of which route

1280
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,760
do you go at the very beginning of what's most fundamental

1281
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,760
which leads you in these two different directions

1282
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:19,760
let me also address your points first of all

1283
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,760
mathematics is not physics physics is nature

1284
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,760
physics is what happens I like the

1285
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,760
Latin version of it nature or notura which is the personification

1286
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,760
of into a lady who gives birth to everything

1287
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,760
so that is physics now in the history of science the

1288
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,760
description and the reasoning of these things that we've seen

1289
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,760
nature came first meaning was born out of this

1290
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,760
notura as geometry

1291
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,760
and that was a very cumbersome argument

1292
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:59,760
to teach all the way to

1293
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,760
the school of Plato which said

1294
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,760
he who cannot do geometry is not allowed to enter

1295
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,760
very difficult so then it was simplified

1296
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,760
algebra, trigonometry

1297
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,760
or calculus so in the beginning geometric arguments

1298
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,760
from Newton and so mathematics is a

1299
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,760
evolutionary process of simplifying the

1300
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,760
book of physics that's what it is

1301
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:35,760
so no English is a much simpler language

1302
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,760
than say French and Latin that's why

1303
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,760
English now has taken the world taken over the world

1304
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,760
I would disagree just like I didn't make it to screen

1305
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,760
I think in many cases actually the mathematics preceded the physics like I mentioned

1306
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,760
the complex numbers so it wasn't actually useful in physics to quantum

1307
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,760
mechanics in the 1930s but complex numbers

1308
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,760
in fact I think it goes back to the 17

1309
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,760
imaginary numbers in the development of the complex number system

1310
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,760
in the 18th and 19th century

1311
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,760
clarify just a second the name for the discipline

1312
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:19,760
is new it comes from the second half of the 1800s

1313
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:23,760
before that it was called mechanics and it is

1314
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,760
called as the Greeks and mechanics is the science of

1315
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,760
figures, bodies

1316
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,760
well the ones that statically were described as geometry now these things

1317
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,760
the pulleys, the ropes, the buildings, the making of the buildings

1318
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,760
was mechanics the building of the ditches and trenches and roads

1319
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,760
so mechanics is the original name for what I was talking about but the question was

1320
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,760
could mathematics be God so if you say physics

1321
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,760
could be God?

1322
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,760
well I understand that there are all God's laws

1323
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,760
okay so there's the end to that okay next question

1324
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,760
I'm wondering in considering these difficult questions

1325
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,760
whether the panelists are really so sure themselves

1326
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,760
as it appears why so difficult people say I don't really

1327
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,760
know it seems obvious to me given the dispute amongst

1328
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,760
you all that no one really knows

1329
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,760
do you have doubts or do you really think you're right

1330
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:31,760
did you do know about what about life

1331
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,760
why things are the way they are?

1332
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,760
that's where scientists we don't know

1333
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,760
but I did not say the beginning of the question because they don't hear

1334
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,760
well would you speak slow enough? this one you have people can be so sure

1335
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,760
themselves about why things are the way they are

1336
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:55,760
given the arguments and disputes and why people can't say I don't know

1337
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,760
it seems like a lot of these questions people really don't know

1338
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,760
but very few people they may share with them

1339
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,760
in secret yes yeah before this meeting started

1340
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,760
we're having a round table in a back room there

1341
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,760
and Dr. Narcissianne

1342
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,760
you brought up the fact that most people think they know more

1343
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,760
than they know I wanted to add to that

1344
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,760
that most professors think they know more than they know

1345
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,760
except England so

1346
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,760
that's the way we are okay and very few

1347
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,760
except those who are in a hurry to go home after a lecture

1348
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,760
or a conference say gee I don't excellent question but

1349
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,760
I don't know so it's a useful answer

1350
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,760
to many of these questions but the urge

1351
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,760
to pursue the question especially when it arrives

1352
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,760
unexpectedly out of an honest audience

1353
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,760
that courage is actually very valuable

1354
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,760
and from me to my students they're very important to teach

1355
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,760
because most people do not get it that they're actually

1356
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,760
free to question authority thank you

1357
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,760
if you can't propose some experiment that would prove you're wrong

1358
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,760
or right make some prediction and say we're going to do some experiment to show

1359
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,760
it comes out the way I think it does or doesn't do how is that different

1360
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,760
than you did the work and physics theory is full of these examples

1361
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,760
but in terms of your theory oh sure

1362
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,760
here is the story of I predicted the evolution

1363
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:43,760
of the speed and sports I predicted it that was in the spring

1364
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,760
of 2008 that was months before the Beijing Olympics

1365
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,760
I predicted that the next winners in sprint ends will be

1366
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,760
bigger okay and with a mathematical formula

1367
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,760
very simple a equals b kind of formula

1368
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,760
and I submitted this as a letter to nature

1369
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,760
with a cover letter in which I said that dear editors

1370
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,760
my colleagues please publish this immediately because in just two months

1371
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,760
from now this will be shown to be correct and they of course

1372
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,760
because I'm from engineering decided not even

1373
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,760
to review my contribution

1374
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,760
my contribution was on the rebound published a few months

1375
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,760
later in the Journal of Experimental Biology in Cambridge not a lightweight journal

1376
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:35,760
meaning here are the facts

1377
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,760
comparative biology journal

1378
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,760
but in Beijing in July my prediction

1379
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,760
turned out to be correct I do not predict the names

1380
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:51,760
of the winners but I predicted their sizes and their speeds

1381
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,760
you see but that's not proving a fundamental physical

1382
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,760
law or all it is as it is as proving a retrospect

1383
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,760
meaning a hindsight that everything that you brought up

1384
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,760
earlier with the insects and the so-called convergent evolution

1385
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,760
should be happening this way that the

1386
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,760
bigger should be faster not just you know waving your hands

1387
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,760
but in a long this in accord with this precise formula

1388
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,760
that is to predict that it was not questioned

1389
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,760
in the past is the proof that you are waiting

1390
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,760
oh the question how many predictions did you make that didn't come true that we never heard about

1391
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:39,760
the doctor already comes in the fact that that has not happened yet

1392
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,760
okay thank you you want to say something

1393
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,760
I do do you have time

1394
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,760
I just have a couple of comments I really enjoyed this it's wonderful I haven't thought this much

1395
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,760
about these issues since college and until the last selection of course

1396
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,760
and I wanted to make a couple of comments

1397
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,760
and they would raise questions regarding the existence

1398
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,760
of God I think the gentleman in a lighter jacket I

1399
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,760
was here late so I don't really have all your names

1400
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:15,760
mentioned that you can't test the existence of God unless I got that wrong

1401
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,760
and if that is true then how can you describe God that's one question

1402
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,760
you might want to reference a show

1403
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,760
that Stephen Colbert had a few weeks ago a few months ago where Ricky Gervais

1404
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:31,760
was there and he proposed a following thought experiment

1405
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,760
which is that if humanity were wiped out or all civilization were wiped out

1406
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,760
what would we recreate the same religions or

1407
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,760
would we recreate the same physics and mathematics which is more likely

1408
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,760
and Colbert was I think stunned by that which is

1409
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,760
impressive considering his deep religious beliefs and his mind

1410
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,760
I also wanted to comment on what you mentioned

1411
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:59,760
about what I think is synchronicity which is kind of

1412
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,760
parallel well I guess parallel evolutionary

1413
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,760
appearances due to different processes and I think that's an important thing

1414
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,760
to keep in mind and the last thing I want to say is I did some research

1415
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,760
when I was a resident I'm a pathologist by training

1416
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,760
that did describe symmetries in biology which I can discuss

1417
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:23,760
with you privately if you're interested that speak to some very basic

1418
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:27,760
primal mathematical principles I don't think it ever saw the light of day

1419
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,760
but it was fascinating sorry a lot

1420
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,760
so the two of you I think are questions

1421
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,760
I think what I heard you write you said

1422
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,760
if you can't test whether God exists how can you describe

1423
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,760
God well I mean we don't have

1424
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,760
I can describe God how an idea what consciousness is because I'm conscious

1425
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,760
and I have an idea of what being an agent is and knowledge is

1426
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,760
so I don't see where you'd have to test something to be able to

1427
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,760
describe it I could describe on

1428
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:07,760
a very very distant planet that is

1429
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,760
what physicists would say is outside our light cone which means we'll never

1430
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,760
be able to determine whether it's there or not I can describe

1431
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,760
there's a certain kind of being on the planet let's say a unicorn to view a description of

1432
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,760
the unicorn so I can describe without ever being able to test

1433
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:27,760
whether that's the case or that there's extraterrestrial intelligence

1434
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:31,760
outside our light cone so I don't see how the two are connected

1435
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,760
together I think you'd have to have some sort of

1436
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,760
access to the properties you're using to describe the thing but

1437
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:43,760
that doesn't require an ability to be able to test whether it exists or not

1438
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:47,760
would you like to comment sure yeah first I'll just

1439
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,760
say that I like to think of God as a flying spaghetti monster

1440
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,760
that's a big movement among evolutionary biologists to

1441
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:59,760
recast religion of flying spaghetti monster but with regard

1442
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:03,760
to synchronicity and convergence I mean one of

1443
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,760
an interesting topic that's come up in evolutionary biology recently

1444
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,760
is trying to understand convergence not just

1445
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,760
from the framework of

1446
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,760
a common natural selective force which is always how

1447
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:23,760
since Darwin it's been interpreted when you see two things that look the same

1448
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,760
you say aha they're under similar adaptive pressure

1449
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,760
but now I think with new

1450
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,760
new tools genomics new tools

1451
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,760
and developmental biology and cell biology we can start to understand

1452
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,760
the kind of canalization that is the molecular it constraints the molecular

1453
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,760
level that drive convergence in ways that

1454
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,760
may not be as related to adaptive pressure as we think

1455
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,760
thank you any other questions

1456
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,760
it seems to me that all of the members of the panel

1457
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:07,760
with the exception of Professor

1458
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:15,760
Bajan would be successfully avoided the topic at hand and I think the topic at hand is

1459
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,760
it says design and nature

1460
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,760
is really is there design and nature and what I heard from

1461
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,760
Professor Bajan was that nature

1462
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,760
designs itself and it does it through the mechanism of evolution

1463
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,760
which is underpinned by the law of physics

1464
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,760
and that means and that really is

1465
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,760
something which is in its own way post creation

1466
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:47,760
or post development in some way so it still leaves open

1467
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,760
the question as to whether or not there was design

1468
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:55,760
or a designer how did evolution how did the law of physics

1469
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,760
come about?

1470
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:05,760
who wants to tackle that? Let me read a brief

1471
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,760
in my latest book The Physics of Life the answer

1472
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,760
to your point is I agree with what you bring up

1473
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,760
is that evolution

1474
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,760
which really means changing design with the

1475
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:25,760
perceivable discernible direction over time

1476
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,760
was one earth and everything

1477
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,760
everywhere else from the beginning

1478
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:37,760
and I just want to follow up with a better understanding

1479
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,760
of the nature design and nature. You understand what the living is

1480
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:45,760
and I think the water flowing down here

1481
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,760
and the water flowing down here

1482
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,760
wants to keep moving then it keeps trying various ways

1483
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,760
of doing and it starts to look just

1484
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,760
that you destroy that or you destroy that

1485
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:05,760
as an evolution and a removal of part of the water.

1486
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:09,760
It's a survival of... it's an evolution of the flow

1487
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,760
architecture and the river basin is just one part of it

1488
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:17,760
it's the circuit executed by water in nature

1489
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:21,760
first there is the rain the rain falls on the ground

1490
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,760
the droplets while falling down

1491
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,760
a quiet shape that tends to

1492
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,760
minimize drag. There we go. So that's the

1493
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,760
quality embryo that gives birth to the river basin

1494
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,760
river basin is the wet mud in the beginning then you have the

1495
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,760
riverlets and then the hill slopes and the rivers

1496
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:49,760
and so all the way to the delta you forgot to mention delta which is the river basin

1497
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:53,760
and then the river is just like the breathing in and breathing out

1498
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,760
and then there is what happens to the water from the river

1499
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,760
basin either evaporation from the ocean or from the Kalahari desert

1500
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,760
in the case of the Oka-Langua delta. So and then

1501
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:09,760
the evaporated humid air is light and it rises

1502
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:13,760
with the undulating rivers you see meandering rivers

1503
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,760
of plumes which then circulate on the

1504
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:21,760
same world map as the winds more easily

1505
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:25,760
so this entire so this is where I actually asked you about

1506
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,760
the atonement it's about not only the thing that

1507
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,760
you bring up which is the river basin it's about the river basin

1508
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:37,760
flowing together with everything else with the so-called environment

1509
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,760
or with the nature itself so the physics

1510
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,760
is holistic the laws of physics are

1511
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,760
obeyed by anything everywhere and anytime

1512
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,760
and that's why this discussion at this topic I

1513
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,760
commend you for putting it together as a title is extremely timely

1514
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:01,760
and it is not about biology it is not about technology evolution

1515
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,760
either it's in fact it's about everything

1516
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:09,760
that has evolving design. Okay so maybe okay so

1517
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:13,760
okay so I'll just say you know design

1518
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:17,760
for me is such a loaded word as a scientist

1519
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,760
because the last thing I want to say is that anything is designed

1520
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,760
because I don't believe that I don't think anything is designed

1521
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,760
design is something we impose after the fact on

1522
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,760
what we see around us and it's because of our squirmy little

1523
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:37,760
mammalian brains doing the things but

1524
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:41,760
it doesn't mean that there aren't some really extraordinary questions

1525
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:45,760
and big questions so for example 13.8 billion

1526
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,760
years ago the Big Bang the universe was not the way it is now

1527
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,760
it was extremely uniform it was hot it had

1528
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:57,760
almost no structure to it somehow 13.8

1529
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:01,760
billion years later it's made structures out of itself

1530
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:05,760
capable of recognizing that fact

1531
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,760
that's a big question right I mean that and it's a big scientific question

1532
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:13,760
for me and I think that's you know that's the

1533
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,760
more interesting thing how did that happen I agree

1534
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,760
it's physics but I don't know how to connect all the dots

1535
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,760
from 13.8 billion years ago to today and I feel that

1536
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:29,760
sometimes I look you know we the fact

1537
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,760
that we impose this notion of design and form and shape

1538
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:37,760
and elegance and beauty on the world around us

1539
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:41,760
has been useful in some respects but we don't know if that's the best thing

1540
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,760
to do for unearthing the deeper truths I don't know

1541
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:49,760
I really don't so I just wanted to put that out there and I just wanted to say

1542
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:53,760
I say design to me and I kind of go into a quivering

1543
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,760
and as I want to run out the door just to say that

1544
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,760
let me know too well do you want to say something

1545
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,760
well not really I mean to me like it's like you know being a scientist

1546
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,760
for me it's not about like figuring out the big questions and all this other kind of stuff

1547
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:13,760
is just I'm just no seriously I just do it because it's fun

1548
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:17,760
it's creative like you know like I mean it's like that when we discovered like

1549
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:21,760
it's like you know I'm known for studying dinosaurs and I can't stand dinosaurs

1550
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:25,760
but you know it's just a way which

1551
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:31,760
like you know when we figured out what color dinosaurs were it's not like we cared we just wanted to see if we were clever enough to do it

1552
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:37,760
and to figure out a way that we could use the quantum radiation and stuff to be able to like do it

1553
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,760
and that you know so I can mean a lot of it is just

1554
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:45,760
it's just that because it gives us a you know I use science as a mechanism for us to be able to

1555
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,760
you know understand all the way from the most fundamental questions in the world

1556
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:55,760
to like the lint of figuring out what color one kind of dinosaur was 130 million years ago so like that it's just

1557
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,760
it allows us to be able to do that in a repeatable and fundamental way by

1558
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,760
you know using mathematics but using technology by asking the right questions

1559
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,760
and it's just a way to approach the world in that way so

1560
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,760
Anybody else?

1561
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,760
Okay. Can I ask you another question?

1562
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:19,760
Oh yes you can ask another question.

1563
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,760
So

1564
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,760
So what is there?

1565
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:27,760
It's there.

1566
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,760
Just fine. I can tell everybody can hear me.

1567
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:33,760
In terms of like

1568
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:37,760
so in terms of sort of like

1569
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:41,760
answering this question

1570
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,760
wouldn't answering the question require like

1571
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:49,760
some sort of multi-field understanding

1572
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,760
that for the most part like

1573
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,760
well that's two questions

1574
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,760
so wouldn't it require some sort of multi-field understanding that we're just not

1575
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:01,760
really capable of in any one's

1576
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,760
particular 90 year lifetime?

1577
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,760
It's probably intractable. I mean there's nothing wrong with that.

1578
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,760
There's nothing wrong with saying we can't do that and I don't know that

1579
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:13,760
because like one of the things I was thinking of was like

1580
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:17,760
in terms of even just for example I was watching a documentary on

1581
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,760
Einstein and it was a situation where like he ran into

1582
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,760
mathematics problems and so it was

1583
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:29,760
a situation where like there was a race between him and another mathematician

1584
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,760
who was older than he was and you know and he's trying to

1585
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,760
figure things out you know and a lot of

1586
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,760
situations where I think you know where you know yeah

1587
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:45,760
like physics and science and psychology and all these other things

1588
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,760
I teach a

1589
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:51,760
course and I was just talking with this gentleman on the fact that Carl Jung

1590
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:55,760
for example knew a lot and consulted with people outside

1591
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:59,760
of his field you know to answer a lot of different questions and even as

1592
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,760
myself as an English teacher

1593
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:05,760
I often bring up things in terms of

1594
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,760
science and all these other things that I'm learning about and constantly trying to say

1595
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:13,760
that I mean in terms of that understanding of like convergence

1596
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,760
I think that would be necessary for understanding

1597
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:21,760
the underlying sort of intelligence

1598
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:25,760
that there is to creation and then the second thing is

1599
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,760
going back to

1600
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,760
what you guys were initially talking about in terms of the fact that

1601
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:37,760
you know the dynamic is always

1602
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:41,760
changing that you know and going

1603
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:45,760
to your question which is

1604
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,760
you know don't we isn't there always a situation

1605
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:53,760
where we don't know you know like I think as some

1606
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:57,760
I was reading something when they were saying at the edge of the chaos in the world

1607
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,760
is always creation right so isn't there always a situation

1608
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:05,760
where and if we if we're ever

1609
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,760
if we were ever to say this is God then wouldn't that be the end of

1610
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,760
the morning okay so that's your question okay

1611
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:17,760
you can ask

1612
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,760
the time is it

1613
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,760
your view of it is in fact

1614
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:29,760
in the right direction the first of all the design is basically a movie

1615
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:33,760
not a sketch in a zoology book

1616
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,760
okay that's the first thing the second

1617
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,760
there is no end to evolution the speaks of the

1618
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:45,760
of the you call it the edge of chaos

1619
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,760
I don't use the word chaos because it means

1620
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:53,760
I don't know anything meaning I give up it's like turbulence

1621
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,760
so but anyway there is that's the good news that

1622
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:01,760
there is always a flow architecture

1623
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:05,760
in the future that will be serving us better

1624
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,760
and what you call it is really

1625
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:13,760
not only up to you but depends on your upbringing

1626
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,760
some of us have

1627
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,760
have gotten both the religion and science others have gotten only the first

1628
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:25,760
others have only gotten the second but

1629
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,760
but every single one of us has the urge to to to to live

1630
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,760
I'm talking about including my cat the urge to to live more easily

1631
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:37,760
or save for longer and

1632
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:41,760
all the rest again but your question question was

1633
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:45,760
if there's a god should we just stop questioning anything

1634
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:49,760
is that what you were enjoying the fun experience of

1635
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:53,760
living under Trump yeah

1636
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:57,760
yeah no but I think it's not about I mean I guess

1637
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:01,760
right it's gonna mean right depends right if if if you don't believe in God

1638
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:05,760
right then you're gonna keep questioning and if you do believe in God you have a choice

1639
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,760
right and historically many people who believe in God were

1640
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,760
also scientists and kept questioning the world around them and unveiling

1641
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,760
the majesty of whatever I mean it's just different motivation

1642
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,760
you know someone like me is not motivated that way and even if you told me

1643
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:25,760
there is a god I go nah nah not really nah

1644
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:29,760
I'm just not gonna go there

1645
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,760
and every year is like what do I believe in

1646
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,760
I'd say I believe in the Lord. I feel that's an excellent answer

1647
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,760
I think that's an excellent answer. One last comment

1648
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,760
I was just gonna say I think in that's really like some

1649
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:49,760
theory, a theory or anything and those who want to talk about

1650
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,760
the quantum creation of reality end up needing

1651
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:57,760
to hypothesize like the mathematics of quantum mechanics that is

1652
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:01,760
not instantiated anywhere it's just mathematics and that somehow

1653
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:05,760
something that mathematics has given

1654
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:09,760
being so I'm just trying to clarify I think that was your and if you got

1655
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:13,760
to that final theory whether it's a personal god or not

1656
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:17,760
with questioning

1657
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:21,760
well you might not be searching for the ultimate explanation anymore but there

1658
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,760
would be a lot of other things to explore.

1659
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:29,760
Thank you.

1660
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:33,760
Thank you very much.

1661
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,760
Thank you very much.

1662
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:41,760
Thank you.

1663
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:45,760
Thank you very much.

1664
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:49,760
Yeah.

1665
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:57,760
Thank you.
