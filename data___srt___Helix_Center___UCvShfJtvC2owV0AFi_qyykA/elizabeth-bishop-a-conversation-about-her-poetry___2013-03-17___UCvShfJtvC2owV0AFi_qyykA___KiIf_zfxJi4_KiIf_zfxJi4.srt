00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
I'm Ed Nersesian Director of the Helix Center and I want to welcome you to today's program

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:14,320
on Elizabeth Bishop that was organized by the Chair of our Poetry Program, David Paulins,

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,620
who will introduce the participants.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:24,000
Just to tell you the programs we have planned, on April 13th we have a program on Music,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,040
Emotion and Mind.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:37,120
On April 27th the program is on Curiosity and Ignorance and I think it's May 10th or

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,920
something like that.

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,680
We have a program, what's that one?

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,920
No, it's not on memory.

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,520
Should be on memory.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,120
Oh, it's a program on a subject.

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,920
We all need to learn more about which is synthetic and systemic biology.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,400
Thank you.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,520
Well, welcome everybody to our talk today about Elizabeth Bishop.

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,240
I'll introduce them.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,160

32
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,360
Lloyd Schwartz is the Frederick S. Troy Professor of English at the University of Massachusetts

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,240

00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,040
In addition to being a poet and literary critic, Mr. Schwartz is the classical music editor of

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,480

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,320
won the Yale Younger Poets Prize in 1965.

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,400
She was the state poet of New York from 2008 to 2010.

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,360
So if people saw the announcement for today's event, they can see that attention was drawn

52
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:03,040
to Elizabeth Bishop's powers of observation, which has been noted by many of the people

53
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,640
who've read her poetry closely.

54
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,960
And I'm just going to make a couple of comments about that.

55
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,720
And I'll just quote some things that she has said in referring to her maternal grandmother,

56
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,280
she says, my grandmother had a glass eye, blue, almost like her other one.

57
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,760
And this made her especially vulnerable and precious to me.

58
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,760
My father was dead and my mother was away in a sanatorium.

59
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,280
Until I was teased out of it, I used to ask grandmother when I said goodbye to promise

60
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,520
me not to die before I came home.

61
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,200
And then about her paternal grandfather, she said, he was wall-eyed.

62
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,160
At least one eye turned the wrong way, which made him endlessly interesting to me.

63
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,920
And then in a letter to her from Robert Lowell, he says, no eye in the world has seen what

64
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
yours has.

65
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,840
And starting with that, I'll turn to our participants to respond.

66
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:09,120
If I could just add one little anecdote, Robert Lowell introduced Elizabeth Bishop, which she

67
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
was giving a reading at the Guggenheim Museum.

68
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,120
And he referred to her famous eye.

69
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:23,960
When she got on stage, she announced that the famous eye will now put on her glasses.

70
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:32,960
We were trying to think before downstairs where it was that we read Mary McCarthy, a

71
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:41,120
vassar classmates description of Bishop's eye as like a great magnifying glass.

72
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,400
And she said, of course, the forfeit would be that you'd have to look at everything with

73
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,480
that eye.

74
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,080
So I think she thought Bishop was a little touchy.

75
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,720
Well, I'll play sort of counterpoint to this just a bit, because I was drawn to Bishop as

76
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
a great describer.

77
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,720
I had been reading Mary Ann Moore for a long time, and Mary Ann Moore, as probably some

78
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,640
of you know, was kind of a mentor to Elizabeth Bishop.

79
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,200
And I have always loved description and poetry.

80
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,960
But I think one of the things that happened is that Bishop was such a great describer.

81
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,280
That people's highest tribute to her was her accuracy.

82
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:30,000
And they missed often how deeply intelligent her poems are, how much psychological resonance

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,280
they have.

84
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:40,200
When I teach Bishop, I love to pass around a New Yorker cartoon that Saul Steinberg did.

85
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,040
And it's of a man in the middle of a spiral.

86
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,960
And at the end of the spiral, he's got a pen in his hand.

87
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,320
And at the end of the spiral, there's a landscape.

88
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,040
But it spins back to him.

89
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,680
And that always made me think about Bishop, that to describe something is always to find

90
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:06,480
out something about yourself, to come back to the self in some new way that you can't

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,080
know about the self only by turning inward.

92
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,080
But it's this constant engagement with the sense or with the visual field, especially

93
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,640
in Bishop's case, I think, that enriches that knowledge.

94
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:25,480
And it can be self-forgetful, of course, loss of self through engagement with the visual

95
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
world.

96
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,040
But I think ultimately the knowledge of the self comes back.

97
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:39,440
And so I think often critics, there was a kind of not damning with faint praise, but

98
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,440
a lack of recognition of the profundity of her poetry, because there was so much attention

99
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,840
to its visual accuracy at first.

100
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,960
So it's just a little counterpoint maybe to...

101
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,760
And just to go back to what Alice was thinking about what Mary McCarthy said, it made me

102
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:05,840
think of this passage in Crusoe in England, which is, if you don't know, the poem to one

103
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,440
of Bishop's most ambitious and one of her longest poems.

104
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,040
And it's a poem in the voice of Robinson Crusoe.

105
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,200
It's also, it seems to me, one of her most autobiographical poems.

106
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:26,520
And there's this amazing moment, like I'm chilling moment, where Robinson Crusoe says,

107
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:34,320
and part of the autobiographical background is that Bishop lived in Brazil for many years,

108
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,080
almost 20 years.

109
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,240
You could call it an exile and you could call it a kind of salvation in some ways.

110
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:52,000
But he says, Crusoe says, I'd have nightmares of other islands stretching away from mine,

111
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,080
infinities of islands, islands spawning islands like frogs, eggs turning into polywads of islands,

112
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,400
knowing that I had to live on each and every one, eventually for ages registering their

113
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,160
flora, their fauna, their geography.

114
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:19,800
So that sense that the price of seeing everything so clearly is that you had to see everything

115
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,440
and there was no way of stopping.

116
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,200
I think Jean is going to read, you were thinking of reading North Haven, the poem to Robert

117
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Lowell.

118
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:39,920
In Bishop's last notebook, her last formal notebook, there are other little notebooks

119
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,400
she carried around.

120
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:48,600
But she is up early in the morning in North Haven, sitting on the porch at about six o'clock.

121
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:55,480
And she's decided to take the wildflower guide and to write down the name of every flower

122
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,120
that she can see from the porch.

123
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,280
And it's about this many flowers, but it's preceded by her writing.

124
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,840
I want now that it's too late to learn the name of everything.

125
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:13,120
She really did have that delight.

126
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:22,800
Bonnie talked about critics praising Bishop's accuracy and not her depth.

127
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:30,160
And there's a wonderful passage in a draft that I think Alice discovered or found at

128
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:40,400
Vassar of some sort of lecture or article that Bishop was going to give and never finished

129
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,640
called writing poetry is impossible.

130
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:58,680
And she says in this, and I think this is the statement that we should all remember Bishop

131
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:05,760
making because it's a profoundly self-reflexive.

132
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:19,480
She talks about the qualities she admires in the poetry she likes most, our accuracy, spontaneity,

133
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,040
and mystery.

134
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:32,880
And what an amazing conglomeration of different and yet overlapping things.

135
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,400
And of course it's very funny about, I mean, she's sort of so famous for being accurate.

136
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:48,880
And yet we know those of us who have really studied her poems that she was perfectly capable

137
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,520
of making things up and was very nervous.

138
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,520
80 watt bulbs and things like that, right?

139
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
Yeah.

140
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,920
Has anybody ever seen an 80 watt light bulb?

141
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,840
Well, she, and in one of her really greatest poems in the waiting room, she talks about

142
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:13,080
this issue of the National Geographic which was the issue that came out on her seventh

143
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,480
birthday.

144
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,800
And she describes in detail all these things that are in that issue.

145
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,320
And they're not in that issue.

146
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:32,200
And that people have written articles about the half a dozen issues of the National Geographic

147
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,800
that came out the year of her seventh birthday where a lot of these things are there.

148
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,880
But they're not in the February 1918 issues.

149
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,760
But it's true to memory.

150
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
It's true to memory.

151
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,560
Memory does that too.

152
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,480
But yeah, except that she knew she was making this up and as Alice said, she was really

153
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,440
worried about New Yorker fact checkers.

154
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,400
And they did check.

155
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,240
And she said, right, right.

156
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:14,760
And I heard her tell me, what's the thing when you have time with the crew so it works?

157
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,400
And she said, I know.

158
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,760
Yes, right.

159
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,480
She has in that poem in the Crusoe in England, she has Robinson Crusoe trying to remember

160
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,280
a line that is a famous line by Wordsworth.

161
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:37,880
And the New Yorker fact checkers pointed out that Wordsworth came much later, you know,

162
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,960
the next century, or, you know, in the next century from Robinson Crusoe.

163
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:52,120
And she said, yeah, I know.

164
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,840
I love the tents of I shant and lied.

165
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,880
Even losing you, I shant and lied.

166
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
It's very bizarre.

167
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Who says shant anyway?

168
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
But where is that?

169
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Yeah, right.

170
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Right.

171
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Right.

172
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
She was thrown back, wasn't it?

173
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Yeah, grandparents, do you think?

174
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Yeah.

175
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,480
Well, I think that's the phrase safe as houses.

176
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
That's a very old-

177
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Safe as houses.

178
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,800
My grandmother used to say safe as houses.

179
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Yes.

180
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Really?

181
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Oh, yeah.

182
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,240
And your grandmother was from English?

183
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
English.

184
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
My English grandmother.

185
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Oh, this was not the Canadian.

186
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,000
No, not the Canadian one, the English one.

187
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,840
One of the things that we were talking about, the temporality of the Crusoe poem, and when

188
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:45,560
we think about Bishop as a visual poet primarily, we not only want to remind ourselves of the

189
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:52,800
profundity of the accumulated meaning that's coming through detail rather than some imposition

190
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,400
of symbols into the poem.

191
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,320
But we also, I think, want to be aware that while she's a great describer, she also has

192
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,080
a sense of time in motion, and often her landscapes will be surprisingly, they'll be

193
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,760
like time lapses.

194
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,840
You can feel spring happening as she's describing a hill.

195
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,160
We're often in this kind of space that's half time and half space that is the space

196
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,560
of the mind, partly.

197
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,480
And there are many poems that do that.

198
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:32,160
And it's a little unsettling at times because you get disoriented in what is the

199
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
sequence.

200
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:40,120
The standard here, you know, or the measure, but she's so interested in that, the psychology

201
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
of space.

202
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,520
But maybe disoriented is okay.

203
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,440
Bigger party?

204
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,960
Maybe disoriented is okay.

205
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,680
Well, it's a place of discovery, certainly, right?

206
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,680
Yeah, and I'm thinking of that distorted and revealed.

207
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,720
Drowning passage, you know.

208
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Yeah.

209
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,520
Does somebody have that to read?

210
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,280
I do have it to read.

211
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Yeah.

212
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,080
I didn't mean to.

213
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
No, no, please.

214
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,520
I think it's from a letter to Anne Stevenson who wrote the first book on Bishop and sent

215
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,280
her lots of questions in Brazil.

216
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:18,720
And Bishop sent her back a very significant, manifestly important letter about seven pages

217
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
long, and this is a passage.

218
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,320
Oh, this is a bit long, but I think it's worth it.

219
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,720
It's not terribly long.

220
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,160
There's the gap between the observed world and the unknown, the psychic one, is something

221
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,480
that disturbs Bishop and her early work, and something that only long experience helped

222
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
her to overcome.

223
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,600
30 years later, she's able to speak as if there were no conflict.

224
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,720
There is no split.

225
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,000
This is Bishop.

226
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Dreams, works of art, some, glimpses of moments of empathy, is it?

227
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,360
Catch a peripheral vision of whatever it is one can never really see full face, but that

228
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,400
seems enormously important.

229
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,840
I can't believe we are wholly irrational, and I do admire Darwin, but reading Darwin

230
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:28,360
one admires the beautiful, solid case being built up of his endless, heroic observations.

231
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,480
I tell us a hust.

232
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:39,440
Almost unconscious or automatic, and then comes a sudden relaxation, a forgetful phrase, and

233
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:47,360
one feels the strangeness of his undertaking, sees the lonely young man, his eyes fixed

234
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:56,560
on facts and minute details, sinking or sliding giddily off into the unknown.

235
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:03,120
What one seems to want in art, she goes on, in experiencing it, is the same thing that

236
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:10,760
is necessary for its creation, a self-forgetful, perfectly useless concentration.

237
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,440
It's good in it.

238
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,360
But when you said disorienting, I thought of them.

239
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:25,000
You know, one of the things I love about that passage that you reinforced in the way you

240
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,880
really performed it for us is how she's always in the moment when she's writing, so that

241
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,080
there are all these interjections, the parentheses, the questioning of what she's just asserted.

242
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:43,000
There are so many ways that Bishop achieves that in poetry, sometimes by using a word

243
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,040
like here, where you just become very present in whatever the thought process is.

244
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,920
I think even there, when she's answering the question from a literary critic, you feel

245
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,720
her kind of thinking it through anew.

246
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,800
So it's very exciting.

247
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,320
It's like her poems in that way.

248
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:12,120
You remind me of another really famously great passage in Bishop, the end of, at the

249
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,080
fish houses.

250
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:25,560
She's visiting in Nova Scotia, and she has this kind of epiphany at the end of the poem

251
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:37,520
where she's dipping her hand in the cold Atlantic, and it's as if the water were a

252
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,480
transmutation of fire.

253
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,160
And then this is the conclusion of the poem.

254
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:54,440
It is like what we imagine knowledge to be, dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free, drawn

255
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:03,880
from the cold, hard mouth of the world, derived from the rocky breasts forever, flowing and

256
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:13,960
drawn, and since our knowledge is historical, flowing and flown, which is really kind of

257
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:24,520
playing with grammar, flown is not the past tense of flowing, but it's everything is

258
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
moving.

259
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,000
Nothing is static.

260
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,440
Her poems have that quality, and it's kind of a quality, and I think it's one of her

261
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,920
great qualities, one of the great qualities in her poems, is that she is living through

262
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
them.

263
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:50,280
It's not just something, and as you said before, and you've written wonderfully about her questioning

264
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:56,440
in poems, that nothing is fixed.

265
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:04,080
And life is something we experience as something constantly changing and never simple.

266
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,720
And I think there's an embrace of that, so that the skepticism is not a negative skepticism.

267
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,520
Modernism skepticism can be very negative, and hers is an interrogative mode of skepticism,

268
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,120
more than a negative harsh rupture.

269
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,400
And as you've said also, I think it's a way of bringing herself home.

270
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,200
It's a way of finding out.

271
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,400
Right, questions are ways of coming in.

272
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
I love that.

273
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,800
You know, Franny Blau, her friend, quoted, and I think it was the oral biography, she

274
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,960
said it was later in life that Bishop said to her, I think we're all, I think the world

275
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:45,440
is a mess, and we're all sub primitive, but we have to be gay in spite of it.

276
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,200
You know that passage in the poem, Lloyd, it is like what we imagine knowledge to be

277
00:21:52,200 --> 00:22:00,920
is embedded in her notebooks from the trip that she took to Nova Scotia to Raggedy Island

278
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,160
in that place.

279
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,040
Her publisher was pursuing her with the copies of her first book, and she escaped to Nova

280
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,840
Scotia.

281
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,240
And she always made it very hard for her own middle of the middle of the net, or to do

282
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,480
anything right.

283
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,040
And so anyhow, she passed on the ferry, the sanatorium, where her mother had been incarcerated

284
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,400
from the time she was five until she graduated from Vassar.

285
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:32,840
And in the notebooks, she writes, I passed the sanatorium where mother was, I hadn't

286
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,080
prepared for this, which really seems amazing when you read it.

287
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,560
I mean, that's the way you get to that place.

288
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,360
And then following that, almost immediately she writes, it is like what we imagine knowledge

289
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
to be.

290
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,040
So I think it has a kind of tragic undertone, or overtone for her.

291
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:00,200
And that same trip in the notebook, she has, the millions of grains are black, white, tan,

292
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,520
and rose mixed with quartz grains.

293
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:09,480
Rose and amethyst from her own, her self-portrait poem, sandpiper, which is such a great.

294
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Yeah.

295
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,440
I think some of that power of observation that we've been commenting on has to do probably

296
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,240
with a vigilance.

297
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,200
So perhaps we think she ought to have anticipated passing the sanatorium on the way to the island,

298
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,360
but she wasn't conscious of it.

299
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,960
She wasn't thinking about it.

300
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,640
And yet some part of her mind was probably prepared, and yet also shocked by that experience

301
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
the passing bond.

302
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,320
You know, that gives me a chance to quote something that I found so fascinating.

303
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:45,840
These are all from, these are little quotes from an early notebook that starts in Cuddy

304
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:53,680
Hunk, which is where Godnelled account says Shakespeare set the tempest in Cuddy Hunk,

305
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,400
this little island off of New Bedford.

306
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,080
And she went there with her friend, the only man in her life other than her friend Tom

307
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Waining, Bob Seaver, who was the brother of a friend, Barbara Chesney, I think, from

308
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Vassar.

309
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
And he loved her and gave her his fraternity pin.

310
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,400
And he wanted to marry her.

311
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,160
And he killed himself.

312
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,080
And she got a postcard three days after he died saying, go to hell, Elizabeth.

313
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,520
I mean, it was one of her early, really horrible tragedies.

314
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,760
But she quotes him.

315
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,720
And you can see how much she loved other people's observation.

316
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,880
And this again goes back to Sandpiper.

317
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,480
Bob said at Nantucket once the water where the waves come in on a coarse rolling gravel

318
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,800
that it sounded like fat sputtering in a pan.

319
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,320
The water behind Mrs. Crane's house coming in and short sliding waves on sand, he said

320
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,720
sounded like someone's shoveling snow.

321
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,440
Well, this turns up in Sandpiper.

322
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:04,400
This is 1934, 1962, little Sandpiper running along.

323
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,480
The beach hisses like fat on his left and interrupted, a sheet of interrupting water.

324
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,240
I mean, these images, she really thought in images.

325
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,440
And they stayed with her forever.

326
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,600
And the entries about New York City in the Depression years are fantastic.

327
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,560
And here's one that makes me think of the pacing that you talked about.

328
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,320
Remember the little essay that she wrote about?

329
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,120
The geese flying over his invasser.

330
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,320
And you know the musical drama.

331
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,920
Some of them are hanging back a little.

332
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,880
It's like a rubato in music.

333
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:51,680
And then she describes the whole migration as kind of having an invisible net around it.

334
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,600
And that always seems to me the kind of rhyme, the kind of dappled rhyme and the pacing that

335
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,400
she's after in her poems.

336
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,520
But this I think is fascinating.

337
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,600
The other day, and speaks to what you said, before I realized it.

338
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,120
The other day before I realized it, I saw a man winding a barber pole.

339
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,360
The iron poles in the city must be electric.

340
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,840
But this one wasn't.

341
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,880
A large keyhole just below the stripe section, and he wound it, sounded like a clock.

342
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,720
The pole was striking up slowly.

343
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,360
The stripes mounting with effort gradually faster and faster.

344
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
Fantastic.

345
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,160
So we come back to the power of her accurate eye.

346
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,720
I mean there's no questioning of that.

347
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,480
I mean it's absolutely there.

348
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,600
But in the pacing, the way she's written it, she gives you how she took it in.

349
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,520
I just love that.

350
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:54,600
There's a little moment in one of the letters that she's writing to Anne Stevenson.

351
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:02,320
Bishop was so kind of famously reticent about her personal life.

352
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:09,680
But here was this young American poet living in England, writing a book about her and asking

353
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,640
her all sorts of questions, and she actually responds to these questions, and she kind

354
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,600
of provides, and it's really great information for all of us who are interested in her, she

355
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,040
provides so much personal detail.

356
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,560
But there is this one absolutely chilling moment in this letter to Anne Stevenson.

357
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,200
She gets to 1934.

358
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,080
And this is her whole comment about 1934.

359
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,400
Met MM, Marianne Moore.

360
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,240
Met MM, Mother Died, Graduated.

361
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:58,000
That's like that on the front of her notebook from the year she was consultant to the Library

362
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,960
of Congress, Poetry Consultant, on the front of the notebook.

363
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,200
It says 1950, just about my worst comma so far.

364
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,960
Well, maybe this is a good moment.

365
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,720
I don't know if we have time to read a poem or something.

366
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,560
The poem that I had thought I might read to the group today is a poem called The Bite.

367
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:30,280
Since we're talking about Bishop's diary entries and so on, The Bite is a, I think, a relevant

368
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,480
poem.

369
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:42,480
It's about, a bite, B-I-G-H-T is a kind of landscape structure in Florida.

370
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,120
The Key West Bite is a kind of enclosing of water.

371
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,200
It's kind of like a bay.

372
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,080
It's a little small enclosure.

373
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,800
But of course it's also upon the bite.

374
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:01,160
But right underneath the tile of the poem, The Bite, we have rather uncharacteristically,

375
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,400
I think, on my birthday.

376
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,920
And it's a descriptive poem.

377
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,880
There's nothing about her birthday in the rest of the poem.

378
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,840
But anyone who knows Bishop will know that she wrote a letter to Robert Lowell while she

379
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:26,920
was in Key West and said the water at the Key West Bite looks like blue glass, sorry,

380
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
blue gas.

381
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:34,600
G-A-S-S, the water at the bite looks like blue gas.

382
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,200
The harbor is always a mess here.

383
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,080
Junkie little boats all piled up, some hung with sponges and always a few half sunk or

384
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,680
splintered up from the most recent hurricane.

385
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,920
It reminds me a little of my desk.

386
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:55,040
So you have to keep that in mind as you listen to this descriptive poem of The Bite.

387
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:01,880
And there's so many things I love about this poem, certainly the way that this kind of scanning

388
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:10,080
of the surface of the scene leads to this more inward kind of reflection eventually.

389
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,520
I love that about it.

390
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,640
But I also love just, as Alice suggested, Bishop loved names of things.

391
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,480
She was quite the fisherman.

392
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,920
And so she loved nautical vocabulary.

393
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:30,000
So there are great words like Jack's straw gaffes and things that if you're not a boat

394
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,040
person, you have to go and look up.

395
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,280
So there's that marvelous sense of vocabulary.

396
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:46,160
And it's also a marvelous poem because it is, on the one hand, frightening in places, close

397
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,920
to even suicidal kinds of imagery.

398
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,920
But it's also very funny.

399
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:58,880
And so there's this pulling back from something that's quite dark.

400
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,320
There is this vividness of the scene.

401
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,640
At the same time, there's a kind of dreamlike quality to the poem.

402
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,840
So I'll just read it.

403
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,000
At low tide, like this, how sheer the water is.

404
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,760
White crumbling ribs of moral, protrude and glare.

405
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:25,440
When the boats are dry, the pilings dry as matches, absorbing rather than being absorbed,

406
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,680
the water in the bite doesn't wet anything.

407
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:35,040
The color of the gas flame turned as low as possible.

408
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,960
One can smell it turning to gas.

409
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,560
So we could be in a Sylvia Plath poem at this point, right?

410
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,440
If one were boat layer, one would probably hear it turning to marimba music.

411
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:53,160
So there's a swerve, right?

412
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:59,640
The little ochre dredge at work off the end of the dock already plays the dry, perfectly

413
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,240
offbeat claves.

414
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,600
The birds are outsized.

415
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,120
And here comes the comic part and I think self-parodic.

416
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:15,440
Pelican's crash into this peculiar gas unnecessarily hard, it seems to me, like pickaxes rarely

417
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,440
coming up with anything to show for it and going off with enormous elbowings.

418
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,520
Black and white manor warbirds soar on impalpable drafts and open their tails like scissors

419
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:36,120
on the curves or tents or sorry, unpalpable drafts and open their tails like scissors

420
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,360
on the curves or tents them like wishbones till they tremble.

421
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,880
With frowsy sponge boats keep coming in with the obliging air of retrievers, bristling

422
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,280
with jack straw gaffs and hooks and decorated with bobbles of sponges.

423
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:00,400
There is a fence of chicken wire along the dock where glinting like little plowshares,

424
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:07,800
the blue gray shark tails are hung up to dry for the Chinese restaurant trade.

425
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:14,360
Some of the little white boats are still piled up against each other or lie on their sides,

426
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:23,120
stove in and not yet salvaged if they ever will be from the last bad storm, like torn

427
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,640
open unanswered letters.

428
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,000
The bite is littered with old correspondences.

429
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,240
Quick click goes the dredge and brings up a dripping jaw full of moral and all the untidy

430
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,680
activity continues, awful but cheerful.

431
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:51,240
And I love Bishop's gift for bringing important information into a poem through simile, the

432
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,880
unobtrusive mode that allows the world to be the world while the poet introduces her

433
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:07,480
own thoughts, so the crucial information here of the unopened letters torn open unanswered

434
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:15,600
letters and the allusions there to correspondences not only interpersonal but she was a great

435
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:21,040
reader at this time of the poet Baudelaire who had a poem called correspondance and so

436
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:27,840
she's introducing a conversation with Baudelaire about the nature of the symbol but in this

437
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,080
most subtle and delicate way.

438
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,840
The last line by the way and I maybe one of my colleagues here can tell the story of

439
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,480
how this happened but the last line all the untidy activity continues, awful but cheerful

440
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,200
is engraved in her tombstone.

441
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
So it continues.

442
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:53,440
I just wanted to say that in rereading her poems for today one of the things that impressed

443
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:03,320
me the most was the incredibly remarkable balance of tension between words that we could call

444
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,160
happy and words that we could call scary or grim.

445
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
Yes.

446
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,640
And this is an excellent example of it, it's usually done in imagery, in descriptors but

447
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,520
here the last line awful and cheerful brings it up almost to a level of abstraction.

448
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
Exactly.

449
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,760
That tension that is always there in the poems.

450
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
Right.

451
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
Right.

452
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,240
I know when we were talking about her, we brought up her love of naming things.

453
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,680
I really feel that was imprinted early on with her love of Hopkins, pride beauty and all

454
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,520
trades, their gear and tackling trends.

455
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,520
Yes.

456
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
And the sounds.

457
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
The sounds.

458
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,640
This poem is just full of fabulous sounds, the mix of the angles.

459
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,520
I mean the word the bite itself has that kind of wonderful angle of Saxon for those of

460
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
these.

461
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,920
I was going to say, am I interrupting?

462
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,960
I was going to say that we talk about her eyes so much and everyone does but her ears

463
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
and that's all that.

464
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,960
She really is living in sound the whole time I think.

465
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Yeah.

466
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,880
And in this poem, Sound and Sight Slipped Together we have that synesthesia where the

467
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,800
blue gas turns to her inbox.

468
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,040
That's right.

469
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,040
That's wonderful.

470
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
Yeah.

471
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Yeah.

472
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:30,160
By the way, Lloyd has reprinted in the Library of America edition the entire correspondence

473
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,160
with Anne Stevenson, which is really like a primer for her.

474
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Yeah.

475
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:45,000
It's just one of the few places where she is actually talking about her life.

476
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,160
And even in the extraordinary correspondence with Robert Lowell, that 700 page correspondence

477
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:03,080
that reads like a Victorian novel, it's so gripping, but she doesn't really talk very

478
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,160
much about her personal history, her background.

479
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:14,160
And they're really talking about more immediate things, absolutely riveting and heartbreaking.

480
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:21,720
But it is that one place where I think she was really, she was concerned enough to have

481
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:29,120
that after being, you know, she'd won some prizes and she was being published in the

482
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:34,680
New Yorker, you know, she had a career, but she was also living in Brazil.

483
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:42,520
And I think this was, she was just vulnerable enough to be willing to answer Anne Stevenson's

484
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
questions.

485
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
Yeah.

486
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:51,000
And also she said, you know, she sometimes wrote as many as 40 letters a day.

487
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,720
And she described that as sort of working without really working.

488
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:03,680
Let me just say, you know, for people who may not know the biographical data, Elizabeth

489
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,880
Bishop had the most dramatically tragic early childhood.

490
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,000
Her father died when she was eight months old.

491
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,040
Her mother, I don't know what the story is there about her mother's mental illness, but

492
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,420
she was hospitalized and institutionalized when Elizabeth herself was five, correct?

493
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,080
And then she went to live with grandparents.

494
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,480
And I think there was some shuffling back and forth between the sets of grandparents.

495
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,360
Was there a custody battle also?

496
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
No.

497
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,160
But the parents, on the father's side, they...

498
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,040
They eventually understood that it was, she got asthma there.

499
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:45,560
She said that she felt about on the same level as the dog, that, that, that, that, that,

500
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,560
you know.

501
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:56,040
Well, she was living with her maternal grandparents in Nova Scotia, in a small town in Nova Scotia.

502
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,000
And really enjoying herself as a kid.

503
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,520
And her maternal grandparents were not at all wealthy.

504
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,880
I mean, just maybe barely lower middle class.

505
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,680
It was a towner.

506
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
Yeah.

507
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:25,200
And working family and living in this little cottage in a small town in Nova Scotia.

508
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:34,000
Bishops' fathers' family were wealthy people from Worcester.

509
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:43,840
Bishops' paternal grandfather owned a construction company who built, you know, the Boston Public

510
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,040
Library, Symphony Hall.

511
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:53,200
I mean, they were really major, not architects, but builders.

512
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:03,360
And the grandparents felt that, you know, their granddaughter living in this kind of

513
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:12,800
practically on a farm, running around the streets of Great Village, the ironic time of

514
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,160
the city, Great Village.

515
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:25,480
Running around barefoot and bringing cows out into the meadow and playing tricks, this

516
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,840
was not what their granddaughter ought to be brought up to be.

517
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:38,160
And they essentially, they didn't exactly abduct her, but they came, it was an agreement,

518
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:46,720
and they brought Elizabeth to Worcester where she was absolutely miserable.

519
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:55,760
And as Alice said, develop asthma, develop eczema that never, the as she almost died of

520
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:03,920
asthma a number of times over her whole life, the eczema never was completely cured, it was

521
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,240
always recurring.

522
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:15,240
And finally, the grandparents kind of had to admit that they had really made a mistake

523
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:25,320
and kind of farmed Elizabeth out to her and her mother's sister who was living in Revere,

524
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,280
Massachusetts, one of the suburbs.

525
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,640
And then they paid for, she went to the Walnut Hill School and then to Vassar, so they certainly

526
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:43,720
paid for absolutely first grade education, but at a great cost to Bishop.

527
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,760
And she was so sick when she first got there they had to carry her up the stairs.

528
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,040
And she didn't go to school until she was 15 or something like that.

529
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:59,920
And that's her aunt got her long fellow in Wordsworth and Blake and Hopkins and she entered

530
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
those poems.

531
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:10,080
And one little detail about her mother being institutionalized was that Elizabeth was not

532
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,360
allowed to ever visit her mother.

533
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:23,160
And you know, they thought this was what psychiatry was in 1918, that it would be too

534
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:30,440
upsetting to Elizabeth's mother to see her daughter.

535
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,960
So she was absolutely forbidden to see her.

536
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:43,560
So once her mother was taken away and institutionalized, Bishop never saw her again.

537
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,240
So that met M.M.

538
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:54,440
Well suddenly she has this new sort of surrogate mother in Marion Moore, met M.M.

539
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,800
Mother died, graduated.

540
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,080
You know that that, we'll be awfully careful again.

541
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,080
Exactly.

542
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:07,680
And for those in the audience who are not terribly familiar with Bishop Therese, beautiful poems

543
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:14,520
in which she explores her childhood, very famously the poem Sestina, the poem in the

544
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,360
waiting room.

545
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,520
She's a great poet of childhood and memory.

546
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,280
She's also a great poet of travel and landscape and sometimes those things to come together.

547
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:34,680
But I think this terrible, terrible suffering, not that it's a consolation, but for us as

548
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,560
a gift that she was able to transform it into something very beautiful.

549
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,080
Some of the best poems of Bishop I think are about childhood and memory.

550
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:50,360
I wanted to read a poem also, but that goes a little later.

551
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:56,600
I mean this isn't a childhood poem, but it's a poem about Brazil.

552
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:03,760
And Brazil, she never intended to stay in Brazil.

553
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,240
But on her first visit she got very sick.

554
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,280
She was going to travel around Cape Horn on a Norwegian freighter.

555
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,120
She got as far as Brazil and she was visiting, the boat was docking for a couple of weeks.

556
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:24,040
And she was going to visit these two acquaintances of hers, whom she'd met in New York, a Brazilian

557
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:30,080
woman and her American partner.

558
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:40,760
And she, and this was connected to the asthma and the eczema, she ate a piece of cashew fruit,

559
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:50,280
the nuts, or cashew nuts are in, and had a violent allergic reaction and a phylactic

560
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,640
shock and had to be hospitalized.

561
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,160
And she blew up, she couldn't breathe, her throat was constricted.

562
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,080
She missed the boat.

563
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:07,240
And fell in love with the Brazilian woman.

564
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:14,240
And the Brazilian woman, de Maseto Saguares, came from an aristocratic family, had some

565
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:24,960
money, said stay, I'll build you a studio, and come to my home, recuperate in this magnificent

566
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,600
home in the mountains.

567
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:34,080
And that was, it really kind of saved her life right after she had that miserable year

568
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:43,760
as consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress, the old name for Poet Laureate.

569
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,600
And she really, for many years, she had a really great life in Brazil.

570
00:45:49,600 --> 00:46:00,640
And then things, for various complicated reasons, including political and the commitments of

571
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,080
water to public works, and she was building a park in Rio, it's the most beautiful park

572
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,720
in Rio now, but it essentially, it killed her.

573
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:22,400
And the relationship began to deteriorate and Bishop left Brazil, and sort of tragic

574
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
story.

575
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,400
Are you going to read a rifle?

576
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
I'm going to read Pink Dawn.

577
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,840
Oh, oh, good.

578
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:34,560
And she has a poem that she started on the verge of leaving Brazil.

579
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,520
I think the original title of this poem was Farewell to Rio.

580
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,120
And then she changed the title to Pink Dog.

581
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:49,120
It took her 20 years to finish it, and it was actually, it wasn't the last poem she

582
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,600
started.

583
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:57,120
I hope Jean is going to read the last poem she started.

584
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,000
But it's the last poem she finished.

585
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,640
It was actually the last poem that she succeeded in finishing.

586
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:14,720
And it just, I wanted to read it because it says some, it's such a wonderful example

587
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:23,080
of the things that Bonnie was talking about before, the images of the city, and then the

588
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:33,120
awful but cheerful in a kind of extreme because there's a really bitter joke in the poem.

589
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:42,120
And then the sound effects, where she is actually imitating the sound of a samba.

590
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:52,200
And I think it's my theory that this is her parody of the girl from Ipanema.

591
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:58,440
And really you can almost, you can almost sing this to the music of the girl from Ipanema.

592
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,440
When did that song get published?

593
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:07,240
Well that was in the 60s, and it was written by a close friend of hers, Venetia's Demariah,

594
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,040
she was a very famous poet and actor.

595
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,840
She translated him.

596
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,760
Ladies man, she translated him.

597
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:27,240
We have to say her translation of Venetia's sonnet of intimacy, Bishop was so proud of

598
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,240
it.

599
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,400
You know, people have this image of her as this very prim, you know, misbishop, people

600
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,520
called her misbishop.

601
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:43,480
That translation had the word, ended with the word piss.

602
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:52,000
And it was the first time a four-letter word had ever appeared in a poem in the New Yorker.

603
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,600
And Bishop was so proud of it.

604
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,920
I mean she really bragged about it.

605
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,600
But let me read this poem.

606
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:06,600
I think it's one of her most amazing poems, Pink Dog, Rio de Janeiro.

607
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:12,880
And remember, the girl from Ipanema begins with this beautiful Brazilian woman and a

608
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:23,240
bikini crossing the Avanita Atlantica to go to the beach, Pink Dog.

609
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,240
The sun is blazing and the sky is blue.

610
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:36,360
Umbrellas clothe the beach in every hue, naked, you trot across the avenue.

611
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:45,480
Oh, never have I seen a dog so bare, naked and pink without a single hair, startled the

612
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,480
passers-by, draw back and stare.

613
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,400
Of course, they're mortally afraid of rabies.

614
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,080
You are not mad.

615
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,560
You have a case of scabies.

616
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,360
But look intelligent.

617
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,400
Where are your babies?

618
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,640
A nursing mother by those hanging teats.

619
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:16,120
In what slum have you hidden them poor bitch while you go begging, living by your wits?

620
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:20,720
Didn't you know it's been in all the papers to solve this problem, how they deal with

621
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,240
beggars?

622
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,280
They take and throw them in the tidal rivers.

623
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:36,680
Yes, idiots, paralytics, parasites go bobbing in the ebbing sewage nights out in the suburbs

624
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,560
where there are no lights.

625
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:47,320
If they do this to anyone who begs, drugged, drunk or sober with or without legs, what

626
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,960
would they do to sick four-legged dogs?

627
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:58,720
In the cafes and on the sidewalk corners, the joke is going round that all the beggars

628
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,560
who can afford them now wear life preservers.

629
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:12,880
In your condition, you would not be able even to float much less to dog paddle.

630
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:19,640
Now look, the practical, the sensible solution is to wear a phantazia.

631
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:27,080
Tonight you simply can't afford to be a nysore, but no one will ever see a dog in

632
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,560
mascara this time of year.

633
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:36,000
Ash Wednesday will come, but carnival is here.

634
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,320
What sombas can you dance?

635
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,440
What will you wear?

636
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:48,960
They say that carnivals degenerate, radios, Americans, or something have ruined it completely.

637
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,560
They are just talking.

638
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,640
Carnival is always wonderful.

639
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,680
A depolated dog would not look well.

640
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,200
Dress up.

641
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:07,000
Dress up and dance at carnival.

642
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:15,360
She actually breaks the line in the middle of the word an, a-n.

643
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:20,080
You simply can't afford to be a nysore.

644
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,840
The n is on the beginning of the next line.

645
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,840
Glens.

646
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,840
Yeah, glens.

647
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,840
Right.

648
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,240
That s a, should we read song for the rainy season?

649
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,240
Oh, yes.

650
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:42,600
Which kind of describes almost in anticipation of the end of the paradisical time in Brazil.

651
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:47,400
That s a poem I wish were a lot better known.

652
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,400
I forget.

653
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,400
Oh, God.

654
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:59,640
She talked about pacing by the little spring by their home, and the maid would be, she

655
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:05,840
said, what must she think of me as I go back repeating phrases over and over?

656
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,920
And I can t help thinking, how did she feel when she came up with hidden, oh, hidden in

657
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,800
the high fog, the house we live in?

658
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:21,200
Song for the rainy season, hidden, oh, hidden in the high fog, the house we live in beneath

659
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,160
the magnetic rock.

660
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:31,640
Rain, rainbow ridden, where blood black, bromelias, lichens, owls, and the lint of the waterfalls

661
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,200
cling, familiar, unbidden.

662
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:42,280
In a dim age of water, the brook sings loud for a rib cage of giant fern.

663
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:50,600
Vapor climbs up the thick growth effortlessly, turns back, holding them both house and rock

664
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,960
in a private cloud.

665
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,880
At night on the roof, blind drops crawl, and the ordinary brown owl gives us proof he can

666
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,880
count.

667
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:06,600
Five times, always five, he stamps and takes off after the fat frogs that shilling for

668
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,680
love, clamor, and mount.

669
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,840
House open house to the white dew and the milk white sunrise kind to the eyes.

670
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:23,360
To membership of silverfish, mouse, bookworms, big moths, with a wall for the mildew's ignorant

671
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,840
map.

672
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:32,600
Marked and tarnished by the warm touch of the warm breath, maculate cherished, rejoice,

673
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:39,400
for a later era will differ, a difference that kills or intimidates, much of all our

674
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,320
small, shadowy life.

675
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:50,360
Without water, the great rock will stare un-magnetized, there, no longer wearing rainbows or rain,

676
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:56,440
the forgiving air and the high fog gone, the owls will move on, and the several waterfalls

677
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:01,280
shrivel in the steady sun.

678
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,440
She saw it coming.

679
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:12,280
I mean, it's that wonderful description of how, of just this open, how, this is a modern

680
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,680
house with glass walls, and you know, it was just, you almost couldn't tell where the house

681
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,920
ended and the, you know, rainforest.

682
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:28,120
Yeah, actually, I have that wonderful description in a letter saying it's all part of the really

683
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:33,960
lofty vagueness of Brazil, where a cloud is entering my living room right this minute.

684
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,960
Right.

685
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:40,640
One of the things that that poem brings out, and actually all the poems we've read bring

686
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:50,000
out, it brings out, is how often her poems engage animal life.

687
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:57,840
And I mean, in the case of pink dog in a most sort of parable way, I mean, pink dog is

688
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,840
it.

689
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,840
She's really identifying.

690
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:05,440
Of course, yeah, pink dog is sort of an allegorical figure there, but there's a continuum, I think,

691
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:11,560
and all the animals in Bishop are both, they're, they're, they're figures from a kind of the

692
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:18,520
unconscious life of the world, but they're also surrogates for the poet, her way into,

693
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,520
to get closer to that unconscious life of the world.

694
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:28,040
And so she's a great poet of animals and encounters with animals in a way very different

695
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:32,760
from other poets, Marianne Moore, for instance, where there is much more the sense of writing

696
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:41,760
fables in the ASOP tradition, or else scientific tracks even, you know, which feature articles

697
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,760
on animals.

698
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:49,680
Bishop's animals have this, this wonderful otherness and yet communication with the human world

699
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,960
or, or resonance with the human world and the owls and so on in that scene, I think, bring

700
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,720
that out really, really well.

701
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,080
Yeah, I actually love the number five.

702
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:05,240
Five.

703
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:15,560
Which reminds me, just back to that thing about her vision and what a curse as well as

704
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:22,800
what a blessing is, in a, in a, in a prose poem called rainy season sub-tropics, there's

705
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:30,240
a section called giant toad, which begins, I will close at the near the beginning, my

706
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:40,760
eyes bulge and hurt, they are my one great beauty, even so, they see too much above below

707
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,600
and yet there is not much to see.

708
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,600
Yeah.

709
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,400
Those are extraordinary.

710
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,400
I love those.

711
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,400
Oh, Jean.

712
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:57,840
Well, I would just think, I don't know if this is obvious, but I just say it in case

713
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,840
it isn't.

714
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:07,240
But it seems to me that the eye, the everything she saw all around her, probably from when

715
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:16,560
she was born, was a way of connecting and locating herself in the world.

716
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,840
And I think her rhymes were like that too.

717
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:23,880
I was thinking before we came today that I don't really have anything to say about her

718
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,880
rhymes except that.

719
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,560
But it seemed to me they were comforting to her as they are to us as readers.

720
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,280
Rhyme always is, I think.

721
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,040
It's either very emphatic only or comforting.

722
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:44,160
But she has, I was first reading her when I was very young, luckily, had her north and

723
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,640
south and a cold spring in my raincoat pocket when I was in college because somebody told

724
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,280
me we'd miss Bishop.

725
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,080
We called everybody that then.

726
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,840
I mean, all the women miss more.

727
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,240
It was ridiculous.

728
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:01,800
But anyway, I did have that book and I would be so struck by her rhymes because I wasn't

729
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,400
sure, since 1956, if you should rhyme or not.

730
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,440
Anyway, nobody could tell you.

731
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,200
But she was rhyming almost it seemed without effort.

732
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,600
And I guess that's how all great poets do.

733
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,080
But in a wonderful field, I'm back to you.

734
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:25,160
In a wonderfully fluid way, I think of the fantastic use of rhyme in something like the

735
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,480
moose where it's not a rhyme scheme.

736
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:38,760
But often she's rhyming words of nature and human world words, so, you know, birches and

737
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,920
churches.

738
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,040
So that there's this beautiful integration that can happen in the place of rhyme.

739
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,800
And it's a master and disaster.

740
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,360
Yes, she stole that one from W.H.

741
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,360
Auden.

742
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:55,240
But you know, when you say that, it reminded me of something.

743
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:59,920
Now I can't think what.

744
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,480
Oh, I know what it was.

745
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,960
But I have a friend who's very, very good at writing a form of our Joan Larkin.

746
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,000
And she has said that, and this probably gave me the idea of this thing of seeing and hearing,

747
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
too.

748
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,640
And Joan said she does a crown of solace about some painful subject.

749
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:25,640
But she said it's like a handhold through the pain for her to have the rhyme scheme,

750
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,800
very tight rhyme scheme in that case.

751
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,920
But I think by the time of the moose, she probably didn't even have to think about it.

752
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,920
Oh, no.

753
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:38,280
You know, it was so probably in her body, but I'm sure she did think about it.

754
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,120
But you know, she said to a friend of mine, I'm going to stop there a minute, but she

755
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:48,480
said to a friend of mine, Eleanor Ross Taylor, a very wonderful poet that you know, Alice.

756
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,240
I mean, excuse me, Elizabeth had just done reading.

757
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:59,840
And so Eleanor poet, too, came up to her and said, I just love that poem, the moose.

758
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:05,320
It's just, I don't, it's just a miraculous poem, because we all feel that.

759
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:11,880
But Elizabeth, I think this characteristic from what I know, said, it's just what happened.

760
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:18,360
You know, and that's a very telling thing as well as a sort of fun anecdote, I think,

761
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,960
of her modesty.

762
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:26,720
But I think, I think she liked what happened, as well as, of course, the pain.

763
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,120
But I think it gave her her life.

764
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,120
Yeah.

765
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,120
I do think so.

766
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:36,160
I thought you had a five day to cap a poem and she heard somebody saying afterwards, not

767
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,640
bad for a poem.

768
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,640
For a poem.

769
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:48,360
Also, it was introduced by a provost, or whoever was in charge of that reading, as Elizabeth

770
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,800
Bishop will now read her new poem, The Moose.

771
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,280
The Moose.

772
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,080
She got a lot of mileage out of that, too.

773
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:06,240
But I was thinking, hearing you talk about, about, because I'm hoping you will read Sonnet.

774
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:14,560
Because the rhymes are so intricate and they're often, not all the rhymes are at the ends

775
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:21,360
of the words, but they're kind of buried in the middle of, in the ends of lines, but buried

776
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,520
in the middle of lines.

777
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:30,680
And there's so much play, if I think if you just heard the poem, you couldn't actually

778
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:37,720
tell where the lines were supposed to end because they're so playful and tricky and

779
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,720
marvelous.

780
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,520
I think that's so beautiful and I think that's how she got to be.

781
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,040
You don't, I mean, you know her.

782
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:47,920
So, that feels to me like she just did it all her life and that's how she got to be

783
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,920
there, do you think?

784
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:49,920
Yeah.

785
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,920
Yeah.

786
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,720
But she just, I don't know, Sonnet.

787
01:02:53,720 --> 01:03:02,840
Well, I'll read it.

788
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,040
Caught the bubble in the spirit level, a creature divided and the compass needle wobbling and

789
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,840
wavering undecided.

790
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:19,240
Freed the broken, the mama, there's mercury running away and the rainbow bird from the

791
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:30,120
narrow bevel of the empty mirror flying wherever it feels like gay.

792
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:35,480
That was the poem that ran in the New Yorker after Bishop died and there was some conversation

793
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:43,120
between Alice, Beth, Fessel and Howard because Bishop had corrected that poem by phone and

794
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:49,080
the manuscript as it was in Galilee in the New Yorker said, caught the bubble in the

795
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:55,720
spirit level, contrarily guided, not a creature divided and then she changed it.

796
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,320
But Howard had to testify to that really.

797
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,920
That's a good change.

798
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:06,680
And mirrors were very important to Bishop and in her early notebook she had this wonderful

799
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,080
entry, age 23.

800
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:17,160
A woman sat, let me see, her wicked mirror took her face, crumpled it quickly and flung

801
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,240
it back.

802
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,040
And she loved inversions.

803
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,040
Yeah.

804
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:29,000
I mean, we were talking about rhyme and of course, as you well know, Sonnet is an upside

805
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,160
dance on it.

806
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:36,600
It's not only a very narrow Sonnet, maybe instead of the full I am in cantameter, but

807
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:45,320
it's not eight and six in the traditional Sonnet form, but it's upside down, six and

808
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,320
eight.

809
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:52,920
So she's playing with inversion in all kinds of ways and yet it never feels contrived.

810
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,760
I think that's what you were saying about that kind of, it just seems to emerge.

811
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,760
Just seems to have to.

812
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,280
Isn't there an image in one of the poems that takes place in Brazil in which the person

813
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,760
has to find a mirror that's never been looked into?

814
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,320
Yes, that's a river man.

815
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,320
Oh, the river man.

816
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,320
That's right.

817
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,320
Yeah, that's right.

818
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:14,960
It imagines herself as a shaman type figure.

819
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,960
Yes.

820
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,440
There's also a poem called, an earlier poem called Insomnia about the moon in the bureau

821
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:34,520
mirror and looking into the mirror as a world inverted, even the phrase is inverted.

822
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:41,840
Their day is always night and forget what the list of thing is and the last line in this

823
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,920
inverted world is, and you love me.

824
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:50,120
Those were the only poems that she sort of openly said, it's about a love affair, about

825
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:55,960
a failed love affair, the beautiful poem conversation, until a name and all its connotation mean

826
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,960
the same.

827
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,960
She's so beautiful.

828
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:05,800
Well, I'd kind of like to recite sandpiper, her self-portrait thinking about all of her

829
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:13,120
travels and that fat pan, that fat sputtering in the pan.

830
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:18,200
So the only reference I think is to Blake to see the world in a grain of sand and eternity

831
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,800
in an hour.

832
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:25,240
So sandpiper, the roaring alongside he takes for granted and that every so often the world

833
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,040
is bound to shake.

834
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:33,280
He runs, he runs to the south, finical, awkward, in a state of controlled panic, a student of

835
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,920
Blake.

836
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:40,760
The beach, this is like fat on his left, an interrupting sheet of water, a sheet of interrupting

837
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:46,160
water, comes and goes and glazes over his dark and brittle feet.

838
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,600
He runs, he runs straight through it, watching his toes.

839
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:56,200
Watching rather the spaces of sand between them wear no detail too small, the Atlantic

840
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,200
drains backwards and downwards.

841
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,800
As he runs, he stares at the dragging grains.

842
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,400
The world is a mist and then the world is minute and fast and clear.

843
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,880
The tide is higher or lower, he couldn't tell you which his beak is focused, he is preoccupied.

844
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,040
Looking for something, something, something poor bird, he is obsessed.

845
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:24,960
The millions of grains are black, white, tan and brown mixed with quartz grains, rose

846
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:30,640
and amethyst, gray, not brown, black, white, tan and gray mixed with quartz.

847
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,760
I love that poem so much.

848
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,360
Speak is focused, he is preoccupied.

849
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,040
Thank you.

850
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:51,400
Ellie Carter, the late Elliot Carter, who recently died almost 104, still writing, wrote a song

851
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:57,440
cycle based on Elizabeth Bishop Holmes and Sandpiper is in that cycle.

852
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:03,640
He knew that that was an autobiographical poem.

853
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:14,320
The sandpiper in his setting is played by an oboe, which was Carter's own instrument.

854
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:27,760
He was mirroring her autobiography and searching for something, something, something.

855
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:34,680
The world is minute and vast, both, which seems very Bishop.

856
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:37,640
The shift in scale that we're always talking about.

857
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:43,520
It's so vibrant when a poet does that.

858
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,960
She didn't like the setting.

859
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,480
She didn't like Carter's setting.

860
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,040
She didn't get it.

861
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:55,480
The other thing about the sandpiper and insomnia and many of her poems is that she had this

862
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:01,440
conversation with the tradition of poetry.

863
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:11,440
She was deeply read but not at all showy about her reading, not a poet that requires footnotes.

864
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,640
She didn't like footnotes.

865
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:22,920
But there are conversations going on with poetry of the past, not for the purpose of

866
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:32,480
displaying her edition or a particular narrow kind of mastery, but just because the conversation,

867
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,720
one of the things poetry is for is to conduct a conversation over time.

868
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:42,520
And insomnia has a conversation with Philip Sidney's famous poem, Addressed to the Moon.

869
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:48,680
And of course Blake's Auguries of Innocence in the sandpiper.

870
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:57,120
She quotes a Herbert line in waiting at Wellfleet, although she doesn't say who she's quoting.

871
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,960
And it doesn't matter if you don't know.

872
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:06,800
The poem is complete by itself, about that knowledge, but there's this layer that is

873
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,280
pleasing to those of us who do know the poems of the past.

874
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:15,680
And it just reminds us that poetry exists in those two dimensions of the contemporaneity

875
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:21,840
and the long vertical feeling of the tradition.

876
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,400
Speaking of Herbert, do you all know the Herbert dream she had?

877
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,080
You all do.

878
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:34,480
She dreamed that Herbert appeared to her in her dream and with his curls and his scarlet

879
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:40,080
shirt, I'll say.

880
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,600
And he said to her, I can help you.

881
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,600
Isn't that nice?

882
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,600
That is a Patrick Priest.

883
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,640
I wish I'd get one like that.

884
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,880
But I do believe he did.

885
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,880
He really did.

886
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,880
After a lot of time, she carried Herbert with her.

887
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,680
In camp when she was a little girl.

888
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,680
I think she did.

889
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:08,080
Talking about George Herbert, the 17th century poet, I think I didn't say that.

890
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,800
It reminds me too that something that we haven't mentioned, I don't think, but which appears

891
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:21,640
also in many of her poems, sort of not too obviously, is the architecture of the church.

892
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,320
Or maybe a person at the church.

893
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,920
She doesn't make a big point about it, but when she's describing her landscapes, there's

894
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,920
a spire.

895
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,920
Right.

896
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:30,920
She's qualifying whether it's a church.

897
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,920
Her cage like the Jesuit church.

898
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:33,920
No, no.

899
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,920
Yes, she does.

900
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:35,920
Do you know that house?

901
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,920
Oh, excuse me.

902
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,920
No, go ahead.

903
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,920
No, go ahead.

904
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,880
The house in Great Village in Nova Scotia is right next to the church.

905
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:48,440
And she had an amazing, which was quite a high spire for Great Village.

906
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:53,720
And she had an amazing thing that she says, somewhere, and I don't remember where.

907
01:11:53,720 --> 01:12:01,000
If you touched it, this is after her mother had had the scream, she wrote a beautiful story.

908
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,600
Wasn't it a story called the scream about the...

909
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,600
In the village.

910
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,760
In the village, it's called.

911
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,520
And yeah, the low poem was called the scream.

912
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:15,080
Anyway, it's about a moment of breakdown of her mother when she's being fitted for address.

913
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:19,160
And it's a beautiful, beautiful story if you get the chance to read it.

914
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,680
I think the first words in the story are the scream.

915
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,680
The scream, yeah.

916
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:23,680
And that's it.

917
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:24,680
Oh, okay.

918
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:30,200
Well, I think it's in there that she talks about the church steeple.

919
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:35,440
And if you put your finger on the church steeple, it would be the scream.

920
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,440
It's amazing.

921
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,440
Yeah, that is just the image.

922
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,440
It is the image.

923
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,440
It is like a tuning.

924
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,440
Like a...

925
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,440
Yeah.

926
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,440
It's the scream.

927
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,240
But when you mentioned the church, she was right next to that church for those years,

928
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,240
you know.

929
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,800
She has the Baptist hymns to the seal.

930
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,800
I mean, a lot of...

931
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,640
You can hear also, uh, some of her poetry has the cadence of Dickinson who got her cadences

932
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,640
from the hymns.

933
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,520
And you can see that carryover as well.

934
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,520
Yes.

935
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,520
Yeah.

936
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:10,600
But there is this sort of quiet compass, you know, where the church is being found in

937
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,760
the landscape in many poems, I think.

938
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,160
Yeah, it comes up that way.

939
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,160
Abivalently sometimes.

940
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,160
Of course.

941
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:21,160
She was in the calluses and I think she had her reservations and stuff.

942
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,000
Yeah, the gold and the Vatican made her session.

943
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Yeah.

944
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Oh, I think that...

945
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,400
I was looking through the early notebooks to see if I could share some things and...

946
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:38,000
I think that one of the things about Bishop's poems is that there's always...

947
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,200
She has a good sense of drama.

948
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,200
Oh, yes.

949
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,680
That's where the mystery comes in.

950
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,520
And there was this little tiny fragment.

951
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:52,080
Again, she's 24 years old here in New York, 1934.

952
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:59,520
When we walked across the bridge, the sun particularized certain windows off the river.

953
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:05,760
If you should go to such a place at such a time, burst in and say...

954
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:06,760
Mm.

955
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:07,760
Mm.

956
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:08,760
It's great.

957
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:13,760
And that's what she took from seeing the window.

958
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,760
That's the one...

959
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,760
Oh, my God.

960
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,760
These notebooks are great.

961
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,760
Did she ever try to write a play?

962
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:23,760
I mean, there's...

963
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,760
She read a lot of plays in the library.

964
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,960
There's a lot of dialogue in her poems, Bill Fins.

965
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,960
She was.

966
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,760
She did translate the birds.

967
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,760
Yeah, the masks.

968
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,760
That's right, of course.

969
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,760
Yes.

970
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:37,760
And Elizabeth and masks, she's driving in such a nice reading.

971
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,760
Yeah.

972
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,760
But she never tried to write a original play.

973
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,760
No.

974
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,760
She wrote everything else, I think.

975
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,760
Yes, didn't she?

976
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,680
And she loved, loved, loved witty people.

977
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,760
Whitt was very important to her.

978
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,600
And I think she said that Pauline Hemingway was the wittiest person that she had ever

979
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,600
known.

980
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:01,200
But she's in one of letters, or maybe to Anne Stevenson, I think.

981
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,480
She said, I've been lucky in my life.

982
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,080
I've known some very, very witty people.

983
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:12,160
And what's the line in one art, at the end of one art?

984
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,160
The jokey voice.

985
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,160
The jokey voice.

986
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,160
Oh, the gesture.

987
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,160
The gesture of one.

988
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,160
But the jokey voice.

989
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,160
Yeah, the jokey voice.

990
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,160
So important.

991
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:29,960
And that the two most serious relationships that she has in most serious is the wrong

992
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:30,960
word.

993
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:39,320
The two really biggest, deepest relationships that she had were with people who were very

994
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:46,200
witty and entertained a lot of, allegedly, I mean, I never knew a lot of.

995
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:54,400
But Alice Mepfessel, who is very funny, very amusing person, no nonsense.

996
01:15:54,400 --> 01:16:01,200
Not very interested in poetry, but who could make Elizabeth laugh.

997
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,920
That's great.

998
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:08,960
There's a little visual anecdote that Bishop wrote in her notebooks.

999
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:15,600
And spot her friend Margaret Miller, who she loved very deeply in school and college.

1000
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:21,680
And Margaret ended up with the Museum of Modern Art as a curator.

1001
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,920
I think one of the authors was Schwitter's catalog.

1002
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:34,800
Anyway, Margaret leaned out of the car with a comb in her hand and pretended to comb the

1003
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,800
round chromium dome of the spotlight.

1004
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,160
Then she tied a scarf around its head.

1005
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:47,200
You just, you see that she was so, I'm trying to play.

1006
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:54,220
She was a musician, Schwitter's and Paul Clay, who were two of the wittiest artists, were

1007
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:58,100
also two of her favorite artists.

1008
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:04,760
Well, I mean, Bishop didn't write a vast amount of poetry.

1009
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,660
The collective Bishop isn't that big.

1010
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,960
Well, it's bigger now than it was before.

1011
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,840
But, I mean, what she allowed to be published wasn't very much.

1012
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:18,120
But as some of you may know, she was a great letter writer, I think you already mentioned.

1013
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:22,200
And her sense of humor in the letters is just fantastic.

1014
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,680
I think they'll be like Byron's later on.

1015
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:29,680
They'll publish them in 13 volumes.

1016
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:38,880
She'd see, there's a wonderful description in Key West of two pelicans on some kind of

1017
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:46,480
boardwalk or something, and a blowfish, they swoop down and grabbed a blowfish.

1018
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:51,000
And one of them had swallowed it, and blowfish expand.

1019
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,280
So it started to expand inside the gullet of this pelican, and he spit it out.

1020
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,600
She said like a basketball to the other pelican.

1021
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,760
So they started playing basketball with the blowfish.

1022
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,440
And you know, Bishop's eye for that kind of the sense of the delightfully absurd.

1023
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:12,480
I mean, in the poem The Bite, I think you see a lot of that where the birds coming back

1024
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,320
with like a bligeing retriever.

1025
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:21,080
And it's just very comic, a comic sense of life.

1026
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:29,000
She didn't like appearing in public, and she didn't enjoy giving readings.

1027
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,280
And she made a number of recordings, and there are a number of recordings, not many,

1028
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:38,400
there are a number of recordings of her reading.

1029
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:45,640
And they're not very good, and they certainly don't capture the quality of the poem or her

1030
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,640
quality.

1031
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:53,800
You know, there was a PBS series called Voices and Visions some years ago, a few decades

1032
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,600
ago now.

1033
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:03,160
And the producers of the series actually got the actress Blive Danner to read her poems,

1034
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,600
because they couldn't stand the way Bishop read.

1035
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,040
I think it was a serious mistake.

1036
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:16,440
You wanted to hear Bishop's voice, and Blive Danner, I hope she's not here today, didn't

1037
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:19,560
hadn't really worked on the poems very much.

1038
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:28,240
But there is one recording, and it's on JD McClatchy's, there's a tape, I don't know

1039
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:32,560
if it's on, I don't even know if it's on a CD.

1040
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:39,120
But there's a tape of Bishop reading, and there's one reading, one poem that she reads,

1041
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:46,600
and it's a comic poem called Filling Station, where she herself actually chuckles at one

1042
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,280
of the jokes.

1043
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:55,880
And for me, it's the only recording of hers that actually sounds like the person I know,

1044
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:02,160
because she was so stiff as a reader, but her, just her little jiggle.

1045
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,640
Can I read Filling Station?

1046
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:13,120
This is a poem, there's a book called Questions of Travel, it's her third book, and it's divided

1047
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,820
into two parts.

1048
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:19,200
One part is called Brazil, and the second part is called Elsewhere.

1049
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:24,400
And the poem Filling Station is in the Elsewhere section, and I always assumed that it was

1050
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:29,920
the Filling Station across the street from her grandmother's house in Great Village.

1051
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,200
But in the letters to Anne Stevenson, she says it's in Brazil.

1052
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,720
It's on this deserted road in Brazil.

1053
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:42,280
I mean, I just discovered this myself.

1054
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:51,080
But I still think of it as Great Village, Filling Station, or yeah, right, Filling Station.

1055
01:20:51,080 --> 01:21:01,320
Oh, but it is dirty, this little Filling Station, oil soaked, oil permeated to a disturbing overall

1056
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,680
black translucency.

1057
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:07,120
Be careful with that match.

1058
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:13,720
Father wears a dirty oil soaked monkey suit that cuts him under the arms.

1059
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:19,600
And several quick and saucy and greasy sons assist him.

1060
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:25,720
This is a family filling station, all quite thoroughly dirty.

1061
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,720
Do they live in the station?

1062
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,160
It's a question.

1063
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,200
Do they live in the station?

1064
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:38,840
It has a cement porch behind the pumps, and on it a set of crushed and grease impregnated

1065
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:45,040
wicker work on the wicker sofa, a dirty dog.

1066
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,400
Quite comfy.

1067
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:52,480
Some comic books provide the only note of color, of certain color.

1068
01:21:52,480 --> 01:22:04,200
They lie upon a big dim doily, draping a tabaret, part of the set, behind a big her suit, begonia.

1069
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,240
I think that's where she giggles.

1070
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,120
Why the extraneous plant?

1071
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,360
Why the tabaret?

1072
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,800
Why a why the doily?

1073
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:25,200
Broidered in daisy stitch with margarit, I think, and heavy with gray crochet.

1074
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,520
Somebody embroidered the doily.

1075
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:34,520
Somebody waters the plant, or oils it maybe.

1076
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:47,040
It only arranges the rows of cans so that they softly say, so, so, so, to high strung

1077
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:50,000
automobiles.

1078
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,520
Somebody loves us all.

1079
01:22:54,520 --> 01:23:06,200
She told me that so, so, so was what you said to horses if you were in a buggy, and the

1080
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:11,800
horse gets upset that this is what you say to calm the horses down.

1081
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,640
So like when cars started coming into these country towns.

1082
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:17,640
Yeah.

1083
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:24,480
And that's what, so the SO, it's not just the joke on SO, but that is also this.

1084
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,480
That's great to know.

1085
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,480
That's awesome.

1086
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:30,440
You know, unfortunately we only have less than ten minutes, and I want to give people

1087
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:34,840
from the audience an opportunity to comment or ask questions.

1088
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:44,600
If anyone wants to say something, please come up to the microphone so we can get you on the

1089
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,600
recording.

1090
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:52,600
Thank you very much.

1091
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,480
Thank you.

1092
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:01,440
This was really wonderful, enlightening and informative.

1093
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:05,880
I knew her poetry and I didn't know anything really about her.

1094
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,520
I've had this book forever.

1095
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:13,600
And my name is Mero Malofsky, by the way.

1096
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:23,480
And one thing I would like to add to the commentary on the, or wonder actually why it wasn't mentioned

1097
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,600
was her social consciousness.

1098
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:34,520
Particularly her Brazil poems, which are, well like the pink dog, which is very powerful.

1099
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,480
But also, I'm not going to read it.

1100
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,040
I'm just going to read the titles, squatters, children.

1101
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:45,760
And most profoundly, the one that moves me the most, is the burglar of Babylon.

1102
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:53,280
And I'm thinking of her generation and the poets who were socially conscious, like Muriel

1103
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,800
Ruchizer.

1104
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:07,320
And our, every generation needs poets to comment and remind us and consolidate our awareness.

1105
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:12,880
And I'm going to do a tiny plug, which is I'm going to be doing, I'm not, you don't

1106
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,440
have to, you know, I'm not saying write this down.

1107
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:22,960
But I am going to be doing a presentation at NYU in June that's sponsored by Cleo Psyche.

1108
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,280
It's their conference and I'll be part of a panel on psychoanalysis and poetry.

1109
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:37,920
And I think it's very important for psychoanalysis to recognize what poetry actually means in

1110
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:43,520
a world, in an internet instant access world.

1111
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:51,000
And to remember that the poets always spoke for an entire culture.

1112
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,160
So thank you for this.

1113
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,160
Thank you.

1114
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:59,880
You know, there's something that I thought, this psychoanalytically oriented among us

1115
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:05,200
would be interested to hear.

1116
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,440
This is again from the early notebook.

1117
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:14,320
If I stretch my thought to Egypt, to India, downtown, it is in my thought I see them.

1118
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,000
And they are not at the time reality for me.

1119
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,720
If I go to these places, it's a different matter.

1120
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:26,640
History then is something like a huge circus tent, folding adjustable, which we carry around

1121
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,480
with us and set up wherever we are.

1122
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:33,840
It possesses the magical property of being able to take on the characteristics of whatever

1123
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,240
place we are in.

1124
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,920
In fact, it can become identical with it.

1125
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:42,320
That's an interesting circus tent, though.

1126
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:46,640
Hello, my name is Jane Simon and I want to thank the speakers.

1127
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:52,200
And I also wanted to ask if we know anything about her process from the notebooks.

1128
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,200
Did she write in the morning?

1129
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,200
Did she write at night?

1130
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,200
Did she write every day?

1131
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,480
I hear that she wrote a lot of letters.

1132
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:01,920
But you know, because she didn't write many poems that we know of.

1133
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:02,920
That's number one.

1134
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:06,640
And number two, McClatchy mentions that she was a chronic alcoholic.

1135
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:07,640
So I did that.

1136
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,360
Do you have any comments about that?

1137
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:13,120
Well, she wasn't an alcoholic.

1138
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,840
I don't think to the extent, say, that Barryman.

1139
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:21,360
You know, people didn't worry about her the way that, I mean, they worried about her

1140
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:28,520
in her personal life, but not to step up to the microphone and completely lose it.

1141
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:35,120
But yeah, I mean, particularly in her 40s and Key West, her friends were terrified.

1142
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,160
And she took anti-abuse in Brazil for that.

1143
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,160
Definitely.

1144
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,320
It was a huge part of her life.

1145
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:44,920
And I think it's in the poetry, definitely.

1146
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:48,520
In the process, I mean, there's certainly been references to her waiting for decades

1147
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,680
to get a word for a poem.

1148
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:50,680
It's not true.

1149
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:54,200
Where, you know, she had the idea for a poem and she sort of leave a space, I think.

1150
01:27:54,200 --> 01:28:04,200
You know, when, and Lull's poem about her talks about her, I wish I could quote it now,

1151
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:08,320
waiting decades for the perfect word.

1152
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,920
You make the casual perfect.

1153
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,920
Right.

1154
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:11,920
Right.

1155
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:12,920
There are manuscripts.

1156
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:17,720
You can look at, for instance, at Harvard, there's a poem called Crusoe at Home.

1157
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:24,400
You know, it's a draft of the later poem.

1158
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,280
There's many examples of her, but we're re-worth things for her.

1159
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:37,200
Crusoe in England, the moose, pink dog, among her masterpieces are poems that took her decades

1160
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,320
to complete.

1161
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:46,760
But maybe her most famous poem, One Art, the villain L, in this very complicated form,

1162
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,440
took her a week.

1163
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:55,360
And we have all the drafts which Alice has reprinted in Edgar Allan Poe and the Juke

1164
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,360
Box.

1165
01:28:56,360 --> 01:29:03,560
They are amazing because you see the first version is almost prose and it's all over

1166
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,120
the place.

1167
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:09,920
And she instantly figures out that it needs to be in a form.

1168
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,800
And she is desperate.

1169
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:18,840
This is a breakup of this relationship with Alice Meth vessel.

1170
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:26,600
And she is on the verge of suicide and maybe has even, even makes a, maybe half-hearted

1171
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,720
suicide attempt in the process.

1172
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:34,960
And that poem, working on that poem, I have an absolute conviction.

1173
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:41,960
It's kept her alive.

1174
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,880
This is One Art.

1175
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:49,200
Another side of a more comical, maybe side of her process as a young writer, and many

1176
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:55,800
young writers do this, we mentioned that Mary Ann Moore was very important to her.

1177
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:01,480
So not only did they meet and become friends, but they developed a mentor or a protege

1178
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,080
relationship and she would send things to Mary Ann Moore.

1179
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:10,040
And Mary Ann Moore would kindly retype them with lots of changes.

1180
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:14,280
And so at a certain point Bishop decided to back off from that particular side of the

1181
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,480
writing process of showing Mary Ann Moore everything that she wrote.

1182
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:27,000
Well there's a notorious story where Bishop wrote maybe the most ambitious of her early

1183
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,520
poems called Roosters.

1184
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:31,000
It's in her first book.

1185
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
A War Pong.

1186
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,520
A War Pong, yeah.

1187
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,320
And she sent it to Mary Ann Moore.

1188
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:41,240
And it has those triple rhymes as like pink dog.

1189
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:45,640
And she's doing something rather daring, almost writing a kind of nursery rhyme, but

1190
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:49,120
it's a very serious and very ambitious poem.

1191
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:57,040
And Mary Ann Moore really didn't get what she was doing and didn't like the triple rhymes

1192
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:02,840
and also wanted her to change the title to the cock.

1193
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:03,840
Right.

1194
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,440
Not a good idea.

1195
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,440
Not a good idea.

1196
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,760
And Bishop, let me just hold up for a second.

1197
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:14,800
I know that a couple of our participants had to like catch buses and things at 3.30.

1198
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:15,800
You're okay?

1199
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:16,800
Okay.

1200
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,800
So we can go a little bit longer.

1201
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,800
Okay.

1202
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,800
We'll let people have their chance.

1203
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:20,800
Thanks.

1204
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:21,800
Okay.

1205
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:27,080
We had an opportunity to look at and listen to the PBS special, which is for anybody's

1206
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:29,440
information online marvelous.

1207
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,440
Is it?

1208
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,360
Oh, I can get it online.

1209
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,360
Full hour.

1210
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,360
No interruption.

1211
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,360
All right.

1212
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:42,240
So I learned a lot last night preparing to be an audience member and listening.

1213
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:46,080
I wanted to know a little bit more about the character of Friday.

1214
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:50,240
Apparently it was a real person because at one point they made reference to the fact

1215
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:56,880
that she bemoaned the fact that he had passed away of the measles.

1216
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,440
So what do we know about this Friday person?

1217
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:08,080
Well, I've always taken that to be a kind of, again, she's doing the Robinson Crusoe

1218
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:13,360
story and Friday of course is the character in Robinson Crusoe.

1219
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:21,280
I think it's her veiled reference to Lotta de Maseto Sowaris.

1220
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:29,080
That is, this was the, in her loneliness, this is the person who comes and rescues her.

1221
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,080
Is that the woman?

1222
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,080
Yes.

1223
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,080
Yes.

1224
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,080
Yes.

1225
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:38,960
And I mean, you know, in Crusoe in England, Crusoe is a man, Friday is a man.

1226
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:45,520
They talk about if only they could have had children.

1227
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:53,960
You know, it's not exactly an allegory of one to one, but I think that's sort of, in

1228
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:59,720
my mind, that's sort of where Friday comes in and that it's really, and the poem ends

1229
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:05,600
with the death of Friday and it's so heartbreaking because I think that's who she's thinking of.

1230
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:10,600
And Lotta probably committed suicide.

1231
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:18,660
I just want to push back just a little though because I tend to, I think many poems come

1232
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:24,480
from personal experience, but I worry when we reduce poems to autobiography.

1233
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:30,400
I mean, the Crusoe story is one of the great archetypal stories of Western culture and

1234
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,240
all of that is important.

1235
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:35,360
And Friday represents the native.

1236
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,960
He represents the other world, the third world as it was called then.

1237
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:47,240
And he represents a relationship to the landscape and to the place that Crusoe doesn't have.

1238
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,720
And that's universal.

1239
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:57,000
And so I worry when we always want to bring fiction back to fact, that we miss really one

1240
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,160
of the great goals of poetry is to share this.

1241
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,160
Yeah.

1242
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:05,120
So it's not to contradict anything that's been said, but just to open it.

1243
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:08,120
But I think that's probably where it comes from.

1244
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:13,320
But that we have to see it as, we have to see the story as the...

1245
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,720
It's all those things I think.

1246
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,880
I think it makes sense for me to think of her.

1247
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:22,680
And it's just like in the moose, I think there's an autobiographical element when she overhears

1248
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:28,160
the conversation about the grandparents and eternity and about someone who's a drinker.

1249
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:31,080
That's her way of bringing in that story.

1250
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,080
She's overhearing it.

1251
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:36,200
And that's a wonderful way of bringing in the drinking, I think, because I didn't want

1252
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:39,360
to understate the importance of that in her life.

1253
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:44,400
It was a big project of lotas to help her combat that problem.

1254
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:48,000
She was a very cheap drunk.

1255
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,320
So did you take her much to get drunk?

1256
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,320
Right.

1257
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,320
Yeah.

1258
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,320
So she could...

1259
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,040
And she knew this.

1260
01:34:55,040 --> 01:35:01,680
But so if she had a drink, it wasn't going to stop there because she would immediately

1261
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:06,360
get drunk and then she would keep drinking and she would go on binges.

1262
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:15,680
But in a way, the question about whether she was an alcoholic becomes more complicated

1263
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:18,880
because she wasn't always drunk.

1264
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,880
And there were just...

1265
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:26,880
There were long periods while she was on anti-buse for a while, from time to time.

1266
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:30,680
But there were also periods when she just wasn't drinking.

1267
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:33,920
And where she was completely lucid and writing poems.

1268
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:38,880
And maybe she would have written more poems if she didn't have these binges.

1269
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:42,040
And it was a drinking generation.

1270
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:45,040
Children writers.

1271
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,040
All drink.

1272
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,040
Yes.

1273
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:55,160
How do you think she might have interacted or fared in world like ours today with Facebook

1274
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:58,320
and talk shows and self-exposure?

1275
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:05,800
Do you think... and do you think that there could be an Elizabeth Bishop who fully interacts

1276
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,720
electronically today?

1277
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,040
Oh, I hope.

1278
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,480
You know, I hope so.

1279
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:12,480
But I don't think she...

1280
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:17,040
I can't imagine Elizabeth on Facebook.

1281
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:22,480
She famously said closets, closets and more closets.

1282
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,480
Right.

1283
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:24,480
Yeah.

1284
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:31,280
But even just the disappearance of... or the erosion of the idea of territoriality and

1285
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,920
regionality because the internet is connecting everybody.

1286
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:34,920
How do you think she might?

1287
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:35,920
Yeah.

1288
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:41,840
That's what I was going to say is I have a poet friend who's wheels on the whole thing,

1289
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,480
electronically.

1290
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:47,120
And I said, I don't really do much of it.

1291
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:52,280
And she said, but Jean, you can talk to a poet anywhere in the world.

1292
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,920
And you can read their poems.

1293
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,320
Anywhere on our little globe.

1294
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:05,200
That must have fascinated the ship if she had gotten that good.

1295
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:08,040
And they could have read her.

1296
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:16,360
Well, now people in Ireland, you can't graduate from high school without learning ten poems

1297
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:17,360
of Elizabeth Bishop.

1298
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:22,360
I mean, out of a hundred, I think.

1299
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:27,400
In the realm of photography and documentary, I've sometimes had to talk to students.

1300
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:35,120
And when I wanted to point out an artist who was to talk about the issue of sentimentality,

1301
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:37,080
I send them to Helen Levitt.

1302
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:40,160
And it occurred to me today, if you know Helen Levitt's work, that there's something very

1303
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:48,240
akin to Bishop in the sense that they're artists who are resolutely unsentimental, I think,

1304
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:51,320
occasionally fierce, but never mean.

1305
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:55,640
There's always this love of the world.

1306
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:58,560
So it occurred to me this connection.

1307
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:06,080
There's one of her wonderful, unpublished poems.

1308
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:10,120
Is her poem about Buster Keaton, called Keaton.

1309
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:18,200
Which is, and it just absolutely figures that Keaton, of all the scream comedians or the

1310
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:24,040
silent comedians, would be the one who was most attractive to Bishop.

1311
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:28,280
And the last line of that poem is, I am not sentimental.

1312
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:34,680
And it starts out, I think, I will be good.

1313
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:37,880
And what Helen Levitt loves is ordinary people.

1314
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:41,640
Just people on the street and animals and children.

1315
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:43,000
And children especially.

1316
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
And they would be a mask on.

1317
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,280
If you want to know about the world, look at children and watch them interacting on the

1318
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:49,440
street.

1319
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,440
She certainly had that.

1320
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:52,400
I think it's a great combination.

1321
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:53,720
She would have loved that.

1322
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:58,200
I always think of Walker Evans when I think of Filling Station, though.

1323
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,680
It's like a Walker Evans photograph.

1324
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:01,960
Only the tone is a little different.

1325
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:02,960
Right.

1326
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:06,120
All right, but we've gone over about almost 15 minutes.

1327
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,560
Well, thank you.

1328
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:18,400
Thank you.

1329
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,320
To thank this wonderful, wonderful group, I think Elizabeth Bishop is talking appreciation

1330
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,320
to you.

1331
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:41,320
Thank you.
