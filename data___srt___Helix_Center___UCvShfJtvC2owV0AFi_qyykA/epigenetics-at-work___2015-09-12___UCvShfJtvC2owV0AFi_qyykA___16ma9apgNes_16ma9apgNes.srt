6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,320
more, if you could silence your cell phones, that would be helpful in terms of the electronics

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,920
in here for our recording.

department of epigenetics and molecular carcinogenesis at the University of Texas MD Anderson Center.

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,240
Okay, now we'll start.

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,240
I'm going to start to ask you what these are epigenetics.

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,240
I think there are a lot of epigenetics actually.

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,880
So in my opinion, epigenetics have two major properties.

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:43,600
One is particle phenomena that is independent of DNA sequence.

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,600
And the second one I think is being practical through the cell type of genetics.

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:03:06,400
Gen2 is a good one.

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,120
What's interesting about definitions of that term is how you define it is really much shaped

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,760
by the training that you've had or the field that you've come from.

38
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:23,120
In my lab, we have a lot of discussions about this particular phenomenon.

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,760
So if you're coming from the field of genetics, then epigenetics typically will be something

40
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,600
that needs to be heritable because that's what genetics is really, the science of genetics

41
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,720
is dealing with.

42
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:43,600
If you are coming from a field that's looking more at molecular biology and gene regulation,

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:51,600
then heritability is not necessary for your inclusion in the definition of epigenetics,

44
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,440
really about processes that regulate gene activity without modifying the underlying gene sequence.

45
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:07,200
But I'd say there's still debates, the funding agencies define it for us, which is a good

46
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,000
definition to use because that will define who gets money on epigenetics.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,840
And they use a fairly broad definition that does not require that the demonstration that

48
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,840
is heritable, in fact there's very few actual demonstrations of heritability of an epigenetic

49
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
mark.

50
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,160
So it's best that they probably deviate from constraining our definition.

51
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:36,640
And to make it even more confusing, there's an intermediate definition, which is the inheritance

52
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:45,920
of information, independent of DNA information from cell to the daughter cell when a cell

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,600
divides.

54
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,440
So that happens throughout our body all the time, which is different from passing on the

55
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,480
information to your daughters or your offspring.

56
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,800
Yeah, I think that's one of the common misconceptions when we talk about when we go on to Wikipedia

57
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,640
and we read what is epigenetics and we see that these chemical modifications that are

58
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,760
heritable, what that means is indeed, just to reiterate that point, it's passed from

59
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,000
cell to cell.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But what we really don't know and what has fascinating implications are, what does this

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,280
mean for our kids, in the past we had thought that whatever we did didn't matter because

62
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,760
it was all just our genetic code, our DNA, the blueprint of the machines of the cells.

63
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,680
So this blueprint, the DNA is the same in every cell of the body.

64
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,720
And this gets passed to our kids and it's fairly robust.

65
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,760
So it doesn't matter if we smoke or if we drink or what we do.

66
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:53,520
But now epigenetics comes along and it throws this twist in that, hey, what if what I'm

67
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,960
doing can be passed to my children and all of a sudden the game has changed.

68
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,800
And that's what I think makes this other inheritance, this transgenerational epigenetic inheritance

69
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,960
fascinating.

70
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,080
And it's definitely something worth a lot of discussion and it's also controversial.

71
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,360
I think that there's two sides to the issue so maybe we should find out what side everyone's

72
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
on.

73
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
I agree.

74
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,120
I think that's why I think epigenetics can have profound impact on ourselves because

75
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:34,440
that means what we do and what we experience could have effect on ourselves and also our

76
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
children's.

77
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:43,160
Although this evidence to show that epigenetic code can be passed transmitted through cell

78
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,880
cycle to cell cycle.

79
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,400
But at least in mammals whether this epigenetic information can be inherited to the next generation

80
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,960
to the grandchildren, I think it's still limited to the evidence.

81
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,200
Maybe you can do more.

82
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:06,720
I would say so, I mean I think there's phenomenological suggestion that something of that nature is

83
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,520
going on.

84
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,840
But it's a challenging question.

85
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
It's not that people aren't asking the question.

86
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,880
People are asking the question, it's a really methodologically challenging thing to do.

87
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,120
So much remodeling is going on when the sperm and egg come together.

88
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,880
That it's really hard to look at the time course at which these molecular changes are

89
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:36,120
going on and seeing what is actually, are the epigenetic baggage that these cells are

90
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
bringing with them?

91
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,360
Is it being removed and replaced?

92
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
What is going on?

93
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
That's really challenging.

94
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:52,040
But certainly in the behavioral models, especially when it comes to paternal effects, there's

95
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,480
fairly strong suggestion that at least something is going through the germ cells.

96
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,640
For example, we do a lot of experiments.

97
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,840
Again, most of the evidence is coming from laboratory animals.

98
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,600
We can certainly see patterns in long-lived species, but it's very hard to look at trench

99
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,760
generational inheritance in a mechanistic way in humans.

100
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:22,600
But if you take cell sperm from a male that has had some sort of life exposure, variation

101
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:29,080
in nutrition or stress, and you take that cell and you fertilize an egg and you implant

102
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,760
that egg into another female, you can see effects predicted by the male's experience

103
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,840
in the subsequent offspring.

104
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,960
So that does suggest that something is going through the sperm.

105
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,080
Although there could be other processes at play and there could be other things going

106
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:54,040
on, the sperm is a cell and it carries other things besides DNA and epigenetic modifications.

107
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,680
So we don't know what it is, but something is going through.

108
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,200
And I think that is actually a very big change to the way in which we've thought about the

109
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,280
process of inheritance in general.

110
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,880
So it is not a wipe away everything.

111
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,760
Here's your new genome, work with it, and start anew.

112
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,960
Normally there's probably a lot that is already in place and preformed.

113
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:24,520
And I think the genomic imprinting literature has really helped to create some basis for

114
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,600
the suggestion that this inheritance is going on.

115
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,960
So we know that there are genes that in a sense carry a molecular memory of which parent

116
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
they came from.

117
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,880
They're either silenced or active depending on whether you inherited that section of your

118
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,840
genome from your mother or father.

119
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,880
So that suggests that something in your own genome has been influenced by the parents

120
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,440
that you got it from.

121
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,760
But then it's the question of whether we can extrapolate this to non-imprinted genes and

122
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,560
environmentally induced phenomenon, but I think it's still questionable.

123
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,520
So I have a question about genomic imprinting.

124
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:10,520
But doesn't that get reestablished when you still have chemicals and molecules around

125
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,600
the other than the DNA from the mother and the father from the egg cell and the sperm.

126
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,960
So there is a ratio and re-establishment.

127
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Right.

128
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
In the germline it's all re-arrased.

129
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Yes.

130
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
But when it's re-established.

131
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Yes.

132
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,480
I thought you still had some of the environment.

133
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,680
You still have maternal factors that are probably driving the imprinting process in general.

134
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
Right.

135
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,200
There is something that is driving it from the mothers.

136
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,720
And that's why studying maternal transmission through the germline is avoided quite actively

137
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,320
because we can't remove the environment from the germline in that case.

138
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,240
Whereas we suspect that to be more the case with fathers.

139
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,400
Though, you know, father, sperm can influence the maternal environment and so on.

140
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,800
So there's a lot of unique processes.

141
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:13,400
Yeah, there's evidence like in 1944 there's a Dutch family, you know, a very famous example

142
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:21,520
that the starvation through the grandparents can affect the grandchildren.

143
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:28,160
So these evidence, I think there's some evidence, the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.

144
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,200
But still I think the molecular mechanism for me is still unclear.

145
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:43,840
During germline stage and also fertilization, they can have drastic epigenetic reprogramming

146
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,040
that tend to erase, you know, that the previous epigenetic marks.

147
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:56,320
And how these epigenetic information can be inherently through, I think for me it's still

148
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,280
a challenge to understand.

149
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,480
But I thought the effects of a Dutch famine only persisted.

150
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
A few generations.

151
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
A few generations.

152
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:12,600
And it's complicated, especially with women because women carry inside them the cells that

154
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,360
are going to produce are offspring.

155
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,880
You know, they're developed.

156
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,520
Even, let's say I was pregnant and I had a female baby in me.

157
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:29,680
That baby already has inside it produced the cells that are going to be that baby's babies.

158
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:37,560
So if my diet, my nutrition is really poor, I'm not only affecting me and the epigenetic

159
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,840
marks on my genome, but also on my baby and my baby's baby.

160
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:50,000
So this is why the great grandchildren is really important that an effect be seen in

161
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,320
the great grandchildren of a female in order for it to be really transgenerational inheritance.

162
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Absolutely.

163
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:06,520
But I mean, it's still completely valid that what we do in the way we eat, where we smoke

164
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,120
our lifestyle, there's clear evidence from studies from Francis and other people that

165
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:21,880
that affects the health of your offspring in severe ways, like likelihood of having obesity,

166
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:29,080
diabetes, short lifespan, major effects due to our own diet.

167
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,600
Absolutely.

168
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,800
And those effects, you know, in some sense, it doesn't matter if it's going through the

169
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,240
germline or going through some other factor.

170
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,720
It means that the lifestyle or life exposures of one generation can absolutely have an

171
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,400
effect in subsequent generations, grand to grand offspring, even great grand offspring.

172
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:56,520
And so I think that realization is probably very important from a policy standpoint.

173
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:02,720
And it doesn't, you know, you can separate that from the controversy over whether there

174
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:10,040
is a mark that is being retained even when there's no exposure to poor nutrition or stress.

175
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Indeed.

176
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Yeah, we've been studying genetics for a long time, well over 30 years.

177
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
And why?

178
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,720
Why have we been studying genetics?

179
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,040
Because family studies and twin studies have said that diseases are heritable.

180
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,200
What does that mean?

181
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:30,760
You know, what we do is we compare genetically identical individuals, monozygotic twins,

182
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:37,160
to fraternal twins or dizygotic twins, twins that have differing amounts of polymorphisms

183
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,480
or, you know, sometimes called mutations in the DNA.

184
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,000
And we see that, hey, the dizygotic twins, the fraternal twins are more dissimilar than

185
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,680
the monozygotic twins for various traits.

186
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,040
We can measure how much does one twin gets schizophrenia versus the other.

187
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
We call this twin discordance.

188
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,400
And it makes a nice example for heritability.

189
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,480
So if we see that more of a particular disease starts to happen with dizygotic twins, we

190
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,520
say, well, we know that their genomes are different, so it must be genetic factors.

191
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:13,240
But when it comes to, well, one of the problems is that we've been looking for 30 years and

192
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,360
finding these factors hasn't happened.

193
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
It hasn't really happened.

194
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,960
And, you know, so now, you know, the genetics community is, you know, pouring millions and

195
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,920
millions and millions and millions of dollars into this.

196
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,480
And we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, well, not, damn it, maybe about 100,000 individuals

197
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,240
in these giant genome-wide studies.

198
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,360
And we're starting to find some very small, significant effects.

199
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,560
So but not enough, not enough to account for schizophrenia, depression.

200
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,560
And so it begs the question, well, what else is there?

201
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,000
And this is where epigenetics comes in.

202
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,840
And so to tie back to what we're talking about, okay, so mom's, you know, state of mind when

203
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,080
she's pregnant, can affect the baby.

204
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
And how does this happen?

205
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,720
Well, it turns out, and this is sort of a new area, and a number of publications have

206
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,280
been coming out in the last couple years, really.

207
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,920
It's really in its infancy.

208
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:12,080
But if mom is anxious, this actually correlates with epigenetic changes in key regions of

209
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,560
our stress response genes, but not ours, in babies, babies stress response genes, as

210
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,280
well as a number of sort of early measures like, you know, baby's cortisol response,

211
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,720
or this methylation mark, this epigenetic mark, and these genes.

212
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,320
And so it's a really compelling argument that, hey, maybe the reason we're seeing heritability,

213
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,960
maybe the reason where we're seeing these traits inherited is because, let's say, mom

214
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,800
is depressed, and then she becomes pregnant, and then this is going to affect the baby's

215
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:51,320
stress response, or stress axis, the HPA axis, and this is a major risk factor for subsequent

216
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,840
psychiatric comorbidities.

217
00:16:52,840 --> 00:17:00,200
And so we're really passing a trait not necessarily through the sperm and through the egg, although

218
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,720
it's a possibility, a controversial possibility, but what is not as controversial as this

219
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,680
idea that it is being passed through what we call a generational epigenetic effect, as

220
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,160
opposed to transgenerational epigenetic inheritance?

221
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,600
And I think, you know, that's something that makes the study of epigenetics very compelling.

222
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,280
I also did read an interesting study.

223
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,360
So why do you call it epigenetic effect?

224
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
I'm not understanding.

225
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,600
If it doesn't have to do with modifications, then why is it epigenetic?

226
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,400
Well, so I think it's called an epigenetic effect.

227
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:45,480
So I think Emma Whitelaw, who was one of the first labs to find one of these famous inherited

228
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:52,160
epigenetic phenotypes in this mouse strain, the agouti mouse, it's a classical mouse example

229
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,680
where an epigenetic difference, a DNA methylation difference, sometimes I'll say epigenetic,

230
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,320
sometimes DNA methylation, DNA methylation can compact a DNA, it acts like a light switch,

231
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,080
and it turned off this gene that caused the mouse coat color to change.

232
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,800
And what's really interesting about this example, and I'm digressing for a minute, but I'll

233
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,520
get back to it, is that this effect was passed on to the offspring.

234
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,400
You could also drive the effect with different nutritional factors when the mother was pregnant,

235
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
which was interesting.

236
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:34,280
But anyway, Emma Whitelaw was saying she needs a terminology to distinguish between these

237
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,800
passed on traits that go through the germline, which she was saying is transgenerational

238
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,360
epigenetic inheritance, versus those that are passed, for example, through stresses

239
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:50,600
to a mom when she's pregnant, or possibly behavioral changes that a mother may confer

240
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:57,160
or bother a stressful environment when a child is in a critical stage like when their baby

241
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:03,640
through things like maternal neglect, possibly postpartum depression, abuse, these sorts

242
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,800
of things.

243
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:11,400
So I think it's really just a terminology to try to distinguish those two.

244
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,160
But it's actually very interesting because you mentioned, Emma Whitelaw has very strong

245
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,040
opinions on the use of the term inheritance.

246
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,480
So with very constrained views on when it should be used.

247
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,200
And you outline exactly why she's done that.

248
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,480
But we have a much looser use of the term.

249
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,520
You can inherit money, and you don't have to be biologically related to the individual.

250
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:39,200
But you know, and so rather than thinking of, you know, transmission, which could entail

251
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:47,000
any mechanism, inheritance is really much about this kind of biological material around

252
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
the DNA being transmitted.

253
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,760
In a way, I had understood it.

254
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,160
Maybe my understanding is already 15 years old was that epigenetic had to do with what

255
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,080
you said, DNA methylation.

256
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:06,400
So that's why if there is a DNA, something on the side of the DNA that is methylated,

257
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,440
isn't that what epigenetic transfer means that goes there for?

258
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
Yeah.

259
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,440
So the modifications, either DNA modifications or some histone proteins, which are associated

260
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:26,200
with DNA, so these modifications can change the structure of the counting, the DNA structures.

261
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,840
So through that, it can affect the gene expression.

262
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,240
They even turn down the gene or turn off the genes.

263
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,240
So that's through the...

264
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,680
Well, isn't that inheritance?

265
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:43,280
It depends if you're going through the germ line and through meiosis, or whether you're

266
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,600
just going through cell division and mitosis.

267
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,400
That is not really inheritance, but it's still epigenetic if you're going through mitosis.

268
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:59,120
Or if the environment in utero is affecting the growing baby, that is not inheritance

269
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,640
because it's going through the cell cycle as well.

270
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,400
So epigenetics is a broad word.

271
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,320
So I'll go back a little bit.

272
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,400
Why nature need epigenetics?

273
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,960
So the genetics based on the DNA sequence, you change on the DNA, but epigenetics based

274
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:27,040
on the modification of the proteins, histones, like a DNA modification.

275
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,520
So why they need this system?

276
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:39,000
One thing, I think your change DNA is difficult, it's a long term, but epigenetics code is

277
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,560
more diverse and flexible and also reversible.

278
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,560
And I think that both way the biological organisms response to environment, they take either

279
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,080
genetics and the epigenetics pathways.

280
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:02,320
I mean, have these advantages to response quickly and this phenomenon can be reversed also.

281
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,080
There's an example I like to use for that.

282
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,960
Why would maternal stress be good ultimately?

283
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,760
Let's say we're a caveman and there's all sorts of dinosaurs around, right?

284
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,000
That's accurate, right?

285
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,760
And it's a very dangerous environment.

286
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,680
Well, what do our genes want?

287
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,800
Our genes want us to survive long enough to reproduce.

288
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,480
Okay, they don't care if you live forever and ultimately get depression.

289
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,240
They just want you to live into your 20s or maybe earlier in caveman times and reproduce.

290
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,840
And so if it's a very dangerous time, you want your offspring to be jumpy.

291
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,760
And so if mom is jumpy and you're having a baby and the baby is not going to go down

292
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:52,040
to the water hole and just start being lax a day school, you want them to respond to twigs

293
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,400
and so they stay alive.

294
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,480
And this makes a lot of sense.

295
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,240
That is exactly how epigenetics can help us.

296
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:04,720
But of course in a society like ours where we're obviously not necessarily adapted in

297
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,520
the same way, we may see some deleterious consequences of that.

298
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,840
I did want to return to one aspect and we were talking about what is epigenetics and molecular

299
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
marks.

300
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,560
I did and I admit to not reading in detail, but this is sort of a bullet point from a review

301
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:26,080
paper I was reading talking about what are some of those possible molecular marks that

302
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,960
could cause an epigenetic effect or an epigenetic phenomenon to be inherited.

303
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:40,320
And what's really interesting was when they took microRNA from sperm of fathers that were

304
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,600
exposed to stress and injected the microRNA into the fertilized oocyte, they were able

305
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,920
to create the same behavioral effect in the offspring.

306
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:59,000
And there's epigeneticists who will say, oh, microRNA is or is not epigenetic.

307
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,360
But I think the key is that it's not necessarily just written on the DNA.

308
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,560
It's supposed to be a DNA sequence independent effect.

309
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:17,040
So are we going to cut microRNA some slack and allow it to confer inheritance if the

310
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,880
evidence goes that way?

311
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Then maybe.

312
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:26,680
But I throw it out there as something interesting I read as a possible mechanism through which

313
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,720
we might confer inheritance.

314
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,560
And this is of course important because the typical ones and something that we haven't

315
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,280
really stressed is that they get erased.

316
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,320
And that's why we think that's why it's controversial.

317
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Because when sperm are developing and the eggs are developing, meiosis, and when we have

318
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,160
fertilization, we have these massive erasures of our DNA methylation and our histone marks.

319
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,520
And so the simple answer is that, oh, that takes care of everything.

320
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,520
Well, then why are we seeing traits passed on in this way?

321
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,720
And so I think it's important to point out that that's one of the reasons it's controversial.

322
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,240
Yeah, absolutely, but the RNA, the small RNAs that that's talking about, there's evidence

323
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,440
that the RNAs direct DNA methylation.

324
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,160
So there's RNA dependent DNA methylation.

325
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:24,120
So the RNAs, if they're inherited, they could help reestablish the methylation patterns,

326
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,720
which then themselves affect the chromatin structure, which affects gene expression.

327
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
I agree.

328
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:38,040
So evidence in fishing yeast, in selgens, even plant, is this small RNA, a play very important

329
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
role.

330
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:45,000
So they can inherit it to next generations, then guide it to the DNA methylations, his

331
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,560
modifications to ensure the inheritance of the same epigenetic information.

332
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Yeah.

333
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:59,480
What's interesting about the erasure assumption is that it is based on studies that were conducted

334
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,120
quite a long time ago.

335
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,600
So it's become a dogma in the field that there's complete erasure.

336
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,720
And certainly there's no doubt that there is genome-wide reprogramming.

337
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:19,360
But I'm curious now with the tools that we have available to us, where we can look more

338
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,920
than just at a gross level of whether DNA methylation levels dive down, but actually

339
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:33,720
look at a single base resolution to see whether, in fact, even if 1% of the DNA methylation

340
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,480
was retained, that'd be quite a lot of DNA methylation still retained in the genome.

341
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,800
But it would seem like most, if 99% of it's gone, it seems like it's been completely erased.

342
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,480
But I think that's something that we need to really explore in more detail.

343
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
And you're right.

344
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:58,120
And there was two recent studies done in mice primordial germ cells, which did exactly

345
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
that.

346
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:06,000
They did detailed DNA sequencing, a DNA methylation sequencing across the whole genome.

347
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,600
And they actually found there was about 4,000 loci that did not lose the DNA methylation.

348
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,320
And most of these loci were transposable elements.

349
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,840
So actually, most of the human genome is made up of transposable elements that are usually

350
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,720
kept silent all the time.

351
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,240
And there's a few of them that are not silent, and they can still move around the genome.

352
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,800
And when these are pieces of DNA, when they move around the genome, they're actually introducing

353
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,240
mutations into the genome.

354
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,640
And amazingly enough, where the methylation was retained was on these transposable elements.

355
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,280
So there seems to be some mechanism that we have no idea yet how it works at the molecular

356
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:00,400
level, whether they're being protected from this global erasure of the methylation marks.

357
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,160
So that would be really exciting to figure out that mechanism.

358
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:11,240
And there were some early studies as well doing cross-species pro-nuclei transfers, so taking

359
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,000
nuclei, putting it in another oocyte of a different species.

360
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And depending on the oocyte context, you get less or more erasure.

361
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,400
So there's probably a lot of oocyte factors that are directing the degree of erasure of

362
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,560
these imprints.

363
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,560
And so that's a really interesting source of individual variation and whether these marks

364
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
actually persist.

365
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:38,560
And it could well be these small RNAs because transposable elements generate pi RNAs.

366
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Right?

367
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,080
Right, I think so.

368
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:47,320
Yeah, this cluster of, you know, I've been read about them for a year or two, but yes,

369
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,120
something that they're basically designed to silence these elements.

370
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Indeed.

371
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
Sorry.

372
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,680
Yeah, I've also heard about that during the Golden Conference.

373
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,320
You know, in the sperm, keystone usually replaced by protonium.

374
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
That's right.

375
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,120
But now you realize that at least some are still there, like 5%, and some even still

376
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,320
maintained the keystone marks for the previous generations.

377
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,120
So that also, as you said, could play a role in the generational inheritance.

378
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah, and so it was interesting.

379
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,240
So one of the studies that focused on histones and their role in transmission looked at cocaine

380
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:31,640
exposure in males, and their findings were exclusively in histones where you see this

381
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,600
retention as you say.

382
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,120
Although I wonder whether it's being retained or reapplied.

383
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,280
I mean, that's, I guess the question is that there's a lot of area that we don't know

384
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,440
from when we go from one generation to the next, but what exactly is going on?

385
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,640
But certainly if you look at multiple generations, you'll see the mark.

386
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,200
It's whether it's staying there or whether it's just being reapplied.

387
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
That's the question.

388
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Yeah.

389
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:03,000
So I read one study where various histone variants had been tagged, and they did show

390
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,760
that they were retained at least up to the first cell division after fertilization.

391
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:15,840
But I think it is a compelling, you know, source of possibility that histone variants

392
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,240
that are retained and not replaced by protomines could confer some information.

393
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,320
It's important to keep in mind that the 10 to 17% that people have detected is enough

394
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,640
to account for the entire coding genome.

395
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,720
So I mean, there's enough information in there in theory.

396
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,880
But it's also important to keep in mind, why don't we have these answers yet?

397
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,200
And it's hard to study this because, you know, it's sort of like the wave particle

398
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,280
duality in quantum physics.

399
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,920
Once you look at that, once you take that sperm and egg that was going to become that

400
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
mouse.

401
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,440
You no longer get to test the mouse later on because you've looked at the sperm and

402
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
egg level.

403
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,480
So then, you know, it's really hard to look at the exact cells that are going to eventually

404
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
develop.

405
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
And I think that's one of the challenges.

406
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,640
So we're faced with these averages.

407
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:11,600
We have to take 10,000 sperm or a million and sort of infer what's happening.

408
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:18,080
And the only way to get experimentally at this process involves embryo transfer and

409
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,800
vitro fertilization, which are all very artificial in their process and how that

410
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,440
epigenetic effects in it of themselves.

411
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,720
So this is one of the issues that we come across when we do these studies in the lab.

412
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,840
We can show it through embryo transfer.

413
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,200
But you've done something that's completely unrelated to the natural process of reproduction

414
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,720
and whether it's relevant.

415
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:50,760
I think that you can kind of expand that kind of concern to, okay, perhaps we would be able

416
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:57,000
to show epigenetic inheritance in the lab in species that are short-lived.

417
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,520
But would it be relevant on a wide-scale process, you know, in society, in natural environments

418
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,160
where you have long-lived species that need to adapt to changing environments all the

419
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
time.

420
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,600
So when people start talking about epigenetic inheritance in response to the quality of

421
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,360
the social environment, I thought, well, why would you want your social environment to

422
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,640
be inherited through your germline?

423
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,960
That seems nonsensical in terms of adaptation.

424
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,400
You should respond to the social environment which you're in and adapt accordingly because

425
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,160
that's the best predictor of the world that you live in.

426
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:40,960
But I still think it's possible, but I think we need to think about whether these would

427
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,080
actually play out in the real world.

428
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,560
When you say social environment, I mean, I'm a molecular biologist.

429
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,640
What do you mean exactly?

430
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:56,320
Anything from the quality of mother-infant interactions to peer interactions to, you

431
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,360
know, adults' social interactions, so whether you're socially isolated or interacting with

432
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
groups.

433
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,200
The problem, I guess, is that you can never separate social interactions from stress reactivity.

434
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,520
And so stress may be transducing the information.

435
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,960
Certainly we think in the case of mother-infant interactions, it's not that, let's say, that

436
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,440
the pure sociality of it, but rather the physical aspects of mother-infant interactions that

437
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,480
are transducing the epigenetic marks.

438
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,000
So are you saying that social interactions of a mother can affect the social interactions

439
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
of the offspring?

440
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,240
Well, they certainly can, yes.

441
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,640
Well, I know the nurturing studies, but older, because then how do you separate nurture from

442
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,400
nature?

443
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,720
In what, be more specific?

444
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,240
So what's the nature element of it?

445
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,640
Like you're around a mother who never interacts with anyone.

446
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Oh, right.

447
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,080
So in, I work in rodents, right?

448
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,920
So we have control over nature.

449
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,360
Everyone's got the same genome.

450
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
But yes.

451
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,040
So the issue, and I think this is really important in the context of these discussions, is that

452
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,880
in humans you have genetic variation.

453
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,200
And you have a lot of what can be called many things, but niche selection.

454
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:22,320
So people find themselves in environments because of biological drives that may be driven by

455
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,040
DNA sequence.

456
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,000
So it is almost impossible to separate out these questions.

457
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,400
There's some really interesting work now in humans, now that artificial reproductive

458
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:39,120
technology is so widespread in its use to look at egg donors and embryo transfer and

459
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,240
all, you know, where mothers are caring offspring that are not genetically related to them and

460
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,600
all these various combinations.

461
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:53,160
And it does suggest that there are some later life characteristics, psychiatric illnesses

462
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:58,520
that are driven by, you know, matches or mismatches between the genetic characteristics of the

463
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,960
mother and genetic characteristics of the offspring or something about the in utero environment.

464
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:13,160
A lot of the studies now that are focused on human analyses of epigenetics really are

465
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,920
highlighting that you need to look at both the genetic variation and epigenetic variation

466
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
together.

467
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,080
So they're not separate entities.

468
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,360
Only in the lab we treat them like that, but we're working with organisms that don't have

469
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,600
genetic variability.

470
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,120
But there are gene environment interactions at the level of epigenetic changes is, you

471
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
know, widespread.

472
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:39,640
And I think you can't, you probably won't be able to predict very well later life phenotypes

473
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,920
solely based on epigenetic variation in humans.

474
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,480
You'll need to know the code.

475
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,880
Also, I think how's the epigenetics implication to evolution?

476
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,120
So this landmark theory, what do you have the idea?

477
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
You know, it's interesting.

478
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:08,360
So, you know, in some ways I don't have any strong views on the role of epigenetics in

479
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
evolution.

480
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:16,360
I think it's probably a great mechanism for conferring adaptation as Zach was discussing.

481
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,800
So we have genomes.

482
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,200
They're fairly stable over generations.

483
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,160
They evolve, but it takes typically long periods of time to evolve.

484
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,560
But we need to adapt to rapidly changing environments.

485
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,640
So it confers that.

486
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,160
That means we survive, we pass on our genes.

487
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,080
So I would predict that genes that confer epigenetic plasticity would be highly selected

488
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,160
for because they would allow us to adapt.

489
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,160
But you know, then I think we get more into kind of theoretical philosophical musings

490
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,760
about how this plays out in evolution.

491
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,080
Certainly there's some suggestion that, you know, we're talking about retrotransposons.

492
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:04,880
Areas of epigenetic variability or, you know, or stability may be areas where there's also

493
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,040
likelihood of genetic variation.

494
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,520
So, you know, there may be a process where if there's a lot of epigenetic variation going

495
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:19,480
on, you know, between or within generations perhaps that will stabilize into the genome

496
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,000
somehow through genetic variation.

497
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,880
But I don't have a lot of strong views on it.

498
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,080
I think it doesn't have to play out in evolution in the way that genes do.

499
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:37,000
I think it should be its own entity as it should be within the discussions of inheritance.

500
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:45,240
So I'm more of an inclusive inheritance thinker when it comes to the term and the mechanisms

501
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
of inheritance.

502
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,880
We can transmit information in a number of ways through social, through parental effects,

503
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,200
through genes, through epigenetics.

504
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,360
They're all different mechanisms working together to confer inheritance.

505
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:04,000
But of course inheritance is just a mechanism that's important for the evolutionary process.

506
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,960
It's not the only one.

507
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,120
I'd like to add to that that I think, you know, if, you know, the standard image of

508
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:17,000
Lamarckian inheritance is this, you know, pseudo giraffe animal that isn't yet a giraffe,

509
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,480
and then the giraffe stretches, tries to stretch its neck.

510
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,880
And then over time its efforts to change itself, you know, have resulted in changing its genome.

511
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,040
And I think, you know, we have to be careful to think that, you know, anything could, you

512
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,480
know, let's assume for a moment that epigenetic inheritance does exist, all right?

513
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,560
You know, the studies have been done 10 years from now and turns out things are passed through

514
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
the germline.

515
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,680
It's not going to be everything that we do.

516
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,000
It's going to be factors that we know reprogram the epigenome.

517
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,280
So we, you know, things that affect us like stress, like other hormonal exposures.

518
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,040
You know, why do we have this, you know, okay, I'm in the psychiatry department.

519
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,800
So most of my examples will be psychiatry related.

520
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,400
But why do we get these on sets of schizophrenia right after puberty, and why do we have sex

521
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,440
differences in depression?

522
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,000
Well, you know, and what is it with stress?

523
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,880
What we have are hormones.

524
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,480
We have these factors.

525
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,040
And this is just one example, but we have steroid hormones, and these steroid hormones

526
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,680
bind a particular type of receptor that recruit epigenetic modifiers.

527
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:37,320
And so it is not that far-fetched to understand why these would reprogram the epigenome molecular

528
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:43,360
biologists will be able to name all the various co-factors that are recruited, your NCORS

529
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,680
and P300s, and there's many more that I'm ignorant of.

530
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,160
But it's important to keep in mind that if we do have this passage through the germline,

531
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,160
it's going to be in distinct areas and not necessarily everything.

532
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,440
And so as we learn more about what changes our epigenome, what specific environmental

533
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,600
factors, cocaine or smoking or alcohol, we'll be able to understand exactly what's getting

534
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,680
passed and why, what type of psychological experiences and why.

535
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,200
Oh, this abuse caused a bolus of stress hormone response at this particular developmental

536
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
time.

537
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,880
That's going to get passed on, but it's not going to be stretching the giraffe neck or

538
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,520
practicing real-hearted basketball to get a scholarship.

539
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,560
And now my kids are going to be great at basketball.

540
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,240
That's not necessarily going to be it.

541
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,360
Exercise could cause endorphins, which may affect these systems.

542
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:38,920
And then, you know, our children may have different stress responses in the brain, but

543
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,840
it's not going to be everything that's inherited.

544
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,200
And I think that that's important to keep in mind.

545
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,800
And Lamarck was, you know, very careful in his theorizing, if you actually read what he

546
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:56,360
does, you will have had to have had exposure to an environment for many, many generations

547
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,400
before it becomes propagated through inheritance.

548
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,600
Both parents would have to be exposed.

549
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,400
So you couldn't just have one parent.

550
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
It would have to be both.

551
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:12,040
And what was being propagated had to confer some sort of adaptation to the individual inheriting.

552
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:18,480
So, you know, and we don't use any of those criteria when we're testing these hypothesis.

553
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,640
And also, when it comes to Lamarck, the prevailing theory of inheritance at the time was pangenesis,

554
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,880
which was this idea that little particles of every cell in your body would break off

555
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,360
into your gametes and be transmitted directly to offspring.

556
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:38,680
Now, maybe microRNA are a good, you know, part of that story reemerging.

557
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,280
But it's certainly a very different way of thinking about inheritance in general than

558
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
we do now.

559
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,760
And I think, you know, I think there's room for Lamarckian ideas.

560
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,680
At least epigenetics provide a potential mechanism for all the marks, the theory.

561
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,680
Yeah.

562
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:00,040
You can inherit it through these epigenetic marks rather than changing the DNA sequence

563
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,080
of like a classic Darwinism.

564
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
Right.

565
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:11,200
You mentioned in terms of offspring two situations, one is, let's say, the mother who gets depressed

566
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,720
during pregnancy or is depressed and gets pregnant.

567
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,800
But another is a mother who gets depressed after the baby is born.

568
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,280
Is there a difference?

569
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,280
Yeah.

570
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,840
So that's a good question.

571
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:30,000
And so we know, for example, if we look at the children of women who have postpartum

572
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,440
depression, they have a lot of problems.

573
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,800
They have developmental delays.

574
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,640
They have dysregulated stress responses themselves, a higher chance for psychiatric

575
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,480
home morbidities.

576
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:49,680
And this has a lot to do with Francis' work that has to do with maternal offspring bonding

577
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:57,920
and how this can ultimately affect stress systems through epigenetic reprogramming.

578
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,760
So there may be other mechanisms at play, but I think, you know, that's the most highly

579
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,000
studied and well known.

580
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,600
And what happens during pregnancy is less well studied, but it looks like some of the

581
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,320
same gene pathways are being affected.

582
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,920
You know, I think that the reason we know that is because we had the targets to look

583
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920
at first.

584
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,680
It's like, well, where should we look at this?

585
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,960
You know, well, let's look where we know what happens in the postnatal environment.

586
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,360
Oh, we see an effect there.

587
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,360
Okay.

588
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:36,520
And that's necessarily the only place that we're going to see this effect.

589
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:42,560
But I think, you know, we're basically the messages very similar that both periods could

590
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,880
be a risk period.

591
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,800
And I think with prenatal depression, there is an assumption, though, you know, that a

592
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,320
lot of work needs to be done to test whether this is true, that the signal, the depression,

593
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,040
is transduced to the baby through stress hormones and other physiological changes during the

594
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,040
pregnancy.

595
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,520
We're currently looking at the placenta as something that might be modulated by depression

596
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,800
and actually modulate the way the offspring is developing.

597
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,240
When it gets to the postnatal period, as Zach mentioned, it's probably more about the dyadic

598
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,920
interactions between the mothers.

599
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,800
So depressed mothers will engage in less positive affect towards the baby that will increase

600
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,680
stress reactivity.

601
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,120
And they'll engage in less nurturing care.

602
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
And so...

603
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
We don't have epigenetic?

604
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,120
Yes.

605
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,120
Yeah.

606
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,720
So, I mean, presumed because in humans, this has been certainly less studied.

607
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,720
Although there's some interesting work looking at stroking.

608
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,240
So tactile stimulation, that's the kind of rat equivalent of what we look at when we

609
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,520
look at maternal care.

610
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,640
But, you know, certainly depressed mothers engage in less tactile stimulation of their

611
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,640
infants.

612
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,480
If you give human infants tactile stimulation, it does modulate epigenetics in the infants.

613
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,880
So certainly a possibility.

614
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:06,440
And have there been studies of, let's say, post-traumatic disorders, fathers or mothers

615
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,000
who then have children?

616
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,720
And what happens?

617
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:18,520
There's been some recent studies of PTSD and in the context of Holocaust survivors and

618
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,520
their children.

619
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,440
And I think they are seeing certainly epigenetic signatures in offspring and grand offspring

620
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,960
as a consequence of a prior generation's trauma.

621
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,360
So it does seem that you see the epigenetic mark.

622
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:36,760
One hand, on the one hand, the way you said it implies that this is proven.

623
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,800
But then it seems that there was some question about this kind of inheritance.

624
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,800
Ah.

625
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,880
So there's proof of an association.

626
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,800
There's not proof that the epigenetic mark has been laid down by the trauma in the first

627
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,080
generation and be transmitted like DNA is transmitted to subsequent generations.

628
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,480
But the multi-generational correlation in, let's say, characteristics that might be

629
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,360
associated with trauma in a previous generation, there's certainly a lot of epidemiological

630
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,720
data to support that.

631
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,520
But that's not proof of mechanism.

632
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,880
It's simply proof of phenomenon.

633
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:25,760
And in terms of cancer, what is the relationship of cancer with epigenetics?

634
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,120
Cancer and epigenetics.

635
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:35,880
So many cancers are sporadic, meaning they happen in your body as your body ages.

636
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,680
There's, most of them are not genetic per se.

637
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,920
There are certain subsets of breast cancer and ovarian cancer that is genetic.

638
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,280
But most of them are sporadic.

639
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:54,080
So that means it's not inheritance in the real term of inheritance.

640
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:01,760
But as far as the role of epigenetics in cancer, meaning changes in the histones, changes in

641
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,600
the DNA methylation, which in turn changed the chromatin structure and the whole relevance

642
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:13,760
of changing the chromatin structure is the result is you change gene expression.

643
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,200
So DNA, genetics information, is just information.

644
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,080
DNA doesn't do anything other than carry information.

645
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:28,880
It's the proteins and the RNAs that are copied from that information that are important,

646
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,200
that will make you healthy, will make you sick.

647
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:39,240
And so when the epigenetic information changes from what should be normally going on, that

648
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,280
is what will cause disease.

649
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:48,840
So there's clear evidence now that known tumor suppressors like P53, there are thousands

650
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:55,440
and thousands of labs that study P53 and P53 mutation.

651
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:03,280
There's clear evidence now that, so the mutation kills the function of the P53 protein, which

652
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,680
normally stops cells dividing out of control.

653
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,080
So now it's mutant, the cells will divide out of control.

654
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:19,200
But there's evidence that the P53 gene product is inactivated just as frequently by epigenetic

655
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,120
changes, not mutation.

656
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:27,280
And there's growing evidence that that's the case with other important genes that are

657
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,480
needed for protection from getting cancer.

658
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:37,280
There's epigenetic changes that stop those genes from being expressed.

659
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,880
And it's the harder thing to study.

660
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:45,520
I mean, DNA sequencing is a lot easier than mapping epigenetic profiles.

661
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:52,800
But I think there's a subset of cancer researchers that now believe that epigenetic changes could

662
00:48:52,800 --> 00:49:01,240
be the first changes that allow a subset of cells to divide more quickly.

663
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:06,320
If you divide more quickly, you're more prone to DNA mutations.

664
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:14,880
So some of us think that the epigenetic changes will lead to or provide a pool of cells that

665
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,880
are selected for developing into cancer.

666
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,880
And I think of evolution in a very similar way that I think these epigenetic changes

667
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:33,920
that can happen quite rapidly as an environment changes allows us all to fit a certain niche.

668
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:42,360
And then you have a population that is now more prone to a mutation that will stabilize

669
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,200
that change in phenotype or behavior.

670
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:53,200
So I think there's a lot of parallels between cancer and evolution.

671
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,200
And also aging.

672
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,320
I mean, our cells change as we age.

673
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:02,160
And age is the largest risk factor for most cancers.

674
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:08,600
So many of us are trying to understand the process of aging, to try and understand predisposition

675
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,800
or delaying the onset of cancer.

676
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,400
So yeah, it's a really hot area.

677
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:22,960
And what's really exciting about epigenetic changes is that unlike genetic changes, so

678
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,360
changes to your DNA, when your DNA changes, it's pretty much permanent.

679
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,840
It cannot be reversed.

680
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:38,120
The technologies are not available for us in the laboratory to reverse genetic changes,

681
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,840
although that is likely to change pretty soon.

682
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:50,960
But epigenetic changes, because their epigenetic information is put there by enzymes.

683
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,760
So you're adding a chemical group by an enzyme.

684
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,880
You're removing a chemical group by an enzyme.

685
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:05,040
Our enzymes can be easily inhibited by designing small molecules or chemicals to block the

686
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,160
active site of an enzyme.

687
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,640
So there are many drugs that are out there and being developed by all the big pharma

688
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:19,560
companies to block epigenetic enzymes in order to reverse these epigenetic changes.

689
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:26,680
So the idea is you can now give these drugs to a cancer patient and now turn on the expression

690
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:32,160
of the tumor suppressor gene to stop the cancer cells dividing out of control.

691
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:40,080
So it's a huge area developing epigenetic drugs and also looking at the epigenetic signature

692
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:49,120
to see if you can predict outcome of how bad the disease would be and predict which treatments

693
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:55,480
would be more effective depending on not only the DNA sequence, but also the epigenetic

694
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,800
information.

695
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:03,880
Another way epigenetics is through regulating chromatin structure.

696
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:12,320
For example, the chromosome organizes distinct domains, one important domain called the centromere.

697
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:18,240
Centromere is important for chromosome segregation during mitosis.

698
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:23,160
If it's misregulate the centromere, they also could cause cancer.

699
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:28,040
And you get aneuploidy, that's when you gain extra chromosomes.

700
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:34,080
I should have said actually the centromere that this gentleman studies is actually the

701
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:43,040
only clear evidence of inheritance of a chromatin structure through cell divisions.

702
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,720
It's a really interesting and unusual mechanism.

703
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:54,720
Yeah, I wanted to return to the issue you just brought up of essentially personalized

704
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:01,240
medicine and the hope that epigenetics brings to this aspect of things.

705
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:06,880
So it's a little bit farther away from inheritance, but I mean you could think of it that if

706
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:16,240
we do inherit some risk for a disease, we may also inherit the ability to better metabolize

707
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,720
a particular type of antidepressant or not.

708
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:25,400
We know that some genetic factors allow this to happen, but it's definitely a hot topic

709
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:34,080
that if we find an epigenetic signature of responders to this SSRI or non-responders

710
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:40,600
to this particular SNRI, we may be able to tailor what medications to give it.

711
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:45,960
And again in psychiatry, this is very important because essentially there's a lot of trial

712
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,840
and error that's done to find what medications will work.

713
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:56,440
And of course skilled psychiatrists can often do a great job of getting there quickly, but

714
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:02,000
I think with more and more antidepressants being prescribed by general practitioners,

715
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,000
having epigenetics as a tool to personalize these treatments to people could ultimately

716
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,800
lead to a lot less suffering in the future.

717
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:21,360
And I think, you know, I know the FDA has before it some proposals regarding the reevaluation

718
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:26,280
of all of their approved drugs to determine whether there are in fact germline effects.

719
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:31,960
And that's a question we don't know about most of the drugs we take, whether they, you

720
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,000
know, we have some indication whether they would be dangerous to take during pregnancy,

721
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,960
but even in that case there's a lot of question marks.

722
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:48,240
But there's, that's not routinely part of their testing and that would be next to near

723
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:54,600
impossible in humans, although they could certainly look at whether germ cells are affected,

724
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,120
but not whether it would continue.

725
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,200
They can certainly look in animal models to see whether there's a transmission.

726
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,640
Yeah, that's a great point.

727
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:09,160
I mean, one of the known antidepressants monomine oxidase inhibitor is actually, you know, we

728
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:17,160
know that it blocks various monomine oxidases and keeps dopamine in the synapse, but it

729
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:24,600
also is a lysine demethylase inhibitor, which acts specifically on the histone code on these

730
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,720
nucleosome marks that can compact or relax DNA.

731
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:34,840
And so, you know, the question is, well, when we give these drugs, we know that we're increasing

732
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:39,640
the neurotransmitters in the synapse almost immediately, and yet it takes about a month

733
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,640
to work.

734
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,640
Why?

735
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,640
Right?

736
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:48,240
So it could be that the efficaciousness of these medications could be due to transcriptional

737
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,960
factors, could be due to how long it takes them to modify the epigenome and really get

738
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,880
that transcriptional machinery in the neurons in the cells to change things and really change

739
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,040
the underlying makeup of what's going on.

740
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,400
But it does bring up that issue of, okay, you know, I'm taking antidepressants, it's

741
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:09,040
working on my brain, that's good, but what is it doing to the sperm or to the eggs?

742
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,240
And does that matter?

743
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,920
And what are the consequences?

744
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,760
And we don't know.

745
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,760
Okay.

746
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,760
Questions?

747
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:28,760
Yeah, go ahead.

748
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:50,520
I'm using microphone that would be at the same.

749
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:55,360
You know, one interesting aspect of genetics is that IQ is inherited.

750
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,880
So I think it was Stephen Pinker who said that if you look at a population of children,

751
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,560
you can compare them to the parents, you can describe 50% of the genetic, 50% of the IQ

752
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,400
variation is being genetic.

753
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,280
Now a lot of studies seem to have indicated that during the course of your life you can

754
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,240
do things which improve your IQ.

755
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,720
So the question is, over generations can you do changes which can improve the IQ of, you

756
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,480
know, your grandchildren as compared to the grandparents?

757
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,000
Or is it something that is completely genetic?

758
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,560
That's if you want it.

759
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,560
I'm sorry?

760
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:31,760
That's if you want them to be more intelligent.

761
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,440
That's a solution.

762
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:39,080
I'm more concerned about doing the reverse to my children, reducing their IQ.

763
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,960
But maybe you can know most about this.

764
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,040
Oh, well, I mean, it's a great question.

765
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:51,280
I mean, I think, so, yeah, that's sort of one of those Lamarckian, it brings us back

766
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,240
to the Lamarckian issue of can we make our son a good basketball player and then pass

767
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,400
that on?

768
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,600
And I don't know.

769
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:08,280
I mean, I guess if you, if a lot of the IQ factors, the genes that influence IQ are

770
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:13,800
inherited by the DNA sequence, I could imagine that something you're doing might be, could

771
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:19,080
potentially free up those genes in an inheritance way.

772
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,480
But I don't know, it's quite speculative.

773
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:28,120
I would also assume that it would be difficult to discern the factors that have caused you

774
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:37,080
to improve your IQ as well because you're going to impart through your environment this

775
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,240
intelligence to your children.

776
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,040
You're going to use bigger words.

777
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:47,360
You're going to probably focus on school a lot for them because you've come to value

778
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,360
intelligence.

779
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:56,200
I mean, it's tough to imagine what specific molecular mechanism that would work through.

780
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:02,000
But also, is IQ, I mean, IQ is based on certain questions that you answered.

781
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
It's not the...

782
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Right.

783
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Right.

784
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,440
You could be trained to answer those kind of questions better.

785
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,280
But it's an interesting question.

786
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:16,560
And the problem with human studies is personally usually not allowed to do them.

787
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:21,760
So it's just observation of what's normally going on in the population.

788
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,960
And they are really, really slow.

789
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:31,040
I mean, people don't live long enough to do a study on someone else's offspring and their

790
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,040
offspring.

791
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,840
So we're going to have to wait.

792
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,080
It's a great question.

793
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,960
And I'm sure the future will answer it.

794
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:42,120
But when, you know, going back to points you were making earlier about the twin study.

795
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:47,520
There are concept of heritability is based on, you know, the models of twin studies that

796
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,640
have been conducted historically.

797
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,480
We don't usually use that approach anymore.

798
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:56,560
In fact, twin studies are now mostly epigenetic analyses because it's great because now you've

799
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:01,440
got individuals who are monozygotic and then you can look at how they deviate in their epigenetic

800
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,240
code over their lifespan.

801
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:08,720
But I think the more people are learning about epigenetics and environmentally induced

802
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,360
changes in gene activity.

803
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:18,600
The more that I think we should question the basis for heritability estimates and the assumptions

804
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:25,880
underlying those estimates because certainly monozygotic twins share more similar environment

805
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,960
than we've been able to characterize.

806
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:32,560
And if environment is laying down these epigenetic codes we have to keep that in mind.

807
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,520
And it's hard to quantify.

808
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:39,040
But I think it's something that we should kind of think about in the back of our mind.

809
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:46,080
Certainly, as you mentioned, genes don't do anything unless they're instructed.

810
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:51,200
And so that is what these gene regulatory mechanisms, epigenetic mechanisms do.

811
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:58,960
And so though we may inherit genes that will increase reaction time and, you know, the

812
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:05,160
way in which we perceive, interact with the world, we can layer in more information on

813
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,800
that which leaves room for the epigenetic enhancement or decrement.

814
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:14,560
I'd like to just make it a little bit more confusing with the twin studies.

815
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:19,920
One interesting aspect when it comes to epigenetics that is rarely ever taken into consideration

816
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,840
is the issue of coreanicity.

817
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,440
That has to do with when the twinning occurred.

818
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:30,760
So if a twinning occurs very early then everyone gets their own placenta and amniotic sac and

819
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,760
everything.

820
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,760
And we call these dichorionic twins.

821
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:38,080
But if it occurs, 70% of twins occur after day four and then we get a shared placenta

822
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,680
and we get these shared connections.

823
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:46,480
And this makes everything really confusing because the twins share stem cells to a degree,

824
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,160
which means that if we study the blood of those twins, they're going to have been swapping

825
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,440
and so it makes it harder.

826
01:01:53,440 --> 01:02:00,600
And so if any of these factors were conferred into the later phenotype, then this is going

827
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,560
to mess with the heritability estimates.

828
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:09,280
It's if something in the interuterine environment influences that IQ that we're looking at heritability

829
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,600
for then this is going to mess with things.

830
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:18,000
Also just sharing doesn't make it simple because they also don't share evenly.

831
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,600
So in extreme cases we'll get what's called a twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome where

832
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:28,800
one twin will be very nutritionally deprived and the genetically identical twins come out

833
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,960
very different because they haven't had equal blood flow.

834
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:37,480
And so these factors, the coreanicity, is never taken into account in twin studies and

835
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,920
can greatly influence heritability.

836
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,920
And epigenetic changes in those situations?

837
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,920
Yeah.

838
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:53,520
So we showed a few years ago in 2009 that the monochoreonic twins, the twins that share

839
01:02:53,520 --> 01:03:00,440
the blood stem cells are more epigenetically similar in blood because they share.

840
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:05,320
But if you look at other cells like buckle cells, they're much more epigenetically different

841
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:09,520
probably because of these nutritional effects.

842
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,080
And this was then replicated by four other groups or so.

843
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:20,160
So it's a very robust finding that twins that share these blood connections are very unequal

844
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:24,520
in the amount of epigenetic reprogramming that they ultimately end up with.

845
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:30,400
So does this mean that if you twin later you're going to have more discordance for schizophrenia

846
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,040
or depression or metabolic syndromes maybe.

847
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,200
But it's never quantified.

848
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,400
People don't quantify the placenta.

849
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,400
So we should.

850
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,400
Just a question.

851
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:55,080
This has been studied with Lamarck and non-Lamarck and that it's what took so long to get to

852
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,080
this point.

853
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:02,280
I think it's for the epigenetic field we just started like 30, 40 years ago.

854
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,480
Just realized this new mechanism.

855
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,000
Why not in the 1870s?

856
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
19 years.

857
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:17,520
Well, I think Darwin's theory also included some of Lamarckian's ideas.

858
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:26,880
Just I think people like to kind of take out of someone's theory the bit they like.

859
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:33,760
And Darwin support the ideas of acquired bio-cutery that can be inherited.

860
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,760
Absolutely.

861
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:42,680
If pan-genesis is your theory of inheritance then the cells are modified by life and they

862
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,120
shed particles and they're inherited.

863
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:52,840
It's interesting to think about the sociological factors at the time that led to the dismissal

864
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,320
of Lamarck.

865
01:04:54,320 --> 01:05:01,040
Now, certainly August Wiseman is usually attributed with that because he did an experiment rather

866
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:06,440
than give example after example after example of the inheritance of acquired characteristics.

867
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,440
He did a study.

868
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,000
He chopped the tails off mice.

869
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,160
The offspring of those mice did not have short tails.

870
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,040
The grand offspring of those mice did not have short tails.

871
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:19,320
The great grand offspring of those mice did not have short tails.

872
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,440
And he kept chopping each generation.

873
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,920
So he tried.

874
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:29,800
And in fact, one experiment well-characterized was seemed to be enough at the time.

875
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:34,360
So that suggests that there are other sociological factors at the time that were probably swaying

876
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,960
people away from the Lamarckian view.

877
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:43,920
And also August Wiseman presented the idea of the Wiseman barrier whereby the germ cells

878
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,280
were special and protected.

879
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:50,240
And we still have that assumption that the germ cells are protected.

880
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,640
They are different cells.

881
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,760
They are certainly different cells from the rest of the body.

882
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,920
But we have this assumption in the back of our mind that what goes on with our other

883
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,920
cells could not possibly affect those cells.

884
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,440
And so that stayed in as a dogma.

885
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,520
And I think still kind of influences the way people think about sperm and eggs.

886
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:17,520
And I think really you need the molecular tools to be able to divine these changes.

887
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:24,040
So when you have dogmas come into science, you need proof and very strong proof to get

888
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,800
rid of them, not just philosophical ideas.

889
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:34,600
So I think part of why now is because now there are studies that are believable that

890
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:42,200
do support these ideas, at least for passing on to several generations like studies that

891
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,840
Francis has done.

892
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:51,960
So now there is evidence that is convincing, at least for short term, Lamarckian inheritance.

893
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,240
Another is technology improvement.

894
01:06:54,240 --> 01:07:01,800
Like 100 years ago we don't know how to delete genes and to look at what is happening in

895
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,800
the cell.

896
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,960
Now we have advanced technology just analyzing all these phenomena in the molecular and

897
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,240
cellular levels.

898
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,240
To help understand to this phenomenon.

899
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:20,040
Maybe we are getting smarter.

900
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,720
So I have two questions.

901
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,880
The first one is more simple.

902
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,920
Is the evidence showing that it is easier to turn on genes or is it easier to turn off

903
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:35,800
genes or is it one harder than other or is it pretty much?

904
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:40,240
Depends on the state of the gene that you are trying to turn on or off.

905
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,320
Okay.

906
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:52,400
If it is solidly in a very tight chromatin structure then it is very hard to turn on.

907
01:07:52,400 --> 01:08:00,400
So I guess to answer your question, repressive states are easier to inherit than active states.

908
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,480
So repressive states are more permanent in general.

909
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,040
That is what I was getting at.

910
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,800
The other question pertains to horn mises.

911
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,840
I don't know how familiar people are with horn mises.

912
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,520
Just homeopathy and things of that nature when you have a low exposure to toxins and

913
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,520
stresses.

914
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:26,080
I am thinking from a chronic point of view, for example, of someone running and causing

915
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,280
information in the body.

916
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,120
Much good comes from that as well.

917
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:36,040
So I am just thinking as far as horn mises, if anyone does know about the subject as it

918
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:42,520
pertains to our health, how does that tie into epigenetics?

919
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:49,200
I am enthused by the subject because I have been to many health conferences where they

920
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:53,760
speak very favorably of horn mises but I am sitting through the panel.

921
01:08:53,760 --> 01:09:01,880
I am thinking to myself perhaps you can have damages that pass on to the next generation.

922
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:08,440
Is that specific to inflammation?

923
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,640
I am not familiar with it.

924
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,800
Or did you mention environmental toxins?

925
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:12,800
Just homeopathy.

926
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,800
Are you familiar with that field?

927
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:24,040
Just the idea that a certain degree of stress on systems tend to evoke the imperative conditions.

928
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:29,680
Low doses and then over the course of a life, not just one instance.

929
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:33,560
This is more a health related question.

930
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:40,480
We know that things like exercise are good for depression and cognition and they promote

931
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:47,880
brain-derived neurotrophic factors that ultimately result in synaptogenesis in the hippocampus

932
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:52,000
and basically are very pro-good mood.

933
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,960
And so that one mechanism that comes to mind is if you have pro-good mood then you are

934
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:03,600
not going to have these high cortisol levels that will be passed.

935
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:09,520
So I don't know if the endorphins or epinephrine that you are generating are going to reprogram

936
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,240
or pass the placenta in the same way that people are studying cortisol because people

937
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,480
are studying cortisol and they are not studying that.

938
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,240
But in theory they could or they will at least reduce that and that is one way that you may

939
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:24,920
pass your good mood on to your kids.

940
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:31,920
As a final note I feel as if the very near future will discover how we are looking at

941
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:39,160
how, you know, I feel like just on the subject of running for example it is perhaps a double

942
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:44,560
edged sword where they will see, they are studying all the good that comes from it and

943
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:50,000
then oh wait a second, 15, 20 years, not running perhaps with just other subjects.

944
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,520
We didn't see that there was also this negative that was simultaneously happening with all

945
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,520
the positive concurrence.

946
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,520
I love this field.

947
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,520
Thanks.

948
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,520
Sure.

949
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,520
Those cytokines that you are creating could if they epigenetically program.

950
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,960
And good and bad is so contextually dependent.

951
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:10,880
So something can be good in one context but very bad in another.

952
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:17,040
And even low levels of maternal care which we would say are bad.

953
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:23,320
Programs offspring to engage in less care which we would say is bad but it also enhances

954
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,520
sexual reactivity.

955
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:29,320
If you have teenage daughters you probably think that's bad too but if you are a rodent

956
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,680
and you are trying to propagate offspring in a stressful environment it is a very good

957
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,680
thing.

958
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:40,840
So you know really you know thinking in terms of the way our body adapts we adapt to the

959
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:47,120
context we are in that allows us to survive and propagate in that environment.

960
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:53,720
Some of the characteristics we might see might seem maladaptive but often that is in another

961
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,720
context.

962
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,120
So PTSD for example is a good example.

963
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:05,320
Having being vigilant not being able to sleep and being very anxious is not great if you

964
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:10,400
are living in a lovely, wonderful, stress-free suburb but probably very good if you are

965
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,080
in a traumatized war zone.

966
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,800
So that's another thought.

967
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,000
I was curious how we read the epigenetic marks.

968
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,120
Does the standard gene sequencing machinery give you the epigenome?

969
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,760
That's my basic question.

970
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:32,400
And the second question is my epigenome constant throughout my body.

971
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,800
So I will answer the second one first.

972
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,960
Is your epigenome constant absolutely not?

973
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:44,080
Every single one of our cells has the identical DNA information.

974
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,840
The identical genetic code in every cell.

975
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:53,520
The only reason why our cells are different like why some look like a hair cell, some

976
01:12:53,520 --> 01:13:00,320
look like a you know a skin cell is because of the edge of the genetic information.

977
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:05,400
And that's because the epigenetic information changes the chromatin structure, changes the

978
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,400
chromosomes.

979
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:13,160
It even makes them more open or more closed, inaccessible in a very local manner.

980
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:19,720
So some genes can be accessed by the machinery that copies the information and some genes

981
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,720
cannot.

982
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:24,800
So it's where those marks are along the genome that's critical.

983
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:30,040
So then it sounds like there's a, the marks appear to give the, to differentiate the cells.

984
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,040
Absolutely.

985
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,880
But the environment changes on top of that.

986
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,880
Yes.

987
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,880
Is that right?

988
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,880
Yes.

989
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,880
Exactly.

990
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,360
So if I wanted to know my epigenome, I would have to look at each cell type throughout

991
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:41,360
my body.

992
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,360
Yes.

993
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:47,240
And even in individual cells, that's the technology that is now being developed.

994
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,720
And then how would you read it?

995
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,760
Let's say we took a skin cell of mine.

996
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,760
Yes.

997
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,000
So it depends what you want to read.

998
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,040
If you want to read DNA methylation, there's a really clever trick where you just add a

999
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:03,600
chemical called biculfite and it changed, I always get this wrong.

1000
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,000
It even changes the methyl C's to a U or a C-O-M-Methyl.

1001
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,720
Actually it converts any modified C's.

1002
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:14,240
It could be methyl, but it could be other groups to U.

1003
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,240
U.

1004
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:19,160
And then when you run PCR, it converts to a T.

1005
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,040
So when you sequence, you get a C to T conversion.

1006
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:26,560
If there's no methyl, and it won't convert if it's methyl.

1007
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,800
So that's really easy.

1008
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,760
Measuring histone modifications is a lot more difficult.

1009
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:41,440
You have to have an antibody that is specific to that particular histone modification.

1010
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:49,840
By modification, I mean a phosphate, an acetyl, a methyl group, but small chemicals or small

1011
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,040
elements.

1012
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,400
The antibody has to recognize that mark.

1013
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:59,720
And then you do a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation where you shatter the

1014
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:04,920
genome into tiny fragments of about 500 base pairs.

1015
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:12,120
And then you immunoprecipitate, you pull down with a immobilized molecule.

1016
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:18,840
The antibody and whatever chromatin is bound to it, and then you sequence that piece of

1017
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:19,840
DNA.

1018
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:25,480
So that is a lot more challenging, a lot more expensive, but I was talking to someone recently

1019
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:31,000
at Mass General that is developing that technique on a single cell basis.

1020
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:38,840
I mean it's amazingly cutting edge, probably shouldn't have said that.

1021
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:45,000
The issue of the cell differences in epigenome in response to the environment is a huge one

1022
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,160
when it comes to doing human studies.

1023
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:52,800
So especially if you're interested in behavior in a more psychological state, because we're

1024
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,600
often interested in what's going on epigenetically in the brain, but we can't access that tissue.

1025
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,760
So we rely on blood and buckle cells.

1026
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:08,240
The animal work suggests that for some epigenetic modifications you might expect to see concordance

1027
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:14,400
between brain and blood or buckle cells, but for many other genes you won't.

1028
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:20,160
So it's really constrained the translation of a lot of the basic science to human studies.

1029
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:24,200
Yeah, and you're also going to get just a very brief point.

1030
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,560
You're going to get a soup of cells.

1031
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:29,000
If you're taking the brain you're going to get some dopaminergic neurons, some serid

1032
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,040
allergic neurons, you're going to get a lot of glia and some oligobendrocytes, and you're

1033
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:38,040
going to get this one number representative of all of that, based on looking at one position.

1034
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:42,240
So it takes a little bit of a look at the way it will go in future.

1035
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,240
Yeah, a single cell.

1036
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,240
Yeah.

1037
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,240
Very expensive.

1038
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,240
I'm sure.

1039
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:52,520
Hi, is there a relationship between epigenetics and character development?

1040
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,920
In what development?

1041
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,360
Is there a relationship between epigenetics and character development?

1042
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,360
Character.

1043
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:05,040
Not just personal, but collective as well.

1044
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,880
So I could say yes, but that's, you know.

1045
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:14,080
I mean you elaborate on that.

1046
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:22,160
So what you're asking is to go from the level of a molecular modification in a cell to the

1047
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:27,520
way in which someone interacts with their environment on a regular basis.

1048
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,520
That's what you're talking about.

1049
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,160
We're talking about character or personality.

1050
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:35,440
And you know, certainly the way in which, you know, your brain functions and your cell

1051
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:40,920
function is going to be determined by the gene regulatory mechanisms, epigenetic mechanisms

1052
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,440
in the cell.

1053
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:47,920
We don't know how you get from that to these kind of broader states.

1054
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:52,080
Certainly there's effects on stress hormone systems that have global effects on the way

1055
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,120
in which we behave in our personality.

1056
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:59,360
There will be effects on certain neuron populations in the brain that might affect your anxiety

1057
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:06,680
levels and depression or your risk taking, let's say, as another character.

1058
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:11,880
But we have a long way to go before we build in, you know, figure out the pathway where

1059
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,280
we get from one to the other, even in animal models.

1060
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,120
It's very challenging to do.

1061
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:22,120
Unless we look at a very simple behavioral output, it's challenging.

1062
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,960
Yeah, just to add on to that, I think it relates back to the last point is that it's hard to

1063
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,240
study the brain.

1064
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:31,840
And so we know that, you know, character is going to be based in the brain, but, you

1065
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,520
know, we can do postmortem studies in humans and then we're looking at these soups of

1066
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,880
cells or we could look at the blood, but are the blood cells going to relate to different

1067
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,120
personality metrics.

1068
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:47,720
So you can assess personality metrics with psychiatric scales in live humans, but you

1069
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,640
can't look at their brain epigenome.

1070
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:57,200
And so we may get there eventually, but the challenges of likening the epigenome to behavior

1071
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:03,840
now are limited to where we can look at behaviors that a mouse might or rat may exhibit.

1072
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:04,840
Did I hear you correctly?

1073
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,840
You localized character?

1074
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,960
You say it's in the brain?

1075
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:15,280
There are various psychological scales to assess, you know, psychiatry is always trying

1076
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:21,240
to quantify, you know, how much someone is extroverted versus introverted.

1077
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:25,880
These are sort of, I guess, it depends on how you quantify character, but I may be using

1078
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,720
a definition slightly different from yours.

1079
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:36,720
But any psychological state may be assumed, perhaps, to be coming from the brain and as

1080
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:42,160
such, it's a challenge at least to study that aspect of it.

1081
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:43,160
Okay.

1082
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,160
Thank you.

1083
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,160
Go ahead.

1084
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,160
We're all so smart.

1085
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:55,720
As a practicing physician, I'm very interested in maximizing the health of my patients.

1086
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:02,320
What I really try to do is help them outsmart their genes, so to speak, and live the best

1087
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,680
healthiest lives they can in preventing chronic disease and illness, both in the mind and

1088
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,680
body.

1089
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:13,240
Wondering where you think environmentally, we can get the most bang for our buck?

1090
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,920
Is it food, which is biochemical, exercise, meditation?

1091
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,240
There's so much research out there.

1092
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:23,640
I'd love to hear from each of you, if you would, where we can really focus our attention

1093
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:27,800
in this fabulous field of actually influencing our own health.

1094
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,800
Thank you.

1095
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,800
All right.

1096
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:34,160
I'll start, I guess.

1097
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:41,280
So there's been a lot of work on the effects of various types of mindfulness-based meditation

1098
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:49,640
on depression, for example, and it's very, very efficacious for that based on meta-analysis.

1099
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,800
I don't know that people have necessarily looked at its effects on the epigenome so much,

1100
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:58,920
although using the transitive property of logic, we know that it will reduce your stress hormones

1101
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:05,760
and other endocrine factors that may reprogram your epigenome in positive ways.

1102
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,960
So I know that that's good, but I can't answer the question of what's best.

1103
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:13,360
I mean, I think that if you're generally healthy and you're also going to, I mentioned earlier

1104
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:18,720
that exercise and endorphins can increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor in these

1105
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:23,800
sort of mood positive factors that influence the brain in positive ways.

1106
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:27,280
I can't say whether that's better than meditation or not.

1107
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:31,080
I like to do both, I think it helps.

1108
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:37,120
And I know less about diet other than sort of what's known from the amount of methylation

1109
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:44,040
co-factors or full-8 B12 B vitamins that can sort of, those act as the bricks that the

1110
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:48,120
building blocks that your methylating machinery uses to methylate DNA.

1111
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:52,720
So if you're like grabbing for methyl groups and you're out of them, you're not going

1112
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:53,720
to be methylated.

1113
01:21:53,720 --> 01:22:00,440
And those dietary factors are going to be important if you don't have them, then this

1114
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,160
could, in theory, cause problems.

1115
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:07,400
I mean, I think all those factors will influence the epigenome and they're good, but to quantify

1116
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,400
them is difficult.

1117
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,480
Yeah, I agree.

1118
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:15,760
I think that the environment factors definitely play a key role in the epigenomes.

1119
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,760
So we have a study on diet.

1120
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:22,960
We, for example, look at the vitamin folate.

1121
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,440
She hates affecting histone marks.

1122
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,520
We look at the yeast and the human cells.

1123
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:35,040
We show the strong correlations that the folate can affect the epigenetic marks, the histone

1124
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,520
modifications.

1125
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:43,680
So we believe, yeah, if you have a proper diet, it's definitely well, you know, can help the

1126
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:47,360
health of the patients.

1127
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,360
And this is terrible.

1128
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:53,320
I don't remember the details, but I do have colleagues in Houston that this is all they

1129
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:57,440
study is certain types of sprouts.

1130
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:01,720
They're not bean sprouts, but something similar to bean sprouts.

1131
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:13,280
And they see clear changes, beneficial changes in the methylation profiles and also protection

1132
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,800
against cancer.

1133
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,480
So you don't have to take folate pills.

1134
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:26,040
There are definite sources of food that are beneficial.

1135
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:32,960
And if you'd like later, if you give me your email, I can put you in touch with people.

1136
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:41,480
So I've always, because I work with mothers and their children, I'm a really strong advocate

1137
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:47,960
of social support as a way of modulating stress, reactivity, enhancing mother infant interactions

1138
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:50,760
and thus modifying the epigenome.

1139
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:54,840
And so I think social support in general is probably really essential.

1140
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:00,600
But that's more of a kind of a group level intervention rather than individual.

1141
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:06,360
So at an individual level, I'd probably be most influenced by the Columbia Center for

1142
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:10,920
Children's Environmental Health work, where they look at various pollutants in Manhattan

1143
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:17,840
and how they affect the brain, especially when they're experienced by mothers who are pregnant,

1144
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,760
but certainly not limited to that level of exposure.

1145
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:28,040
So one of the toxins we study is bisphenol A, BPA, that's made and it's used in the manufacture

1146
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,040
of plastics.

1147
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,800
So whenever you drink at a plastic bottle, you get BPA in your system.

1148
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,800
So I would try and reduce exposure as much as possible to that.

1149
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,720
It's an endocrine disrupting chemical.

1150
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:45,520
You get it when you touch grocery store receipts and it has epigenetic effects.

1151
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:51,840
So certainly and I think now they're certainly looking a lot more at thalates and other exposures

1152
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:58,120
as well that come from the various chemicals that we unfortunately are exposed to in New

1153
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,120
York.

1154
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,120
Okay.

1155
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,280
Oh, there's one more.

1156
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:13,680
Yeah, this has to do with Mother Infant Diads, a question about infant observational research.

1157
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:20,720
And much of the language that has been used that could apply at that macro level has used

1158
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,520
the word stress.

1159
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:27,400
And yet there are much more subtle sort of relationships that go on in the Mother Infant

1160
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:32,840
Diad then stress would seem to account for.

1161
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:39,640
So for example, in something called the social referencing paradigm at six months of age,

1162
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:46,520
you put a child on a visual cliff, that is it's a glass and there's a drop, but you can

1163
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,840
crawl across because there's a glass.

1164
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:54,880
And the mother stands at one end, the infant is allowed to crawl and the infant starts

1165
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,680
to crawl, gets to the cliff, what looks like a cliff.

1166
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:03,600
And then we'll crawl forward or not depending on the mother.

1167
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:10,120
In each case, the mother's asked to, asked the kid to keep crawling toward her.

1168
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:17,800
And some infants will look at the mother, be calmed by her expression, her encouragement

1169
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:22,480
and will continue across, will feel confident in her confidence.

1170
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:27,480
Her fears won't look or will look and will be too afraid to continue.

1171
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:28,480
That's at six months.

1172
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:36,120
A year later, there's a correlation between those six month old who followed their mother's

1173
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:44,200
instructions, trusted them enough to continue crawling and what's called secure attachment,

1174
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:49,600
which is I'm sure you know that's been measured in a variety of different ways.

1175
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:56,400
The same mothers, if they had been tested on the adult attachment inventory, that whole

1176
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:03,560
group of mothers at six months of pregnancy, we would have been able to predict from their

1177
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:09,440
responses on that inventory, which asks questions about their early relationships, we would

1178
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:16,720
have been able to predict what their 12-month-old children would be like on a measure of their

1179
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,320
security of attachment to the mother.

1180
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:23,960
So there are a number, and this is just skimming the surface, there are a number of very important

1181
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:30,320
findings in the infant observational research that pertain to the mother infant diet and

1182
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:34,960
the nature of the bond, really the individual difference in the bond.

1183
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:39,160
And somehow stress doesn't capture the subtleties of that.

1184
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:44,960
You guys are definitely talking about the biological mechanisms that underpin the kind

1185
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:50,920
of behavioral differences that are being seen in this kind of research, but is there something

1186
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:53,920
else that you could name besides stress?

1187
01:27:53,920 --> 01:28:00,480
Is there some other, or do you find some way of translating stress into these subtle

1188
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:04,800
interactional differences in mothers and infants?

1189
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:13,160
Yeah, I think the bias in what we study and what has been studied in the field is based

1190
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:17,120
on what you can do in the lab and experimentally.

1191
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:24,000
And you can't look at these attachment relationships in the basic science models that we use in

1192
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,680
the lab.

1193
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:30,000
That said, there's probably, you know, what you're describing is the transmission of attachment

1194
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,680
security from one generation to the next.

1195
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:37,560
So there's probably some correlate to that, and certainly we see that the degree and reliability

1196
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:43,720
of mother infant interactions does transmit from mothers to daughters and rodent models,

1197
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,280
but we don't assess it obviously in the same way.

1198
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:50,440
We're looking at something that we can quantify the level of tactile stimulation.

1199
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:55,440
Right, but you look at licking and sucking and wrap pups.

1200
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:56,440
Exactly.

1201
01:28:56,440 --> 01:29:00,720
So, you know, when we talk about stress, it's because it's something that is comparable.

1202
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:06,400
You know, we know about stress physiology, and in this model we know a little bit about

1203
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,240
it in humans.

1204
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:14,240
Whether what we're studying in these basic models can be applied, I mean, I certainly

1205
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,240
it could.

1206
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,040
It's just be operationalizing.

1207
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:23,520
What is it that we think is driving the epigenetic change in both generations and getting our

1208
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,200
hand handle on that?

1209
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:31,480
I think, you know, it's just the field is moving extraordinarily fast, you know, when

1210
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:36,120
you think of it comparative to other fields, but it's still very early doors, I think,

1211
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:41,520
for applying what we know in terms of the basic science to extrapolating to these kind

1212
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,680
of real social interactions in humans.

1213
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:49,800
But what you were saying about bringing in support, being helpful, really does translate

1214
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:54,720
to the macro level of certain kinds of interventions that you can do with these mother infant

1215
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:59,080
diets that have correlates at the biological level.

1216
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:00,080
Yeah.

1217
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,240
It's just why is there something other than stress hormones.

1218
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,240
Yeah.

1219
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,240
Yeah.

1220
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:07,240
Certainly.

1221
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,920
But I think we're probably uncomfortable going much further than that because, you know,

1222
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,680
when I look at a rat, it's not, you know, there's no social referencing.

1223
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:17,920
And there's, you know, so it's just that we want to keep it true to the models that we

1224
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,640
work with rather than going too far afield.

1225
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,360
Thank you.

1226
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,360
Okay.

1227
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,680
Thank you.

1228
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:40,200
Thank you.

1229
01:30:40,200 --> 01:31:00,200
Thank you.

1230
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:13,380
All right.

1231
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:30,040
