1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:16,300
DeGenevieve did a very oldytale unless he picked the

2
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:23,300
Just pull them in.

3
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:58,420
Welcome to today's program. I'm Ed Nersesien, the Director of the Center. Before introducing

4
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,020
the participants for today's program on fake knowledge, knowing and the illusion of knowing,

5
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:12,700
I'd like to announce the next programs. On November 18, we have a roundtable on American

6
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:19,300
poetry today that was organized by Anne Marie LeBien and the participants in that are Patricia

7
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:27,020
Carlin, Selby Davidov, Amy Holman, Paolo Znhabier and Stefan Massimila.

8
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:37,540
Then the first weekend of December, December 1 to 3, we have a weekend of programs on the

9
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:47,100
subject of art and science, the two cultures converging. In addition to the roundtables,

10
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:57,900
there will be also other programs during these two days, including videos and other performances.

11
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:05,660
This particular program on the science and art is organized with another group, the Art

12
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:20,500
and Science Centers, SIRs. As far as the program today, I'd like to introduce the various

13
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,380
participants and I will do it on alphabetical order so you may have to raise your hand

14
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:34,420
so people know who you are. Paul Bogosian is the Silver Professor of Philosophy at NYU,

15
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,500
Director of its New York Institute and Philosophy and member of the American Academy of Arts

16
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,460
and Sciences. I am going to make the bios very short if you want more information there

17
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:52,500
on the website. Daniel Kahneman is Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Public Affairs

18
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:04,380
at Princeton. He won the Nobel Prize in 2002 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013.

19
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:14,900
His work on decision making and human judgment was done with participation of Amos Torsky.

20
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,100
Eric Candel is Professor of University, Professor at Columbia University and Cavalier, Professor

21
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:29,580
and Director of the Cavalier Institute for Brain Science. He has received many, many awards

22
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,540
and he received the Nobel Prize in Psychology and Medicine in 2000.

23
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,540
Physiology.

24
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:43,580
Close enough. Physiology. Not psychology.

25
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,580
It's close enough. Physiology.

26
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:59,540
Mark Mitten is a magician and one of the most curious minds I have ever encountered.

27
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:12,300
His specialty is Physical Misdirection. Daphna Shomani is Professor of Psychology at Columbia

28
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,980
University's Mind, Brain, Behavior Institute and Department of Psychology and she is also

29
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,700
a member of the Cavalier Institute for Brain Science.

30
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:28,340
And then Steven Sloman is Professor of Cognitive Linguistic and Psychological Sciences at Brown

31
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:35,260
University. He is Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Cognition and it's in reading his recent

32
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:41,940
book with Phil Fernbach, The Knowledge Illusion, Why We Never Think Alone, that I developed

33
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,460
the idea of doing this round table.

34
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,980
Before they start, I'd like to say that after the conversation, there will be a period of

35
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:58,260
question and answer. I would very much appreciate if those who come up here come with a question

36
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:05,260
and just focus on one question and get the answer to that question. Thank you.

37
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:18,300
So the format is one of the participants. We'll start the discussion and I think Steve wanted

38
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,260
to get going.

39
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:29,740
I'm happy to start. I'm probably not the right person to give this distinguished group, but

40
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,220
I didn't know that you brought us together by virtue of having read our book and so I'm

41
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,540
really pleased by that. And let me spend two minutes describing what the book's about.

42
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:47,020
The book has two ideas. It's about ignorance and the community of knowledge and the idea

43
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:55,300
is that people think they know more than they do. So people are relatively ignorant, which

44
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,460
is a claim I would defend, although that's not really the point. The point is that people

45
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:08,820
think they understand simple everyday objects as well as deep important ideas as well as

46
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:16,220
political policies when in fact it turns out they don't understand them so well.

47
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:22,380
And so the second part of the book is an attempt to explain why that's the case. Why is it

48
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:29,100
that we think we understand more than we do? And the answer we offer is that people confuse

49
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:35,860
what other people know with what they know. So we live in a community of knowledge. Knowledge

50
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:42,180
is something that exists across people. Most thinking does not occur inside the head, but

51
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:48,620
it rather occurs within a community and that's sort of the storehouse of knowledge. We outsource

52
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:56,780
most of our thinking. And thus we think we understand things because it's not so important

53
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:04,340
to identify the source of knowledge. What's more important is to gain access to the knowledge.

54
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,060
That's the main idea.

55
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,500
I must say the scientists I know don't quite share that view. Most of us think we're quite

56
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,380
ignorant and don't think we know more than we know. I wonder whether this is your share

57
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,380
feeling.

58
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:26,420
Well, that's scientists. But I think that when you talk about the psychology of the public

59
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:33,460
or people in general, or scientists when they are not acting a scientist, then the situation

60
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:41,180
is completely different. And people do believe they know things that they have no idea about.

61
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:47,340
And what I find most striking and perhaps you explain it in your book is that when you

62
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:55,100
ask somebody why they believe something, they always have something to say. And they seem

63
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,660
to think that what they have to say, the reasons that come to their mind are the cause of their

64
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:08,220
belief, which is nonsense. The beliefs are the cause of what they say. So the belief comes

65
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:15,700
first and reasons come to mind when asked, when required. And the striking thing to me

66
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:24,060
that introspectively that's not available. I was running an introspective exercise this

67
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,740
morning and it, you know, fake news did remind me of Donald Trump. So we're not going to

68
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:37,660
avoid Donald Trump completely. But I was very struck by the fact that I can, you know,

69
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:44,260
I can hear the arguments of Trump supporters. And I don't believe for a moment that's,

70
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,540
that what they say is the reason that they believe what they believe. They conclude.

71
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:56,380
And I tried to convince myself that the same was true of me. And I found it terribly difficult.

72
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:06,660
I found that, you know, I believe what I believe because it's true. They believe. They believe.

73
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,220
The direct access to the truth. Absolutely. But every one of us has direct access to

74
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,940
the truth because the experience of truth is, you know, what we have in perception. We see

75
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:26,340
the world as it is. And we suppress alternatives as we go. And the experience of truth is true.

76
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:32,100
It's simply that you can't imagine an alternative to what it is that you see or you think. That's

77
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,580
what's true. So that's, you know, we're blessed with truth all the time.

78
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,660
I mean, two, two things about that. One of them is we hold beliefs with different levels

79
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,780
of confidence. So perceptual things, things that are right in front of our eyes, we're

80
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,620
very confident about. But other things we infer on the basis of the evidence and there

81
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,220
the inference may be shakier and we're aware of that. I think even ordinary people are

82
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,820
aware that their prediction about who will win the Super Bowl, you know, even if they

83
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,180
believe something about that. This is a shakier than saying that there is a table in front

84
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:09,220
of us. But the important point you were making about the difference between the preferred

85
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:16,140
reason, the reason that we give for believing something versus the actual cause of the belief.

86
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,980
It's an important distinction. However, you know, it has to be united with the fact that

87
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,420
there is a distinction between the onset of a belief and the maintenance of the belief.

88
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,260
So we believe something, we come to believe something at a given time and then that's

89
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,220
maintained. Now when I ask you right now, why you believe that, I don't battle of Hastings,

90
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,340
was 10, 16. Now there may have been a cause for that a long time ago, but the reason you

91
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:46,060
offer now may be the reason for which you maintain that belief. So in fact, I don't believe there's

92
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:52,420
necessarily a huge gap between what maintains the belief right now and what your reason

93
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,620
is. It's clear that you're much more of an optimist about what you want to mind than

94
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,500
I am. I like to believe. Yeah, no, I'm on Danny's side on this one. I mean, let me bring

95
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,540
some data to bear on the issue. It turns out there are beliefs and then there are beliefs

96
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,220
and then there are beliefs, right? I'm not sure we're all talking about the same kind

97
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,980
of belief. But when it comes to political beliefs, it turns out the people who feel the most

98
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,300
strongly about things turn out to be the most ignorant about those things, right? I like

99
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,300
to say it took me decades to learn how little I know. Well, that's a further issue because

100
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,380
the ignorance, the question of truth has to do with the reliability of the belief. And

101
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,380
so one of the things that really is very important to do is to distinguish between the truth

102
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,980
of what you believe and the evidence or the reasons that you're out for believing that.

103
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,220
I thought he was making a point about the reasons, the justification that we are for

104
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,860
believing something. You know, at the end of the day, especially when it comes to complicated

105
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,700
beliefs, beliefs that are not about perceptual things in the environment, the most important

106
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,340
thing you can aim for is not truth itself, but reasonable belief. What you want to do

107
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,260
is make sure that you believe things that are as close to the evidence that's available

108
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,260
to you as you can make them. And if you're lucky, that will also lead to true belief.

109
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,180
I think there's something so interesting about these sort of two perspectives because it really

110
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,260
sort of highlights the difference between philosophers' optimistic perspective and a

111
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,140
psychological empirical perspective that says, yes, maybe we can and should be bringing these

112
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:28,500
things closer together. But de facto, people have false confidence that is separate from

113
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,180
the reliability or the truth. I think it's that discrepancy that you're highlighting

114
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,420
that's so fascinating and that we can't, and that even knowing about that discrepancy doesn't

115
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,860
make us any less vulnerable to it.

116
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,860
It's because we can't imagine alternatives very easily.

117
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,860
But there's a very different difference between...

118
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:58,860
And having an idea of yourself, it seems to me if you come up with an idea, you are more

119
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,860
convinced of it than if you read something.

120
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,860
Here's the mic, Adam.

121
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,860
No?

122
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:18,860
I'm not sure that people are always sure of ideas because they came up with them.

123
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,860
I don't think that's amazing.

124
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:28,860
I think it's often it's the other way around that actually ideas come out of doubt.

125
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:35,860
But when we're talking, as we, the title, invited us to talk about fake knowledge and

126
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:42,860
knowing, then we're in a different territory.

127
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:50,860
When you could admit that what you're presenting is an idea of how the reasonable man or woman

128
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:59,060
or human should believe and should think. What we're presenting here is sort of the more

129
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,460
empirical of course, how people think they know.

130
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,460
Of course, it's a completely different thing from how they know.

131
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,460
We're completely agreed and there is, of course, a fascinating and it's an empirical question.

132
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,460
Philosophers, we're very good at sitting in our armchairs.

133
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,460
But we are very well aware of what the boundaries are of what you can get from the outcher.

134
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,460
If you're interested, as you say, in the psychology or the error-proneness of people in general,

135
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,460
then that's heavy empirical work and it needs to be...

136
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,460
It's actually very hard to do, I would think. People do it the base of these surveys,

137
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,460
which I find to be quite bad science a lot of the time.

138
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,460
But the key thing is to bring enough distinctions to bear when you're doing that empirical study

139
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,460
so that truth is not being run with reasonable opinion.

140
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,460
A cause of a belief is not being run with how it's maintained and so on and so forth.

141
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:59,460
I might offer cheap magic tricks as a way to think about both from a practical standpoint.

142
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,460
Namely, one thing I hear people doing is conflating and basically taking all knowledge

143
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,460
and conflating it into what's measurable and verbal.

144
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,460
But the moment you say that, chances are you're already in a cognitive context

145
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,460
and you've already dismissed physical information

146
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,460
and the way that a practitioner goes about crafting wood or writing a bicycle

147
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:28,460
or sharing knowledge in a spiritual community or in a psychological, you know, self-help group.

148
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,460
So basically, whether you want to call it mind, body and spirit, which is very out of vogue

149
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,460
or cognitive, you know, sensory motor and social,

150
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:44,460
certainly we have to account for different kinds of ways of knowing in these different kinds of information.

151
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:51,460
And I'm not including autonomic and automatic information that, you know, we can have the best idea in the world,

152
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,460
but if suddenly we have to go to the bathroom, we might not be able to express it to the group.

153
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,460
You know, so there's all these different kinds of information and it's important to think about

154
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,460
how we have those ideas and verify and confirm those ideas.

155
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:15,460
So one important distinction, I think, is between knowledge that's justified by understanding

156
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:20,460
the consequences of that knowledge as opposed to knowledge that's based on basic values,

157
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,460
protected values or sacred values.

158
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,460
So the motivating experiment for the study was one for the book,

159
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:35,460
was one done by Frank Kyle in which he asked people how well they understood basic common objects,

160
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,460
like ballpoint pens and people felt they had a sense how they were.

161
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,460
So he said, okay, how do they work? Explain in detail.

162
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,460
And actually people couldn't generate anything.

163
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,460
I mean, people had no idea how they were.

164
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:57,460
Most experiments were done with drawing and were they able to isolate the problem of 2D to 3D transfer?

165
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:03,460
Actually, there's a person sitting very close to us who's an expert in this about the way that the mind is able to take three-dimensional information.

166
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:10,460
So a friend of mine who's an art teacher, he said it's counterintuitive, but it's much easier for people to sculpt than to draw,

167
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,460
because there's less of a transfer going on.

168
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,460
So, and then also in those bicycle experiments, when they had to draw bikes, they might not have known where the handlebars are

169
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,460
in relationship to the pedals, but you could have also tested them by, for instance, just the practical problem of,

170
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,460
you know, are they able to fix a bike? Are they able to win a bike race?

171
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,460
When the chain's off, can they put it back on or not?

172
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,460
In other words, there's other ways that, and also if other people are, if they're on a bike race with other people,

173
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:44,460
I'm getting at the social, so I went through the physical, and then socially, you know, if other people's bikes are breaking down, do they care?

174
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:53,460
So you can go into the same territory, but look at very different issues, and if it's only being, you know, represented in a, like a one to seven scale,

175
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,460
you know, which is also kind of an abstract compared to people who work with their hands and do something practical.

176
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:12,460
I like to consider a specific case in which a perspective was held with strong support, and over a period of time, weakened.

177
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:25,460
So when I was a house officer at the Mass Metal Health Center in 1960, you couldn't get a job as chairman of the Department of Psychiatry unless you were a psychoanalyst.

178
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,460
This was the standard, particularly in the East Coast and the West Coast.

179
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,460
There were some places in between, they were still skeptical.

180
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,460
In psychoanalysis was the dominant mode.

181
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:46,460
You know, at Harvard, the general feeling was that the reason we were not treating hypertension asthma successfully,

182
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,460
a lot of the diseases for which there was no treatment at the time, was that these people needed analysis.

183
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,460
These were all psychosomatic illnesses.

184
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,460
And psychoanalysis was the rage in the United States.

185
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,460
It was the Chris Hartman-Lowenstein generation at that time.

186
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,460
You look at the same universe now, and no one talks about this.

187
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,460
You can't become a chairman of the Department of Psychiatry for your psychoanalyst.

188
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,460
You've got to be a geneticist or something like that, and justifiably so, I must say.

189
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:23,460
And yet it's amazing how this has lost the imagination of the scientific community.

190
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:31,460
So I think there is something like, you know, empirical knowledge, which is important in order to support the growth of a discipline.

191
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:37,460
And psychoanalysis lacked it sufficiently to continue to capture people's imagination.

192
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,460
But what I was saying that Danny didn't agree with my client.

193
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:53,460
What I was saying that he didn't agree with is that if a psychoanalyst said, I think that asthma is caused by some difficulty you have in your relationship with your mother.

194
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,460
He believed that.

195
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
Yeah.

196
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,460
He knows it.

197
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,460
So, grab a paper.

198
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,460
Somebody else told it to him.

199
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,460
He may question it more.

200
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,460
But if the idea occurs to him, it seems to have more of a power.

201
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,460
I mean, that's interesting because I would have thought it's almost backward.

202
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,460
That you believe in things because you believe in the people.

203
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,460
You trust and love the people who believe in the same thing.

204
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,460
So I don't think that you invented psychoanalysis for yourself.

205
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,460
I mean, you got it from somewhere.

206
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,460
And you got it from people you trusted.

207
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
This is true.

208
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:39,460
At Harvard, great at being had a tremendous influence on people in academic medicine.

209
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,460
And she would have tea for them once a week on Fridays.

210
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:51,460
And she would come over and she'd convince them that most of the patients that you're treating that don't respond to the therapies available have.

211
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,460
Or psychosomatic illnesses of various kinds.

212
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,460
And they would respond to psychoanalysis.

213
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,460
And the internists sent their patients into analysis.

214
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,460
And ten years later, they said nothing happened.

215
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,460
And boom.

216
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,460
Their reputation of psychoanalysis dropped spectacularly.

217
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,460
So there is an interaction between empirical data and theoretical speculation.

218
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,460
Yeah.

219
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,460
You know, but I...

220
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,460
Somebody said not disappear that fast.

221
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,460
No, no, not everything disappears.

222
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,460
But I must tell you, in my academic life, this is amazing the change.

223
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,460
Yeah.

224
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,460
Amazing it.

225
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,460
I just want to report an experience I had yesterday driving from Princeton.

226
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:37,460
There is a big sign that says Jesus lives beyond reasonable doubt.

227
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,460
It's not true.

228
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,460
I saw it.

229
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:56,460
But... so I agree that, you know, we rely enormously on what we call testimony.

230
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:03,460
So, instruction by others, you know, so much of what we believe, we believe because...

231
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,460
And I agree with Danny that, you know, often there's a...

232
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,460
If you're reading somebody listening to somebody very credentialed or reading something really credentialed,

233
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,460
and they say something, you might have much greater confidence in that

234
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
than if you came up with that on your own.

235
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,460
You didn't have the supporting evidence.

236
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,460
So... but there is an interesting question here about where things bottom out.

237
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,460
And there is the suggestion, and I think this seems to be part of the theme of your book that I haven't read it,

238
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,460
that somehow things bottom out in something called collective knowledge rather than individual knowledge.

239
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,460
And though that's a very important and interesting issue.

240
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,460
It has to be well defined.

241
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:44,460
But... so far, the fact that we rely on people, the fact that we rely for 90% of what we know on people, other people,

242
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:52,460
doesn't mean that things don't bottom out in some individual decision about who is trustworthy and who isn't.

243
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,460
Okay.

244
00:23:53,460 --> 00:24:00,460
At the end of the day, you have a lot of people clamoring for your attention, okay, and a lot of them are posing as experts.

245
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,460
You have to make a decision about who you are going to trust.

246
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:11,460
Now, of course, there is the actual role of empirical evidence which can come and smash up even the most...

247
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,460
I like empirical evidence.

248
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,460
That's very important.

249
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,460
But to the extent to which you are relying on people in your community,

250
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:25,460
there is a sense in which the fundamental contribution is still made by an individual judgement about who is to be trusted.

251
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:36,460
I have a question for Steve really about this, which is... we know empirically that we entertain false memories or connected memories

252
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,460
in our own mind that have nothing to do with other people.

253
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:45,460
Seeing Eric here, I saw Eric last week, I'm going to associate those events and create a rich kind of network of memories

254
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,460
without relying on anybody else's knowledge.

255
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Do you think that that mechanism, that that process that happens in an individual's experience is the basis

256
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,460
and the same kind of process that happens when it's other people,

257
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:06,460
or do you really think that the collective knowledge socially is a completely different kind of beast?

258
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:17,460
So, Danny wrote a book about two kinds of thinking, and I actually think that you're pointing to exactly the difference

259
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,460
between those two kinds of thinking, right?

260
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:27,460
So, on one hand, we have these intuitions which come very quickly and naturally, and our brain clearly produces those.

261
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,460
I mean, those are internal. Those are properties of our heads.

262
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,460
When I say we think as a community, I'm referring to a deliberative process, right?

263
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,460
I love the word deliberation because it has these two meanings.

264
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:47,460
One meaning is that we're thinking things through slowly, but the more common meaning is the sense of a jury

265
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,460
deliberating, right? A group of people.

266
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:56,460
So, I would argue that right now there are thoughts that are being produced by this group of people collaboratively

267
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,460
that no individual brain would be able to produce.

268
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:07,460
And even in the domain of memory, right, our memories are shaped by our schema as any good cognitive psychologist knows.

269
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,460
And those schema are social entities, I think, to a large degree.

270
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:18,460
I'm struck with the fact that in this context, you know, the New York Psycho-Atlantic Institute,

271
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:23,460
1940, the highest of the high, we're having this kind of discussion.

272
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:32,460
It seems to me the more appropriate discussion for the Atlantic Institute is why didn't we try to base this on an empirical level?

273
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:40,460
Why didn't we go to the trouble as, in fact, the American Psycho-Analysts before the European Evasion of Arpurn, Chris and Lowensley were about to do,

274
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,460
Larry, Cuba, et cetera, to try to test some of these ideas?

275
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:52,460
How come psychoanalysis has been so ineffective in trying to test these ideas in a more rigorous way?

276
00:26:52,460 --> 00:27:00,460
Why isn't an imaging facility associated with every analytic institute, why isn't there a full-time research program associated with each institute?

277
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:07,460
Here a great institute, like the New York Psycho-Analysts Institute, doesn't have a full-time research effort going on.

278
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:20,460
I spoke here about ten years ago and I made a comment like this and he said, you must realize every person who's trained here must spend at least two hours a week learning about imaging.

279
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:29,460
But you know what, they can learn in two hours a week about imaging, but I know about Greek philosophy, even less.

280
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,460
Yes, well, I'm asking you.

281
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,460
This three of us are collecting data on this issue.

282
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,460
Knowledge in the concrete context.

283
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:46,460
I'm not here as a representative of the New York Psycho-Analysts, so I can't answer it as the way New York Psycho-Analytics would do,

284
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:54,460
but I would say that 30 years ago, nobody would have invited you to give you a talk to the ten years ago.

285
00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:06,460
Because 30 years ago, there was a conviction that what we thought and how we saw our theory explained everything, or at least explained the problems we were talking about.

286
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,460
I didn't for a moment, 30 years ago think so.

287
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,460
Who didn't?

288
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,460
I didn't.

289
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,460
No, I'm sure you didn't.

290
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,460
I'm not sure.

291
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
I'm not sure.

292
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,460
I'm not sure.

293
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,460
So what we did was we did the psychoanalysts.

294
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:29,460
So when I was training here, there was no question that what the teachers told us, and then we developed our connected ideas about that, that we had a lot of answers.

295
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,460
And that's how we work with the patients.

296
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:42,460
I think the question for psychoanalysis that is relevant is if some of that knowledge, some of that those findings from Freud on,

297
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,220
what Freud said came from his head. There was no...

298
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:45,940
Most of it.

299
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,860
Right.

300
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,380
So, if that wasn't right,

301
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,860
or if that now is proven to not fit the data,

302
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,340
how come our patients are doing well?

303
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,460
Psychoanalysis has helped a lot of patients.

304
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,540
So, what is it that makes it,

305
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,740
and that's the question I have for myself,

306
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,020
is what is the therapeutic action of what we do?

307
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,860
It's not...

308
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,700
You don't know that.

309
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,540
No.

310
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,060
You don't know what is related to interpretation.

311
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,700
You don't know whether it's just being present with a person.

312
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,140
I mean, there are so many variables that are involved here.

313
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,780
You know...

314
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,580
But it's certainly...

315
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,660
Mary and Rudolph Goldberg are always telling me recently

316
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,020
she's trying out a situation which, in an analytic situation,

317
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,500
rather than sitting behind the patient,

318
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,540
she's sitting in front of the patient.

319
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,460
Finds it in some circumstance, it works better.

320
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,980
There's so many things that haven't been looked at.

321
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,460
It's a surprisingly...

322
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,860
unquestioning field.

323
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,860
Aren't you flogging a dead horse here?

324
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,700
I'm sorry.

325
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,620
Aren't you flogging a dead horse?

326
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,380
I mean, haven't we all moved on to that?

327
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,620
Well, maybe it can be resuscitated if we rethink it.

328
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,100
But I think we learn a great deal

329
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,780
by seeing why did people turn away from that?

330
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,020
Why did they do what was clear to so many of us?

331
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,220
And that is to ask them direct questions.

332
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:09,340
I think, Eric, there is a certain arrogance of scientists

333
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:14,260
that the scientific way to know is the only way.

334
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,660
There is evidence, and then you know the truth.

335
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,780
I happen to be a scientist, so I share that.

336
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:25,620
We should know that the concept of knowing is contested.

337
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,020
There are many people who know that Jesus lives

338
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,180
beyond a reasonable doubt.

339
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,260
And so there are just other ways.

340
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,540
There is revelation and transmission

341
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,060
and many other ways of knowing.

342
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,100
And science is one religion.

343
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,700
I happen to be part of it.

344
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,140
But we should really not...

345
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,060
But don't you think one of our functions

346
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,540
is to help people see and what circumstances.

347
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,380
Science might be helpful to moving them further.

348
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,140
I mean, certainly the science...

349
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,220
So you have Eric coming along and saying,

350
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,260
I've discovered cognitive behavior therapy.

351
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,740
It's so much more useful in these circumstances.

352
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,500
Why not do a systematic study to see

353
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,860
in what circumstances cognitive behavior?

354
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,420
I mean, you're not asking me because, of course, I agree with you.

355
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,740
At the point, I think...

356
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,820
LAUGHTER

357
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,140
The point?

358
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,740
I mean...

359
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,860
That's it. That's it.

360
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,140
It's not.

361
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,660
Because most people know things differently,

362
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,100
and they think they know.

363
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,300
How far is this?

364
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,980
As academics.

365
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,340
Is to help people see...

366
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:34,900
I mean, you're not...

367
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,260
What is the better way to go?

368
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,660
What I'm suggesting, actually,

369
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:44,980
is that if the function of academics is to convince people

370
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,060
of the value of science and to help them see the value of science,

371
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,020
then it would be a good idea to have some empathy

372
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,060
for what people think they know now

373
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,980
in different ways of know.

374
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,180
We have to start from an attempt to understand

375
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,980
and to empathize with other ways of knowing.

376
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,540
I'd add to that, it's great, I think what you're saying,

377
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,140
if I'm understanding correctly, is A, have empathy for that,

378
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,460
but also have a scientific understanding

379
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,820
of what gives us that subjective feeling of knowledge.

380
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,580
Absolutely. And how to help people

381
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,300
move from their current position to another one.

382
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,060
So this is a topic close to my heart.

383
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,540
I wrote a book some 10 years ago called Fear of Knowledge,

384
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,100
which discusses...

385
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,660
Fear of what?

386
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,700
Fear of knowledge.

387
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,180
Knowledge. Fear of knowledge.

388
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,380
LAUGHTER

389
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,820
Fear of knowledge.

390
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,260
Which was precisely about, so you just said something.

391
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,780
You did actually a classic maneuver,

392
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,860
which you said something extremely radical.

393
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,980
And then you backpedaled to something much more innocuous

394
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,100
that everybody could accept.

395
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,900
And Stanley Fish, by the way, does exactly the same thing.

396
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,820
I wouldn't have thought you would be in that company.

397
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,380
But the radical remark is science is just one religion among many.

398
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,780
OK. This is an amazing thing.

399
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,700
OK. It's not even ultimately a coherent view,

400
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,380
because if you say, well, you know, I happen to be a scientist,

401
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,820
you know, that's my favorite method.

402
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,100
But other people have other methods.

403
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,140
For instance, they use tea leaves,

404
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,740
or they use alleged divine revelation,

405
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,860
and so forth to find out what's true.

406
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,420
That's, of course, perfectly fine.

407
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,180
That's their method.

408
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,620
I mean, did I say that's perfectly fine?

409
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,140
Well, you said science.

410
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,140
You said science.

411
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,700
You said science.

412
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,300
I did not imply.

413
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,620
Science is one religion among many.

414
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,220
Yes.

415
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,820
Yes, I did say that.

416
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:38,100
The way we treat religions, because we don't treat them

417
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,900
necessarily as a source of truth, is we say people

418
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,620
are entitled to their faith, to their religious beliefs.

419
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,620
OK.

420
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,540
I, OK.

421
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,580
The innocuous remark is, no, look.

422
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,300
Of course, this is a privileged way of figuring out

423
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,100
what's true.

424
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,860
But in order to bring other people around,

425
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,900
you have to have empathy.

426
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,220
You have to understand what shoes they're walking in.

427
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:04,580
You have to see something essential, which

428
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,620
is that from the point of view of somebody

429
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,140
who doesn't believe in science, and that's

430
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:13,220
at least 30% of Americans, if not more,

431
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,980
from their point of view, science is just another religion.

432
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,420
And it's useful to understand that when we are talking

433
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:24,860
to people who do not share our basic beliefs about what

434
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,500
is true and how to acquire truth, we better

435
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,540
try to understand who we're talking to.

436
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,220
Empathy is no question.

437
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,340
But leveling it all out by saying it's just one religion.

438
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,860
No, I mean, I wasn't leveling it all out.

439
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,420
I was really trying to tell you that there

440
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,020
is another perspective.

441
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,620
Of course, there's no other perspective.

442
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,300
Other perspective, science is a religion.

443
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,060
Like, no.

444
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,060
No.

445
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,060
No.

446
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,060
No.

447
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,260
What is the definition of that?

448
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,900
A miracle.

449
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,180
And science, what definition is a miracle.

450
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,300
It's a system of belief.

451
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,900
But there are different systems of belief.

452
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,260
I keep expecting you to ask them to explain this.

453
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,260
Yes.

454
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,060
That's right.

455
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,860
It's a strong belief.

456
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,700
It's too much fun.

457
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,900
And I doubt that they could.

458
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,100
But humans aren't the only species

459
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,220
that have false confidence and false knowledge.

460
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,900
So we have to also take into account

461
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,180
that much of this is probably emerging

462
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,380
from basic biological mechanisms.

463
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,900
We see you can get animals to have false confidence

464
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,180
and false beliefs as well.

465
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,700
I don't know how much is known about the social sharing

466
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,900
of knowledge.

467
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,500
But certainly, there are studies showing

468
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,340
these sort of phenomena emerge in non-humans as well.

469
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,540
I think that's a really important aspect

470
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,180
in terms of understanding what I think,

471
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,220
partly what you were referring to,

472
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,660
is the physical and biological manifestations and mechanisms.

473
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,100
And there's a big danger there if you

474
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,740
take the rational context of, I have rational information,

475
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,540
so I'm going to understand that.

476
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,020
The most beautiful way I ever heard this expressed,

477
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,820
I spent a lot of time talking to Gerald Edelman

478
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,340
about selective systems in nature.

479
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,900
And we believe it or not, we compared.

480
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,420
He first talked about his mind theory.

481
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,420
But I said, can we go back to something empirical?

482
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,980
And can we go to your work on immune response?

483
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,660
Because he had found the structure of the antibody.

484
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,260
And so we had these great talks about comparing a magician

485
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,900
and his audience doing tricks that could adapt, not stage tricks,

486
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,180
but tricks where you're adapting very quickly,

487
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,020
almost like three card monty on the street.

488
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,620
So there's a very feedback and feedback for the response.

489
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,780
So I was trying to explain this concept of selective processes

490
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,900
in nature and at a Mind Science Foundation conference.

491
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,940
And there's a philosopher and a cognitive psychologist.

492
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,220
And it wasn't happening.

493
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,380
And then a wonderful woman, the Secretary of the Mind Science

494
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,340
Foundation, she came by and I said,

495
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,660
well, let's put it in terms of nightclubs.

496
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,820
So this is getting into how does this information

497
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,220
get specific, right?

498
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,860
So if you're thinking about, does it have to be rational?

499
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,380
So I said, well, let's think about nightclubs

500
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,980
because at the time I was working at a big nightclub in New York.

501
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,980
And I said, so if you walked into nightclubs,

502
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,220
she was in her 20s.

503
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,500
And I said, if you walked into a nightclub, you'd ignore me.

504
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,340
And she said, no.

505
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,220
I'd find out if you were an owner or a friend of the owner.

506
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,180
And if you weren't, then I'd ignore you.

507
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,660
So I said, OK, this is the level of reality I want to address.

508
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,540
So then I tried to explain this idea of selection

509
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,260
of the selection of processes in nature.

510
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,860
And she said, it's so obvious what he's saying.

511
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,180
And the other people got it.

512
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,020
What are you talking about?

513
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,740
Because they kept on trying to fit it into a rational construct.

514
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,300
And she said, listen, when I go to a nightclub

515
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,780
at the beginning of the night, I know exactly who I'm looking

516
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,060
for.

517
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,700
I'm looking for Mr. Wright.

518
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,460
But by the end of the night, when it's closing time,

519
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,820
I'm looking for Mr. Wright now.

520
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:53,380
And all he's saying is that nature can never choose.

521
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,540
It can't deliberate.

522
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,140
It can only select, in terms of natural selection.

523
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,180
She didn't say that a minute, a minute.

524
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,020
The Mr. Wright now.

525
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,780
So once we shift from these areas of cognitive constructs,

526
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,820
of cognitive information, and go to this animal stuff,

527
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,220
it's good to think about ourselves in different contexts

528
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,300
where we can appreciate selective processes

529
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,940
and nature a little more easily.

530
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,860
Yeah, no, I'm sure that's right.

531
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,660
But I do think that there's a special status

532
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,180
given to certain kinds of constructs

533
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,340
that only humans are capable of.

534
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,340
Yvall Harari has this great thought experiment.

535
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,380
He asks you to imagine 50,000 chimpanzees

536
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,940
sitting in the stadium watching a soccer match.

537
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,540
Pure chaos, right?

538
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,660
Complete chaos.

539
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,140
You'd have animals jumping all over each other.

540
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,980
There's something that humans are capable of.

541
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,820
There's a way that humans can interact with other humans

542
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,340
that no other, I'll go this far,

543
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,700
that no other cognitive mechanism is capable of.

544
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,460
My joke, my quick response is I say,

545
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,380
we've come into a point in society

546
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,340
where we really believe that Mr. Spock must run the enterprise.

547
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,700
And in, because in other words,

548
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,780
the sense of reason must lead.

549
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,380
And then we forget the reason why a morality play

550
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,900
called Star Trek was written

551
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,100
to show the importance of our humanity.

552
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,540
So all I'm saying is it's really, it's,

553
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,540
I was not saying that we are led by reason.

554
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,260
I was saying that we are able to collaborate

555
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,940
as a group, as a community,

556
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,460
in a way that no other cognitive systems can.

557
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,540
That's the claim.

558
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,380
So one thing we can do is share each other's intentionality.

559
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,820
And Mike Thomasella has great arguments

560
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,460
showing that no other animal, no other machine

561
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,460
is capable of sharing intentionality with others.

562
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,820
And that is the whole Captain Kirk point, right?

563
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,660
If you can build a collective group

564
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,540
that can do things beyond individual capacity.

565
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,860
Steve, I had a question.

566
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,140
When you wrote your book, I'm sure, before Trump's election.

567
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:00,980
Yes.

568
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,420
The idea of a community,

569
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,540
could there be two communities that do not communicate

570
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,380
with each other?

571
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,100
I mean, would you be writing the same book today?

572
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,100
Oh, well, I'd have a lot more examples

573
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,380
if I were writing it today.

574
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,220
But yes, the ideas would be the same.

575
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,940
So one of our ideas is this notion

576
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,460
of contagious understanding, right?

577
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,020
We run experiments showing that when other people

578
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,820
feel they understand, then you feel you understand more, right?

579
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,700
Understanding's a bit like a disease.

580
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,340
It's sort of, it's contagious.

581
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,900
And as a result of that, you can have ideological communities

582
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,500
where individuals think they understand

583
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,180
because the people around them understand,

584
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,540
but everybody else understands

585
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,460
because the people around them understand

586
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,840
and there's no actual understanding.

587
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,180
So when you have that kind of dynamic,

588
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,540
you can certainly have multiple different

589
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,220
ideological communities arising, right?

590
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,140
Absolutely.

591
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,580
I mean, there are a lot of questions

592
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,580
about what forms your community

593
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,460
and presumably we're all members of multiple communities

594
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,300
and there's an asking of...

595
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,620
You call them communities of knowledge?

596
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,460
Yeah.

597
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,380
You don't like that?

598
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,300
No, no one.

599
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,220
I like it a lot.

600
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,980
But you're using the word knowledge in a very different way

601
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,700
than it's being used by others.

602
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,700
If those are communities of knowledge.

603
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,260
That's one thing worth mentioning

604
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,660
just in order to calibrate the terminology.

605
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,300
So typically we use words like knowing,

606
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,620
understanding,

607
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,180
and factive senses so that when you know

608
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,740
what you know has to be true

609
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,340
and when you understand what you understand,

610
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,820
you really understand the principles

611
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,940
by which the thing works.

612
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,980
I think you just identified the difference

613
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,620
between philosophers and psychosocialists.

614
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,980
No, but you know, this really ought not to be

615
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,060
because this is terminology.

616
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,660
Unless you get, you just agree on the terminology,

617
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,300
we'll just end up confusing one another.

618
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,140
So this is...

619
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,580
I mean, you're talking about knowing

620
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,580
and we psychologists are talking about

621
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,900
feeling that you know.

622
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,820
Well, that's it.

623
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,260
So you see that in his little speech

624
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,220
just now, I don't mean to be the semantic police here,

625
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,940
but in the speech, there was constant sliding

626
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,420
between feeling you understand and understanding.

627
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,020
So is understanding contagious

628
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,060
or is the feeling of understanding contagious?

629
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,100
What you showed is the feeling of understanding

630
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,100
is contagious because you then wanted to say

631
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,740
there was no real understanding.

632
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,580
That's true.

633
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,940
I think this explains why biologists

634
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,820
so often take a reductionist approach.

635
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,660
Why so much of the genetic code

636
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,060
was worked out on simple animals

637
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,420
because I could do the experiment today,

638
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,660
show you the results and you can replicate it tomorrow.

639
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,060
So there is a level of science in certain areas

640
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,780
in which we can show each other exactly what we do.

641
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,540
The procedure is straightforward

642
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:50,500
and anyone else can do it and get very much the same result.

643
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
So that has to be distinguished

644
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,620
from the kinds of philosophical speculations

645
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,980
we're talking about in which you can have your belief

646
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,820
and I have my belief

647
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,580
and we don't necessarily have to have coincidence of that.

648
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,660
But there is hard science that is a prototype

649
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,780
of what ultimately wants to accomplish

650
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,260
in a number of different areas.

651
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,180
But I think Steve's book, for example,

652
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,420
is based on that sort of hard science

653
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,180
about human subjective sense of knowing.

654
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,180
Right.

655
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,900
Series of studies replicated

656
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,540
and it's not molecular science,

657
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,740
it's behavioral science.

658
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:26,740
With the same things working for it.

659
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,220
And it seems like, I've reduced to say in other meanings

660
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,260
that this book is especially important

661
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,940
for cognitive psychologists that can get information.

662
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,420
Like I'm thinking the historical note of when

663
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,540
Oricneizer was trying to reframe cognitive psychology

664
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,740
and kind of misunderstood,

665
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,020
but he specifically brought up this kind of physical information

666
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:54,180
as described by the Gibson's and social schematas

667
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,220
as described by Frederick Bartlett.

668
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,220
And it seems like you go into a similar territory

669
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,340
and remind people that you need to open it up

670
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,060
from just the pure cognitive.

671
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,260
So one of the ideas is that as human beings

672
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,020
we're foragers for knowledge

673
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,180
and we don't retain a lot of it in our brains.

674
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,140
We retain some of it in our bodies.

675
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,540
We use the world all the time, right?

676
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,660
Like I don't know exactly where that bottle of water is,

677
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,260
but I can look and see and reach for it.

678
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,060
But more than anything, we use other people.

679
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,980
And these days of course we use Google,

680
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,960
which is a great source of knowledge.

681
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,260
So this notion of embodiment,

682
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,100
which I think you're referring to, right?

683
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,260
That we use our bodies as part of the process of thought.

684
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,460
We're sort of trying to generalize that to say

685
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:40,700
we use other people as part of the process of thought as well.

686
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,980
Let me make this a little bit more concrete.

687
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,980
So we have these gifted people all around here.

688
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,660
I'm gonna give you a task.

689
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,660
If we wanna put psychoanalysis,

690
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,820
psychoanalysis theory on an empirical basis,

691
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,900
how would we proceed?

692
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,060
What would you suggest to the first steps?

693
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,740
Then if you want to do it?

694
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,900
I don't want to do that.

695
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,740
Yeah, I know.

696
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,580
I know.

697
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,420
I know.

698
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,740
I know.

699
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,060
Thank you.

700
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,820
You didn't know about price to it.

701
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,660
I know.

702
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,500
I know.

703
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,340
I know.

704
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,180
I know.

705
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,020
I know.

706
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,780
I didn't get to know about price per se.

707
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,100
You just wanted to do that.

708
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,380
You gotta do it what he did.

709
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,780
Selection is a point.

710
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,420
Yes.

711
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,620
People have tried, right?

712
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,140
I mean, there are all sorts of studies

713
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,940
looking at the effectiveness of psychoanalytic theory,

714
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,820
of psychoanalysis.

715
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,100
There are relatively few,

716
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,900
when you consider how long the theory has been around,

717
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,380
that they've been competing theories

718
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,620
that have been surprisingly few.

719
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,460
Okay.

720
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,900
Do you have an idea?

721
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,340
Like a step by step, like the next 10 years?

722
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,740
I do, you gotta have to think it through.

723
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,180
But just for example,

724
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,740
under what circumstances is cognitive behavior therapy,

725
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,540
more advantageous compared to analytic therapy,

726
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,420
that's something that's easily,

727
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,220
I would easily stupid word,

728
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,180
but should be possible to say.

729
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,540
It has been studied.

730
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,380
Yeah, it has been studied.

731
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,380
Not extensively, not in a minute.

732
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,820
Enough to show that one is far superior to the other.

733
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:11,820
I'd like to say something that perhaps is completely obvious

734
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,380
here, right?

735
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,220
Which is that, and several of you have said

736
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,420
in many contexts before,

737
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,460
but might be worth reminding ourselves,

738
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,100
which is, and it really comes from the perspective

739
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,620
of this thinking about, you know,

740
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,140
as everybody does, but my own work on memory,

741
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,100
and how we have to use memories

742
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,380
to guide our behavior all the time.

743
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,980
We have to make fast decisions all the time,

744
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,300
and that sense of confidence,

745
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,620
the subjective sense of knowing that we know something,

746
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,820
regardless of how that's influenced by other people,

747
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,220
we couldn't act without that, right?

748
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,380
This is, it's not like it's in our way,

749
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,380
and just leading us to make mistakes,

750
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:53,620
and really, you know, in the spirit of Danny and Amos's work.

751
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:57,260
This is a fundamental necessity for survival,

752
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,300
is that subjective sense of belief,

753
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,100
and without too much deliberation, right?

754
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,780
So, you know, in many ways,

755
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,500
it's framed here as sort of something that's an illusion,

756
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,020
but it's an illusion that serves us very well.

757
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,260
The illusion of knowledge that we don't,

758
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:18,300
we can't possibly always know in depth everything

759
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,340
we think we need to know to act.

760
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,060
I mean, a fundamental psychological result, I think,

761
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,380
is that the experience of knowing it the same,

762
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,820
whether your knowledge is true or not.

763
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,780
So, and you know, what we are concerned with here,

764
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,860
is the experience of knowledge, of knowing,

765
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,460
and it's a powerful experience associated

766
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,900
with a powerful sense of confidence,

767
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,900
and the fact that it doesn't necessarily correlate

768
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,980
with truth is a very, very important fact,

769
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,900
that we are taking as a fact.

770
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,140
So, I don't think there is terminology for confusion.

771
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,460
I think we're really arguing about knowing as a state of mind,

772
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,700
which, you know, can be in reality something else,

773
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,820
and it can be connected or disconnected from reality.

774
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,700
Well, I'm offending you.

775
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,140
No, no, look, it's, it's,

776
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,860
we can agree on the terminology is easy to agree on.

777
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,100
I mean, put it this way.

778
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,860
So, the way we usually think is knowing consists in part

779
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,820
of the subjective aspect, which is believing with confidence

780
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,780
and backed up probably by some reasons.

781
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,540
And then the truth component, which is something we,

782
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,620
is not in our head, and either obtains or doesn't obtain.

783
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,260
So, from a psychological point of view,

784
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,940
though this is contested in some portals,

785
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,420
but we can surely agree on this,

786
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,300
what matters for the explanation of behavior

787
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,500
is the strongly held belief,

788
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,340
the belief held with confidence, that's it,

789
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,020
whether it actually has the real dyadic relational aspect

790
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,220
or the truth or not, won't matter to how you behave.

791
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,940
And so that's, but we can reserve the term knowing

792
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,260
for something that has the truth component,

793
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,020
and reserve the term reasonable or strongly held belief

794
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,580
for the state of mind.

795
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,380
Well, when you're at a restaurant and ordering from a menu,

796
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,420
you're not gonna say, I'll have the spaghetti

797
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,300
because I have some reasonably, you know,

798
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,860
reasonable suspicion that that may be better.

799
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,460
And you'll respond quickly and you'll place your order.

800
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,820
That's a preference rather than a belief.

801
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:28,860
I mean, it's a belief about the outcome of the choice.

802
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,100
You do think, well, what is going to satisfy me at this moment

803
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,860
and then you make a selection based on that?

804
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,500
So that's based on reasons.

805
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,140
That's a belief about your own, what will make you happy.

806
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:40,980
Yes.

807
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,660
I think it's very similar in many ways,

808
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,180
in the sense that you're making a prediction

809
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,140
about the future based on something you're feeling,

810
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,340
but you feel strongly about it,

811
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:51,980
even though it's almost by definition kind of based on

812
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,820
reasons.

813
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,020
I don't see any dispute here.

814
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,100
Okay.

815
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,740
I tell you what is interesting is there's something that,

816
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,140
well, I'd, I'd turn.

817
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:02,540
Well, let me just quickly make a point that may be obvious.

818
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,460
You know, if I'm at a restaurant,

819
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,460
often what I do is ask the waitress or the waiter,

820
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,500
would you take the spaghetti?

821
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,140
And if they say yes, then I'll go with it.

822
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,100
And in general,

823
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:20,100
in general, I think many of our, many of our decisions

824
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,060
are made out of habit and many of our decisions are made

825
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,580
because, you know, I was at a faculty meeting recently

826
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:30,060
and we were deciding whether to promote someone.

827
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,260
And this colleague of mine said, you know,

828
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,820
I didn't think this person should be promoted.

829
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,140
I was right on the knife set.

830
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,180
So I sat there and waited to see how other people voted.

831
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,460
And I just went with the majority.

832
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,420
And I actually think people do that all the time, right?

833
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,660
Is this the norm?

834
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,580
Is this what people do in this situation?

835
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,860
That's the question we often ask ourselves.

836
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,220
And so often we don't have reasons.

837
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:58,340
Our reason is this is what the community's doing.

838
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,180
Well, not to reason.

839
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,180
But the big difference with your colleague

840
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,020
is that your colleague knew they didn't know.

841
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:06,460
And right in many ways, that's one of the most interesting

842
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,420
phenomena is when people think they know and don't, right?

843
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,620
As, you know, now quoting you to you.

844
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:16,740
And implicit in what you're saying, I think,

845
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,580
is trust in the community.

846
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,540
But, you know, I can't help looking around.

847
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,900
And there are communities that are not talking to each other.

848
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,700
And they're at equal level of self-confidence.

849
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,100
But communication is broken down.

850
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,020
So there is no community of knowledge.

851
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,140
And there is, you know, science is not

852
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:43,460
universally accepted.

853
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,460
And we're all living in communities of knowledge.

854
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,540
It's just that there's more than one of them, right?

855
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,460
I look around.

856
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:52,860
I look to scientists and experts and people in this room.

857
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,260
And there are other people in America who look elsewhere.

858
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,380
It's actually an interesting question where they look,

859
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,820
because it's not at all obvious.

860
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,620
You've had another point you wanted to make.

861
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:11,500
I wanted to draw you out on this idea that exactly what

862
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,660
the dependence is on the community in knowing or thinking.

863
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:22,660
Because, again, there is one fairly familiar description

864
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,620
of that that we started out with, where we rely on other people's

865
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,060
knowledge.

866
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,260
We accept what they say.

867
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,860
We accept what they say.

868
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,140
It's an interesting question on what basis.

869
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,540
But in an ideal situation, you would

870
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,620
have some reason for trusting that source

871
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:40,180
and trusted for that reason, except what they have to say.

872
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:48,260
But you wanted something that's more a sexier thesis,

873
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,060
that somehow the thinking itself is distributed.

874
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:54,540
The thinking process is communally distributed.

875
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,260
Did I understand you correctly?

876
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,540
The reasoning is distributed.

877
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,140
Now, that's a very, I mean, the picture I described,

878
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,740
we're individuals, we're reasoning for ourselves.

879
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:06,580
Sometimes we outsource because we don't know everything

880
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,420
we want to rely on.

881
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,740
Other people's thinking.

882
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,700
But that thinking itself is conceived of

883
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,820
as an individualistic thing, which may have been borrowed

884
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,460
from others.

885
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,100
But what is this idea of a distributed thinking?

886
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:21,900
So the idea comes, essentially, from a colleague of yours,

887
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,420
Hillary Putnam, the philosopher, who talked about this

888
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,460
in the domain of language.

889
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,180
And he pointed out, often we use words,

890
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,620
even though we don't know what they mean.

891
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,900
So I might say something like, I hope one day to see

892
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,060
a piece of molybdenum.

893
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,460
And that's a perfectly good sentence, right?

894
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,380
Even though I have no idea what molybdenum is.

895
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,260
I just believe there are experts in the community

896
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:48,300
who could identify this.

897
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,540
And I think we use words like that all the time, organic.

898
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,220
What does it, this apple is organic.

899
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,700
What does that really mean?

900
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,580
It means that we think there are people out there too.

901
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,580
Right?

902
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:03,540
You could identify some lack of something.

903
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,140
So it's more expensive.

904
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,260
It just works better.

905
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,020
That's true.

906
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:12,340
But that seems to fit with the less sexy model,

907
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,740
you see, because that's a case where what I am doing

908
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,020
is I am deferring to a bunch of experts who really

909
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,620
have criteria for identifying molybdenum

910
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,060
or organic or something.

911
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:24,540
And according to him, the way the attribution of concepts

912
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,540
works in the community is provided

913
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,220
you are willing to defer to these experts.

914
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,340
We attribute to you the full concept that they have.

915
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,060
Not the full understanding of that concept,

916
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,940
but the concept itself.

917
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,140
But that looks like it's not as though my reasoning

918
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,500
is distributed over theirs, but rather I get to say

919
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,980
I am nolybdenum, but I am nolybdenum because I defer.

920
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,460
But you wanted something else.

921
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:49,180
Look, I think I'm mostly happy with that.

922
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,820
And if it's not sexy then, no, I'm not sexy.

923
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,700
What can I say?

924
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,140
But I do think that there's a division of cognitive labor.

925
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,740
So whenever we do almost anything,

926
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:03,060
including crossing the street, there

927
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:06,580
are different jobs that are associated with different people.

928
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:09,900
And our perspective and our knowledge base is tiny.

929
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,340
And yet things get done.

930
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:16,140
We build communities like psychoanalytic communities,

931
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,300
and we build iPhones, and we get to the moon

932
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,380
because there's a lot of different expertise that's

933
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,100
brought to bear on all the things that we do.

934
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,180
So that's really the idea.

935
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:29,540
And it would be useful to think about people like craftspeople

936
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,260
in addition to people that work on ideas and groups,

937
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,700
like even specific laboratory techniques

938
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,580
or specific music techniques.

939
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:42,140
Or because I spent five years with a great master

940
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,580
and the physical misdirection.

941
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,140
And there was no way to learn those ideas quickly.

942
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,500
And now what's really strange is because of YouTube,

943
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,820
people assume that they can learn that kind of physical stuff

944
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,780
faster.

945
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:56,940
And it actually did take five years of rigorous training.

946
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,900
And then several years just contemplating that.

947
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,540
So it seems like there's different levels

948
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,580
of those communities of knowledge.

949
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:09,540
And it seems like you could, as you did in the book,

950
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,700
but there's also you could find more extremes.

951
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:17,180
One of my favorite examples is a guy, George Bassaco,

952
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,260
who's been on previous panels, who

953
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,260
is a master panel conservator at the Met.

954
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,420
And he did a 12-year apprenticeship

955
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,060
under very interesting circumstances.

956
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:29,860
And the knowledge that he has is just extraordinary.

957
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,700
His sense, a whole sense of time has changed.

958
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,580
I'm dying to see an example.

959
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,340
One quick example?

960
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,420
Oh, he is.

961
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:41,940
All right.

962
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,020
A quick turn.

963
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:43,940
All right.

964
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,540
We have a little paper bag here.

965
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:50,380
So the idea is, how do we confirm ideas

966
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,540
that when we're talking together,

967
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,860
just like we're talking right now,

968
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,980
we confirm or not confirm ideas that we're sharing.

969
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,900
But when we're in a physical space,

970
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,340
we actually start, oh, have a few?

971
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,180
That's right.

972
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,140
Ah.

973
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,820
So I just wanted to teach you a quick magic trick

974
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,820
so that you can feel these different ways of confirming.

975
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:14,060
So specifically, I'll be focusing on not the ideas

976
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,900
as we're confirming and not confirming here,

977
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,740
but just a simple physical exercise.

978
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:26,540
So the simple idea, this will look strange from certain angles,

979
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,900
but we're, so I'm going to explain it,

980
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,620
and then I'd love you to try it.

981
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:35,180
The idea, so in any magic trick, there

982
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,580
is basically a causal pattern that we want the audience to see

983
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,540
and a causal pattern that we don't want the audience to see.

984
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,060
And they might be apparent.

985
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,860
They might be real.

986
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,540
And because they're not all real,

987
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,900
that means we can shift time in very interesting ways.

988
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,820
So this is such a little experiment,

989
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,380
and I'm going to expose this trick completely.

990
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,260
It's a great clown trick, and it's something

991
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:00,500
you can all do for your friends and relatives.

992
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,020
You snap.

993
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,300
If you can snap, it's easier.

994
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,420
I can show you a method without that.

995
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,620
And just wait one second.

996
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,660
So what we're going to do is take a ball,

997
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:12,180
throw it into the air, and catch the ball.

998
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,740
So the whole idea is that we throw it up,

999
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,140
but it's stand up quickly so you can.

1000
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,140
OK.

1001
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,140
OK.

1002
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,140
Like this?

1003
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,140
Like that?

1004
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,140
And.

1005
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,140
And like this?

1006
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,140
Right?

1007
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,140
Or like this?

1008
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,140
Or you can do it.

1009
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,140
And if you can.

1010
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,140
OK.

1011
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,140
And I really, I just try to get that.

1012
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,140
Right.

1013
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:38,140
So just try that for about 30 seconds, and try to catch the ball.

1014
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:45,140
In the bag so that it looks and feels right.

1015
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,140
I can't get a good snap.

1016
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,140
You can.

1017
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,140
I don't think I'm going to do this for a while.

1018
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,140
Sorry.

1019
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,140
You don't snap?

1020
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,140
OK.

1021
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:52,140
Sorry.

1022
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,140
I'm not.

1023
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,140
I'm not.

1024
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,140
I'm not.

1025
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,140
I'm not.

1026
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,140
I'm not.

1027
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,140
I'm not.

1028
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,140
I'm not.

1029
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,140
I'm not.

1030
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,140
I'm not.

1031
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,140
I'm not.

1032
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,140
I'm not.

1033
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,140
I'm not.

1034
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,140
I'm not.

1035
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,140
I'm not.

1036
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,140
I'm not.

1037
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,140
I'm not going to do this.

1038
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,140
You're feeling.

1039
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,140
You been it.

1040
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,140
That's good.

1041
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,140
That's that's good.

1042
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,140
I see.

1043
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,140
You figured it out.

1044
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,140
I figured it out.

1045
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,140
I figured it out.

1046
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,140
I had a.

1047
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,140
Find that amygdala.

1048
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,140
I see.

1049
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,140
Just like that.

1050
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,140
Give it a good shot.

1051
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,140
I see.

1052
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,140
You throw the ball at it.

1053
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,140
And then, you can't do it.

1054
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,140
Then throw the amygdala.

1055
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,660
That sounds like the ball land.

1056
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,660
OK.

1057
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:29,620
So that's the first step.

1058
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:33,420
Did anybody have the feeling that they didn't do that so well?

1059
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,460
OK.

1060
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,460
And this is an amazing thing.

1061
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,460
When we're in the physical world,

1062
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,460
we have different ways of confirming.

1063
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,460
So we have ideas about what it should look like,

1064
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,460
and you can all feel that.

1065
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,460
It might not even be verbal.

1066
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,460
You might not be able to put all the details

1067
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,460
into a drawing for a researcher.

1068
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,460
But when it's right,

1069
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,460
how many of you got, when you nailed it a couple times,

1070
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,460
you get that feeling of that felt good, that felt right?

1071
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,460
And we're like machines.

1072
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:03,460
We have these incredible powers of making it like,

1073
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,460
I'd love to see you work in the lab on the Epleasure,

1074
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,460
like back when you were like digging in.

1075
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:10,460
Because when we get into that physical space,

1076
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,460
we're actually in a different part of ourselves

1077
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,460
that's really hard to remember in these conversations.

1078
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:18,460
So then we're going to do one more step,

1079
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,460
and then go back to the other kind of confirmation.

1080
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,460
But now I want you to confirm socially.

1081
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,460
So turn to the person next to you,

1082
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,460
and then throw a ball to them,

1083
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,460
and then have them throw the ball back to you.

1084
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:34,460
Share a ball, an invisible ball, with your neighbor.

1085
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,460
Okay, just try to figure out.

1086
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,460
Learn something.

1087
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,460
I'm going to catch some of it.

1088
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,460
I'm going to do a yuck-a-doo, and I'm going to do a yuck-a-doo.

1089
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,460
I'm going to do a yuck-a-doo, and I'm going to do a yuck-a-doo.

1090
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,460
Okay.

1091
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,460
Now, just keep it from being all that good.

1092
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,460
Yeah, I'm going to grab it and try to make it.

1093
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,460
I can say it's too unashinkful.

1094
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,460
You're going to go home to see it.

1095
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,460
No, no, no.

1096
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,460
Good.

1097
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,460
I'm going to do a reason for the opposite.

1098
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,460
Exactly.

1099
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,460
Excellent.

1100
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,460
All right.

1101
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,460
All right.

1102
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,460
You've done it.

1103
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,460
All right.

1104
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,460
Okay.

1105
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,460
Oh!

1106
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,460
Oh!

1107
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,460
Oh!

1108
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,460
What's that?

1109
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:11,460
No.

1110
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,460
I, I, I, I failed.

1111
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,460
So that's just, that's an example of,

1112
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,460
of different kinds that we can...

1113
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,460
I've been a lot.

1114
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,460
I've been a lot.

1115
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,460
I've been a lot.

1116
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,460
I've been a lot on B.

1117
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,460
I've been a lot on B.

1118
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:31,460
I like to apologize to the entire panel.

1119
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,460
Well, and we're learning something.

1120
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,460
The other thing that we're learning is,

1121
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:38,460
when we engage physically and socially,

1122
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,460
it's really fun.

1123
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,460
I was just at Columbia, walking down the street,

1124
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:47,460
and there's a new game store where you go in and people are playing games.

1125
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,460
It's electric.

1126
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:52,460
You go in and you just see what we just all felt.

1127
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:56,460
When we play together, we bond and we have this kind of collective knowledge,

1128
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,460
and it's almost instant.

1129
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,460
It's, it's amazing.

1130
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:03,460
We don't death to instantiate this in all kinds of verbal description,

1131
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,460
but you can feel it almost immediately.

1132
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,460
Anyway, that's the idea.

1133
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,460
Nice.

1134
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,460
Thank you.

1135
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,460
You have another?

1136
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,460
Yeah.

1137
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,460
What is this?

1138
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,460
Another example.

1139
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:16,460
Sure, whatever you want.

1140
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,460
Dandy was having fun.

1141
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,460
Okay.

1142
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:20,460
You're a chip.

1143
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,460
Quick card trick.

1144
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:22,460
No.

1145
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,460
Okay.

1146
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:24,460
Okay.

1147
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:25,460
Okay.

1148
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:28,460
Opening for questions.

1149
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:29,460
Okay.

1150
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:38,460
You just have to vote in the speaker.

1151
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,460
Just ask your question.

1152
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,460
Yes.

1153
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,460
I would like your comments on pluralistic ignorance.

1154
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,460
I think it's relevant here.

1155
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,460
If you want me to read a definition, I can.

1156
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,460
Okay.

1157
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,460
It's in social psychology.

1158
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:57,460
Pluralistic ignorance is a situation where a majority of group members privately reject

1159
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:03,460
a norm, but incorrectly assume that most others accept it and therefore go along with it.

1160
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:08,460
It's also described as no one believes, but everyone thinks that everyone believes.

1161
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:13,460
In short, it's a bias about a social group held by a social group.

1162
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:18,460
I'd like to comment about the ignorance that's going to be relevant.

1163
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,460
It is relevant.

1164
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:25,460
It's a powerful phenomenon, especially these days.

1165
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:32,460
I really believe that it falls right out of the kind of analysis I was proposing earlier,

1166
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:38,460
where people sense of understanding comes from the sense of understanding that others have.

1167
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:45,460
If there's this norm that says, we as a group believe x, then even if most of the group

1168
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:50,460
believe x, you're going to have this sense of understanding that x is true.

1169
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,460
And people don't know about it.

1170
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,460
And people don't know about it.

1171
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,460
Right.

1172
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:59,460
So the only way to know about it is to sort of have a vote, is to have a public open discussion

1173
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,460
about whether people do in fact accept x.

1174
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:12,460
And that's why the liberty of forums are so important, right?

1175
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:17,460
And that's why we bring this kind of knowledge to make it public.

1176
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:22,460
I think people are afraid to go against the norm, and therefore don't know about what's going to be the debate.

1177
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,460
Absolutely.

1178
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,460
I couldn't agree more.

1179
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,460
Go ahead.

1180
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:33,460
My question is, why did people evolve this way with the seemingly error-prone system?

1181
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:40,460
And what does the panel think of the argument of theory of reasoning that says that the reason

1182
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:45,460
is that reasoning wasn't developed to be right, but was to win arguments?

1183
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:52,460
So you're referring to the Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber theory of argumentation.

1184
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,460
Good.

1185
01:04:54,460 --> 01:05:00,460
I mean, I think it makes a lot of sense.

1186
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,460
Why?

1187
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:03,460
We evolved in groups, right?

1188
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:06,460
And there's always been a division of cognitive labor.

1189
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:14,460
We have our own little specialties, and we take positions, and by virtue of having group discussion,

1190
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,460
you're going to have multiple positions put forward.

1191
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:23,460
I think the one thing that that theory gets wrong is the notion that we spend a lot of time arguing.

1192
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:30,460
I think philosophers spend a lot of time arguing, but I think most people spend their time telling stories.

1193
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:41,460
I think we live in a really perilous time where we have these communities of experts that are

1194
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,460
driven and we're not speaking to each other.

1195
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:50,460
And to some extent, I wonder to what extent you believe that the sort of post-modern concept of truth

1196
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:55,460
that we all studied in college, I certainly did, but everything is socially constructed,

1197
01:05:55,460 --> 01:06:04,460
and that there's no way to get between language and its object, and that in essence, truth is malleable,

1198
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:13,460
has contributed to the world we're living in today, which we can call post-truth, where there is no reality testing.

1199
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:19,460
That's a very important observation and question.

1200
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:28,460
One of the things I keep telling some of my journalist friends is I'd really like them to study where Kalya and Conway went to school,

1201
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:34,460
and what courses she took, because I find it very hard to believe that somebody could get on national TV

1202
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:44,460
and use the notion of an alternative fact without this having been validated for her by various post-modernist professors coming down the line.

1203
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:52,460
This thing you have to understand, this idea that there is no such thing as the truth, but the truth is only perspectival,

1204
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,460
and so there can be alternate truths and alternate facts.

1205
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:01,460
This is something before it was championed by the extreme right, was championed by the left,

1206
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:07,460
and it's been orthodoxy in universities and social sciences and the humanities for the last 40 years.

1207
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:15,460
There is no doubt that this has had a follow-on effect, because these kids go, they graduate, they go into civil service,

1208
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:26,460
they go into government, and suddenly you're seeing them use it in some of the most dangerous possible ways to rebut

1209
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:35,460
climate change science, to rebut even size of an inauguration crowd, by simply appealing to the idea that everybody has their own truth.

1210
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:42,460
So I completely agree with you, I think this has been the root of a lot of evil, and it originated with the left,

1211
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:48,460
and is migrated to the right for obvious reasons, and that is that relativism about truth is symmetric.

1212
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:56,460
If it can be used by the left, as it were to insulate people from criticisms from the right, it can also be turned around and used the other way.

1213
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,460
So...

1214
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:06,460
I'm a psychiatrist with a particular interest in the science of spirituality, and I wanted to ask you today,

1215
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:12,460
we're talking about cognitive illusions, and how by virtue of being human we often fall prey to these cognitive illusions.

1216
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:19,460
And I wanted your thoughts in particular on the idea of consciousness, because there's a paradigm shift happening very slowly

1217
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:26,460
from the materials point of view where the brain creates consciousness to a point of view where consciousness creates the brain,

1218
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:31,460
where consciousness is primary, and I'm curious what the points of view are on that.

1219
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:45,460
I think several of us just don't accept your premise that things are developing that way.

1220
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,460
I've nothing to say.

1221
01:08:52,460 --> 01:09:00,460
I mean, I think people are starting to start to understand that I was trying to study now,

1222
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:07,460
under what circumstances material becomes conscious, and you can easily imagine experiments that were allowed to explore the...

1223
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:14,460
I take an image of view and show it to Daphne very tangently.

1224
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:19,460
She will perceive it on some level, but she won't be consciously aware of it.

1225
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:24,460
If I show the same image for a longer period of time, she will be aware of it.

1226
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:33,460
If you now do imaging experiments under those two circumstances, you see with the brief exposure, only the temporal lobe is activated,

1227
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:41,460
and that with a longer exposure, the information propagates the other areas of the brain and is utilized effectively by it.

1228
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:48,460
So one component of moving from unconscious consciousness is the information becomes available to large areas of the brain.

1229
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:54,460
They can then use it effectively, but this is a very early primitive understanding of a component of consciousness.

1230
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,460
Simple example.

1231
01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:05,460
And I also think thinking more clearly about selectional processes in nature is helpful, so that it doesn't fit into this either or category.

1232
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:15,460
And I also really love some of the experiments by Olaf Blanka at EPFL, where in terms of social consciousness approach that you might like.

1233
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:23,460
One of the really interesting things that has been, you know, around since Freud, and Ernst Chris was very much interested is

1234
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:28,460
to what degree there is easy communication between unconscious and conscious processes.

1235
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:36,460
You know, Chris's idea of regression in the service of the ego that is part of creativity is having easy access to one's unconscious processes.

1236
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:41,460
And to some degree, I don't know whether this is what you were talking about before you go home and you think about something and boom,

1237
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:49,460
or all of a sudden it comes to you in a moment of relaxation. So that may involve something like that. It will be very interesting to understand exactly how that occurs.

1238
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:52,460
Thank you.

1239
01:10:52,460 --> 01:11:03,460
So my question is, is there a clear distinction between what we believe and what we know, and if there is, then what is it?

1240
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:07,460
You may ask him, he has the answer to that one.

1241
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:11,460
That's it.

1242
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,460
Any?

1243
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:18,460
You know, it really depends whether you're a psychologist or a philosopher. I mean, I...

1244
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:23,460
No.

1245
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:32,460
You know, we use the word knowledge for a belief that happens to be true. You know, that's the condition for the use of the word.

1246
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:43,460
If you want to be precise about the terminology, the belief itself as we seem to be agreeing around the table, the belief is the subjective state is actually the same.

1247
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:49,460
And the question that separates belief from knowledge is whether it's true or not.

1248
01:11:49,460 --> 01:12:00,460
Yeah, I mean, I would also add the component of justification. So, you know, you can have a belief that's based on a punch, or guess,

1249
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:08,460
which may or may not be true. So, but we wouldn't call that knowledge. You know, suppose you think, I'm going to win the lottery.

1250
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:15,460
You know, and then you blow and blow, you do win the lottery, but you had zero reason to believe that. It's not like it was rigged in your favor.

1251
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:19,460
We wouldn't say he knew that he was going to win the lottery, you know, or if you do...

1252
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:23,460
Sometimes we do so. Subscript it. Subscript it.

1253
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:30,460
All of this is just... It really is terminology. That is, we can... We know how to make the distinctions between the notions that we think are important,

1254
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:40,460
and then we use the words to make sure that we express ourselves. So, there's belief, there is justified belief, belief that is really based on some good evidence that you're aware of.

1255
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:47,460
And then there is justified belief that have also true. We reserve the term knowledge for the thing that has all three properties.

1256
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:55,460
So, I can believe that there may be extraterrestrial beings, but I can't say that I know that there are.

1257
01:12:55,460 --> 01:13:00,460
Right. You can't because there may be, but you can't say it because you don't have evidence.

1258
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,460
That's what he said. So, yeah. Okay, thank you.

1259
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:08,460
So, let me... That is clearly how philosophers make the distinction.

1260
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:18,460
Let me hypothesize that psychologists use a more sort of ordinary language while making the distinction, which is really just a degree of consensus.

1261
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:25,460
Right. So, if there are very few people who also have that thing, then we call it a belief.

1262
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:29,460
Whereas if everybody agrees, then we call it knowledge.

1263
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:35,460
You know, the most... This is known as the notion of a widely accepted claim.

1264
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:41,460
Okay. It's widely accepted within the community. And in fact, most people, they don't only conflate that with knowledge.

1265
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:46,460
They conflate it with truth. So, you know, people say...

1266
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:48,460
Right. So, that's why you get...

1267
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:49,460
That's all we have.

1268
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:52,460
Even in journalism, yes. This is a crucial error.

1269
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:59,460
This is why you get in journalists, for instance, they say, is evolution a fact or is it just a theory?

1270
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:06,460
Now, that's a very weird question for a philosopher, but it's not if you think by fact you mean widely accepted claim.

1271
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:10,460
So, you're asking, is this a widely accepted claim or is it just an opinion that some people have?

1272
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:20,460
That makes sense. But there are very strong reasons for not conflating widely accepted claim with truth and widely accepted claim with knowledge.

1273
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:24,460
Okay. I can give you the reasons, but...

1274
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:31,460
As I say, at the end of the day, this is merely keeping the terminology clear. We know the distinctions.

1275
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:40,460
The word intuition is interesting in this context because the word intuition is frequently defined as knowing without knowing why you know.

1276
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:41,460
Right.

1277
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:49,460
You know, that's the standard definition of intuition that you find. And I, you know, I find that very difficult to accept.

1278
01:14:49,460 --> 01:15:01,460
And I suppose this is true for everybody around the table, but it is a very widely accepted notion that you can know without knowing what you know.

1279
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:08,460
And that there is a subjective state of knowing without knowing what you know.

1280
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:13,460
And this is very common in everyday language. And it's quite powerful.

1281
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:26,460
And in part, when psychologists use the terminology that you were objecting to, I think, when we use that terminology, it's influenced by that.

1282
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:31,460
That knowing is really a subjective state.

1283
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,460
So, I hope my question will be a good follow-up on this.

1284
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:40,460
Because the thing I think you didn't really mention is that it fascinates me.

1285
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:54,460
It's the human's capacity to actually sort between what you, I mean, what you describe as like concrete empirical knowledge and that other domain of knowledge where you extrapolate, project, trust others.

1286
01:15:54,460 --> 01:16:09,460
I find it fascinating, for instance, that the member of a tribe who knows that there are spirits behind any leaf or tree or river, when they want to make a boat, they know they have to carve a tree a particular way

1287
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:12,460
so that it floats. They don't confuse the two domains.

1288
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:22,460
Those who build the cathedral, who believe that angel were holding the world, they knew the equation so that the walls of the cathedral would stand.

1289
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:36,460
And even today, the people who think that the Trump supporters who think that a wall is going to start Mexican rapists to enter the United States, they know when their car breaks that they have to operate on a different mode.

1290
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:53,460
So, behind those two domains of knowing that seems to be pretty universal, don't you think there is a human capacity to actually, in most cases, orient ourselves in a pretty accurate way?

1291
01:16:53,460 --> 01:17:03,460
For one thing, if you're in the physical world and you make a boat that doesn't float, you find out really quickly it doesn't float.

1292
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:22,460
What you're pointing out, and again, this will be controversial among the psychologists, is that there is a much greater use of reason, operative guiding people, than sometimes they're given credit with.

1293
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:35,460
And this shows up in these small ways. It shows up in countless ways in which we navigate the world, including reaching for the bottle in the right way, because that's part of knowledge, it's part of perceptual knowledge.

1294
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:39,460
And then, of course, your boat example is a more sophisticated example of the same thing.

1295
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:49,460
So, you're absolutely right, there are huge domains of behavior that's simply taken for granted, where people operate in completely rational ways.

1296
01:17:49,460 --> 01:18:01,460
And then, they sort of quarantined that off from areas which are less constrained by evidence, where they believe what they wish to believe, rather than what is justified.

1297
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:07,460
My question specifically was, do you think there is a psychological function? Like I'm like really talking science here.

1298
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:09,460
Oh, I guess it seems to me that...

1299
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,460
Oh, the psychological function is obvious.

1300
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:16,460
Because I say you'll drown if you build the boat the wrong way. So...

1301
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:30,460
So, I understood your last question differently. I thought you were asking whether it's possible to be accurate, whether you can always know whether your theories about what's going on are right or wrong.

1302
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:42,460
In these two domains, there is a surprising wisdom behind where people know actually when they can afford one domain of knowledge and audio.

1303
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:45,460
So, can I just make a quick observation about that?

1304
01:18:45,460 --> 01:19:11,460
George Bernard Shaw wrote in The Preface to His Play St. Joan in 1924. He argued that the people who followed Joan of Arc because of her ability to speak to archangels and prophets, that those people were no less rational and no less correct in their behavior than the soldiers who followed the generals in World War I.

1305
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:20,460
Because in both cases, people were operating based on faith. Faith that the people who were leading them knew what they were doing.

1306
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:32,460
That the weapons that they had constructed were going to work. That there was at the time and even more so today, a science that we can't possibly understand.

1307
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:41,460
So, when people are pressing buttons to shoot people or drop bombs today, they don't understand the technology. Very few people understand the technology.

1308
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:49,460
So invariably, we have to rely on faith. And invariably, I think, therefore, there's going to be a kind of uncertainty.

1309
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:53,460
This is very dangerous. This is very dangerous.

1310
01:19:53,460 --> 01:20:03,460
Well, I don't know if it's dangerous. I think it's accurate.

1311
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:07,460
I interpreted the question in a slightly different way.

1312
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:25,460
It's about different ways of knowing and that they can coexist. And very simply from my neuroscience perspective, cognitive neuroscience perspective on this, that's true. We know scientifically that we know things in a lot of different ways.

1313
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:39,460
And our assumption from our discipline is that the reason for it, if there is one, is that you need to know things in many different ways and that ultimately an action will be driven by one system or presentation rather than another.

1314
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:46,460
But that's important because you don't know in the moment what kind of knowledge will be the most useful.

1315
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:58,460
But what that does create is a system of sort of parallels, slightly misaligned kinds of ways of knowing that might add robustness and resilience, but of course, add complication as well.

1316
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:05,460
Definitely. Maybe you can elaborate on the separation between cognitive knowledge and motor knowledge.

1317
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:09,460
Right. That's such a good example of a book that is trying to be.

1318
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:22,460
So one of the kind of famous well-known examples in the brain are the different separate circuits for remembering what Eric and I spoke about at our last meeting last week.

1319
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:34,460
And there's a very separate way of knowing what remembering what, let's say, the content of the information and its flavor and a separate way of knowing how to open the door when someone comes to visit you.

1320
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:39,460
And those are so separated out that you can have patience with damage to different parts of the brain.

1321
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:45,460
And each of those different ways of knowing can either be independently impaired or intact.

1322
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:52,460
Right. So these are kind of everyday examples of this multiplicity of systems of knowledge.

1323
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:54,460
Thank you, Danny.

1324
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:58,460
Hi.

1325
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:01,460
I'm a bit shorter.

1326
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:10,460
My question has to do with before earlier when all of you were talking about kind of where we get our knowledge from.

1327
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:13,460
How do we decide what can be trusted?

1328
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:30,460
So I was wondering if any of you could comment on kind of the trustworthiness of or how much trust can we put in empirical knowledge when so much of our empirical studies are so to speak weird.

1329
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:36,460
So Western educated industrialized.

1330
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:44,460
Can't remember what the other one is, but Democratic and oh, wealthy, well rich.

1331
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:51,460
Yeah.

1332
01:22:51,460 --> 01:23:02,460
Just a comment on the question in a sense. I think there are two. I thought you were headed one place and then you ended up somewhere else, but I think they're both maybe relevant.

1333
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:12,460
And one is first amongst us. We assume that the empirical message of scientific inquiry is the way forward and it has to be done well.

1334
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:20,460
And I think really the rest of your question was, well, how do we know we're doing it well and that it's relevant for understanding humanity more broadly given the constraints that we're doing.

1335
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:26,460
The constraints of the research people like us do. Is that correct?

1336
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:31,460
Yeah. Well, because you guys were just commenting on thinking you know.

1337
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:44,460
And how do we get our actual empirical evidence to truly reflect not just what we think we know and not just necessarily reconfirming what we already know, but actually taking it a step further.

1338
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:55,460
Yeah. So, you know, I don't think I don't think maybe others have something more interesting to say. I think I can say we do the best we can with the science we do and we can be doing better and their efforts towards that.

1339
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:57,460
I don't know if Danny's.

1340
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:07,460
I mean, you know, we think there's not a consensus in the scientific community. So, you know, one of us may come up with some idea. Somebody else in the field may have an opposite idea may challenge you.

1341
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:16,460
So there are challenges going on in the scientific community all the time to give you certain more confidence in certain ways of thinking than others.

1342
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:36,460
I had a recent experience that I think is relevant to the question. I was, I got an email from two scientists who wanted to talk to me about climate change and how to educate people on the truth of climate change.

1343
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:47,460
And we arranged for lunch and we met for lunch. And one of them is a member of the National Academy. Another one with the head of the New York Academy of Sciences.

1344
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:58,460
And their climate change deniers, which just never occurred to me. And they want to find ways of educating people in the truth.

1345
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:12,460
They can. And what would happen, you know, was that I was challenged. It's actually quite interesting in terms of the science, what you would advise people like those to do.

1346
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:23,460
And, you know, I suggested that they published what we call an adversarial collaboration, that they tried to have a conversation, public conversation with opponents.

1347
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:34,460
But, but I was challenged by is why do I believe in climate change? And of course, I believe in climate change for exactly the same reason that many other people don't believe in climate change.

1348
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:41,460
Because I believe in people who believe in climate change. And that's, that's it. There's really nothing beyond that.

1349
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:57,460
I don't even, you know, the sense that I understand climate change. I know that I don't understand enough to win an argument with somebody who doesn't believe. Like those two scientists who are telling me that carbon dioxide is a beautiful thing.

1350
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:05,460
But is it really, is it really as circular as that, you know, that I believe in climate change because I believe in people who believe in climate change?

1351
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:12,460
I mean, there are, no, I hope that there are some people at the end of the chain who know what they're doing.

1352
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:24,460
I understand I'm saying even in your own case, is it quite as vacuous as that? Isn't it that they, the people that you trust have other qualities that make you trust them more?

1353
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:28,460
And therefore, since they're trustworthy in general, they're also trustworthy on this particular topic.

1354
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:35,460
That's completely circular. I mean, I trust people who engage these and members of the National Academy.

1355
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:43,460
I believe basically in climate change, if we ask ourselves, because the National Academy of Sciences in its majority believes in climate change.

1356
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:51,460
And I believe in the National Academy of Sciences. You know, that's, this is not a very strong argument for believing climate change.

1357
01:26:51,460 --> 01:27:00,460
You can believe in the notion of things. I don't think that's right, because those are, you know, you can keep pushing the question further and further back.

1358
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:05,460
Suppose somebody were as skeptic about admission to the National Academy and so on and so forth.

1359
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:08,460
Suppose one were as skeptic about empirical method in general. I agree.

1360
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:12,460
Once they've pushed it that far, you may have trouble giving answers.

1361
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:21,460
But the proximate reason why you believe in climate change or why you believe that smoking causes cancer, why you believe any of these things that you yourself haven't done studies for,

1362
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:27,460
is you have good reason to trust the people you trust and not nearly because of their views about that particular topic.

1363
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:32,460
It's a much more general reason to be trusting of that particular body.

1364
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,460
That's true on the other side as well.

1365
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:38,460
And that's true in communist, that's true in totalitarian societies.

1366
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:43,460
What is believed that the end of the train isn't true?

1367
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:55,460
That's a very radical skepticism, which means that if you keep pushing it back, you will reach a point where your answers are circular, but it does matter where they get to be circular.

1368
01:27:55,460 --> 01:28:07,460
I mean, I take Paul to be saying that you believe that members of the National Academy of Science are telling the truth about climate change because they also were able to send people to the ground.

1369
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:10,460
They were able to send people to the moon, right?

1370
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:15,460
And they were also able to build incredible electronic equipment, etc.

1371
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:24,460
So there's a network of knowledge that they accept and are part of, and that's good reason to believe them, even if you don't know anything about climate change.

1372
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:27,460
But you can still be skeptical, I guess.

1373
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:29,460
Yes, I mean, skepticism.

1374
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:37,460
I made those two scientists for lunch, and it didn't change my belief about climate change at all.

1375
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:44,460
And you know, it's not that I was shaken because here are two reputable scientists who don't believe in climate change.

1376
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:49,460
I stayed with my belief, and that I think is very common.

1377
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:56,460
Sure, because we now 97% of scientists believe in climate change.

1378
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:00,460
I think my question may follow on this one.

1379
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:15,460
We are at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute in society, and it would seem from the discussion so far that everybody has accepted the notion that Dr. Candel, that psychoanalysis is simply passé and unscientific.

1380
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:17,460
No, no, no, no, no.

1381
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:21,460
I'm saying that question is never been examined.

1382
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:24,460
Well, I would like to challenge you on that.

1383
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:30,460
First of all, my dissertation over 50 years ago was an empirical study using subliminal...

1384
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:39,460
I'm a psychologist using subliminal perception into kistoscopes, and we found results, but it's not just from 50 some odd years ago.

1385
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:48,460
If you Google psychoanalytic empirical research, you will get over 500,000 hits, not all of them of the same quality.

1386
01:29:48,460 --> 01:30:00,460
But the late Benjamin Blatt at Yale, Howard Chevron at Michigan, and others I can aim, have been doing long-term studies and at your own university.

1387
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:10,460
There are studies going on that are empirical studies that seem to support the idea that I like you.

1388
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:20,460
I'm a scientific person, I believe, in the scientific values that have been discussed here, but not in the exclusion of psychoanalysis,

1389
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:30,460
nor in the diminution of the empirical... non-clinical empirical research efforts that have supported it for over 50 years,

1390
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:36,460
not in any way conclusively and showing many limitations, but it's a science.

1391
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:39,460
I guess that's more of a statement than a question.

1392
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:41,460
Statement of faith.

1393
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:50,460
I don't have a question per se, but I do...

1394
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:53,460
Quick comment.

1395
01:30:53,460 --> 01:31:02,460
In terms of the use of religion, religion is defined in the dictionary as belief in the transcendental or metaphysical being.

1396
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:16,460
I think the way the word was thrown around here was inappropriate or misused, and I just wanted to make that comment.

1397
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:31,460
The other thing about animal sentience, there have been over 2,500 studies to date on the fact that many animals from elephants at the high end to fish,

1398
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:40,460
certain fish at the low end, if there is a low end, have indeed...

1399
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:43,460
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1400
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:51,460
That sentience has been found unequivocally amongst non-human beings.

1401
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:53,460
That's all I have.

1402
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:56,460
Sentience has been found in animals.

1403
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:02,460
No disagreements.

1404
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:15,460
I'm a general internist, and I was thinking as you were talking about how we know things about a case that I was confronted with,

1405
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:21,460
and what I really wanted to ask about is how do we communicate between each other when knowledge...

1406
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:29,460
...when what we know is different, and I saw a patient, she was 19, and she had something called conversion disorder, at least I think,

1407
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:33,460
where she knew she couldn't move her arm.

1408
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:40,460
And I can take some pictures and look, and I know, at least I think, that she can't move her arm.

1409
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:48,460
And what I think we're all confronted with now, and I think she can move her arm and she thinks she can't move her arm,

1410
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:51,460
is, well, now what do we do to? How do we speak to each other?

1411
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,460
How do we try to bridge that gap?

1412
01:32:53,460 --> 01:33:02,460
And I think that... I wonder what the thoughts are of this group of how do we bridge that gap and talk to each other.

1413
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:06,460
Good morning, I'm sorry for analysis.

1414
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,460
So can I probe you a little bit?

1415
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:09,460
Yes, sir.

1416
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:13,460
So did you engage with her and try to use the scientific method?

1417
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:20,460
So I did what I think many of us would do, and I went to my mentor, and I said, you have more experience with this than I do?

1418
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,460
What do I do with this person?

1419
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:30,460
And he told me, he said, and I guess maybe this is another type of religion, it became one of my religions, sort of, was to say,

1420
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:34,460
just tell her, you think it's going to get better.

1421
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:36,460
You don't have to run.

1422
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:37,460
I see.

1423
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:45,460
The different belief systems that are causing this block between you and say, I don't know why you can't move your arm exactly.

1424
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:48,460
I can't see on a picture, but I think it could get better.

1425
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:51,460
And so that's what I did, and it didn't get better.

1426
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:52,460
I see.

1427
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,460
But as I noticed...

1428
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:56,460
So you didn't try showing her a video of herself moving her arm?

1429
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:57,460
I did not.

1430
01:33:57,460 --> 01:34:00,460
Or ask her to pick up a glass of water...

1431
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:05,460
This gets to a little bit of the point that was raised before that I'm trying to have empathy.

1432
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:09,460
To say, yes, I understand that you're having this problem.

1433
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:14,460
And I believe that you believe that you can't move your arm.

1434
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:18,460
And so maybe we can move beyond it and talk about something else.

1435
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:20,460
I don't know, but it wasn't solving the problem.

1436
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,460
It certainly wasn't solving the problem.

1437
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:23,460
Thank you.

1438
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:31,460
You can tell a lot about a person by asking what's your favorite joke.

1439
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:33,460
Here's my favorite joke.

1440
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:35,460
The rabbi is sitting in the kitchen...

1441
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:37,460
Who's the leader's table?

1442
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:42,460
And his wife is making soup.

1443
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:44,460
There's a knock at the door.

1444
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:45,460
The rabbi says, come in.

1445
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:46,460
Who men come in?

1446
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:48,460
They say, we have a business dispute.

1447
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:49,460
Could you solve it?

1448
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:51,460
The rabbi says, sit down.

1449
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:53,460
First man gives his story.

1450
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:56,460
The rabbi says, you're right.

1451
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:58,460
Turns the second man.

1452
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:00,460
Second man gives his story.

1453
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:01,460
You're right.

1454
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:07,460
His wife throws down the soup spoon and says, how can he be right and he be right?

1455
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:09,460
The rabbi says, you're right too.

1456
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:22,460
So I've been doing analysis for, you know, 45 years in this hallowed institution.

1457
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:30,460
And when I was taught, originally, I was taught by people who did feel they had the revealed

1458
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,460
truth.

1459
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:39,460
I think for the last 25 years, what I have been teaching is different.

1460
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:42,460
And here's an example of a case.

1461
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:45,460
Ten years ago, a man came to see me.

1462
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:47,460
He couldn't get a date.

1463
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:49,460
He couldn't hold down a job.

1464
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:54,460
And he was really depressed about this.

1465
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:57,460
Ten years later, he's married.

1466
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:00,460
Empirical fact.

1467
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:05,460
I saw the birth, the marriage certificate.

1468
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:07,460
He's got two children.

1469
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:08,460
Empirical fact.

1470
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:11,460
I've seen pictures of them.

1471
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:19,460
And he's got a job because that's how he can pay me at my exorbitant rate every month.

1472
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:26,460
So what I know is that all those changes have taken place.

1473
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:34,460
What I do not know and confess to this ignorance is how did it happen?

1474
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:40,460
Is it because I thoroughly analyzed his edible complex, which I did?

1475
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:45,460
Is it because I analyzed his masochism, which I did?

1476
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:53,460
Is it because I've treated him in a respectful, interested way for ten years, which I did?

1477
01:36:53,460 --> 01:37:01,460
Is it some communication between our mutual unconsciousness that neither of us knows anything

1478
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:02,460
about?

1479
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:07,460
So what I know is that the process works.

1480
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:12,460
And I have forty instances like this.

1481
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:17,460
What I don't know is how and why it works.

1482
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:20,460
How would one study that?

1483
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:23,460
Sir, don't leave.

1484
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:25,460
How do you know it works?

1485
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:27,460
How would one study that?

1486
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:28,460
I don't know it works.

1487
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:30,460
The process of therapy.

1488
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:33,460
How would one study why it works?

1489
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:36,460
I think it would be really hard.

1490
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:40,460
I think you could study that it works.

1491
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:49,460
One of the reasons I think that cognitive behavioral therapy works is the quality of the relationship

1492
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:56,460
between the patient and the physician, because some people, they can do it and it really

1493
01:37:56,460 --> 01:38:00,460
works, and other people, it falls flat on its face.

1494
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:09,460
I know an instance where a little girl was sent to a CBT after having had a dynamic therapist,

1495
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:16,460
and after about half a dozen sessions, she turned to the therapist and said, could we

1496
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:20,460
talk about my family?

1497
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:22,460
I think that's where the problem is.

1498
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:29,460
I'd like to draw one distinction between CBT and what you described, that CBT is based

1499
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:35,460
on controlled trials, where you take patients and some of them get treatment and others

1500
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:40,460
don't get treatment, and you look at the level of improvement after a while.

1501
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:45,460
What you did not tell us, what you did not examine, were the possibility that the person

1502
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:50,460
success in life and children and job and so on had nothing to do with you.

1503
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:57,460
All the hypotheses that you mentioned were hypotheses that assumed that your interaction

1504
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:03,460
caused the changes in that person's life, and it's that assumption that many people question.

1505
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:05,460
You're right, Toby.

1506
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:08,460
Thank you.

1507
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:18,460
Thank you.

1508
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:28,460
Hi, I'm an undergrad studying neuroscience and philosophy at Columbia University, and my

1509
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:31,460
question concerns imagination.

1510
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:36,460
So Einstein, for example, when he was coming up with his theory of relativity, he had

1511
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:41,460
this assumption that gravitational waves exist, and this was only proven, I mean, we only

1512
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:45,460
detected gravitational waves a few years ago, and there was this leap of faith involved,

1513
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:51,460
and there was this imagination, he pushed boundaries, he pushed, he questioned and challenged

1514
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:56,460
the scientific paradigms of his time, and my question is what is the role of imagination

1515
01:39:56,460 --> 01:40:02,460
and his knowledge, because I'm sure he knew that that was, the theory of relativity was

1516
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:08,460
how the universe was worked or how the universe was composed.

1517
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:15,460
Well, you know, first of all, he tried to publish a paper proving that gravitational

1518
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:21,460
waves don't exist in the 1930s, so it was a consequence of his theory that they exist,

1519
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:26,460
but in fact he thought it was a bad consequence that he tried to try to have a fallacious

1520
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:29,460
argument for trying to show that didn't follow.

1521
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:34,460
But the real, the question you're asking, I mean, there are these incredible creative

1522
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:40,460
breakthroughs, and creativity in general is a very, very difficult thing to understand,

1523
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:46,460
because what we understand, the way we understand things is to see what the principles are that

1524
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:51,460
operate and how, when those principles are, when the mechanism is working correctly,

1525
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:57,460
things follow from that, but creative breakthroughs precisely are things that break the rules,

1526
01:40:57,460 --> 01:41:03,460
and so it is, I don't know if a theory, the psychologist should tell us what the latest

1527
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:08,460
thinking is about creativity, but as far as I know, we're very much in the dark about that.

1528
01:41:08,460 --> 01:41:15,460
I think this is an extreme example in any way, and a very beautiful one that I think of how we all do this all the time.

1529
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:19,460
I think in many ways it's really kind of the essence of part of this conversation and very relevant,

1530
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:25,460
which is both in the scientific realm, but in general, here we are talking about doubts and

1531
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:31,460
suspicion and empirical data, we all feel very strongly about some of our ideas, right?

1532
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:38,460
And we have to get through the next grant cycle and study, and all the obstacles we face as scientists,

1533
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:46,460
we have to feel strongly and have a lot of confidence in those ideas, and yet simultaneously we have to know that that's a little bit of an illusion

1534
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:52,460
and keep pushing for it, and I think something that everybody has to do all the time,

1535
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:57,460
to get up in the morning and to work hard at anything requires a strong sense of belief and confidence,

1536
01:41:57,460 --> 01:42:05,460
and yet to do it in a way that's intelligent and cautious requires at the same time knowing that we might be wrong,

1537
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:10,460
and I really guess that this idea of multiple representations happening simultaneously.

1538
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:16,460
Also, as time you have the feeling that this has worked before, this line of thought,

1539
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:19,460
so it's likely to work again in the future if I run additional control,

1540
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:25,460
so you have a little historical background with it, it gives you confidence in the fact that you're moving in the right direction.

1541
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:32,460
But just one little historical correction, the confirmation for general relativity didn't just come now with the discovery of gravitational waves,

1542
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:44,460
it came 1917 with the observation, the bending of, yeah, so it's not as though we've had this great confidence in general relativity for 80 years,

1543
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:49,460
and suddenly with some slight confirmation, the confirmation came early on.

1544
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:50,460
Thank you.

1545
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:52,460
This question is a question.

1546
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:54,460
Shirley Mueller, neurologist.

1547
01:42:54,460 --> 01:43:01,460
A few questions ago, someone asked a question, and several of you interpreted it differently.

1548
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:04,460
This question was the same.

1549
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:13,460
So this would be because of genetics, education, environment, how you interpreted the context, and so on.

1550
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:19,460
Would this not get down to organism as you suggested?

1551
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:30,460
And is not the real grain of salt, and what we're talking about today, which is fake knowledge versus illusion of knowing,

1552
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:36,460
having to do basically with the organism in our brain processes?

1553
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:42,460
You're looking at one of the neuroscientists on the panel, but I don't think anybody else would disagree.

1554
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:50,460
Even the psychoanalysts, right, it all comes down to brain mechanisms in the sense that it involves brain mechanisms,

1555
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:52,460
not that that necessarily explains it.

1556
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:58,460
But I'd like to hear you discuss it more, because to me that was what was missing today, this concrete information.

1557
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:00,460
That's what I'm asking for.

1558
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:04,460
Well, I could say a lot about the brain.

1559
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:09,460
I'm not sure, I know how to answer that, and maybe Eric.

1560
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:19,460
Well, I think one of the things that I think would benefit to feel the great deal, if there was more of a bridge between brain science and psychoanalysts.

1561
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:25,460
As I give you an example, there's a woman called Helen Mayberg, who's a neurologist actually.

1562
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:31,460
She's been interested in depression, and she's been able to localize regions with imaging that involve depression,

1563
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:41,460
and then see to what degree there's a loss of those abnormalities when patients respond therapeutically, and she has tried different therapies.

1564
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:43,460
So there are beginnings in this direction.

1565
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:51,460
So to take various kinds of psychiatric illnesses begin to identify the neuroanatomical substance, it's a very difficult problem.

1566
01:44:51,460 --> 01:45:00,460
But to begin to do that, and to see which change with which kind of therapeutic approaches is clearly the next step in our field for the next 15, 20 years.

1567
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:12,460
I think in addition to that, there's certainly a good amount of evidence into what's happening in the brain when you're creating some false memories, for example.

1568
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:21,460
So we actually know how that plays out, and it's only us from the outside who would call these things false memories, but connecting memories to each other.

1569
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:29,460
We know more or less how the brain does that, how the brain sort of creates associations, and those are things, as we mentioned earlier, that are necessary for many aspects of behavior.

1570
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:42,460
I think this is just sort of one several examples of extreme consequences, but I think we actually know a fair amount about what's happening in the brain, and I think there's this very interesting disconnect between that level of understanding,

1571
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:48,460
and really being able to explain these phenomena at the level of society and know what to do about them.

1572
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:50,460
So there's a lot of tension.

1573
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:53,460
There were actually some cases in which one is beginning to do that.

1574
01:45:53,460 --> 01:46:12,460
In the last 10 years, it's emerged that when people age, in addition to being susceptible to Alzheimer's disease, there's a milder form of memory disorder called euphemistically age-related memory loss, which is quite different from Alzheimer's and involves different regions of the brain.

1575
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:21,460
You can develop animal models of that as well, and you can see where this occurs, and actually find that there are certain therapeutic approaches to it.

1576
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:43,460
For example, there is a hormone released from bone called osteocalcin, and osteocalcin reverses age-related memory loss, and you can show in an experimental animal that as they have age-related memory loss, if you now exercise them more, if you have them work their bones more by walking more, you can reverse that, and that's related to the amount of osteocalcin's produced.

1577
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:53,460
And this may contributes to why people who exercise a lot as continued exercises age tend to do better in terms of their cognitive performance.

1578
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:59,460
So we're beginning to get some clues from these combination of approaches that are useful.

1579
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:02,460
You want to do a quick part trick?

1580
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:05,460
OK, sure.

1581
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:14,460
OK, one big... so... here we go.

1582
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:17,460
I want to learn how to do this. I want to leave today.

1583
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:19,460
You should do it.

1584
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:20,460
No, no, no.

1585
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:22,460
I just happened to have a card to do that.

1586
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:31,460
Hold the cards in your hand, and if you would be so kind to just think of a card, and then change your mind a couple times.

1587
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:35,460
And think of another card. So this way you don't speak to him.

1588
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:36,460
Yeah, absolutely.

1589
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:37,460
Yeah, if you were.

1590
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:41,460
Right? So think of one card and then change your mind a couple times to get past all bias.

1591
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:47,460
And... we'll see if this works.

1592
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:50,460
And then say the card out loud so we can all hear it.

1593
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:51,460
Acesbade.

1594
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:53,460
Exactly what I thought.

1595
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:54,460
Seriously.

1596
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:55,460
I swear.

1597
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:57,460
I really need that.

1598
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:58,460
I can do this.

1599
01:47:58,460 --> 01:47:59,460
I can do this.

1600
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:01,460
I can do this.

1601
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,460
I can do this.

1602
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:03,460
I can do this.

1603
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:07,460
Boy, we'll go card it.

1604
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:12,460
By highest scientific accomplishment reading your mind.

1605
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:14,460
Wait, it gets better.

1606
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:17,460
Could you deal out cards right here?

1607
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:20,460
And just... could you spell connemon?

1608
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:21,460
Right?

1609
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:22,460
With these cards.

1610
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:25,460
So put a card down and it goes K.

1611
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:29,460
So put a card down over there and spell K.

1612
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:30,460
Or face down.

1613
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:33,460
It makes them more dramatic.

1614
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:37,460
That's K. And then A.

1615
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:41,460
H.

1616
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:44,460
N.

1617
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:48,460
E.

1618
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:49,460
M.

1619
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:50,460
M.

1620
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:54,460
A.

1621
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:56,460
M.

1622
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:58,460
M.

1623
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:01,460
A.

1624
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:03,460

1642

I love Chinese artists, but I think you can also work with Marc.

1643
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:28,460
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what things.

1644
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:30,460
How is he good?

1645
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:31,460
I'm very good at stuff.

1646
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:33,460
I have an idea.

1647
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:38,460
I'm not wrong with the art.

1648
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:40,460
Can we just say the class of hot?

1649
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:42,460
No, no, no.

1650
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:44,460
I think you can avoid your dessert play.

1651
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:47,460
Right down the park.

1652
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:50,460
So, there's a conference in the West,

1653
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:52,460
it's like I'm in the older than I'm wearing.

1654
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:54,460
Yeah, I'm myself.

1655
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:58,460
Either way, I was talking about you.

1656
01:50:58,460 --> 01:51:00,460
How do you still go?

1657
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:02,460
Very good?

1658
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:04,460
I don't want to say the right way.
