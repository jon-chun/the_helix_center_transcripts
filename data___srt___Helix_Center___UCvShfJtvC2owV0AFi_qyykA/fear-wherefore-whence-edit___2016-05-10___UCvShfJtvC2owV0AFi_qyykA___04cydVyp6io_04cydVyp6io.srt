13
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,920
Sorry, how are you gonna? No, I'm just gonna wait for you to say something. Go ahead.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,840
Okay, well I guess I'll start. So you know as a psychologist, turned into a

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,280
neuroscientist of sorts. I think any kind of psychological question, whether

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,360
you're approaching it in the brain or in behavior, always has to start from our

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,800
introspections. I mean that's our only access to our mental processes and

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,280
internal states and so forth. So you know without being able to introspect

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,280
and formulate the idea that we have a line that we have something called

20
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,600
consciousness, we couldn't possibly study that. So there's no way that an

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,440
organism that doesn't have that capacity to look inside its own brain and have

22
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,280
its own ideas and formulate those especially in verbal questions, statements

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,880
like this that allows us to say okay I'm aware that I have a psychology, a mind,

24
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,920
and that's somehow related to my body but also seems to have some kind of

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,960
separate existence. All of that is only possible because of the kind of brain

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,160
that we have and we don't know which other animals obviously have that because no

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,680
other animal can tell us about this. So from the point of view of fear, we look

28
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,680
into our brains and our minds and we say what is fear? How are we gonna study

29
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:52,240
that in an animal or another person? And what we come up with is that you know we

30
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,360
fear is a kind of experience we have that we're in danger. So therefore we can

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,560
study what happens when an organism is in danger and learn something about fear.

32
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,000
Now the way we observe scientifically the fear of another organism so to speak

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
is through its behavior or other reactions or responses. Obviously we

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,080
can't go inside another person or another animal's mind. So when I study a rat and

35
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:31,400
the rat is exposed to a threatening stimulus and it freezes, the question is

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,840
what do we call that? For the last 30-something years, many of my colleagues

37
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,400
have called that fear. But when I was talking about fear and many my colleagues

38
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,240
as well, we weren't talking about fear as the conscious experience. We're talking

39
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,040
about it as a kind of inner motivational state that connects

40
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,760
stimuli with responses so that a rat is freezing or a human jumps back from a

41
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,000
bus that's flying by before there where the bus is there and so forth. And when

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,920
that happens we have these non-conscious systems that allow us to do this. At the

43
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,880
same time when we look into our minds we both see ourselves jumping back and

44
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,720
feeling afraid. So it all seems to be bundled together as one thing and that's

45
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,360
why the most common idea about how fear is represented in the brain is that you

46
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,560
have a kind of fear circuit or fear center that we've inherited from animals

47
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,960
aside. There goes back to Darwin and perhaps even older and through the

48
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,040
operation of that circuit we both respond to danger and feel fear. I mean

49
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,600
that's the natural way to think about it. But as we begin to take these things

50
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
apart, not so much in animal brains because we can't really make the

51
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,520
distinction. But in the human brain we can begin to see that when we can create a

52
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,360
threat by a conditioning process is expose the person to that threat and the

53
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,040
person will then respond to the threat. But if we present that and the person

54
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,280
will know the threat is there and so forth. But if we present that stimulus in a way

55
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,200
that the person doesn't have conscious access to the stimulus, the person will

56
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,240
still respond to the threat. So the heart will raise, the palms will sweat and so

57
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,000
forth even though the person never saw the stimulus and claims to feel no fear.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,080
So fear can't be what's driving these responses that are controlled by this

59
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,480
part of the brain that I work on called the amygdala. Fear is what happens when

60
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,200
we become aware that our brain is responding in this kind of way and a

61
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,560
lot of other things go into the creation of the fear as well. So this and you can

62
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,840
study patients who have what's called blind sight where they're blind in the

63
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,080
left side of space. You can present a threat there. You don't have to use any

64
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,680
tricks or anything where it's presented very briefly. You can just present a

65
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,880
threat to the rough visual field and if you're imaging the person the amygdala

66
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,200
will be activated and the responses will be present but the person won't know the

67
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,360
stimulus is there and won't feel anything. So and I'll cut it short now.

68
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,840
So because of this kind, this and many other kinds of pieces of information, I

69
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,720
come to the conclusion that it was really inappropriate to talk about fear

70
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,280
when I was studying the rats' responses to threats. What I'd been studying is the

71
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,080
operation of the defensive survival circuit that allows the rat or any

72
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,520
other organism to detect and respond to danger and that can contribute to the

73
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,560
feeling of fear but that is not one and the same as the feeling of fear. The

74
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,000
feeling of fear instead I think is more of a kind of cortical process,

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,040
neocortical process where information about the present stimulus, memories

76
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,720
about what that stimulus is and what it means, schemas about what kinds of

77
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,640
emotions those are associated with and so forth are integrated with the fact

78
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,040
that say the amygdala is already being responding to the stimulus and all kinds

79
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,800
of feedback is coming within the brain arousal and body feedback and so forth

80
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,720
and all of that is integrated in working memory to give rise to the feeling of

81
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,440
fear. So that's my view of things. What's the value of making that distinction?

82
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,200
Well the value is that this is going to take you some more time is that okay?

83
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:23,800
So the value of what it is for the past 50 years the pharmaceutical industry has

84
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,920
been attempting to develop and anti-anxiety drugs and in 2010 last

85
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,880
post-SmithKline and a couple of others began saying we can't do it. Nothing

86
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,320
is happening. You know we're testing rats and mice in these chambers and giving

87
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,120
them drugs that make them less timid, less behaviorally inhibited but when we

88
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,960
give them to people it doesn't make them feel less fearful or anxious or not

89
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,680
reliably or consistently. So what's wrong? Well the person that's a person

90
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,400
with a social anxiety disorder on a SSRI is more likely to go to the party

91
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,880
but still feel bad when they're there because it's not reducing the fear and

92
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,200
anxiety at the party is just changing the inhibitory behavior about going to the

93
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,720
party. So if we make this broad distinction between

94
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,880
circuits that control these behavioral responses and circuits that generate

95
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:24,200
these kinds of subjective feelings we can begin to ask questions about

96
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,400
therapy and how it can be approached in a way that's more consistent with at

97
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,560
least the way I think about how the brain is organized.

98
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,720
Joe I think what you said is really crucial and delighted to hear you say it

99
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,360
because being an analyst I believe the mind can be studied

100
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,360
and also that the cerebral cortex in evolution

101
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,280
is crucial and you have just outlined that salient fact

102
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,840
that the brain in humans is complicated it's layered

103
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,840
their levels their connections and many of the most

104
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:09,240
interesting things about mental function are probably widely distributed circuits

105
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,720
maybe even whole brain and that's crucial because it may allow us to begin to

106
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,520
correlate cerebral neurophysiology with what analysts call meaning

107
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,720
and meaning is a tricky thing because one it's mind

108
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,840
number two it may be unconscious as well as conscious

109
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,280
number three big point it's symbolically presented

110
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,360
it's symbolically represented and when that happens

111
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,880
something's happening in the brain both in word presentations and thing

112
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,120
presentations that stores this meaning for us

113
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,120
but it isn't mind it is brain and as analysts we deal with very

114
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,080
paradoxical fear which is called usually anxiety

115
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,040
fear being something that has happened or about to happen

116
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,440
anxiety being something you worry about that it might happen

117
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,840
and the anxieties that we look at as analysts may be unconscious in their

118
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,280
contents are often paradoxical patient fear what is not

119
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,520
not just for most people or even more so they fear

120
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,200
what is positively reinforcing for most people

121
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,760
and so we have to understand not the fear or the

122
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,640
or the the um the affect generated but the affect meaning the affect

123
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,160
contents mark solm's is here which takes me back to

124
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,480
makali makarly and hobsan who when i was a young tad just as a a new

125
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,720
attending out of residency they gave a grand rounds at psychiatric

126
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,640
institute big news the dream has no meaning why

127
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,640
because the generator of the dream is in the midbrain

128
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,640
i got up and dared to say you know now three years old i saw my first movie

129
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,560
snow white in the seven doors in the movie i turned to my mom and said mommy

130
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,480
what was that and a kindly usher says come here get out show you

131
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,920
takes me upstairs in the back shows me the projector it says that's the movie

132
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:21,160
i say wow that's the movie and i thought man i'll never understand grownups

133
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,560
this man over there said you know what they're actually rolling about the

134
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,200
physiology of the dream and began to show that higher

135
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,840
cortical function is intimately involved in the dream

136
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,640
and that brought meaning back into the study of neurophysiology

137
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,280
it's a very tricky study because mind is not the same as brain

138
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,840
there are carlots but the qualitative experience of mind

139
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,680
is probably a whole brain experience consciousness is probably a whole

140
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,120
brain experience doesn't mean that we can't have very useful

141
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,600
correlations but it does mean that as an analyst i study

142
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:08,520
mind and qualitative experience not only event occurrences and quantitative

143
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:18,200
experiences what would you say

144
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,880
how fear and anxiety are expressed in the brain when i do

145
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,920
imaging of that and and that of course is a very

146
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,720
artificial settings because what what we do is we put people in big machines

147
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,760
that make a lot of noise and and we show them stimuli

148
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,040
and they know that's nothing is going to jump on them and attack them or anything

149
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,120
like that but still we do see circuitry that

150
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,920
that gets activated for certain things i was very privileged to once image

151
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,840
this famous blind side patient gy who was so we were first asking him what do

152
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,920
you see it's nice nothing i said but just guess

153
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,920
decides press left or right whether it's this or that he said okay i'll do it if

154
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,120
you want me to do it but i really see nothing

155
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,360
but his guesses were better than chance he was it was actually really

156
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,880
he was without being conscious of what he was saying he was

157
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,400
saying it the interesting thing is it was it was not only fear it was saying

158
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,120
which was also happiness actually it was reacting to

159
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,960
happy stimuli as well and um and so it was really amazing to see that

160
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,560
somebody who was not conscious of something that he was perceiving was

161
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,320
still able to show brain activation in all this

162
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,080
circuitry that we that we know that are involved in in in the perception of

163
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,120
so you're saying that his perceptual circuits were lighting up

164
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,200
yes yeah and the cortex prefrontal cortex that stuff so no so not the

165
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,560
prefrontal cortex that's the interesting part is that it was the

166
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,680
earlier visual areas and and motion areas and sort of

167
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,400
mimicry even areas that were being involved but not the prefrontal and

168
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,360
not the parietal in in his case so that was

169
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,080
and i think the prefrontal in the parietal cortex are essential for the

170
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:06,520
experiential feeling of the emotion so to follow up on Joe's point then

171
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,200
in your human or imaging studies i study mainly

172
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:17,160
mouse threat circuitry so have you found based on what Joe has

173
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,960
laid out it would seem that we should find new areas in the human brain that

174
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,480
have not been yet figured out by optogenetics or other

175
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,440
things within the rodent brain that are related to fear

176
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,480
have you based on your sort of i know very laboratory based still sort of

177
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,520
paradigms have you found other areas that

178
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,720
have not yet been found in rodent brains i guess all the mirroring areas are

179
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,800
not definitely i i i don't know much about rodents i have to say i've always

180
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,880
been you know i don't think it has to do with areas

181
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,840
we can talk about circuits that you can pick up

182
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,680
you know in an imaging situation and certainly the

183
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,560
you know the rat or mouse prefrontal cortex is very different very

184
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,400
different um you know other primates have much more similar

185
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,760
prefrontal cortex but even in the even the differences between

186
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,560
humans and non-human primates exist in terms of

187
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,280
you know connectivity patterns and and other kind of subtle connection

188
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,800
and other things that that wouldn't necessarily be

189
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,680
you know that imaging wouldn't be sensitive to

190
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,800
or i mean some of them are like the connectivity but you know it's

191
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,760
there's i i agree with what you said that may mean my whole

192
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,200
position has long been my starting position as many of our

193
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,320
starting positions is probably from our graduate student days and i studied

194
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,160
as a graduate student conscious experience in split brain

195
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,360
patients and how information presented to the right

196
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,920
hemisphere couldn't be accessed by the left

197
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,760
hemisphere but the left hemisphere could you know respond to the behaviors

198
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,280
being produced by the right hemisphere and was always generating these

199
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,200
complex explanations of why the behavior is being produced even though it had

200
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,640
no idea and so this led gazanaga and i to the

201
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,760
this idea that part of the role of consciousness is to

202
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,280
kind of tell a story about ourselves that that

203
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,040
sort of glues together all these random behaviors coming from all these

204
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,960
unconscious processes including so-called emotional behaviors and in

205
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,720
this Freud said the of the consciousness is the tip of the iceberg most of what

206
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:32,120
the brain is doing is under the radar can i push a little bit on that so

207
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,960
if you take the research that you were talking about at gsk so one way to read

208
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,160
what you're saying is not only is that research

209
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,320
not going not in fact helping us understand how to suppress

210
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,280
the feeling of anxiety this sort of phenomenology

211
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,880
phenomenology of it but one one way to take what you're saying is

212
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,320
they can't in principle because the thing that we do in

213
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,840
sort of as phenomenological beings as humans is this going to turn out to be

214
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,760
different right but i would say can't directly inform

215
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,280
feelings but obviously in a in a real emotional situation unlike what we can

216
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,360
do in humans and laboratory the feedback from all of this stuff so

217
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,080
you know there are lots of things going on let's put it in terms of three

218
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,120
consequences of a make-it-all activation that would

219
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,680
impact say working memory and its ability to

220
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,320
synthesize all of this information one would be

221
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,680
direct connections from the amygdala to cortical areas

222
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,240
another would be outputs of the amygdala to and i'm just using a make-it-allist

223
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,880
example not necessarily see how that's answered everything

224
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,600
the second would be connections from the amygdala

225
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,520
to arousal circuits in the brainstem that are going to you know light up the

226
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,560
brain and say something important's happened and cause

227
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,560
attention to begin monitoring the environment seeking an explanation

228
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,680
as in the old shactor and singer experiments where they aroused the

229
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,120
people put them in a situation where things were

230
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,760
happy or sad going on and the people adopted the

231
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,600
the emotional tone of the the context because what you're in a

232
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,520
in a row situation you know cognitive dissonance why am i aroused why am i

233
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,480
feeling this kind of tension in my brain and body

234
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,040
and so you seek an explanation for that so arousal is very important but also

235
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,600
then there's the feedback from the body which is the key to

236
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,760
demosios theory i think that's one part of it but not the entire explanation

237
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,120
of where our feelings come from and then there's a fourth one right

238
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,280
show inhibitory tracks from the prefrontal cortex

239
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,400
down to the amygdala right okay uh well the

240
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,120
darsalato prefrontal cortex and the new reports

241
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,360
don't have any connectivity with the amygdala it's very very crucial point

242
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,720
right but it's the higher levels that do well that's pretty high

243
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,840
or yeah well prefrontal but darsalato prefrontal yeah no connection to the

244
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,480
mimic are there inhibitory tracks somewhere up there

245
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,720
back down to the mimic so darsalato and other prefrontal areas connected to

246
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,200
medial prefrontal areas which do in fact connect the amygdala so okay

247
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,840
yeah so the the you know the consequences of activating one of these

248
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,320
defensive survival circuits whether it's you know a threat circuit or a

249
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,640
feeding circuit or anything else uh is that changes take place widely in the

250
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,200
brain it creates a global organismic state within the

251
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,000
brain and body that the body and brain then have to

252
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,680
brain test a deal with now you know one of the reasons that

253
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,760
has moved me to this more cognitive view of fear

254
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,920
is and other emotions is the fact if we just stick with fear

255
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,760
you know we have to be able to not just account for fear as a defensive

256
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,440
survival response so we can be afraid of a snake at our feet

257
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,200
but we can also be afraid of starving to death and that would not be

258
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,640
part of the defensive survival circuit that would be a homeostatic mechanism

259
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,320
involving low energy supplies or dying of dehydration so we begin to worry

260
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,120
about that because our hypotherlamic fluid balance

261
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,040
circuits are out of culture or are freezing to death in the sense of

262
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,120
failure of thermal regulation so these are not traditional

263
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,120
threat circuits but yet their activity can cause us to be afraid

264
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,000
and we can even move beyond that to broader fear such as the fear of

265
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,480
anxiety of not leading a meaningful life or of the

266
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,120
eventuality of death an existential kind of threat

267
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,360
so a circuit you know if you say fear the amygdala is the brain's fear center is

268
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,600
as is often said you can't possibly get to an explanation of both

269
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,840
existential fear and the fear of a snake in one explanation

270
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,520
so it's there's only one way you can do that it's through a cortical processing

271
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,880
of all these various kinds of inputs fear is a

272
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,640
kind of construction or an assembly or an emergent property

273
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,080
of a lot of ingredients that happen below the surface

274
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,720
yeah now Joe you you have taken fear and applied it

275
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,000
to the fear of not leading a happy or satisfactory life

276
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,040
an analyst would say no that's anxiety actually

277
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,400
no that's I said fear or anxiety okay no my

278
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,720
I think that whole discussion about fear anxiety is not settled because I

279
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,320
still no matter how much I look into it I can't see what exactly

280
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,120
differentiates one from the other but that's another matter you were

281
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,800
going to say well right sorry I do I do wonder a little bit about these 10 to

282
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,920
which these are semantic issues and 20 center content

283
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,280
so for example it seems like it could be that when we talk about the fear of

284
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,560
not eating a meaningful life and the fear of getting hit by a train

285
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,800
that we're using the same word but in fact it's not it's going to turn out

286
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,600
that it's sort of a nervous to tell you in sense we haven't carved nature I

287
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,480
just joined properly in the natural language

288
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,240
and so my bias scientifically is always as a splitter as opposed to a

289
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,240
bumper and so it seems to me as that it could plausibly be that there's

290
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,040
lots of systems which if you kind of went down they kind of look like they're

291
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,560
doing more or less the same kind of thing keeping us from doing it so for

292
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,600
example you know getting us to eat when we're hungry or

293
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,840
worrying about the fact that we might not but that would all of a sudden done

294
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,240
when we're all done with our work whether we're talking about the cognitive

295
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,280
level or the neurophysiological level we're going to look at these things where

296
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,160
you see oh I actually turned out that those things were of a family and the

297
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,400
Eleanor Ross sense of family resemblance but they weren't exactly the same thing

298
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,640
right and so and so I have a fear that my microphone just dimmed

299
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:31,640
I agree with that and but the the point is that so the field has been so

300
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,640
narrowly focused on fear I'm saying let's consider all the options and

301
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,240
whittle back from there rather than you know kind of just being stuck in this

302
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,720
defensive mode where you know a snake is the canonical form of fear

303
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,320
when we know that people never encounter snakes in New York City and that they're

304
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,920
a lot of fearful and anxious people when you are so maybe including fearful about

305
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,760
snakes that they have never seen exactly well they're also human snakes

306
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:06,920
editing much more frightening so an analyst would say look if you want to

307
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:12,680
study brain physiology about human fear and anxiety you have to look at the

308
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,920
neurophysiology of meaning and probably that means you have to look at the

309
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,840
neurophysiology of representation

310
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,160
I'm not sure I completely agree with what you say because I think in some cases

311
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:33,000
you can put people in a state chemically that will make them experience anxiety

312
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,400
even if they have no reason to experience anxiety so if you flow your system for

313
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,320
example with thyroid hormones your blood pressure is going up your heart is

314
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,760
beating you have all these symptoms that are normally present when you

315
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,720
experience fear except there is no stimulus that would provoke fear and yes

316
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,040
you feel anxious you have the deep feeling of being anxious even if you

317
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,040
know there is no reason to be so so I think that there is no meaning there but

318
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:03,400
the body is still sending a signal and makes us interpret whatever the signal

319
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,360
is as inviting those people who have panic attacks say I feel like I'm going to

320
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,600
die

321
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,320
yes but but they have that's different because they have a

322
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,720
condition that makes them have panic attacks but I'm telling you is if you

323
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,120
do that to a perfectly you know normally if there is a person a healthy person

324
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,680
who is feeling well you give them this medicine and then suddenly they will have

325
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,320
this huge surge of anxiety and that I think is interesting because because

326
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,520
it also shows that things can just arise from body signals into the

327
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:46,360
absolutely fear-promised actoma but often either it's true free-floating

328
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,520
anxiety which is rare or the person even though they know it's physical

329
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,520
has a mental experience of it it has a representation to it

330
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,760
they can say or what does that feel like feels like I'm going to die

331
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,280
feels like I'm suffocating feels like I'm falling

332
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,920
no but what does that tell you what that tells you and it

333
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,600
means you could say anything wait a minute you could say anything at your

334
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,760
analyst yes you could say anything but what you do say

335
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,320
may be actually influenced by who you are right

336
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,320
and the question maybe so maybe what you heard

337
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,840
maybe you heard people who are panic attacks think they're dying so when you

338
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,360
have a panic I think I'm going to be dying they don't necessarily think

339
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,840
they're dying they say it feels like they're dying right but maybe you have

340
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,120
you know especially in this as you go on the internet it says people who are

341
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,600
panic attacks they think it feels like dying

342
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,280
it doesn't matter if they say it's another one would be like a lollipop

343
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,960
that's fine we're not talking about the content the specific content

344
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,760
but only that affect in human beings tends to have a content

345
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,720
and that if you want to understand the human experience

346
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,960
of affect you have to understand what Joe has already said

347
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,520
that there are links between cognition and affect and physiology

348
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,040
that the package deal in humans tends to be represented

349
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,480
in that package deal and they will express it we call that package deal in

350
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,080
human beings meaning the meaning of the affect

351
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,080
Prancing or psychiatrist and the neuroscientist what are you like

352
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,080
it's hard to say because I'm actually a neuroscientist I've actually it's much

353
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,200
easier for me to think about what I was actually thinking about as you were

354
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,680
saying this was actually about there's a certain group of patients that were

355
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,160
studied at the University of Iowa who basically had congenital lesions of

356
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,040
their amygdala you're familiar with these courses

357
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,960
and and that recently there was a paper that came out a couple years ago that

358
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,320
if they were given some type of carbon dioxide sort of

359
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,800
inhalation they actually felt for the first time a fearful response

360
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,120
we would or at least they had what looked like a physician's first time

361
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,880
so it wasn't there no that it was just showing that they could feel

362
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,000
they could have a physiological response too

363
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,760
but did you look for those people they still have

364
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,320
they still felt fear in some on other things like as you said

365
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,320
these are great subjects because they have thoughts that they probably have

366
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,160
fears that their life has no meaning or various other things

367
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,200
you know but I mean that's part of my argument against the idea that they

368
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,920
make the lives of fearsome exactly these people can have fear

369
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,560
without them a mingle walk exactly even though they don't they don't have the

370
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,720
physiological response of whatever if you put them in the laboratory and

371
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,520
shock them and put a yellow square in front of their face

372
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,760
you know and they won't freeze or have a physiological response to that

373
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,320
mingle is the key to the output yes those to the circumstances

374
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,520
that's a tremendous response but if you interview them they will actually say

375
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,520
right if i mean list felt actually um is it

376
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,160
my you showed this and with Adam Anderson i think in 2002

377
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,800
it didn't get as much attention as the the Iowa paper more recently but it's

378
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,000
the same the fact that you can have the amygdala is not involved in the

379
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,880
experience of these emotional responses i mean these emotional states but

380
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,000
only in the expression but i actually prefer to think of their mingle as a

381
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,800
relevance the factor as has been proposed by some people

382
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,440
because i think it's it's been it's present in a lot of tests that i do

383
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,360
for them if i just show neutral faces versus objects

384
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,680
faces are more relevant to us because the biological stimuli i get a mingle

385
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,960
activation even if there is no fear involved in those things

386
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,880
so i think it's it's we we need to broaden our view that we were talking

387
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,960
about fear so we talk about the amygdala but there's a dozen parts of the

388
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,160
amygdala take only the lateral nucleus of the

389
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,360
amygdala that we can divide into three parts

390
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,680
uh one that is involved in plasticity and learning another that's

391
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,200
involved in the transmission to other amygdala errors and so forth

392
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,840
so the circuitry is i mean in an imaging study

393
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,600
you can see you know positive and negative and all of that and in the

394
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,880
blob called the amygdala but when we get into the detail and that's why the

395
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,440
animal studies are important we can see the circuitry

396
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,040
cells that will respond to positive but not negative and so forth so at a

397
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,720
subtle level of micro wiring there are these

398
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,960
distinctions so you know what what it is is

399
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,000
you know we i think what we have to think about is

400
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:35,720
a circuit that is detecting threats by predators versus

401
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,200
circuits that are responding to positive incentives

402
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,720
versus circuits that are responding to uh

403
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,320
dehydration or changes in temperature all of those are going to

404
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,200
you know may overlap but they're also going to be criss-crossing

405
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,440
and you're not going to be able to pick that up through uh

406
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,960
through you know crude imaging technology

407
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,400
crude where it is today but you know i think the

408
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,960
i mean it's less crucial it's less crucial

409
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,280
the usual idea is that you can the ultimate resolution of the magnet will

410
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,760
be somewhere along with the idea of a cubic millimeter right?

411
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,800
yeah and having that is a very tricky part because you have all kind of things

412
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,760
around that that makes it difficult yeah like one of the early studies of

413
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,800
mark reichl's that implicate the amygdala turned out to be jaw muscle

414
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,080
never rather than the amygdala i believe i got to know you're

415
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,520
saying something so important which is the complexity even of the

416
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,560
amygdala right the complexity of the brain and how its

417
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,040
function is over determined and multi-determined

418
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,280
which is an analytic concept well they're based on froid

419
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:44,600
and it's a basic physiological fact about the human brain

420
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,560
and how it functions

421
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,520
i wanted to ask you something Joe you said that

422
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:01,160
people take the tranquilizers and it doesn't

423
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,800
take away their anxiety SSRI it's even more interested i didn't say

424
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,880
tranquilizer it's an anti-frantic look i said SSRI's

425
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,560
so what about when you take actual tranquilizer

426
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,560
anti-anxiety medication so okay i mean we get it now we get into the

427
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,680
details so there are receptors for benzodiazepines and

428
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,880
prefrontal areas as well as the amygdala all over the brain

429
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,720
so the question is two questions i guess one is

430
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,000
when a person is feeling less anxious on the benzodiazepine

431
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,920
is that because one the benzodiazepine has

432
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,480
specifically reduced anxiety or is there a more general

433
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,080
change of emotional processing and if it's

434
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,520
uh a second question would be is it because

435
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,400
you've changed emotional processing per se

436
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,360
or because you've changed the cognitive underpinnings

437
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,280
of that emotional processing by blunning activity you know

438
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,800
benzodiazepines or GABA agonists so they blunt

439
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,880
activity wherever they bind so if you blunt cognitive processes that are

440
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,960
involved in the assembly of higher thoughts or even

441
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,360
fears and anxieties and prefrontal cortex then you're going to feel less

442
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,240
fearful anxious but have you done that by directly

443
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,960
changing anxiety you might say okay as a

444
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,560
therapist it doesn't matter you know if it works it works that's great

445
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,960
but as a scientist you want to know why it's working

446
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,880
and is it doing what you say it does because that's what's led to

447
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,040
billions of dollars being spent trying to make animals less

448
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,680
timid in these behavioral situations to find drugs that can make people less

449
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,800
people less fearful or anxious you think prance is a bad

450
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,080
i still am amazed as a as a psychiatrist and as an

451
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,040
nurse scientist that we don't actually know where

452
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:57,240
where the site of or what circuit or what network is being affected by the

453
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,200
events of the as we've been giving them for decades

454
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,160
and you would think that we would there would have been a conditional receptor

455
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,800
knockout mouse that would have been done at some point

456
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,840
but for some reason that has not been because it was

457
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,680
I mean the pharmaceutical industry moves in the direction of

458
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,400
okay we've got this drug yes let's get the next one

459
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,280
with you know tweak to it they'll make more money right yeah

460
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,360
so they're not going to figure it out they're not going to figure it out

461
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,680
so scientists have to do that and but look at it you'll have a certain piece of

462
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,680
data for you I took once a benzo librarium for a

463
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,200
plane flight yes my brother met me he said to my

464
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,560
wife the plane landed at noon eric landed at one

465
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,120
well it wasn't only fear of us the fear it was a wow

466
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,800
a really good feeling well we're on the subject of ethics for

467
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,400
example giving people drugs we don't really know how they work for the last

468
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,880
decades and we used to give people aspirin

469
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,640
and on this note of social anxiety I don't often have the chance to talk to

470
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,240
people in the clinical world so I'm interested in this story for example

471
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,800
about the introvert who we medicate so that they go to parties which they

472
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,440
subsequently presumably are you know are very difficult for them

473
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,080
right because they're introverts so they actually don't really like

474
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,840
going to these sort of social events right and one way to read introversion

475
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,200
is that's Darwin's way of saying you know what you should maybe devote your

476
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,720
attention to the non-social stuff because whatever the social stuff is doing for

477
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,680
you it was really not working out so there might be other ways

478
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,600
should we should we be suppressing anxiety at the point where we get people

479
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,480
into situations which are subsequently going to be

480
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,560
unpleasant even if i may maladaptive for them

481
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,520
is this something that we do in the clinical community i i was not aware

482
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,480
other than yeah i was aware that we give people all the time medications which

483
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,480
we don't understand how they work that's cool with that it's called

484
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,360
being a doctor yeah

485
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,800
i know i've always i've always been impressed with my friends over the

486
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
medical community it's even if they go to they are to

487
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,160
empiricism we haven't even known to ask that question because it's all

488
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,920
seemed like one thing in the brain you know fear and anxiety like

489
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,840
fear center anxiety center happiness but there are some things that

490
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,520
are a touch more specific i don't know how they work

491
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,560
but people who have stage fright they respond to in the raves

492
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,240
i think that has not become uh solid as it used to be

493
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,680
and also what response does that mean the subsequent studies have not been

494
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,560
this clear and the question is what response to enduro

495
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,560
the tachycardia the sweating that response the tremor

496
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,440
that response to enduro they then have to say if they can

497
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,240
wow nobody can now see that i'm anxious and the anxiety may

498
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,320
in certain people fade because of that

499
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,240
or maybe because you don't get this body response you feel better because you

500
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,840
don't get those signals but that's the key

501
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,240
that's the previous understanding what you're saying that there's new

502
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,560
sort of doubt right that this is why i actually think that enduro does work

503
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,440
because did you take some deploy

504
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,920
no but if we have um if we condition rats in a certain way

505
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:15,320
that make them avoid situations um we find that there's a group

506
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,680
of about 20 that never acquire the response but if we inject

507
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,440
propanolol and enduro directly into their central amygdala which controls the

508
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,200
outputs to the freezing and all that the animals stop freezing

509
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,840
and start performing the response so they can now approach the threats and

510
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,560
and so forth so it has this in the traditional sense an anti-

511
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,640
anxiety effect in terms of behavior right but i wouldn't call that

512
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,400
anxiety we call that reduced uh defensive behavior reduced

513
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,880
behavioral inhibition um so the you could i mean that would be

514
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,280
consistent with the effects of enduro given to people

515
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,680
you give it to them and they're more willing to go

516
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:02,680
on stage and and perform so whether they i mean in and the the body feedback and

517
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,120
all of that that's suppressed would indirectly

518
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,640
make you feel less anxious even if the enduro itself is not directly

519
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,560
reducing your anxiety all right i wanted to get your opinion

520
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,280
what did you think of the recent study that came out

521
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,720
about giving instance we're talking about enduro where they did where they

522
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,080
were conditioning humans who had a spider phobia

523
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,120
too and then they sort of brought up they

524
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,320
did essentially a reconciliation type experiment

525
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,440
where they gave the enduro during that window did you actually

526
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,320
we were a window was this the uh Dutch study?

527
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,200
yes exactly i'm not going to comment on that

528
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,200
i mean that there's some issues i don't want to go

529
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,080
the experience in terms of experimental design

530
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,120
in general yeah okay

531
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,960
but a couple of drugs we don't know how they work and and why they work

532
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,400
have you seen this study that showed that paracetamol

533
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,360
which is something you'll take for pain actually

534
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,400
alleviate social pain in these games where you

535
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,680
you know give the ball to people and ignore them and so forth and i thought

536
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,520
i was also something that's interesting in terms of

537
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,560
circuitry is interacting and and responding because who would think of

538
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,440
paracetamol as a things i already think do they know how it works or

539
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,400
we don't know how i mean it's a cop's two inhibitor it's an interesting

540
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,840
but but it's nobody really completely understand how paracetamol works i think

541
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:35,000
yeah currently at Cornell we're doing a there's a clinical trial which we're

542
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,560
doing i'm a sort of a very small member of this

543
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,280
clinical trial but it essentially is looking at

544
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,880
people with post-traumatic stress disorder and this was a

545
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,440
an anti-tuberculous drug called desyclocirian it had gone by the trade

546
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,280
named ceramysin and it had previously been thought of

547
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,840
by serendipity to be actually opening up the the glutamate

548
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,000
and mda channel but what people have found is that it can be given a short

549
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,200
time periods as a cognitive enhancer and so what

550
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,920
what the trial we're doing is we're actually giving them

551
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,680
about 45 minutes or an hour before their cognitive behavioral exposure

552
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,440
treatment they get this drug and or a placebo

553
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,800
and then they do their exposure treatment so we're actually going to see

554
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,280
whether this works this has been all been very well

555
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,360
worked up by mike davis a researcher at Emory University

556
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,840
in rats but this is one that had been initially been worked by karaa wrestler

557
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:34,280
to decrease phobias of fear of heights but now we're going to do something

558
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,160
much more complicated in looking at something that is

559
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,440
even even though post-traumatic stress disorder is considered to be

560
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,160
something that has elements of fear and anxiety

561
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,600
it's so much more complicated than that and i think we're going to see whether

562
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,800
or not this at least helps the it's not the it's not

563
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,520
model therapy for the PTSD but it's actually going to be used in conjunction

564
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,720
with exposure therapy i think the and there's been a few meta

565
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,760
analysis recently that suggests the effects they're like

566
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,640
many things you get an effect in the first study right then the biggest

567
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,440
effect now it's uh start a fall start a fall

568
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,480
apart so that'd be interesting let's see what you

569
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,640
get on the meta analysis in the voted models or in the humans i know in

570
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,720
humans uh a lot of um stuff on hoffman and uh mike

571
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,320
mike lotto at the uh have done a lot of that

572
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,440
it seems that the things that don't work for

573
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,440
desyclic serine are things like snake phobias like if you

574
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,000
if you have a if you have some type of certain phobias are not as amenable

575
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,280
to this but again we don't actually know where this

576
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,000
works there have been some studies that suggested

577
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,040
effects both the amygdala it's whatever firing rates in both the amygdala and

578
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,680
also the prefrontal cortex i don't think it's been

579
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,960
as clearly mapped out unless i've missed some paper

580
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,240
yeah but that would go along with representation

581
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,800
right meaning the significance of yes that's according to a

582
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,240
prefrontal concept or i can still say that because i'm arguing against that

583
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,200
whole concept yeah so i'm just going to take a

584
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,760
moment and i have a new book out called anxious

585
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,200
uh little promotion in the in the book um one of the things i

586
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,560
propose is that you know that because the if in fact the

587
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,840
conscious experience of fear is distinct from these more basic

588
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,920
threat processing circuits um we might

589
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,920
profitably approach exposure therapy by directly attacking the amygdala

590
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,960
independent of conscious awareness by using subliminal

591
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,560
presentations of the cs of the the spider the snake or whatever

592
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,240
and reducing amygdala's response is outside of consciousness

593
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,240
then do conscious exposure therapy and then do

594
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,320
psychotherapy to help the person cope with the situation kind of a three-point

595
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,400
plan what do you think of that it's uh but look i think that's potentially

596
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,640
terrific and analyst would either after you're done or before

597
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:07,000
or instead of ask the question why is this person afraid of spiders

598
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,240
do they have a traumatic history with spiders many don't but what do spiders

599
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,800
mean to them if you will what is the what activates

600
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,480
the affect circuit what's the affect meaning

601
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,160
and then get the story of that so that the person themselves

602
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,760
in a certain other circuit cognitive more cognitive circuit

603
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:32,040
understand something about the symbolic representation spider

604
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,360
and may deal with the actual elements of what they are afraid of behind the

605
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:44,040
spider image that is crucial suggestion is a very very powerful tool so

606
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,120
you can change things by suggestion is the equivalent of placebo

607
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,040
so and i think it's always a very powerful thing you can see it in the

608
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,800
brain you're changing the terms of the discussion from is there meaning

609
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,320
to how do you know the meaning and does the meaning work i was addressing

610
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,520
only that there is a symbolic representation well

611
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:09,000
that's all but if you take anybody any student that comes and you

612
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,760
put them in a magnet and you show them subliminal images of snakes

613
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,720
you'll see they're all fear circuitry that lights up

614
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,640
it's has the meaning to them do you think

615
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,560
the snakes the fear of snake it's coming because of a meaning

616
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,560
or do you think it's just yeah don't you think that that people feel oh my god

617
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,440
the snake might bite me or get inside me or they don't know it's there

618
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,360
no you rapidly show it okay now we're talking about the analyst view of the

619
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,720
unconscious they don't know it's there yes that's right

620
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:43,800
the whole analytic theory of human mental function and neurodic pathology

621
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,640
is that there are aspects of meaning of it of which we're not aware

622
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,560
and all of the analytical literature on techniques it talks about how to make

623
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,240
that unconscious conscious maybe it's baloney maybe it doesn't work maybe it's

624
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,120
just placebo different question the idea however the analytic idea

625
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,920
is human meaning is there and maybe unconscious

626
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,040
sorry my point is not that I might show you show snakes to anybody

627
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,480
and anybody will have these reactions because of the meaning of snakes

628
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,680
so you mean that you think everybody has a problem with snakes because of their

629
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,200
history no no no no everybody's afraid of falling

630
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,280
but the falling is conceived of representationally

631
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,280
it's not just stimulus reflex that's all i'm saying but what i

632
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,000
understood this to be would be that joe was throwing out that there should be

633
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,440
a clinical trial where you do treatment as usual or to add on top of it

634
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,720
this type of subliminal

635
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,720
it's a normal reaction that's that's we evolved

636
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,480
of course representation of things that are dangerous for us

637
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,120
snakes spiders hides etc so i think that's that's a normal thing to have a

638
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,520
reaction to when it becomes a problem that interferes with your daily action

639
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,720
then it's a problem that you need to solve but but otherwise i think it's a

640
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,760
normal thing that we have it's like we see faces everywhere

641
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,080
we are we we can see objects that look like a face

642
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,720
and in 170 milliseconds you will activate the areas of your brain that

643
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,880
normally sees real faces because you treat

644
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:24,520
yes that's why that's all i'm saying that's all i'm saying that's the design

645
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,160
yeah you can and and that's why babies orient to faces after just a few

646
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,880
minutes of life because we have this sub-particle system

647
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,080
that orientes us two things that are important for evolution

648
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,640
and and i think that's something that doesn't need to have extra

649
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,920
you know meaning no i think we're saying the same thing

650
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,120
meaning is innate to human beings that's what i was saying i think you need to be

651
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,400
careful to put meaning to some of these things

652
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,760
i think you but the way you are saying it you are

653
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,840
putting meaning to everything but you don't need meaning

654
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,160
in other words the person who has the fear that the who goes under these

655
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,280
imagings and they all respond to snake fear

656
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,280
that don't have to the snakes don't have to have any other meaning for them there's

657
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,040
no unconscious meaning to it the only meaning is

658
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:17,480
that evolutionary we are going to have to guard ourselves

659
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,040
against snakes okay add your now reducing meaning to its minimalist

660
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,320
significance which is fine but now you want to take a step further and say it

661
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,440
has no meaning at all snake doesn't even mean snake

662
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,920
it's no no a snake okay so snake has a mean that's only because we have given it

663
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,640
the name excuse me it has meaning the name is given in a name

664
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,440
i mean in terms of meaning if if it has meaning

665
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,320
then you're really the same we have to protect ourselves

666
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,440
so i would just go back to one of the things you said to kind of

667
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,160
tie it into the things like the um you said the job of the amylist is to make

668
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,520
the unconscious conscious but if the meaning is wired in to

669
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,840
say the amygdala yeah there's no way to make that conscious

670
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,600
i mean there's the circuitry because the prefrontal cortex can't

671
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,560
look at the amygdala and see what it's doing you know there's certain things

672
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,000
that are unconscious but in this thing yeah certain things that are unconscious

673
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,360
because of wiring not because of repression oh no that's right

674
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:19,480
but there are actual fibers from the amygdala to the pre-chortex we

675
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,800
like i asked you about that right and their actual fibers back then again

676
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,160
no and so but right but not well okay i mean

677
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,760
one could inhibit one's and make all the responses we do it all the time yes

678
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,680
we're good at inhibiting yeah but less good at uh i'm sorry

679
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,400
every the other way the other way yeah i mean it's

680
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,960
um it's very well i mean the the asymmetry there is that it's very easy

681
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:50,600
for the arousal of these emotions whatever you want to call them to

682
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,640
uh affect our conscious experiences yeah but less easy for our conscious

683
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,320
experience to change our emotions as we all know that's why you are in business

684
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:06,440
right

685
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,800
you're thinking well no i would just add to that so i i mean again i feel like

686
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,880
this notion of meaning ironically enough can have to be a semantic issue so

687
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,160
uh it might be helpful for some of us to understand

688
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,440
what it would look like for something not to have meaning because the examples

689
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,320
that i think i'm accustomed to seem intelligible in this kind of

690
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,840
Darwinian context without needing any of them additional

691
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:35,320
but on this on this note about consciousness and so forth i think most of us

692
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,240
sort of take a view that um it's interesting i feel like all of the

693
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:44,360
discussion about the fear of dehydration has led to this moment right here

694
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,240
you know that one that i think that most people would agree that a signal

695
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,280
feature of the mind and this goes all the way back to the early work on

696
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,320
split brain patients and so on is that there's modularity that is there are

697
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:01,480
systems that are isolated from each other again not in virtue of a suppression

698
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,480
you know sort of uh but the fact is that you know there's lots of stuff going on

699
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,200
our heads and they just do the little things

700
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,640
behind the you know behind the veil and it's just fine that they do those sorts

701
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,000
of things and i i take it but that's why you get many of the effects that you do

702
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,720
and another way is just to bring this back to the very top of the conversation

703
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,200
which is you know if you sort of take that view

704
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,600
then the question of what consciousness is doing now maybe it's a narrator along

705
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,280
the lines of kazanagans and so on that's here to tell us stories

706
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,320
but that does bring me back to the point about rodents which is that if you

707
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,760
think that what's going on in terms of phenomenology and consciousness has to

708
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,080
do with telling stories in the social world

709
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,360
then critters that don't really talk to each other which is you know every

710
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,640
other species more or less roughly and these with natural language

711
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:48,040
they wouldn't need that and which so one one direction that does sort of

712
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,480
point you is it to make it makes you think a little bit about if phenomenology

713
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,320
has to do with the narrator then maybe it's something unique

714
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,600
which again would then go all the way back at the discussion of what the

715
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,680
animal research is telling us on this topic

716
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,120
yeah i mean i'm reluctant to say it's unique

717
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,040
because we don't know but i would say that if it

718
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,520
if animals have phenomenology it can't be anything like what we have with

719
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,800
language i mean as soon as we as soon as an experience

720
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,600
begins to develop we are labeling it and defining it and giving it meaning through

721
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,640
our words and our history and our experiences

722
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:28,520
so um you know we have 37 words in english for

723
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:34,280
variance of fear and anxiety and it must be that must be an

724
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,000
important kind of emotion for us because we have so many

725
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:46,440
words for it just like that many words for snout too right

726
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,840
and to go back to your um not understanding the difference between

727
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:55,400
fear and anxiety or not accepting it um i mean so

728
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,120
i think the the usual view i'll state stated as i know it

729
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,200
uh which is that fear is an emotion that you experience

730
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,960
when the threat is present or expected in imminent

731
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,640
whereas anxiety is a worry about something that hasn't yet happened and

732
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:17,640
may never happen right well i know i mean

733
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,480
once you start digging deeper into any of these

734
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,760
distinctions you find holes in them so where what are the holes

735
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:40,680
well if i uh i recently saw that uh the you can have people uh

736
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:47,160
subliminally do something and where they could cheat or not cheat

737
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:53,960
and subliminally effect their views about right or wrong and religion

738
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:59,240
and uh if you put in the ideas about religion

739
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:05,640
they are more liable not to cheat right now is that anxiety or is that fear

740
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,160
because what the idea is has to do with the notion of god

741
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:14,280
i was just neither god is watching either no so god is watching you

742
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:21,000
and god wants you to do the right thing so uh is that fear or is that anxiety

743
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,600
why but i mean are you saying only the religious people

744
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:30,680
when in that direction the people know when they introduced religious ideas

745
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,720
and the subliminally the people cheated less

746
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,480
because of the notion of right or wrong and the fear of god

747
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,040
than when they didn't so let me give you a change in the example

748
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,400
no but hey you're not going to know unless you ask the person

749
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:53,160
no you want that one made that we're back to the movie projector in the

750
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:59,480
movie yet no we're no no no if you if you think about fear

751
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,720
of anxiety you yourself i like when you think about it

752
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,400
that's the point when you when you speak about it

753
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:12,280
mental when you speak about it you're going to use in certain situations

754
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,440
the word fear when in fact with the definition that

755
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,480
joe gave you should be using anxiety necessarily

756
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:25,400
how to ask the person no that's not important okay

757
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,120
an analyst said ask the person how they experience that

758
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,560
some people experience god as a living presence

759
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,640
now i'm going to go back to the experiment not

760
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,760
what we are recruiting to so let's go back to the experiment so i can give you

761
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,880
a very similar experiment that has nothing to do with god

762
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,200
um john barge who's uh used to be at NYU now at yale

763
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,960
that studies at NYU where he brought in

764
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,280
participants in the study and had them unscramble

765
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,920
um the blocks of war you know had the reassembled words

766
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,000
and sentences from blocks and so there were two kinds of

767
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,600
sentences that were scrambled like this one kind had to do with uh

768
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,680
you know sentences about old age and another kind had to do with

769
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,680
just random things nothing about old age and the these were all undergraduate

770
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,640
students and so the students who unscramble sentences about

771
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,160
old age took longer to walk down the hall afterwards

772
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,520
just as a sign i would call that fear inside it's

773
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,760
it's activating in non-conscious but that's an uncomfortable

774
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,400
good let's finish let me just finish with that so the

775
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,920
you know you had in your study they were responding to they were

776
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,880
being jic what would they extemulate in

777
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,040
i don't remember the details i tried this some time ago but it had to do with

778
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:53,960
when they were when they subliminally introduced ideas

779
00:54:53,960 --> 00:55:00,360
religious right ideas then the cheating was less so we have these

780
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,360
non-conscious schema that are kind of sitting there where they would classify

781
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,800
information that comes in for and reaches consciousness so you can

782
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,600
activate these schema with probes or primes like religion

783
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,160
old age blah blah blah and then that becomes part of your conscious thought

784
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,360
process because you've been primed to do this the classic priming thing which

785
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,120
happens unconsciously that leads into the consciousness i don't think it has to

786
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,040
do with fear joe's talking about unconscious schemas which we call

787
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,400
representation he's got a much more complicated you with the mind than you

788
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,240
do right now no that's not that that doesn't solve the

789
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,520
the problem of the distinction between fear of anxiety

790
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,680
but that was a sidetrack that's a good representation

791
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,360
nobody's saying that's not the issue right it's more complicated than that

792
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,120
that's not not i don't know what you mean by more complicated

793
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:54,680
what i'm saying is there are many definitions and many attempts at

794
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,920
distinguishing fear and anxiety and i don't find

795
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,960
that there are any of them that are foolproof because you're looking at the

796
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,960
definition when you were talking about it before you set fear and anxiety

797
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,200
because if it were possible to make as clear a

798
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,880
distinction as between fear and something else

799
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,560
we wouldn't have this discussion so obviously a fuzzy there is something

800
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:23,080
fuzzy about that distinction it's not important in psychoanalysis but it's

801
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,600
not a question of definition you won't find the answers in words and in

802
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,840
epistemology you have to find the answer in the mental experience

803
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:36,120
and joe has shown in the brain of course you have to find it okay so you can't

804
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:41,000
argue that any definition has holes in it because that's not the point of course

805
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,640
any definition of anything that's it's the mental experience and it's neurophysiology

806
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,720
you're totally misunderstanding because we work backwards from the concept

807
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,880
talking about definitions and that way work backwards from where you are

808
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,600
happening what about fear of being in the putes and

809
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,720
anxiety being more chronic that's one of the other

810
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,640
that's the same thing that we're talking about that fear is a response to an

811
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,320
immediately present seems anxiety is a worry about the future but suppose we

812
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,800
start with worry and say that the threats that we worry about

813
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:18,280
are anxiety but when the threat is present it's fear

814
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,240
no so let's say you are sitting alone at home yeah

815
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:25,080
and you suddenly start thinking what if i'm alone

816
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:29,000
and somebody breaks in yeah that's anxiety and then you go and you check

817
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,040
the door double make sure it's double locked and so on

818
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:36,200
is that fear or exactly sorry so for you the temporal element is

819
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,120
is free so i so on this kind of view i can't

820
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,200
fear that something is about to happen me i can be anxious about it

821
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:49,320
if it's imminent so if you see for example a rat in a box

822
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:56,360
well let's forget rats so to say that you every time you

823
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:01,400
touch this bottle you get an electric shock so

824
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,360
even though you're not touching it you know you're going to get shocked

825
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:10,280
so you're you know you would say that you're afraid because it's there

826
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,480
um whereas anxiety would be you're the next time you come here you're worried

827
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,280
that there might be a bottle that will shock you if you come in

828
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,400
can't we just settle this by fiat right so we're scientists right don't we get

829
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,320
to decide what words mean yeah well i think

830
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:29,000
the problem with that is that we get when we do that i mean that's what my

831
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,280
field did a long time ago it decided fear was a

832
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,160
non-conscious or non-subjective state motivational

833
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:40,200
physiological state that connects threatening events with responses

834
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,600
um but they called it fear and they use it to try and help people

835
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,960
feel less fearful or anxious and explain fear and anxiety in people

836
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,400
so when as soon as you do that you're out of the non-subjective and into the

837
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,200
subjective and nobody makes a difference so

838
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,880
people will go to society for neuroscience as a thousand posters on

839
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:01,240
freezing rats and talking about curing anxiety

840
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,880
in people right so i think we have to be very careful when we redefine things

841
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,400
scientifically when we take common language words and redefine them

842
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,840
scientifically because our cell we open ourselves in the trouble when we're

843
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,800
talking about things that every day people experience

844
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,960
and let me ask you my terms then so again as a as a Darwinian guy

845
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,680
my guess is that where you're really ultimately going to be pointing to our

846
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,960
systems that have different functions so one function might be you know what

847
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,520
i need to incubate about something that might happen because that's going to

848
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,080
help me down the road so i think you all agree that a certain amount of

849
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,120
anxiety isn't such a bad idea because it

850
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,240
potentiates planning for those virtualities are supposed threats

851
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,240
so one kind of a system would be a a forward-looking system that maybe

852
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,880
simulate something which might be threatening another one is

853
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:48,360
a system that's designed to take appropriate evasive action

854
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,680
given what has happened in the past and that of course fits with some of the

855
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,120
learning stuff right so so if we start to carve the

856
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:58,520
world in terms of functions instead of by fiat do you feel like that might get

857
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,160
us in a productive direction would that satisfy your friends at the

858
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,040
site? Well that is anxiety is a byproduct of the

859
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,720
fact that we have a brand that can imagine the future

860
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,680
and so you don't think it's you see a byproduct so in my

861
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,200
world this is what I've got semantics on my world that means you think it doesn't

862
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,560
have a function that it's sort of non-functional

863
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,600
it doesn't have a function what does it exist i mean

864
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,800
but the reason it's not there in virtue of the fact that it did some particular

865
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,960
job that I'm saying anxiety i think it's really

866
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,040
good

867
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:33,400
i mean i find that remarkably unlikely but you know well so you know your

868
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:39,960
ability to imagine how to build a building is not that

869
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,000
different from your building ability to imagine

870
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,640
that that building is going to fall down on you

871
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,920
mm-hmm well maybe it is maybe it isn't uh

872
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:54,280
i mean it seems to me uh we could have we could have the ability for this kind

873
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,040
of planning with respect to building in terms of

874
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,840
that could be an artifact manipulation system like that's working memory

875
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,240
allows me to think hey what if i strongly bow this way

876
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,760
um whereas but i mean it could be a different system although it makes use

877
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,720
of some of the same components where i think about what are all the things

878
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,440
that might go wrong that maybe i should plan for so for example maybe i should

879
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,160
make my building with stuff that makes the most dangerous or

880
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:17,640
unlikely that whatever um so it seems like certain kinds of anxiety seems to

881
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,680
me uh like you wouldn't want to suppress all kind of anxiety so

882
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,600
Randy Nessey who's the only psychiatrist i sort of know lives in my world and he

883
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,800
has this example where you know if you're a mouse and you have

884
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,320
any if you get anxious every time you smell you know feline urine

885
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,000
then so you scurry away that's kind of a good that's kind of a good thing i would

886
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,280
want to say i'm not anxious the math so he's not anxious at all

887
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,320
we should see but he's certainly one one of these

888
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,480
having a threat response right yeah yeah yeah i mean how would you distinguish

889
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:49,960
his behavior from the subjective state i mean the only way we can do that in

890
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,000
people is to ask them but yeah but yeah people can

891
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
lie they can but you know at least we and they can in fact your

892
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,640
work shows they can be wrong right so all this but framework that's not the

893
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:04,040
point the point is that in humans we're all operating with the same

894
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,080
kind of brain but when we go to another animal they're operating with a

895
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,040
different kind of brain and the way the human brain is different

896
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,720
isn't exactly the circuits and so forth that

897
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,160
allow us to experience our world they put a different way if you could

898
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,600
get eliminate everybody's anxiety about everything

899
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,920
would you do that no well absolutely not anxiety is

900
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,600
you know it again it allows us to anticipate the future which can be

901
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:32,760
very useful to us in many ways and that's the value of anxiety because

902
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,840
it allows us to uh try to charge the brain up a bit

903
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,240
and work on the future in a way that makes it

904
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,680
important rather than just oh something is going to happen in the future

905
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,320
yeah that's i mean that's sort of what i think too but i would say that that's

906
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,880
why we have in the first place now you and i can disagree about how it's

907
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,400
about but it's just saying that how it came about may be a spandrel

908
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,320
maybe so that you have the capacity to imagine the future

909
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:00,360
and when that is associated with brain arousal and other things like that

910
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:05,640
that becomes worry and what about pathology then so if it's true that

911
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,480
the system by and large is a pretty good job can't we can we think about

912
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,200
cases of pathology of social anxiety fear pights and

913
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,400
spiders so for example all these things you should sort of have some of that

914
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,360
i mean you can hear New York City right you know to be against what the

915
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,000
snakes do you don't want to have something that will

916
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,720
actually make you stay in your apartment yeah right so that's

917
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,000
me that's getting us so there's like a setting that gets slightly altered right

918
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,440
well maybe again maybe should stay near where i mean i'm not in your cities

919
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:34,120
oh i just ran into it i just ran into red small corner here

920
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,080
um so it seems like the pathology then is do something that's

921
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:41,560
useful but to set to kind of a higher to low level okay

922
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:45,960
yeah yeah but it was but psychiatrists are very simple-minded people so all we

923
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,640
know we if they don't leave the apartment we know something's wrong if they can't

924
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:54,440
go to a job we know something so it's a very simple bar of if it's gone to the

925
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:58,200
level where you can no longer function in society or it's significantly

926
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,960
limit your ability that's something that it does not

927
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:06,760
simply be giving you any evolutionary advantage

928
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,600
and that's when you try to give some medication it was my

929
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:17,240
kind of a of action we don't understand to that person

930
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:25,240
so are you saying to have anxiety as opposed to fear

931
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:29,160
you have to have cognitive function or you are saying it's true of both

932
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,320
i think cognitive functions are required for both exactly

933
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,760
but of a threat is the matter whether the threat is present or worried about

934
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,320
in the future but a response to a threat does not

935
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:48,440
require that no exactly just my opinion so that in essence

936
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:55,640
what your work is saying is that you can still

937
01:04:55,640 --> 01:05:02,280
respond and protect yourself without having the cognitive component of it

938
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:05,560
exactly and that the 50 years of work done in

939
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,480
roaded models in particular have been studying that type of threat

940
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,800
defense of research and that's important because it's part of

941
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,920
it you know if this is correct we need to treat

942
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,000
different systems in the brain differently we have to have to have

943
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,360
road psychiatry from the point of view the way the brain is wired

944
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,840
and so it's important to have drugs that will change behavioral

945
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,720
inhibition i mean behavioral inhibition is often

946
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:31,000
equated with things i and i think that's you know part of the problem we use

947
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,760
these words and the semantics of it gets kind of lost in space and

948
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,960
to confuse things by using the same words for different things

949
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,560
but you're in what you're getting back to what you were saying in the future

950
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,600
if you could develop either a behavioral probe or some

951
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,880
magical nanoparticle that would just go straight to

952
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:52,680
getting to the threat and tamp down a person who is psychiatric patient who

953
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:59,480
had an overactive threat response system then you might then it will allow

954
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,520
that person to actually go to into psychotherapy for example and then

955
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:06,600
work on the yeah but that probe would probably affect the same circuit she

956
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,600
was asking about they're involved in positive responses to signal

957
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:15,240
yes exactly but through behavioral interactions with

958
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:19,640
the patient like through exposure specific stimuli you could be more

959
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:24,200
specific i think that you know that psychiatry has much more to gain

960
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,880
through behavioral than pharmaceutical approaches it's

961
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:31,160
sort of stunning that our pharmaceutical agents have worked at all

962
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:35,560
yes yeah we've given us with serotonin reuptaken hip

963
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,440
which are that essentially blocks all serotonin

964
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:42,600
reuptaken the entire body there's some studies that show that it doesn't

965
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:49,240
actually work yeah close to placebo yeah well

966
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:54,040
actually as my and my colleagues he's a he's also a psychiatrist but also a

967
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,080
neuroscientist at Stanford he goes psychiatrists have

968
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:02,040
used the placebo effect to maximal benefit whenever we give it

969
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:05,400
the great thing it doesn't if it doesn't have side effect like most of these drugs

970
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,240
have i mean i thought i have people be cured with you know sugar pills

971
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,640
as a placebo then with these things that have all these

972
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:16,280
personal side effects exactly exactly there's some of these really that do

973
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:21,720
work though right like maybe no i think

974
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:26,200
well my colleagues i conceptualize is that 30 years ago 40 years ago when they

975
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,160
were first introduced the people who had the most

976
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:34,360
severe untreated depression these probably did these were you got huge

977
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:38,120
effect sizes and then what you notice is that the effect size is kept on getting

978
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:43,000
smaller but so that there is some subset of the depression syndrome at least

979
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,160
that that responds to these but then we don't have those patients anymore because

980
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,800
they're all on these drugs so that's true

981
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:54,840
everybody's on drugs i last one more thing before we go to the

982
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:59,080
audience eric had mentioned panic attacks before

983
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:05,720
so panic attacks are attacks that have to do with anxiety or with fear

984
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:09,240
well so you know there's a specific stimulus like an

985
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:12,920
inter-aceptive stimulus stretching in the chest or

986
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:18,920
chest pain so you would say that that's a stimulus that

987
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,400
is probably then making you anxious and then that's causing a feed forward

988
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:27,720
loop that's if they don't always exist that that what you just said is

989
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:31,480
involved in that case and i mean that you know that the

990
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:36,360
truth is that let's just accept that for the purpose of this

991
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,080
except what i had described is fear and anxiety

992
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:42,760
but as soon as you're afraid it more thinned anxiety right so

993
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:47,000
this is snake at your feet so you have first your your fear of the snake but

994
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,640
immediately you begin to worry about is its poisonous will it bite me

995
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,240
can i get to the hospital will they have the antidote if i die will my family be

996
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,280
okay on and on so that's where i draw the distinction

997
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,520
the snake is there you have that rapid autonomic nervous system response

998
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:07,880
and then you kick into worry and that takes you forward

999
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,200
it will be very hard to make that distinction in

1000
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:18,920
in to to somebody who has the snake immediately their thoughts goes those

1001
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,160
ways right so it's inevitable in a way in those situations for one and the

1002
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,480
other to coexist but you could also start with a

1003
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:34,120
you know with anxiety and that you know perhaps could

1004
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,240
how could more fit to feel that could more interfere

1005
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:41,400
sure and so somebody who's anxious of crossing a bridge you take their hand

1006
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:46,200
and you go towards the bridge they start getting pretty afraid

1007
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:50,600
but next thing to know they leave your hand and run the other way

1008
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,840
Ed also gave an example where anxiety morphs into fear maybe

1009
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:57,960
did i lock the door not then the person gets up to check whether they lock the

1010
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,880
door not

1011
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:03,960
i don't want to go up at the event but something i've done very interesting

1012
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,560
you talk about the pharmaceutical approaches and you talk about

1013
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,680
maybe more of the kind of homological approaches are experiential

1014
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:17,640
when you talk about drugs like all those visions don't seem to combine both of

1015
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:22,360
those properties throughout biologicals and they're

1016
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:26,760
seemingly very intense and experiential

1017
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:31,960
um does this interest any of you or um how that's

1018
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,840
it's how these drugs both combine these experiences and yet

1019
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,320
they're not steady as often as you think it's a lot of work now on the

1020
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,880
one yeah yeah who is new to us and it's due that came out in the last two weeks

1021
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:51,240
yeah yeah well yeah what about the whole brain

1022
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:55,800
connectivity under LSD but as a therapeutic tool to a lot of

1023
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,400
yeah stuff it's happening i don't know it mentioned LSD

1024
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,120
i did

1025
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,240
you recommended it and also um there is a

1026
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:13,960
one a decade ago we would not be having this conversation but that

1027
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:19,320
now one of the most important or most highly studied drugs for depression

1028
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,320
is ketamine because it is and that in order and the idea

1029
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,000
for the way ketamine works is that there is the belief that you have to

1030
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,760
actually have this sort of dissociative experience

1031
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,680
in order for it to be effective so this pharmaceutical industry have made

1032
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:38,360
ketamine like drugs that don't have this dissociative experience

1033
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:42,040
which have fewer side effect profiles and now them work as well

1034
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:45,160
there's something that they think is magical about

1035
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:48,440
there's some big news on ketamine this week that just came out and you study

1036
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,000
showing that its effects are due to some metabolic

1037
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,880
so the glutamate so the metabolites of ketamine that was actually

1038
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:01,800
yeah and the idea that the main target for ketamine had always been thought of

1039
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:06,200
one glutamate receptor subtype called the NMDA receptor and now they think it's

1040
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:10,520
the other subtype called the AMPA so the metabolite might be the active

1041
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,480
version of it but you know but these are all grad studies

1042
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,760
we know one has yet there are the human studies are

1043
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,880
ongoing right now so it's not clear whether or not

1044
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,480
that causes the metabolite might not cause a dissociative effect

1045
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:28,200
that's the key actually I um there's this

1046
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:32,840
there was a studies going on about NYU and Johns Hopkins and at least

1047
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,160
I read about it last spring on psilocybin where

1048
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:41,960
and I don't know if you're familiar with that but with people who are

1049
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:46,520
in people with cancer who are dying and have

1050
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:51,240
death anxiety they've been taking they've been taken on psilocybin

1051
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:55,400
trips and the images that they've been encountering

1052
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:01,720
help eliminate the anxiety and apparently the anxiety after six months is still

1053
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,000
not there so I don't know if you're familiar with that study but it just

1054
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:11,960
goes to the other questioner thank you

1055
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,480
so first of all I just want to say mr. Lidue you got a little Matthew McConaughey

1056
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,960
in your voice

1057
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,720
I'm from Louisiana I think that's what

1058
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,200
Texas is saying

1059
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:30,200
so did you talk about the you know the circle thing

1060
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:34,120
the thing that I have a question about is and maybe this isn't the appropriate

1061
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:38,840
way to ask it and maybe it's a simplistic way to view the mind

1062
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:45,240
but my question is whether or not minds that are considered creative or

1063
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:51,800
logical have different effects in the feeling of anxiety and fear

1064
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,680
for example somebody who might be considered more creative

1065
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:59,160
a creative thinker having more experience of anxiety

1066
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,280
than fear in a logical thinker because of the

1067
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:06,360
eminent threat right going on the definition of time

1068
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:13,080
having the effects right in front of them so I just I just be or the the

1069
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,560
threat right in front of them so I'm just curious

1070
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:21,160
about your perspective on the kind of the the duality of the brain in that

1071
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:25,000
sense and its effects on fear and anxiety

1072
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,200
I may say conceptually it seems right that the person who is more creative

1073
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,400
and more imaginative and you know doing all these kind of

1074
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:39,000
anticipatory things are separated the other not necessarily out there in the

1075
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,600
present world would perhaps be more prone to anxiety

1076
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,960
I don't know if that's actually the case

1077
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:50,280
okay is that is that would you I mean is that

1078
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:55,560
a good way to look at it or do you think it's flawed in in that sense I mean is

1079
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:01,240
it flawed to to think with this topic right or

1080
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:06,760
and left brain or logical I think that's right right left brain

1081
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:13,720
I mean that you know the the brain right and left comes from primarily from

1082
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:18,600
what the split brain work and there you have left and right for sure but the

1083
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,920
in the normal brain everything is connected and

1084
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:24,760
crossing and integrated and so while it's not

1085
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:29,320
appropriate to think about our hemispheres controlling different aspects of

1086
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:33,560
personality this that doesn't mean that we don't

1087
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:37,880
some people want more logical and others more spatial and imaginative or so

1088
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,720
forth in their personality traits it's just not perhaps not

1089
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:46,520
separated so neatly in terms of the brain but maybe the way you can think

1090
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:51,560
about it is that if an anxious person manages to help their anxiety by

1091
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:55,240
being creative that's a good way to deal with it

1092
01:15:55,240 --> 01:16:02,920
and constructive way to transform the anxiety into a positive thing

1093
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:08,200
didn't got a nigga didn't got a nigga feel there were things from the right

1094
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:14,200
brain and from the left brain in non separated laws

1095
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:19,080
we have to grow up and separate from our parents

1096
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,720
isn't language still a little bit

1097
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:25,240
language not a lot of language has he changed has he changed his position

1098
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,760
he's not so left right I mean he's still you know he's got a little bit of

1099
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,720
connection to that but he's not as strong as you will

1100
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,720
I mean some functions are more left or more right I think face perception is

1101
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,240
more in the right having sphere language for in the left but doesn't mean

1102
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:43,320
but because the causal connection are so huge and efficient and everything

1103
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:47,240
it's there is never anything that only happens in the one side and stays there

1104
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,720
hi thanks a lot for this talk it's been really educated

1105
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:59,720
the the the the discussion that you guys were having about

1106
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,680
fear and anxiety that's been going on in the literature for a long time

1107
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:07,880
I you know and I know that you've been talking a lot about clarifying terminology

1108
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:13,080
I wonder if it wouldn't be better to talk about this rather as a stress

1109
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:19,000
response system and to look at it temporarily because of the fact that

1110
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,800
we're really what we're talking about is you know the urgency of response

1111
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:28,600
and what level of the nervous system is going to trigger that response so

1112
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,880
if you're in a dark alley and somebody touches you in the back

1113
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:37,160
there is going to be an immediate response and the representation that's

1114
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:41,400
going to be this there is going to be a very low level reflex

1115
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:46,360
and then the next level would be perhaps at the habit system if you're

1116
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:51,240
a karate guy you know and you have developed these skills over the years

1117
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:55,800
then you would have more sophisticated representation of your response

1118
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:01,080
to that situation and then you know if you're watching a movie of somebody being

1119
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:06,040
robbed then you're you're able to access a higher level of representation

1120
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:10,840
and abstraction and you might ask whether he had a good relationship with his mother

1121
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:16,600
you know that he's you know robbing things. I think the analysis you

1122
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:20,120
described is dead on but I wouldn't call it a stress system because that's a

1123
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,720
whole other part of you know my pile of baggage and well I

1124
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:27,400
I'm sure that people have more sophisticated or

1125
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:32,040
very specific way of talking about stress but when you're talking about like the

1126
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:36,120
amygdala and stuff like that you know so much literature has been devoted to

1127
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:40,040
you know the fear response and things like that but the amygdala is also

1128
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:44,360
has positive valence as well as negative valence

1129
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:51,960
and when you connect the amygdala with and the extended amygdala with the

1130
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,640
the peri-actyl-so-gray and the hippocampus

1131
01:18:55,640 --> 01:19:00,120
then you're you've got a system that is

1132
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:06,680
addressing different stimuli and classifying that and evaluating

1133
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:10,680
and and then creating responses according to those schemes. Right my

1134
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,960
solution to that is to talk about defensive survival circuits. Survival

1135
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,520
circuits one of which is defense others are

1136
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,760
dealing with other kinds of biologically significant activities so

1137
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,360
but I think you know we're on the same page

1138
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:32,280
all right my question

1139
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:38,200
thank you yes would you mention the typical examples of

1140
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,480
spiders and snakes in eliciting fear and or anxiety

1141
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:45,720
and wouldn't possibly be an altering factor be

1142
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:50,200
an expertise and knowledge and be able to differentiate which ones are lethal

1143
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:55,400
and which ones aren't lethal affect your reaction to it because only a small

1144
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:59,880
percentage of snakes are in fact you know venomous

1145
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:04,040
and and and those are aren't that are dangerous

1146
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:09,320
you know maybe the large constrictors and spiders all of them technically have

1147
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:12,360
venom but only if you are potent enough to

1148
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,960
affect us and then I know if it's out by now if I saw a

1149
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:19,320
black widow spider or brown recluse from the pattern I would know

1150
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,920
you know that there were bad news when it's ranchola if it bit me I'd probably

1151
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,840
experience something like a beast thing rather than that

1152
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:30,440
but so I'm spider I don't think I wouldn't think twice about it

1153
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,520
so I guess that he was with that could that alter someone's response or

1154
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:38,280
you know I mean that the as you guys can say better than me but

1155
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:42,840
the phobias are not sensitive to information and logic

1156
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,680
so there's no amount of reasoning so this is not dangerous and this is is going

1157
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,720
to change the response to the snake and he says I understand right I was

1158
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,440
saying it's medically encoded like in never doubles that you're going to be

1159
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:56,600
panic if you see something in a broader classification even though it's not

1160
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,120
venom even though it's not dangerous it's a better to react

1161
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:06,120
too many times than to miss one time so so it's very to react to a known venomous

1162
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:10,280
snake than then thing oh yeah well maybe not and you know so

1163
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:14,040
so we are we are primed to have quick reactions to

1164
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:18,040
things of a category that are potentially I just don't want to squander it on

1165
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:21,080
those are like the reserve it for those things they could actually

1166
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,360
harm me yeah and that way not waste that way

1167
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,720
anxiety on something that's uh the time but we we talking about things that

1168
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:31,480
are happening in in less than a hundred milliseconds you don't have time to do

1169
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:34,280
all these you know thinking analysis that you have a cross

1170
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:37,560
on it or not the thing of knowledge is accumulate over a period time that you

1171
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:42,280
could recognize instantly uh in less than a hundred milliseconds

1172
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,160
yeah it's also not that simple because there's lots of

1173
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:48,280
mimicry among poisonous critters in nature right so

1174
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,600
apismatic coloring right so that just means that

1175
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:54,280
if i'm a non-poisonous snake and there's a poisonous snake that kind

1176
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:57,480
looks like me selection is going to favor me looking even more like the

1177
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,280
poisonous guy because the benefits i get from other critters being afraid of

1178
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:03,240
me so it's actually so there's two things one is

1179
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:07,080
there's a problem of maximizing expected value which means false you know

1180
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,120
you do a lot of false positives and try to avoid misses

1181
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:13,240
but the other one is mimicry really undermines these systems and they move

1182
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:16,040
faster than uh we probably do in terms of the

1183
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,400
selective history it's a problem but he does have a point

1184
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:25,080
about education helping with fear and that's basic to human learning

1185
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:35,080
um i have a question which may be a slight detour um but uh

1186
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:39,960
um speaking as a layperson and particularly a layperson in terms of the

1187
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:44,760
way in which most of the question is being addressed in terms of remedy

1188
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:49,560
um cause and remedy and um so my question is really about

1189
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:54,840
fear as not what happens to create fear but what happens

1190
01:22:54,840 --> 01:23:01,880
when we have fear and is so various questions related questions

1191
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:07,720
about that what is that what's it doing what does it do is it bad

1192
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:13,320
when is it good can it be used what happens when conflicting fears

1193
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:17,880
come together what does that feel like and what does that makers do

1194
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:23,720
and um also thinking about uh this is uh i had a

1195
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:28,120
sidetracked to the sidetracked um talking about fear is temporal

1196
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:32,600
i'm thinking we can imagine the present too we can be in a present situation

1197
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:36,920
and obviously we don't necessarily know everything about situation that we're

1198
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:40,680
in and it may be an ongoing situation or situation that's not like

1199
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,960
a appearance of snakes can be something that goes on for

1200
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:48,200
half an hour or an a half whatever um and so

1201
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,800
what's our imagination about a situation that we're actually in

1202
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:56,040
which is not necessarily a bad thing um and i'm not again not talking about

1203
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:59,240
necessarily the remedial

1204
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:07,240
speechless

1205
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:12,440
i think probably we agree with what you're saying that there's a complex series

1206
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:17,800
uh that one can't substitute for another we got into that discussion

1207
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:23,320
about the snake automatically triggering the neurophysiology very rapidly of

1208
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,600
fear but whether that is fear or what we mean by fear and the higher

1209
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,840
cortical representation of that uh which doesn't mean that that doesn't

1210
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,800
happen uh and it doesn't always mean that that happens

1211
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:37,640
they're actually related but different and so when you're describing different

1212
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:42,120
categories of complexity essentially i think most of us

1213
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:46,680
sitting here would say right on but i think maybe the essence of my

1214
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:51,880
question is about whether fear can be good and what we can do for example

1215
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:55,720
about going inside fear rather than necessarily

1216
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:59,640
going to the solution of getting rid of it yes i think i think

1217
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,000
all of us would agree from the adaptive to the psychoanalytic

1218
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,600
right i mean from an evolutionary perspective i mean yeah i mean if you

1219
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,960
imagine what it would be like for our ancestors who felt no fear they were

1220
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,520
not our ancestors because they're dead they got

1221
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:16,440
they got bitten by snakes they got the snake or they were sticking their

1222
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,480
hand in the fire whatever they were doing if they work out so well so

1223
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:23,880
there's no doubt uh at least not in my mind um that fear is a very functional

1224
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:27,240
part of the architecture we need our fear yeah right um

1225
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,800
and not just that but it's got to be complicated because there's lots of

1226
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,600
things that are threatening to people uh there's pathogens and there's other

1227
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:37,000
people and there's big cats and uh you know where we're at evolutionary time

1228
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,800
there were lots of ways that you could come to an end i mean we're really

1229
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,280
complicated the thing about complicated things is

1230
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:46,840
if you just perturbed them a little bit they become damaged and no longer able to

1231
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,240
work right so to keep us healthy you got to do all this

1232
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:52,200
cool stuff but to disable it's all i need is a little ice

1233
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,920
peck and i'm done i mean it's really simple to disorder

1234
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:59,320
very and you know complicated systems so fear is basically the way to say look

1235
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:02,600
here's a thing in the world that could damage me could harm my fitness

1236
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:06,040
interests and then motivate me to take appropriate action

1237
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,480
now for some reason we have phenomenology associated with that

1238
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:12,840
maybe we don't need that but at least insofar as the

1239
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:16,360
reactions to the stimuli those are definitely good for us and

1240
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:21,560
yes if you were insufficiently afraid then you would be in in big trouble

1241
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:24,760
and the other way too right so some of the clinical friends can tell us about

1242
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:29,160
the dangers of being too afraid of the world so that you stay in your

1243
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,840
apartment which here i'm understanding i was very small

1244
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,200
which is a great reason for everyone to move to Philadelphia anyway

1245
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:39,960
um so so sure and then if you're asking about the

1246
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:43,320
phenomenology i mean i i think that's a hard question

1247
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:47,160
why does it feel like something to be afraid i i think you could ask that of

1248
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,640
why does it feel like something to be anything

1249
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:53,240
and that's that's hard i think you know some of the things that we've heard

1250
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,480
here especially joe and others work has spoken

1251
01:26:55,480 --> 01:27:01,400
that a little bit no okay i'm still uh here in the

1252
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:06,200
remedial even inside the embracing of the fear but

1253
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:09,400
okay thank

1254
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:17,480
hi thanks for letting us listen in um i have a question that i i hope kind of

1255
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:20,440
ties things together because it has a couple of components and

1256
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:25,400
things that have come up and one of them is um let's say last night i had a dream

1257
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:29,400
of falling and one of the things that we talked about

1258
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:33,080
was mice and one of the things we talked about was humans

1259
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,520
but we didn't really talk about the in between very much in terms of the

1260
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:40,360
complexity of brains and processes that can happen

1261
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:44,120
my understanding or at least i think that there's some question that that

1262
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:48,120
dream of falling comes from great ancestors back in the day

1263
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,400
and to me that would seem like something that's anxious

1264
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:56,440
and so i wonder about anxiety and fear and primates and things that are more

1265
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:59,800
advanced though they don't have a clear language

1266
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:05,480
but they have some form of communication how much information has been garnered

1267
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:09,640
from that kind of study well because we can't ask them we

1268
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:13,080
have to just go on their behavior and so when we're

1269
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:17,720
looking at behavior if depending on how close we want to stick to the data we

1270
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:23,320
can describe it in terms of their threat responses or the responses to danger

1271
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:27,320
and uh leave it at that or we can speculate about things that we can't

1272
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:30,200
prove which would be to say that there's a state of fear that

1273
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:34,040
intervenes between processing of the threat

1274
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:38,520
and the control of the responses so at this point it's a matter of

1275
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:42,120
where what your comfort level with is and what your approach to the science of

1276
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:46,280
it is whether you want to put that subjective experience in the middle

1277
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:50,280
of the responses when we know from human studies that

1278
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:54,840
you don't need that experience in order to get some of these responses

1279
01:28:54,840 --> 01:29:00,600
the dream of falling comes into the dream i mean it's like a very

1280
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:04,840
cognitively up there sort of thing and so to me

1281
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:09,480
i do think that that's something that you know animals i mean i watch my

1282
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:15,240
pet's dream and they twitch and whine and i imagine they have anxiety

1283
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:19,400
when that happens and fear i just it's so i don't want to try to

1284
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:22,360
separate it so i go home every day i pet my cat and he

1285
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:26,600
hers and i think he's feeling good and so we're good together and that's fun

1286
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:30,200
but when i'm in the lab i can't allow myself that kind of

1287
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,640
supposition so you can feel whatever you want about

1288
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:38,040
the interesting thing about animal dreams is you know that these studies

1289
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:42,520
where they would cut the thing that's when you dream you're paralyzed

1290
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:47,240
when you and and you can but but if you cut that and you let the motor

1291
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:51,080
system work in cats you can see that their cats is rehearsing everything

1292
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,960
that makes a cat a cat i mean they attack the he's

1293
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:58,040
the they've made they have all these dreams that that

1294
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:03,720
sort of reinforce all the circuitry that that is important for their

1295
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:07,800
species so i think that's animals do dream it but i think it's rehearsal

1296
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:11,320
of of of things that happen in the day

1297
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:16,120
is that also true of humans i don't think and the IRB has approved that

1298
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:19,560
experiment but wait there's a separate question

1299
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:23,000
the question is do you think that that one function of human dream name i

1300
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,040
very well be to practice the sort of things that we as humans yes if you

1301
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,560
ask people what they dream about that's a significant proportion

1302
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:33,800
mark here we get your influence

1303
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:39,080
as you say we can't make the same cut in humans

1304
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:43,160
severing locus through lius from

1305
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:46,200
motor neurons there is a naturally occurring condition

1306
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:50,440
rim behavior disorder which is due to a degenerative process in the

1307
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:53,320
midbrain which is sort of roughly the same area

1308
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:57,400
and so we do have humans who act out their dreams

1309
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:01,480
and the interesting thing is if you go with your statement that what the cats

1310
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,760
do is everything that makes them a cat

1311
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:08,040
what humans do is mostly aggressive

1312
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,160
very very aggressive but to the point that it is

1313
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:17,480
quite dangerous to your sleeping partner if you have rim behavior disorder

1314
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:24,040
it's better if you're single than maybe it makes you aggressive to have

1315
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:29,080
rim behavior disorders or maybe we come from an evolutionary history that

1316
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:31,880
turn on a lot of aggression among our species

1317
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,840
oh there's more questions i didn't realize

1318
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:38,760
yeah um i think we've pretty much resolved the issue that

1319
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:44,920
anxiety is a necessary part of human mental experience and we would be in

1320
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:50,040
bad shape if we didn't have it um one thing that also is specifically

1321
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:54,440
human is super ego anxiety so i'm wondering if there's been

1322
01:31:54,440 --> 01:32:00,520
any attempt to study what circuitry might be involved when some kind of

1323
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:05,080
stimulus that stimulates super ego anxiety

1324
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:09,240
supposed to just something like a snake can you describe what that would be

1325
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,240
yes what Ed said about the religion being

1326
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:15,160
you know religion and then you don't write it was Ed's question that actually

1327
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:18,840
got me thinking about this whether there would be some way to

1328
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:24,360
elicit that kind of response by showing a stimulus that has to do with

1329
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:28,840
something that would arouse a super ego response like seeing something like

1330
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:32,440
torture right um i'm just wondering if there's been

1331
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:38,840
any study of pathways that would be so specifically human

1332
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:44,440
that would have to do with anxiety um i don't know anything but it could

1333
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:47,480
be there the only thing that i know that's getting

1334
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:51,400
slightly close to that is an experiment that we've done and it's not published

1335
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:56,360
but we had uh mip student taken oath and then

1336
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:59,960
have an experiment do an experiment where they could cheat or not

1337
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:03,560
and they would make money and those who were

1338
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:07,000
under oath and it was not to a god or anything it was to the to their

1339
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:12,600
university and uh first they cheated less and when they were losing money

1340
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:17,080
because they were telling the truth the whole actually reward system was

1341
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:23,560
going up so it was rewarding to lose lose because you were under oath and

1342
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:29,080
your heads were not to cheat so that's the thing that can get

1343
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:33,640
that that's a good thing about some humans

1344
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:44,040
well you folks succeeded in arousing quite a number of thoughts and

1345
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:48,680
questions in my mind but let me start with

1346
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:53,000
thought experiment can you imagine that you are

1347
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:58,760
new and that you are migrating in the searingeti in africa

1348
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:04,760
and suddenly you look around and you see many other news are running like crazy

1349
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:10,200
so you you're joined and run now uh you have not been

1350
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:14,840
not been frightened by a snake uh you have not been told

1351
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:20,280
something as dangerous as no communication nobody has said anything

1352
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:25,160
so uh and another matter about it is that these

1353
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:30,200
news although they may be uh especially if they're old and wounded

1354
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:34,520
uh they may be susceptible to being attacked by lions or other

1355
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:41,240
things but they have probably survived many more generations because they

1356
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:45,240
don't live as long as humans but quite a long time

1357
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:51,400
without speech and without fear and without anxiety or at least if they

1358
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:55,400
have it that we don't know about and as a matter of fact there are other

1359
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:58,280
species which have been around much longer than that

1360
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:02,440
like turtles turtles have been around for a long long time

1361
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:10,520
so the question of what is the use of consciousness and fear and anxiety and

1362
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:13,800
all the attempts we make to make distinctions

1363
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:19,080
uh what what good is it that's uh that's one thing

1364
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:28,600
uh second the second point is about uh the placebo effect

1365
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:33,000
now uh what do we know about the placebo effect

1366
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,440
uh when i was a fellow and after my psychiatrist residency

1367
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:43,560
i worked with the with more riser it was a period when

1368
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:49,960
uh psychosomatics was changing from being explained by Freudian concepts

1369
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:54,440
like an ulcer is what happens when you incorporate your mother

1370
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:59,880
and she's biting in the stomach and it changed to

1371
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:05,080
what are the physiological accomodiments of

1372
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:10,360
hypertension and so on and we did a little funky experiment

1373
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:15,640
uh which uh was that we we just got some

1374
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:20,760
subjects and we put them on a couch and we had them look at a light

1375
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:25,160
that flashed a subliminal flat just so that you know that there was

1376
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:29,160
flashed there was nothing in it other people were trying to

1377
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:35,560
describe how uh let's say a rebus uh in in such a thing could

1378
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:40,360
stimulate thoughts fantasies and so forth we just asked these people

1379
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:44,600
to close their eyes after they hadn't seen this light

1380
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:49,000
and let's let something come to mind so picture come to mind

1381
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,840
then they could draw it and then they could tell give it a title

1382
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:56,280
and we came to a conclusion which is not so

1383
01:36:56,280 --> 01:37:01,080
remarkable that the main effect of the experiment had to do with how they

1384
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:04,360
conceived of it and what their relationship was

1385
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:09,560
to the experimenter and some people well the activation

1386
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:13,800
uh was i think kept me out of the army and that at the time of the

1387
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:19,800
Vietnamese war because i think that the CIA this had something to do with

1388
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:23,960
a lie detector test because we we used skin resistance among other

1389
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:28,440
things and you could chart this and then you could compare

1390
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:33,720
with what they imaged and what they drew and one very impressive person

1391
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:38,520
at least i was very impressed drew a picture of Don Drysdale throwing a ball

1392
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:42,760
and it was coming right to him and this was going boom boom boom

1393
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:48,200
boom and then after after a few minutes

1394
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:53,080
everything calmed down and when we asked if he could remember what he

1395
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:57,000
what he had done that was left out he forgot he was a sort of a

1396
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,080
went into a doves after we were very curious about this

1397
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:05,240
but we couldn't get refunded so i gave up

1398
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:11,640
the thing but uh you know that this is that there is a negative

1399
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:17,400
aspect of placebo effect also and uh it's also

1400
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:21,560
it's been very very interesting to me that people say

1401
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:26,680
that we have to compensate for the for the placebo effect because

1402
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:31,000
it may give a beneficial result when the drug isn't doing it and so on so

1403
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,760
forth but it also depends on how the experiment is set up i would

1404
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:39,320
think and how the person responds to it whether it's positive or negative

1405
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:44,680
and it's very important of course and but it also goes back to the other

1406
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:50,760
point about the the new the ganoo's uh there is so much

1407
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:55,080
communication between animals and between humans

1408
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:57,800
which is not on a verbal level but which has

1409
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:02,920
obviously got complicated content and communications

1410
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:11,960
uh and how we can really learn by just depending on the words what the

1411
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:17,320
report is of something now the last week or a week before i had a

1412
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:21,080
tia and i was sitting in a meeting with some other

1413
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:24,760
some colleagues and psych psychoanalysts from france

1414
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:29,160
and i was uh having a happy conversation with one of these people when it

1415
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:32,440
came about that i couldn't talk i couldn't make words i couldn't think of

1416
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:37,400
how to speak and i just had to sit there

1417
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:42,440
uh but i'm and i must but i must tell you if you asked me how that felt was i

1418
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:46,840
fearful was i i wasn't fearful and i was an anxious

1419
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:50,680
after it went away and i started going to doctors

1420
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:54,840
and they were going through all kinds of possible diagnoses and this and that

1421
01:39:54,840 --> 01:40:00,200
they're like not anxious okay uh in retrospect

1422
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:03,240
i knew that it was uh you know somehow hazardous

1423
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:08,680
but i mean all of this is uh churning around in my mind that i thank you

1424
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:12,040
for it maybe i'll do something thank you

1425
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:22,760
last question so um also want to add my voice to come

1426
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:25,480
but in a lot of these i've been a lot of these sessions this was one of the

1427
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:29,640
best i've ever been to this was i think a really really terrific

1428
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:32,920
discussion and i i treat PTSD for a living so

1429
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:36,760
um nevertheless i found that you were able to

1430
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:39,720
uh manage to interest me as well as people who were

1431
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:43,480
in all different levels there were two just two very simple clinical

1432
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:45,400
observations i i don't feel comfortable

1433
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:48,280
uh leading this discussion without making the point that the

1434
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:52,680
it's very common right now to talk about the placebo effective SSRIs

1435
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,720
and i have to completely agree with friends as both from my clinical

1436
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:59,400
experience with about 10 000 severely depressed in patients over a course

1437
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:02,680
of a lifetime and my own recurrent severe depressions

1438
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:07,720
that SSRIs are incredibly effective when that and it's really dangerous

1439
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:10,680
um if we don't make that clear to people on the outside

1440
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:14,120
um that what's happened is diagnostic creep so that there are a lot of people

1441
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:17,880
who are on SSRIs who maybe it wouldn't be but for severe depression

1442
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:20,840
i don't think there's i've just seen it too many times seen it with other

1443
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:23,880
peace people and in myself it's a light switch and it makes a huge

1444
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:26,280
difference life saving difference and i think

1445
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:30,040
within the scientific discourse about about that we have to be clear because

1446
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,840
there's already too much resistance to taking medication when people with

1447
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:38,600
severe depression point one um so uh second point point point is

1448
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:41,880
that in treating lots and lots of PTSD patients i found that one of the most

1449
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:45,000
i do exposure therapy and things but one of the most effective things

1450
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,800
that i've done is that it just sort of stumbled on this is at the beginning of

1451
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:53,400
the whole treatment process i will say to the patient and usually these have

1452
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:57,400
been non-sophisticated uh psychologically non-sophisticated

1453
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:04,280
people cops firemen metal workers other 9-11 exposed people will say you know

1454
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:08,840
the issue here is that um your life your feelings and your behavior are run by

1455
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:13,000
a committee inside of your head and you are not invited to committee
