1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
A Madner Session Director of the Healing Center.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today's program is on French Surrealism, a revolution of the mind.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It was organized by Anne-Marie Levine, who is sitting there,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and who's also agreed to take charge of the program

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we will be developing during the next year, which will be more oriented

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
towards literature and the humanities in addition to the usual science programs that we do.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Just a few words, I would say, but Anne-Marie, before she introduces the rest of the panelists,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Anne-Marie is a poet and visual artist who began writing while touring as a concert pianist.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
She's the author of three books of poetry, Uphobia, Bosphrite to a Blue Movie and Oral History

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and is working on an artist's book called Rekulep of Musote.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Her work also appears in various journals and anthologies such as poetry after 9-11,

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
literature as meaning and literature after 9-11.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
She's published essays on Gertrude Stein's politics on trauma and art,

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and on context, and has received grants from the NYFA,

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Puffin and Woga Stein Foundations for her work.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
She occasionally performs solo theater pieces based on her poems.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
She's as well a maker of box art, miniature paintings on wood and digital prints exhibited throughout the country.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you, Anne-Marie.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Thank you.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Anne, welcome.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We're going to each talk for 10 to 15 minutes, and then we'll have some conversation amongst ourselves,

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and then we'll open it up to questions from the audience.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And I'm going to start with the sort of introduction.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It seems to me my task today is to provide some historical background, context,

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
the names you'll be hearing, and some sense of the meaning of the surrealist movement,

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the Rezon D'Etcla for our choice of subject today.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The ability to remain in a state of expectation and openness to chance

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
is the cine quanon of the surrealist poetic experience.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And the second quote says that the central project of surrealism

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
is the resolution of the contradiction between dream and reality.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The movement called surrealism is 90 years old this year.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It emerged in 1924 out of French poet Angléville-Tones first manifesto

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and became arguably the most important artistic movement of the 20th century,

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
global in its reach and becoming, I think, part of our collective unconscious.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It has influenced advertising, images, features of our daily life

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
that we don't even realize reach back to the surrealist aesthetic.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
More about this during the program.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Perhaps the best indication of surrealism's influence

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
is the fact that the word itself has become part of everyday language.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
In the visual arts, in particular, all one has to do to gauge surrealism's impact

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
is list the names of those who are directly involved in or deeply influenced by surrealism.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Georgia DeCurico, Francis Picabia, Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, Hans Arpe,

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Andre Masson, Max Ernst, Man Ray, Salvador Dally, Juan Miro, Luis Bonuel,

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Alberto Giacometti, your name Agritte, Henri Garcia Boson, Eve Tongi,

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Arshill Gorky, and Joseph Cornell to name a few.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You may not know, though, that surrealism began as a literary movement,

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
led by Henri Bloton, with some scorn for the visual and the oral.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He only accepted visual arts somewhat later when he acknowledged that the visual

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
is the most powerful of the senses.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Painters from all around the world flock to join the movement

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and are probably better known to you than the poets, the originators,

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
some of whom I should thus name.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
For example, Bloton himself, always the driving force.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Philippe Supoe, Louis Aragon, Antonio Arto, René Craville, Robert Desnos,

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Paul Elois, Michel Léres, Bezier Mapére, René Charr, and Tristan Sarra,

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
who was one of the founders of the data movement, which directly preceded the surrealist movement.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So although based in France, surrealism was an international movement,

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
but surrealism became a movement because it pursued principles that led from the mainly destructive

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
to the constructive, from theory to practice.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It intended to open up something buzzing or dinging?

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It intended to open up areas of thought beyond reality and reason.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Indeed, it intended to become a way of life.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
As I said, surrealism originated as a literary movement that experimented with a new mode of expression

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
called automatic writing, which sought to release the unbridled imagination of the unconscious.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Surrealism became an international, intellectual, and political movement.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Porto, a trained psychiatrist along with French poets Aragon, Elois, and Supoe were influenced

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
by the psychological theories and dream studies of Sigmund Freud and the political ideas of Karl Marx.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Using Freudian methods of free association, their poetry and prose drew upon the private world

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
of the mind, traditionally restricted by reason and societal limitations to produce surprising

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
unexpected imagery.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The cerebral and irrational tenets of surrealism find their ancestry in the clever and whimsical

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
disregard for tradition fostered by data as a decade earlier.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So the organized surrealist movement in Europe dissolved with the onset of World War II,

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Blaton, Dali, Ernst, Masson, and others, including the Chilean artist Mata, left Europe for New York.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The movement found renewal in the United States at Peggy Guggenheim's Gallery, Art of the Century,

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and at the Grian LeVee Gallery.

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
In 1940, Blaton organized the fourth international surrealist exhibition in Mexico City,

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
which included the Mexicans Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Surrealism's surprising imagery, deep symbolism, refined painting techniques, and disdain for

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
convention influenced later generations of artists as well, including Joseph Cornell and Arsho Gorky,

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
whose work formed a sort of link between surrealism and the later abstract expressionism.

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Blaton's manifestos speak to the surrealist methodology, the use of techniques such as automatic writing,

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
reduced hallucinations, word games like the exquisite corpse.

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You may hear more about that later.

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
To make manifest repressed mental activities.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The second manifesto lays out the surrealist view of reality and expresses the surrealist desire

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
to open the vistas of the arts through the close observation of the dream state and the free play of thought.

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
New vistas of artistic imagery and activity were opened up by surrealism, so much so that

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
it completely altered the popular notion of what art is.

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
As I said, perhaps the best indication of surrealism's influence is simply the fact that the word itself

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
has become a part of everyday language.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And I'll end by telling you of an event which took place in New York City way after World War II,

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
probably in the 80s.

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Someone put together a panel on surrealism with the title,

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
what if anything does surrealism mean to us today or does surrealism have any relevance today,

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
something like that?

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The best answer I think was American sculptor David Hairs.

99
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He had been associated with the French surrealist painters and poets in New York.

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He said, it keeps open that hole in our heads, letting in sunshine and other pleasant surprises.

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And then I thought, I would just read you one...

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And it's called, I've told you.

103
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've told you for the clouds, told you for the ocean's tree, for each wave, for birds in leaves,

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
for the small stones of sound, for the familiar hands, for the eye becoming face or landscape,

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and sleep restores color to the sky for the whole night consumed.

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
For the grill work of roads, for the window opened for a forehead-beared,

107
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I've told you for your thoughts, your words, every caress, every confidence survives.

108
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And then in French...

109
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I didn't realize.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It was about amb props to your voices,

111
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and you rallied together by earning cardards in the age of 60,000 cases,

112
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:45,680
and I'd like to spend a little more time talking about that.

113
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,600
This is called the Doctor is Unconscious, Surrealism's Freudian Slips.

114
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,960
Let's begin with an appropriately Freudian question, what does Surrealism want?

115
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,960
If you ask an American, it wants to be an avant-garde art movement.

116
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,880
For your average Frenchman, it wants to revolutionize literature.

117
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,800
But to Andre Breton, its founder and prime theorist, Surrealism wanted first and foremost

118
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,000
to be a science.

119
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,200
Notice how Breton defines Surrealism in 1924 in the first manifesto.

120
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,960
Psychic automatism in its pure state, by which one proposes to express verbally by means

121
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:29,680
of the written word or in any other manner the actual functioning of thought.

122
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,000
What Breton was aiming for, in other words, was not a radical new artistic or literary

123
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,840
technique, but nothing less than a road map of the mind.

124
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,480
Breton poetry were not ends in themselves, but means to explore the hidden byways of human

125
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
consciousness.

126
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,800
Now let's jump back a decade.

127
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,840
The year is 1913.

128
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,960
Breton was 17 years old, and like most young men, he has to choose a career.

129
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,280
His parents, like all parents, want him to choose something prestigious, naval officer

130
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,080
or engineer.

131
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,280
But young Andre will have none of this.

132
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,760
So for lack of better, and because he thinks it will afford him the most free time, he

133
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,240
helps for medical school.

134
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,760
The following year the war comes, and Breton, on the basis of not much training at all, is

135
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,080
sent to the front as a medical orderly.

136
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,600
By 1916, Breton has been assigned to the neuropsychiatric center at San Dzier, and it is there that

137
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,000
he first encounters psychiatric medicine, particularly the theories of Sigmund Freud.

138
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,680
Now let's recall that in France at that time, Freud was considered either cutting edge or

139
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,720
a crackpot when he was considered at all.

140
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,240
Indeed, Freud's writings were still five years away from being translated into French,

141
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
and Breton learned of them only second-hand.

142
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,040
Nonetheless, he became a passionate admirer.

143
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,600
In the 1924 manifesto, he went out of his way to give, quote, thanks to the discoveries

144
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,200
of Sigmund Freud, who very rightly brought his critical faculties to bear upon the dream.

145
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,200
The importance of this is revealed a few pages later, when Breton formulates one of

146
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,600
Surrealism's guiding principles as, the resolution of these two states, dream and reality, which

147
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,160
are seemingly so contradictory into a kind of absolute reality, or surreality.

148
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,120
Medicine, in other words, and specifically psychoanalysis, were part of Surrealism's DNA

149
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,160
from the very start.

150
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,880
It was also in San Dzier that Breton first made the connection fundamental to Surrealism

151
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,800
between poetry and mental illness.

152
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,640
Breton's rounds at the psychiatric center consisted of interviewing patients suffering

153
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,800
from that new category of wartime trauma, shell shock.

154
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,720
This was no mere exercise.

155
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,880
If the interviewing physician thought you were simply trying to avoid combat duty, you could

156
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,360
be imprisoned or shot.

157
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,920
For Breton, however, the medical legal aspects of these interviews were unimportant.

158
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,280
What excited him were the unusual phrasings his patients used.

159
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,760
To his friend Theodore Frankl, another medical student, he raved about the aside.

160
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,160
Astonishing images that emerged from these conversations on a higher plane than those

161
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,560
that would occur to us.

162
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,200
Frankl, of a more sardonic bent, remarked that Breton, in his nutcase hospital, is moved

163
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,080
and horrified to see patients who are better poets than he is.

164
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,160
This is a good place to highlight one fundamental difference between the science of psychoanalysis

165
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,760
and the protoscience of Surrealism.

166
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,160
Where Freud and his followers look to the patient's discourse as a guide for treatment

167
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,160
and cure, Breton's interests lay purely in the manifest content and the stranger the

168
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,360
better.

169
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,720
The last thing he wanted was to reintegrate the Analizand into society.

170
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,920
We can therefore consider it a boon to patients everywhere that whatever interest Andre Breton

171
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,600
might have had in practicing medicine ended with the war.

172
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,440
Instead he took away from his experiences a lifelong fascination with the resources of

173
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,520
the unconscious and with modes of expression that were unlike anything the rational mind

174
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,440
could produce.

175
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,760
This fascination soon led to the exploration of automatic writing or writing without conscious

176
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
control.

177
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Here's how Breton later described his discovery of it.

178
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,640
Completely occupied as I still was with Freud at that time, I resolved to obtain for myself

179
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,160
a monologue spoken as rapidly as possible without any intervention on the part of the

180
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:28,440
critical faculties, which was, as closely as possible, akin to spoken thought.

181
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,480
The first sustained automatic text was the magnetic fields which Breton wrote in collaboration

182
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,840
with the poet Philippe Supoe in 1919.

183
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,240
The text purports to be generated strictly without conscious intervention, though Breton,

184
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,480
ever the writer, couldn't resist making some stylistic revisions before publication.

185
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,360
Here's a sample.

186
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,600
Prisoners of drops of water we are but perpetual animals.

187
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,680
Stiff stems of Suzanne, uselessness above all, village of flavors with a lobster church.

188
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,960
The world that writes 365 in Arabic characters has learned to multiply it by a two-figure

189
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
number.

190
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,400
God the father's will to grandeur does not in France exceed 4810 meters height above

191
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,640
sea level.

192
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,760
The magnetic fields is essentially a book length prose poem.

193
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,520
Breton, however, considered it much more than volume of poetry.

194
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,400
For him, it was a major advancement to the psychoanalytic reading of literature.

195
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,320
He sent a signed copy to Freud and Vienna, expecting the elder analyst to hail him as

196
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,160
a pioneering colleague, but no such response was forthcoming.

197
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,440
Undaunted, Breton made another overture in the fall of 1921 when he and his bride traveled

198
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,680
to Vienna for their honeymoon.

199
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,240
Hoping to interview the father of psychoanalysis, Breton found himself turning around Freud's

200
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,880
building for several days too shy to knock.

201
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,600
When the interview finally did occur, it was a bitter disappointment.

202
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,000
Freud politely confessed that he didn't really get modern poetry and didn't see what his

203
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,200
young visitors work had to do with him.

204
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,280
Breton's wife, Simone, recalled that he returned from the meeting so disillusioned that he

205
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,360
refused to talk about it.

206
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,440
Soon afterward, he vented his spleen by publishing an account of the interview in which he described

207
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,800
Dr. Freud as a little old man with no style who receives clients in a shabby office worthy

208
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,680
of the neighborhood GP.

209
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,360
This was not Breton's last contact with Freud.

210
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,440
In 1932, the two men had a minor epistolary tiff over a critique Breton had made, suggesting

211
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,720
that Freud had appropriated someone else's discovery as his own.

212
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,360
Over several letters, Freud meticulously explained the way the misunderstanding then ended their

213
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,360
exchange with, and now a confession.

214
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,240
Although I have received many testimonies of the interest you and your friends show

215
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,080
for my research, I am not able to clarify for myself what surrealism is and what it wants.

216
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,240
Perhaps I am not destined to understand it.

217
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,880
I, whom I'm so distant from art.

218
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,040
Breton later published the correspondence, showing that Freud might not have understood

219
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:12,040
art, but he recognized a slight against his professional integrity when he saw it.

220
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,040
Nor was the magnetic fields surrealism's sole engagement with the psychoanalytic discourse.

221
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,080
Among many other examples, let me mention two.

222
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:26,840
The Immaculate Conception, which Breton wrote with the surrealist poet Paul Elwara in 1930,

223
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,440
and Salvador Dali's theory of paranoia criticism.

224
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,080
The Immaculate Conception traces human life from conception to death, using a variety of

225
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,920
literary conceits.

226
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,520
In the most striking chapter, the possessions, the authors simulate various forms of mental

227
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,440
illness, acute mania, general paralysis, dementia precocks, and so on.

228
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,440
This in an effort, as Breton put it, to resolve the antinomy between reason and madness.

229
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,880
Here's the first sentence of dementia precocks.

230
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,720
The woman here with an arm on her head pebbled with pralines, which leave here without anyone

231
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,640
having a clear idea because it is a bit more into the noon here while leaving the laughter

232
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,840
of the teeth, which retreats across the palette of the deniodes, which I caress with my tongue,

233
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,360
without thinking that the day of God has arrived, music forward of the little girl's weeping

234
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,160
seeds whom one watches without seeing them weep by the hand of the graces on the fourth

235
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,600
floor window with the cat's minionet, which the catapult took from behind on a holiday.

236
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,080
Period.

237
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,680
As for paranoia criticism, Salvador Dali had joined surrealism in 1929 and lost no time

238
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,920
in establishing himself as its master showman.

239
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,960
In 1932, recognizing that automatic writing had more or less run its course, he devised

240
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,600
a new technique of mental exploration for the group.

241
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,960
Early inspired by Jacques Lacan's doctoral thesis on paranoid psychosis, paranoia criticism

242
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,440
was defined by its creator as a spontaneous method of irrational knowledge based on the

243
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,120
critical and systematic objectification of delirious associations and interpretations.

244
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,760
Or in non-de-li language, a means of understanding one object by freely associating it with others,

245
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,280
no matter how unrelated.

246
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,600
The Eureka example was an image that Dali at first thought was effaced by Picasso, but

247
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,520
which he then realized was actually a photograph of an African hut turned sideways, the revelation

248
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,280
being that both these realities existed in the same image, much like dream condensation.

249
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,280
It was also Dali who gave Freud at least a partial answer to his question of what surrealism

250
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,920
was about.

251
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,040
In 1938, by which time Dali had been drummed out of the movement, he visited the elderly

252
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,120
analyst in London.

253
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,360
Hoping as had Briton, twenty years earlier, to impress Freud as a major theorist in his

254
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,360
own right, Dali expounded his ideas on paranoia while Freud stared on in silence.

255
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,040
Before his imperturbable indifference, Dali later wrote, my voice became involuntarily

256
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,160
sharper and more insistent.

257
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,040
Then continuing to stare at me with a fixity in which his whole being seemed to converge,

258
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,680
Freud exclaimed, addressing Stiffon's vieg.

259
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,760
I have never seen a more complete example of a Spaniard.

260
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,240
What a fanatic!

261
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,600
From Bertone's jealous viewpoint, the visit was bad enough, but what really ground his

262
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,040
gears was the interest Freud finally seemed to be showing in surrealism after all his

263
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,920
fruitless attempts.

264
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,520
And indeed, Freud wrote to Sivag that before meeting Dali, I was inclined to look upon

265
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:35,520
surrealists who have apparently chosen me as their patron saint as absolute, or let us

266
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,440
say, 95% like alcohol, cranks.

267
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,000
The young Spaniard, however, with his candoured, fanatical eyes and his undeniable technical

268
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,120
mastery has made me reconsider my opinion.

269
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,560
This was Freud's last contact with the surrealists and his final word on a movement that since

270
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,720
its inception had pursued him like an autograph hound for his seal of approval.

271
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,320
Still, it would be misleading to take surrealism and interactions with psychoanalysis as merely

272
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,160
the grandiose delusions of young admirers.

273
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,360
While surrealism's claims to being a full-fledged science might be open to debate, and its understanding

274
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,440
of certain mental conditions a bit naive, its insights into the permeability of waking

275
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,360
life and dreams, and its exploration of the mind's hidden language, prefigure attitudes

276
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,520
later taken by mainstream psychiatry.

277
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,840
Perhaps more significantly, as several have pointed out, the surrealists demonstrated

278
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,320
a compassion for the mentally ill that was hardly common in their day, and that long

279
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,600
predates the anti-psychiatric writings of R.D. Lang and David Cooper.

280
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,400
And they were decades ahead of Michel Foucault in denouncing the normative and repressive

281
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,800
aspects of psychiatry as it was sometimes practiced at the time.

282
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,240
So while poetry and painting have taken center stage in our appreciation of surrealism, and

283
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,480
deservedly so, we should not forget that surrealist literature and art were made possible by

284
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,560
the movement's early, lifelong, and passionate engagement with the ever-relusive functioning

285
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
of thought.

286
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
Thank you.

287
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,000
This is a narration.

288
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,160
The young woman who just entered, we're talking about a cafe, everything takes place

289
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:15,240
in the cafe, she appeared to be swathed and missed, closed in fire.

290
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,200
Everything seemed colorless and frozen next to this complexion, imagined and perfect

291
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:27,200
concord between rust and green, ancient Egypt, a tiny unforgettable fern climbing the inside

292
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,360
wall of an ancient wall, the deepest, most somber and most extensive of all those I've

293
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,640
ever leaned over.

294
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
And this goes on.

295
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,480
The young woman, and you notice the repetition like in the poem that Anne Marie wrote, the

296
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,720
young woman who just entered was writing.

297
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,640
She'd also been writing the evening before, and I'd already agreeably supposed very quickly,

298
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,880
she might have been writing to me, and I found myself awaiting her letter, naturally, nothing.

299
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,600
But this room, still the cafe, fully lit was free of any other presence.

300
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,080
A last wave had swept away my friends to whom I was still talking.

301
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,280
This young woman who just entered was just about to reappear in the street where I was

302
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,280
waiting for her without being seen in the street, and then they're going to go to lay

303
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,960
out of a marketplace in Paris.

304
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,160
The face I'd feared and a frenzy never to see again was there, and so close turned toward

305
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,960
me that it's smile and that moment leaves me even today with the memory of a squirrel

306
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,680
holding a green hazelnut, hair and a bright downpour upon flowering chestnut trees.

307
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,480
She tells me she's written me, this letter just now was destined for me, and she was

308
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,080
surprised no one had given it to me, and she rapidly said farewell to me, giving me a

309
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,400
rendezvous for that same evening at midnight.

310
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,340
So of course it happens to be, you know, first in a cafe, then at midnight, then in the

311
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,040
alley, two in the morning.

312
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,600
I shall glide over the tumultuous hours that ensued.

313
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,760
It's two in the morning when we leave the cafe of the birds.

314
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,240
My self-confidence undergoes a peculiar crisis, and you will see in everything I'm

315
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,920
going to read, which is mostly about love and love for them.

316
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
There's always this doubt at the middle.

317
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,360
There's always this un-embalance.

318
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
What am I capable of after all?

319
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,800
This is brutal.

320
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,920
And what shall I do now so as not to be unworthy of such a fate?

321
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:25,200
I walk ahead automatically in a great clank of gates being closed, to love, to find once

322
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,200
more the lost grace of the first moment when one is in love.

323
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,920
All sorts of defenses spring up around me, bright laughter springing up from the years

324
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:40,400
fast to finish sobbing under the great beating of grey wings of an uncertain spring night.

325
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,640
Who goes with me in this hour in Paris without leading me, and whom moreover I am not leading?

326
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,880
I never remember having felt in my life such a great weakness.

327
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,640
I almost lose sight of myself.

328
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,520
I seem to have been carried away in my turn.

329
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,440
Perhaps it would suddenly become impossible to take a step, perhaps without the help of

330
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,440
an arm which has just taken my own, recalling me to real life while enlightening me with

331
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,040
its pressure about the shape of a breast.

332
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,200
Oh no, it's only in fairy tales that doubt cannot sneak in and see you.

333
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,680
This is what is sneaking in now strongly.

334
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,480
It's never a question of slipping on some fruit peeling.

335
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,920
I see bad and good in all their native state, the bad winning out with all the ease of suffering.

336
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,960
Life is slow and man scarcely knows how to play it.

337
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,200
Who is going with me?

338
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,760
Who is preceding me tonight once again?

339
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,960
There would still be time to turn back.

340
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,920
So he didn't turn back, but it was always plagued by doubts.

341
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,240
I wanted to read you just one poem of Roto, which seems to me to sum up surrealism in

342
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,080
its aesthetic sense in all the wonderful ways.

343
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,360
I'll read it to you in English, but tell you that it's about a pun on mirror and glass,

344
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,720
and the word mile, which means the way it sounds, mile means evil, and also means fail

345
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,320
differently trunk.

346
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,080
This poem is about upside downness.

347
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,760
It's about contourries.

348
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,240
It's about hot and cold, and it's finally a very optimistic poem because surrealism in

349
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,320
its basic sense was optimistic despite all the doubts and love.

350
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,640
And this is called, They Tell Me.

351
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:23,560
They tell me that over there the beaches are black from the lava running to the sea, stretched

352
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:30,040
out at the foot of a great peak, smoking the snow under a second sun of wild canaries.

353
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,920
You can already hear the hiss of the waves, second sun, and then French that goes, Susan

354
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,600
and so go so they just so as so vage.

355
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,080
You already hear the waves coming in the lava as of course black and the beaches white

356
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,200
and so on.

357
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,840
So what is this far off land seeming to take its light from your life?

358
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,240
It trembles very real at the tip of your lashes, sweet to your carnation, like an intangible

359
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,520
linen freshly pulled from the half open trunk of the ages.

360
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,720
Trunk of course being mile, but then you get to play on the word trunk because it's the

361
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,600
trunk of the body.

362
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,840
And you casting its last sombre fires between your legs, the earth of the lowest paradise,

363
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,560
glass of shadows, mirror of love, and lower towards your arms opening on the proof by

364
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:22,760
springtime of afterwards of evils not existing, all the flowering apple tree of the sea.

365
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,960
So you feel the appleness, you know, the apple but restored somehow on the tree in the land.

366
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,080
And that to me is the way that surrealist poetry works.

367
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,560
I want to read you two poems by Elia and Marie Reggie one poem.

368
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,320
I want to read you a famous one because of its first line.

369
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,720
It's called the earth is blue like an orange.

370
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,840
And if you've read Julia Kristeva she goes on and on about how blue and orange go together.

371
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,520
I think that the love in all these poems undoes any problem of logic.

372
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,520
Of course it's illogical and therefore it makes sense surrealistically.

373
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,120
The earth is blue like an orange.

374
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,680
Well an era, words do not lie, they no longer supply what to sing with.

375
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,840
It's up to kisses to get along, mad ones and lovers.

376
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,920
She, her wedding mouth, all secrets, all smiles and what indulgent clothing.

377
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,200
She actually looks quite naked.

378
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,240
The wasps are flowering, green, dawn is placing around its neck, its necklace of windows,

379
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,120
wings cover up the leaves.

380
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:28,520
You have all the solar joys, all sunshine on the earth, on the past of your loveliness.

381
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:34,080
And one more orange poem because he was haunted by this color, enormously visual this whole

382
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
movement.

383
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,040
You'll have oranges in the emptiness of the world and the emptiness of window panes.

384
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,440
Heavy with silence and shadow where my bare hands seek all your reflections.

385
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,240
Illusory is the shape of your heart and your love is like my lost desire.

386
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,160
Oh, amber sized dreams, gazes, but you've not always been with me.

387
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:00,720
My memory is still darkened from having seen you come and go time, uses words like love.

388
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,480
The stress of the monosyllables, they're very great stylists, these surrealists.

389
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,520
I read you one last one from Elleuar called A Woman in Love.

390
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,520
She's standing on my eyelids and her hair mingles with mine.

391
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,360
She has the shape of my hands, she has the color of my eyes.

392
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,200
She dissolves into my shadow like a stone against the sky.

393
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,000
Her eyes are always open and she doesn't let me sleep.

394
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,120
Her dreams in daylight cause the suns to drift away.

395
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,400
Make me laugh, weep and laugh, speak when I have nothing to say.

396
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:37,200
So the way the poem sort of dissolves into nothingness at the end I think is very grand.

397
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,040
Finally, my favorite poet in the world, Colle Hanesha, who is a great resistance poet, but

398
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,240
also a surrealist in the beginning and in a sense all the way through.

399
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,840
This is what William Colle's William said of him.

400
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,880
In A Woman in Love, you are a poet who believes in the power of beauty to right all wrongs.

401
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,120
I believe it also.

402
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,360
So I will read you two or three very short poems by Shah and then one slightly longer

403
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,520
one.

404
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,880
And in all the poems you see the smallness.

405
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,160
Everything is about how the simplest things become meaningful.

406
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,920
The basket weavers love.

407
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,760
I loved you.

408
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,920
I loved your face, a spring furred by storm.

409
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,440
And the emblem of your domain in closing my kiss.

410
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,240
Some put their trust in a round imagination.

411
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,000
Just going is enough for me.

412
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,840
I brought back from despair so small a basket my love they wove it a willow.

413
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,840
And another very short one, this is about dreaming since we're in the psychoanalytic

414
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
institute.

415
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,320
I thought I had to do something about dreaming.

416
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,480
It's a call short cut.

417
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,560
The hill he has served so well descends torrential at his back.

418
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,760
Poor tongue salute him.

419
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,360
The mules and the matter will welcome him.

420
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,760
The gullies rose he'd face turns toward him twice.

421
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,400
The waters of its mirror.

422
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,960
Meanness sleeps.

423
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,280
He is as he dreamt himself to be.

424
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:10,280
And this one, very, very short call unbending prayer, seems to have been very powerful.

425
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,080
And we have a lot of friends who want to use it in their sermons and their, this and

426
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,080
that.

427
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,680
And it's how the small becomes infinitely large.

428
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,560
It's called unbending prayer.

429
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:27,320
Preserve for us rebellion, lightning, the illusory agreement, a laugh for the trophy slip from

430
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,760
our hands, even the whole lengthy burden that follows whose difficulty leads us to a new

431
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,200
rebellion.

432
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,880
Preserve for us fate and the primrose.

433
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,840
And the last one from wonderful honey Shah, because of whom I moved me and my whole family

434
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,320
to France.

435
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:52,920
This one is called annals fast, which means it's a sort of, it's a tradition of remembering

436
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,400
something like a memorial always.

437
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:01,640
And to me this is the height of tragic love, poetry that the surrealists are in and we're

438
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,960
in and still are in, in my view.

439
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,040
Summer was singing on its favorite rock when you appeared to me.

440
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:14,000
Summer was singing a part as we who were silence, sympathy, sorrowful freedom.

441
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,120
We were sea still more than the sea whose long blue spade was playing at our feet.

442
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,000
Summer was singing and your heart swam far from it.

443
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,800
I embraced your courage, heard your confusion, rode along the absolute of waves toward those

444
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:35,120
high peaks of foam where virtues sail, murderous to hands bearing our houses.

445
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,320
We were not credulous.

446
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,160
We were surrounded.

447
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,280
The years passed by.

448
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,320
The storms died down.

449
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,400
The world went its way.

450
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,320
I suffered to think it was your heart which no longer perceived me.

451
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,400
I loved you.

452
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:57,240
In my absence of visage and my emptiness of joy, I loved you, changing in every way faithful

453
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
to you.

454
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,440
So you see at the end, so it's changing but faithful.

455
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,160
That whole contrary excitement on which the realism in its aesthetics is built comes out

456
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,160
in everything you read always.

457
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Thank you.

458
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Up to you.

459
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,160
No?

460
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:26,240
Seventh inning stretch.

461
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,920
I was trying to learn how to be a poet and I transferred from a college that I hated to

462
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,200
Columbia University.

463
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,640
I was searching for something in poetry that I had only cut glimpses of.

464
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,560
It had to do with what poets call the image.

465
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:46,360
Now we know that an image is a reproduction of something that exists or the imagining

466
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,440
of something that doesn't exist.

467
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,520
Soon I found myself engaged in a serious private study of the images movement and Anglo-American

468
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,880
poetry.

469
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,400
The experiments led by T.E.

470
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:05,200
Hume in London, not much of a poet but a great theoretician.

471
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,960
Then Ezra Pound arrived in London from the US and the small group of poets clustered around

472
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,480
Hume had a first-rate poet and theoretician who was ready to formulate their ideas, add

473
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,360
some of his own and do battle for them.

474
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:27,720
The image that the images were talking about wasn't simply what some call poetic presentation.

475
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,120
The green car stood in the driveway.

476
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,040
It was metaphor that they were after.

477
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:43,880
The green car grew more branches and leaves every night as it sat in the driveway.

478
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:50,000
The image then is a tool of transformation that creates a third reality out of the two

479
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,040
realities that contribute to it.

480
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,200
It is in essence a vision.

481
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,440
In those days I was reading poetry furiously and to New York I had brought with me Dylan

482
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,400
Thomas and his extraordinary metaphor making.

483
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:15,480
I fellowed sleep who kissed me in the brain, let fall the tear of time, the sleepers eye,

484
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,360
shifting to light turned me on like a moon.

485
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:28,360
So planning healed I flew along my man and dropped on dreaming in the upward sky.

486
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:34,440
I soaked myself in Thomas's recordings and much later I discovered his connections to

487
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,800
the British surrealist movement well underway in the 1930s.

488
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,760
And as I got to know the campus and Morningside Heights poets, one or more of them must have

489
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,280
told me about French surrealism.

490
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,320
My friend Michael O'Brien I suspect was the first.

491
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:59,320
Poet Kenneth Koch taught at Columbia then and I was able to take a couple of his courses.

492
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:07,560
I was the only GI on Saipan he later told me with a subscription to View Magazine.

493
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:15,280
A surrealist magazine published in New York City from 1940 to 1947.

494
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,520
I was also lucky enough to find mentors in Serge Guevronsky, a poet, translator and

495
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,720
novelist at Barnard College and Leroy Bernig who taught in the Graduate Department of French

496
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,160
at Columbia.

497
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,200
All I could find in the Columbia library was a single anthology of surrealism but it was

498
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,520
a start.

499
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,960
Somewhere around then Eddissian Gallimard began to publish lovely inexpensive editions

500
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,360
of many of the surrealist poets in paperbacks that were easy to slip into your pocket and

501
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,480
carry anywhere.

502
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,640
Paul Elward Robert Desnos, Andre Breton, who I learned was the leader of the movement,

503
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,680
Louis Aragon, Benjamin Perret, Antonin Arcto and a fellanks of others, all likewise in

504
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,920
search of images or metaphors or call them what you will that could scorch your face

505
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:12,000
and shoot you to somewhere you never knew you could go.

506
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,280
Someplace above the real or beyond it.

507
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,000
That's what the surrealist metaphor is supposed to do.

508
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,800
Rocket you out of your shoes toward something marvelous.

509
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,440
And though it seems paradoxical, the marvelous can be accomplished through almost anything,

510
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,840
the places and objects and people that we see or fail to pay attention to every day.

511
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,840
Antonin thought that almost any two objects could be drawn together to create something

512
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,760
extraordinary.

513
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,520
Unlike his mentor, the poet Pierre Reverd.

514
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,880
The two terms of the image can't be too distant, he believed, or the metaphorical connection

515
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,520
wouldn't hold.

516
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,160
After the horrors of the First War and out of the Dadaist movement that thumbed its nose

517
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,000
at culture and art and reason and government and everything that seemed to contribute

518
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,760
to the slaughter of so many.

519
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,720
Unpositive had to be built.

520
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:16,160
Only so many poems and plays and works of art can be created that say, fuck you.

521
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,120
Breton, who is steeping himself in Freud's work at that time, came to recognize phrases

522
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:28,800
and images in his dreams and saw the possibility of joining them in spoken thought, as he called

523
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,360
it.

524
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:36,120
Working together, he and a poet from the Dada group, Philip Supo, collaborated on a text

525
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:42,120
that mixed poetic prose and poetry that would become the foundation stone of the new movement

526
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,920
that rose out of the ashes of Dada to become surrealism.

527
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:54,440
A term derived from a play by Guillaume Apalinaire called The Breasts of Terezius.

528
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:03,640
The new text, published in 1919, or maybe in 1920, I forget, was called The Magnetic Fields.

529
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:11,040
Here are some paragraphs from its first pages.

530
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,800
Prisoners of drops of water were nothing but perpetual animals.

531
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,680
We run in the noiseless cities and the enchanted posters don't move us anymore.

532
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:28,360
What good are these great fragile enthusiasms, these desiccated jumps for joy?

533
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,440
We don't know anything but the dead stars.

534
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,400
We look at their faces and we sigh with pleasure.

535
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,320
Our mouths are drier than lost shores.

536
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,160
Our eyes turn without object, without hope.

537
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,560
There are only those cafes where we gather to drink those cool drinks, those watery cocktails,

538
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:56,240
and the tables are stickier than those sidewalks where the dead shadows of our vigil have fallen.

539
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,760
Sometimes the wind surrounds us with its great cold hands and pins us to trees beheaded by

540
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,320
the sun.

541
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,400
We all laugh, we sing, but no one feels his heart beating anymore.

542
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,520
Excitement abandons us.

543
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,560
The marvelous stations never shelter us.

544
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,440
Their long corridors frighten us.

545
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:25,120
Then in order to live, we still have to smother these dull minutes, these centuries in rags.

546
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:31,080
Once we love the suns at years and the narrow plains where our glances flowed like those

547
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:37,600
impetuous rivers of our youth, there are nothing but reflections in those woods restocked

548
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,080
with absurd animals, well-known plants.

549
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,120
The cities we don't love anymore are dead.

550
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,800
Look around you.

551
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,280
There's only the sky and those great vague landscapes that will be better off to testing.

552
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,120
With our fingers we touch those tender stars that populate our dreams.

553
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:05,000
They've told us that yonder there were prodigious valleys, wagon trains lost forever in that

554
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,640
far west as boring as a museum.

555
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:15,560
When the great birds take flight, they leave with a cry and the streaked sky no longer resounds

556
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,360
with their call.

557
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,960
They pass above the lakes, the fertile marshes.

558
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,040
Their wings push aside the two languid clouds.

559
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,040
We aren't even allowed to sit down anymore.

560
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:36,240
Immediately, laughter rises up and we have to scream out all our sins.

561
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,600
That's just a little piece of that book.

562
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,240
The Breton wrote amazing poems of his own.

563
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:51,880
Luneon Libra, translated as Free Union, drew on the tradition of the blézón, a type of

564
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:58,680
poem that celebrated the female body.

565
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,680
So I'm going to read that.

566
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,440
It's probably his most famous poem.

567
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,720
My woman with her forest fire hair, with her heat lightning thoughts, with her hourglass

568
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,440
waist, my woman with her otter waist in the tiger's mouth, my woman with her rosette

569
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,160
mouth, the bouquet of stars of the brightest magnitude, with her teeth of white mouse footprints

570
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:31,080
on the white earth, with her tongue of polished amber and glass, my woman with her stabbed

571
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:38,440
eucharist tongue, with her tongue of a doll that opens and closes its eyes, with her tongue

572
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:45,520
of incredible stone, my woman with her eyelashes in a child's handwriting, with her eyebrows

573
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:52,040
the edge of a swallow's nest, my woman with her temples of a greenhouse with a slate roof

574
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:58,800
and steam on the window panes, my woman with her shoulders of champagne and a dolphin-headed

575
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:06,360
fountain under ice, my woman with her matchstick wrists, my woman with her lucky fingers, her

576
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:13,240
ace of hearts' fingers, with her fingers of new mone hay, my woman with her armpits of

577
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:21,120
martin and beach nuts, of midsummer night, of privet and angel fish nest, with her sea

578
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:28,400
foam and floodgate arms, arms that mingle the wheat and the mill, my woman with rocket

579
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,320
legs, with her movements of clockwork and despair, my woman with her calves of elder

580
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:42,840
tree pith, my woman with her feet of initials, with her feet of bunches of keys, with her

581
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:50,200
feet of weaver birds taking a drink, my woman with her pearl barley neck, my woman with

582
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:57,800
her val door cleavage, cleavage of a rendezvous in the very bed of the mountain stream, with

583
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:04,400
her breasts of night, my woman with her undersea molehill breasts, my woman with her breasts

584
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,960
of the crucible of rubies, with her breasts of the spectre of the rose beneath the dew,

585
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:18,880
my woman with her belly of the unfolding fan of days, with her giant claw belly, my woman

586
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,040
with her back of a bird fleeing vertically, with her quick silver back, with her back

587
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:32,200
of light, with her nape of rolled stone and damp chalk, and a glass and a falling glass

588
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:39,200
that's just been sipped, my woman with her hips like a skiff, with her hips of a chandelier

589
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:47,200
and arrow feathers, and stems of white peacock plumes, her hips, an imperceptible pair of

590
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:54,200
scales, my woman with her buttocks of sandstone and asbestos, my woman with the buttocks of

591
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:02,160
a swan's back, my woman with her buttocks of springtime, with her gladiolas, sex, my woman

592
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:09,200
with her sex of place and platypus, my woman with her sex of seaweed and old-fashioned

593
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:16,720
candies, my woman with her mirror sex, my woman with her eyes full of tears, with her

594
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:24,720
eyes of violet armor and a speedometer needle, my woman with her savanna eyes, my woman with

595
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,760
her eyes of water to drink in prison, my woman with her eyes of forests forever beneath the

596
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:43,880
axe, with her eyes of sea level, air level, earth and fire.

597
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,760
The surrealist who captured my heart, however, was Robert Desnos.

598
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,760
Desnos was famous for his ability to speak poetry during the trance experiments that

599
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:00,800
the group participated in for about a year, until some members of the group started to

600
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,320
chase each other with knives, desnos among them.

601
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:16,360
Here is one of Desnos' most beautiful poems from his poetic sequence called The Shadows,

602
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,200
and this is called The Voice of Robert Desnos.

603
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,200
So much like the flower and the current of air, like the waterway, like the shadows passing

604
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:33,200
everywhere, like the smile glimpsed this amazing evening at midnight, so much like everything,

605
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,440
happiness and sadness.

606
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,760
It's yesterday's midnight lifting its naked torso above belfries and poplars.

607
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:49,400
I'm calling those lost in the countryside, the old corpses, the young oaks just cut down,

608
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:55,200
the shreds of fabric rotting on the ground and linen drying in farm yards.

609
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:03,720
I'm calling tornadoes and hurricanes, tempests, typhoons and cyclones, riptides, earthquakes.

610
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:11,160
I'm calling the smoke of volcanoes and cigarettes, the smoke rings of fancy cigars.

611
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,920
I'm calling loves and lovers.

612
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,720
I'm calling the living and the dead.

613
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,200
I'm calling the grave diggers.

614
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,000
I'm calling the murderers.

615
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,080
I'm calling the executioners. I'm calling the pilots, the masons, the architects.

616
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,880
I'm calling the flesh.

617
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,200
I'm calling the one I love.

618
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,920
I'm calling the one I love.

619
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,720
I'm calling the one I love.

620
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:42,720
Triumphant midnight unfolds its satin wings and lands on my bed.

621
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,760
Suffries and poplars give into my desires.

622
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:55,240
Those lost in the countryside find their bearings in finding me.

623
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,960
The old corpses come back to life at my voice.

624
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,520
The young oaks just cut down, wrapped themselves in greenery.

625
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,920
The shreds of fabric rotting on the ground and on the ground, flap at my voice like the

626
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:14,200
flag of rebellion. The linen drying in farm yards, clothes,

627
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:21,800
adorable women that I don't adore, who come to me, obey my voice and adore me.

628
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,680
The tornadoes spin around in my mouth.

629
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,840
The hurricanes reden my lips if they can do it.

630
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,560
The tempest snarl at my feet.

631
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,520
The typhoons rumble my hair if they can do it.

632
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,440
I accept the kisses of cyclone drunkenness.

633
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,720
The riptides come to die at my feet.

634
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,880
The earthquakes don't shake me but make everything totter at my command.

635
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:54,600
The smoke of volcanoes attires me in its vapors, and cigarettes smoke perfumes me.

636
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,480
And the smoke rings of fancy cigars crown me.

637
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,960
The loved ones and the loved pursued for so long find shelter in me.

638
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,200
The lovers hear my voice.

639
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,120
The living and the dead give in and wave to me.

640
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,200
The former, coolly, the latter intimately.

641
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,680
The grave diggers abandon partly dug graves and announce that I am the only one who can

642
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,320
direct their nighttime labors.

643
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,360
The murderers greet me.

644
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,360
The executioners invoke the revolution.

645
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,200
Invoke my voice.

646
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,200
Invoke my name.

647
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,680
The pilots use my eyes to navigate.

648
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,280
The masons are seized with vertigo, hearing me.

649
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,960
The architects leave for the desert.

650
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,880
The murderers bless me.

651
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,320
The flesh quivers at my call.

652
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,680
The one I love does not listen to me.

653
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,160
The one I love does not hear me.

654
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,560
The one I love does not answer me.

655
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:11,000
Many of the surrealists fled to other countries during World War II, other stayed and worked

656
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,960
for the resistance like Desnos and Paul El-Ward.

657
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,960
Eventually Desnos was betrayed by a journalist.

658
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,440
He died just after the liberation of Terezin, the ghetto and concentration camp in Czech

659
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,600
oslovakia where he had been held prisoner.

660
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:36,520
Two Czech students recognized him from the photographs that had appeared in Breton's

661
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:42,640
book Naja and tried to help, but he was too ill with typhus to be saved.

662
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,600
He was 45 years old.

663
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:51,760
This is probably Desnos's best poem from a sequence of love poems called Ale Misterius,

664
00:50:51,760 --> 00:51:00,120
which I've translated as to the one of mystery.

665
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,280
I've dreamed of you so much.

666
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,240
I've dreamed of you so much you're losing your reality.

667
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:14,360
Is there still time to reach that living body and kiss on that mouth the birth of the voice

668
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,560
that's dear to me?

669
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:22,080
I've dreamed of you so much that my arms used to crossing on my chest as I hugged your

670
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:29,240
shadow couldn't fold themselves around the shape of your body, maybe.

671
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:35,640
And faced with the actual appearance of what's haunted me and ruled me for days and years,

672
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,680
I would probably turn into a shadow.

673
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,000
Oh, what a sentimental pair of scales.

674
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,320
I've dreamed of you so much there's probably no more time for me to wake up.

675
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:56,520
I sleep standing up, my body exposed to all the appearances of life and love and you,

676
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,880
the only thing that counts for me today.

677
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,080
I'd probably reach for the first lips and face that came along, then your face and

678
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,920
your lips.

679
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:14,880
I've dreamed of you so much, walked so much, talked, slept with your phantom that maybe

680
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:21,000
there's nothing left for me to do but be a phantom among the phantoms and a hundred

681
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,880
times more shadow than the shadow that sturls and will go on strolling cheerfully over the

682
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:34,480
sundial of your life.

683
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,120
I am going on, aren't I, well, a couple more minutes.

684
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:44,120
Breton whom the Nazis would have loved to lay their hands on fled to the United States

685
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:50,160
and eked out a living as an officer, as an announcer for the office of war information.

686
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:56,240
A friend of mine who worked alongside him told me that he refused to read any copy in which

687
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,480
the pope was mentioned.

688
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,600
Many other surrealists made it to the US as well, Max Ernst, Yves Tange, Kurt Seligman,

689
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,000
and Andre Masson among them.

690
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,200
And as they made their way into the American art scene and its society, their influence

691
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:18,800
left behind the beginnings of the New York School of Painting that included Robert Motherwell,

692
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:26,160
Jackson Pollock, Arshil Gorky, Milton Avery among others, which in turn had a marked influence

693
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:34,240
on poets like Frank O'Hara, John Ashbury, Kenneth Koch, Barbara Guest, and James Schuyler.

694
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:39,040
They became known as the New York School of Poetry, a group that has written its own

695
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,600
chapter in our recent literary history.

696
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:47,760
These were, and are, Ashbury is still very much alive, poets who were deeply influenced

697
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,280
by French literary and artistic surrealism.

698
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:58,880
In the 20s, surrealism spread throughout Europe, inspiring groups in Belgium, Eastern Europe,

699
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,000
Mexico, to which Benjamin Parre had immigrated.

700
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,160
Martinique Spain, Breton lectured in Barcelona two years before he published his manifesto

701
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,360
of surrealism in 1924.

702
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,360
Latin America, Egypt, and even Japan.

703
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,800
English translations of surrealist writings began to appear in American and British literary

704
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:28,880
magazines in the 20s, and by the late 50s Robert Bly the poet was beating the drum for

705
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:35,160
a poetry of the unconscious, though ultimately he repudiated French surrealism in favor of

706
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:41,800
Spanish language surrealism, Lorka, Neruda, Bayejo, and others.

707
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:48,720
The 60s and 70s saw the creation of a Chicago group of surrealists led by Franklin Rosemont

708
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,360
and his wife Penelope, to me their efforts seemed to be a rehash of work that the French

709
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,280
had done.

710
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:02,320
Right now there is some discussion, particularly among certain West Coast poets, of a neo-surrealism.

711
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:08,920
At 16, the San Francisco poet Philip La Montia had come to New York, showed his poems to

712
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:15,360
Breton, and been given a job at V.V.V.V. or V.V.V.A., a surrealist magazine published

713
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,480
during Breton's New York years.

714
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,760
This is a voice that rises once in 100 years, Breton said of La Montia.

715
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:30,600
But La Montia published very little, and a promising surrealist poet named Pete Winslow,

716
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:38,760
also based in San Francisco, died in his 30s of complications following surgery.

717
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,560
Surrealism however had a tremendous impact on the poets of the beat generation, most notably

718
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:51,080
on Alan Ginsburg, and there is a legion of beat-derived surrealists all over the planet.

719
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:56,680
I wish I could tell you what neo-surrealism is, and who is in it, but it seems to include

720
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,400
everyone.

721
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,280
This is no surprise.

722
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:07,520
In his third surrealist manifesto, written after Breton had thrown him out of the group,

723
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,760
Robert Desnos put it this way.

724
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:19,160
For surrealists, there is only one reality, complete, open to everyone.

725
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:24,200
Surrealism has fallen into the public domain.

726
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:29,680
Surrealist practice in poetry has made its way into American poetry for well over 80 years

727
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,240
now.

728
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,480
When everyone is a surrealist, no one has to be a surrealist.

729
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:40,760
There are precious few groups to join, and no manifestos to sign.

730
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:48,480
Poets can partake of the enormous gifts bequeathed in writing, and in all the arts by the surrealists,

731
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,400
and that's good enough for me.

732
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,400
Thank you.

733
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,400
Thank you.

734
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:59,440
Well, do you have no, I'll ask this question later.

735
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,080
Does anyone have a handful of things they'd like to add to things that they've heard,

736
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,960
or questions they'd like to answer, or like answered?

737
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,960
No?

738
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:15,200
I would too, but we have a little extra time.

739
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,520
I was going to ask the audience.

740
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:21,600
I will ask the audience, but in the meantime, I thought, well, we still have the stage.

741
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:26,520
Does anyone have anything to add or question about all this?

742
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,520
No?

743
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,520
I think it's interesting.

744
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,520
Bill Sutter.

745
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:36,800
We've only just read four poems out of 20,000.

746
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:46,640
It's daunting to try to make such a selection, but go out there and get the books.

747
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,080
That's an idea.

748
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,080
Yeah.

749
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:54,920
There are a lot of translations out there that are well worth reading, Mary Ann's.

750
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,680
And there's a list outside.

751
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:05,080
I think the point is, we can only possibly touch on a very small piece of it, which is

752
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,080
what we've done today.

753
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:10,040
We've looked at the poetry, we've touched a little about the psychoanalysis, we've touched

754
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:15,880
a tiny bit on the art, but surrealism has so many other aspects that we can't possibly

755
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,880
talk about.

756
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,880
It's very big.

757
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,880
Very, very big.

758
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,680
And it's several of us have mentioned.

759
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,840
It's now diffused itself into the current of everyday life, to the point where it means

760
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:28,480
everything and nothing, but it still has a particular meaning.

761
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:36,040
And it still has a corpus of writings that remain relevant and oddly enough, translate

762
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:40,120
in a number of cases very well, although that's something you wouldn't think would be possible

763
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,120
for automatic writing.

764
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:46,360
I mean, I guess if I have a question, I would direct it to the two eminent surrealist translators

765
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,360
sitting right here in front of me, which is...

766
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:52,000
I can argue with...one argument is the my woman.

767
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,960
Of course, my woman brought on my farm.

768
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,760
So we, others have translated it differently.

769
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,840
I translated it as my beloved, so I don't go into the problem.

770
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,000
You can't say my wife, because it was done for three different people at different times,

771
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,760
so forget my wife.

772
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,000
And my woman just gets right in my nerves.

773
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,560
So I took it out of the random house of French poetry, because I didn't think my woman could

774
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,560
work for it.

775
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:27,600
I think it's interesting that I suppose it's the interwar poetry, the poetry between the

776
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,400
First World War and the Second World War.

777
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,800
It's so full of love poems.

778
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:38,600
I mean, rather amazing for a huge movement like that, or maybe it's because it was so

779
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:47,440
particularly French, but it is amazingly full of love and real love, not just love poems.

780
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,440
And also, yeah, go ahead.

781
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,720
No, I was just going to say I think it's full of two things.

782
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,720
It's full of love, but it's also full of despair.

783
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:56,080
I mean, I think as we listen to the poems that were read here tonight, there's this,

784
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,080
you know, I think you mentioned that.

785
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,080
There's this core of real desperation.

786
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,840
She does an answer on calling out.

787
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:05,760
There's, you know, no matter what it is, even there's very little happy love and surrealism.

788
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,920
I think that there was a huge...love was valued above everything else.

789
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:17,360
I mean, it was sort of the core driver, the core emotion, but it never seems to work

790
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,360
out very well.

791
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,360
Well, does it?

792
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,360
I mean...

793
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,360
Sometimes it happens.

794
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:27,560
It seems to work out fairly well for Desmos, who had a lot of disappointments and wrote

795
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:35,080
a lot of great poems about his disappointments, but he married and seemed to have very good

796
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,320
marriage.

797
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:42,240
And there's a heartbreaking letter that he wrote from...I don't know if it was from

798
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:48,800
Terezin or from Compiène or...

799
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,080
And d'Ronsie, yeah.

800
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:54,520
And it's just this heartbreaking letter about how everything's going to...you know, did

801
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,520
you get the package?

802
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,920
I sent you...I got your package and so forth and so on.

803
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,720
What about my book that's in press now?

804
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:08,040
And you know, I promise you that we're going to have a wonderful life when we are able

805
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,080
to get back together again.

806
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:15,280
And it just breaks your heart, but that was a beautiful romance.

807
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,360
Well, love is always full of love and despair.

808
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,440
I mean, that's not unusual.

809
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:30,240
It's just that as subject matter, so much of the subject matter.

810
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:34,400
Also I think it's interesting that in a way it is so cheerful.

811
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,240
It is also up.

812
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,040
It has an up spirit to it, regardless of what it says.

813
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:45,440
But it is optimistic, and that's perhaps the political situation that to begin with people

814
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,640
were optimistic after the first world war.

815
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,680
I suppose it didn't last long.

816
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:56,840
And there's something that makes us all laugh still when we hear some of these things.

817
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:03,040
And of course it's penetrated so deeply into society that we don't think of the stuff we

818
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,000
do as a surrealist.

819
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:12,320
But as an abstract painter, I sort of now realize surrealism has been part of the landscape

820
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,160
in my head since I was a child.

821
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:21,120
If not for surrealism and my paintings are not surrealist, none of this would happen.

822
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,120
It gave permission.

823
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,640
And it gives a great freedom.

824
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,120
It gives you freedom.

825
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,120
Yeah, complete freedom.

826
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,120
Yeah.

827
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,120
Which is a question my point.

828
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:33,320
Well, do you think also later on thinking of the beast now, you know, Kerouac discovered

829
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:37,760
what he called spontaneous boprocity.

830
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,480
And it was great, great, you know, which means just going, just hitting the page and going.

831
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,680
And Ginsburg later began to talk about first thought, best thought, although he was a big

832
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,840
reviser like Breton.

833
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:56,400
And so there's a direct line from this automatic composition to just getting it on the page.

834
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,760
You know, playing the chorus is like a tenor saxophone player.

835
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,200
Yeah, there's a question right behind you, Marie.

836
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,200
Sorry.

837
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,240
This is your presentation.

838
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,240
It's fine.

839
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,240
If there are going to be questions from the audience, you have to close the mic.

840
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:19,080
Because otherwise it's not recorded and so the picture will come on the other side.

841
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,080
Can that be passed around?

842
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,080
Yeah, can we pass it around?

843
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:29,080
It's I think better if we go ahead.

844
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:36,880
I think the idea that if surrealism is everywhere, it's nowhere or it has no meaning is not at

845
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:44,280
all the case because it, right, I know you didn't say it, I had no meaning, but there

846
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:53,880
is so much rich material coming out now that refers or in some senses longs to continue

847
01:03:53,880 --> 01:04:00,960
that tradition or has a great desire to feel the same ecstasy that was felt during that

848
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,920
period which is felt continually.

849
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:10,960
And there are a lot of recombinant poets, I would say, and artists who do the same kind

850
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,560
of work without referring to that.

851
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:18,760
And it's as of course as rich and real and coming from the soul.

852
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:25,000
And you can even talk about, not the automatic writing so much, but about things that John

853
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:31,640
Cage started and Jackson McLoe and people who were doing concrete work and pulling in

854
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:40,400
aspects of Buddhism and aspects of jazz which was considered spontaneous and is as spontaneous

855
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:46,760
as speech or written word which actually is automatic.

856
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,880
I mean all of our speech is automatic in the same manner.

857
01:04:50,880 --> 01:05:00,320
And that, and there are so many levels of kind of longing and desire for the same fulfillment

858
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:08,880
of love in this kind of augmented speech and augmented writing.

859
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,280
And first of all, I have to thank you so much.

860
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,440
The poetry was exquisite.

861
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:22,360
I haven't heard much of this work for 30, 40 years and it just brings back the same

862
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,960
openness that the surrealists wanted to create.

863
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,440
I was also in love with Breton's face.

864
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,440
Anyhow, thank you.

865
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:36,520
It was beautiful but it's continuing with absolutely the same level of passion now,

866
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,840
all around the world.

867
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:47,680
And the fluxes people related directly, the dotted people related very directly as children

868
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,200
of the surrealists.

869
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,200
So.

870
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,200
Thank you.

871
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,680
Thank you.

872
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,680
Thank you for an interesting afternoon.

873
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,200
It's something I'm not really familiar with.

874
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:07,160
But I wanted to ask especially you, the painter, this question.

875
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:14,200
About five or ten years ago, I got lucky and I ran into Young's Red Book.

876
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:22,840
And I assume that you folks maybe ran into it also.

877
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:28,440
And I wondered, the only analyst you mentioned was Freud.

878
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:35,960
And I just wondered if Young had any influence on this kind of poetry.

879
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,160
I really don't know.

880
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,640
I know Young's Red Book.

881
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,080
I mean, I ran into it as you said.

882
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,920
Because I have friends who are young and analysts.

883
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:49,680
But I haven't run across any mention of Young in my reading about the surrealist painters.

884
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:59,040
In his huge book, I don't know how many plates there are of his paintings of his dreams.

885
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,240
I think there are a lot of them.

886
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,400
It's a huge book.

887
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,280
And that's what I was thinking of.

888
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,880
But no one mentioned his name.

889
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,040
Well, he did a lot.

890
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,000
He made miniature villages.

891
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,920
He did all sorts of artistic things himself.

892
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,640
But I don't know if he had any influence on it.

893
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:21,200
Well, I think one thing, you know, Young and Freud, of course, it's split fairly early

894
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,200
on.

895
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,600
And you don't really find many mentions of Young in surrealist writings.

896
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:32,640
The Freud sort of got in there early, which I think is an important point to make.

897
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:36,880
Because Bertone was somebody who, you know, brilliant as he was, as creative a mind as

898
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:42,840
he was, was kind of known for taking bits and pieces of the work that he read and then

899
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,840
running with it.

900
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,840
This was the case with Freud.

901
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:48,760
This was the case with Hegel, who he also claimed as a great formation, as a case with

902
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,760
Marx.

903
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,800
But if you actually look what Bertone wrote about Freud, Hegel and Marx, it's not a deep

904
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,800
analysis.

905
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,960
It's picking and choosing the bits and pieces that can serve his own purpose.

906
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,840
His use of Freud was really fairly superficial when you get down to it.

907
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,040
You know, Bertone was not a great Freudian scholar.

908
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:12,960
He was someone who had been deeply excited by the discovery of Freud's early theories

909
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:20,400
and especially his work with dreams and with the automatic states, which was also came,

910
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:28,200
which also came from, you know, some of the other early psychoanalysts, but Freud in particular.

911
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:35,200
And I don't know that his use and analysis of psychoanalysis went so far as to penetrate

912
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,760
into variant forms or the other people.

913
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,400
You know, really Freud was sort of where his focus was.

914
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,760
And because it was where his focus was, it tended to be where the other surrealist focus

915
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,760
was.

916
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:50,840
Jung is a name that comes in, I can't really even think of time-sitting.

917
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,320
Thank you, Bertone.

918
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:56,800
He did come in through Bachelorette, who was called the philosopher of surrealism.

919
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,080
And Bachelorette was, of course, very influenced by Jung.

920
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,760
And from that it got, and the whole Picasso young thing that is talked about is very strong.

921
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,800
But Bachelorette was a philosopher and he was a journalist.

922
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,800
Yeah.

923
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,800
But he was called the philosopher of surrealism.

924
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,800
I love that.

925
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:15,000
Also, the red book was only published in the last few years.

926
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
That's true.

927
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
But one of those.

928
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
So nobody saw those.

929
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,360
The family guarded that manuscript with great fervor.

930
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:32,400
And the other question, and you'd have to go back and look at the, when did the translations

931
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:38,640
of Jung start appearing in French, for example, because not everybody spoke and read all of

932
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,400
the European languages.

933
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:49,680
And I don't think that Freud, I don't think, excuse me, that Jung starts appearing in translation

934
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:56,520
until maybe the late 20s, which would be, you know, the horse was already out of the

935
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,000
chute in terms of Freud.

936
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,760
But Freud was not that much earlier.

937
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,520
Freud only started in 1920, the first French translations and then continued on through

938
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,520
the 20s.

939
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,520
But he had the grip on the men.

940
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,520
He had the grip on the men.

941
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,080
I didn't read this other guy, you know.

942
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:17,320
But in many ways, Jung is, in many ways more appropriate to surrealism.

943
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,760
And Freud is.

944
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,760
Yeah.

945
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,760
Yeah.

946
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,760
Are you almost sort of wise?

947
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,760
Yeah.

948
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,760
I agree with you.

949
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,760
Yeah.

950
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:32,200
But again, those weren't available until the last few years.

951
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,200
Yeah.

952
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:38,920
Again, thank you so much for your good words and your passion for this.

953
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,440
I have a question that's more about present day.

954
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,440
If like Breton was sitting in the chair right now and he could be present and say, well,

955
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,400
what does this mean today?

956
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:53,480
I'd like to just ask you, I'm very much taken by the nature of like, what is imagination?

957
01:10:53,480 --> 01:11:00,240
They were like Breton, a higher level of consciousness exploring human potentiality, creation, meaning.

958
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:06,760
So when imagination, some people say it's a more holistic, creative, open-ended, your

959
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,840
brain is creating your imagination.

960
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,480
Where else could it come from?

961
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,480
But it's holistic.

962
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,480
It has a sense of innate beauty.

963
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,480
You share it.

964
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,480
You include it.

965
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:18,400
North of Fry, one of the few people wrote a book about it, said, imagination creates

966
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:23,840
a bridge that allows emotion and intelligence to form together to create meaning.

967
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,800
So I was wondering with all the background that you have of how would you understand

968
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:34,240
or explain what is imagination as a form of consciousness?

969
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:38,360
And is there any way that you can imagine we can create some understanding to promote

970
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:45,960
those better ideas to get out of the locked up thinking which eliminates emotion which

971
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,120
you cannot create meaning without?

972
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,360
I'm just throwing it out to you, whatever you can come up with, I'd appreciate it.

973
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,360
That's a hard one.

974
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,360
Next time.

975
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,360
Does anyone have any of these?

976
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,960
It's a vast subject.

977
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:08,640
In terms of just to hark back to the idea of the metaphor, Pierre Revardis, one of the

978
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:15,480
great 20th century French poets and a kind of a mentor to Breton at least intellectually,

979
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:22,560
he said, the metaphor flies in on its own wings.

980
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:28,480
And Breton has great pains to point out, you can't sit down and think up a really good

981
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,360
metaphor.

982
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,600
It either comes or it doesn't.

983
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:40,120
And in fact, you can go back and read Aristotle and this idea is right there in Aristotle.

984
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:46,080
So it's a vast subject and a great one.

985
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:50,040
And what is the imagination?

986
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,000
And I think there have been a number of answers to it.

987
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:59,800
But in the surrealist case, I think for one thing, Breton was a pure product of French,

988
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,360
bourgeois, rationalist society.

989
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,600
And that was the enemy that he fought against his entire life.

990
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,600
Was Greco-Roman logic.

991
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,560
That was the main target.

992
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:14,760
And so the entire enterprise of surrealism, whether through its brief flirtation of interest

993
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:21,800
and Buddhism through Toronto or psychoanalysis or whatever it might be, was to allow the

994
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:27,800
conditions, create the conditions for which you could open your mind to the flood of images

995
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:33,640
that would come in and not constantly try to filter or not constantly try to eliminate

996
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:37,200
the ones that didn't make sense or the ones that didn't seem to conform to some arbitrary

997
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:42,640
rule of what images should be, that all of it was valid and all of it was useful.

998
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:50,560
It's a curious thing because surrealism itself as an entity, as a movement, was actually

999
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,080
heavily regulated.

1000
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:57,160
Breton himself was a great theorist of the liberty of thought, the freedom of thought

1001
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,400
and at the same time was enormously controlled.

1002
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,640
He was a real control freak.

1003
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:07,920
And so there's a, in a way you can almost say it's the tension between the two that

1004
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,320
actually produced that spark that allowed surrealism to last as an active movement for

1005
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,480
something like 50 years.

1006
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:20,200
And it was interesting and probably not that surprising that shortly after his death in

1007
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:26,960
1966, his hand-picked successor, who was in every way as forceful and dynamic as Breton

1008
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,360
was, a man named Josh Eustaire, tried to keep the movement going.

1009
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:36,240
And there were two things, curiously enough, that finally put an end to it three years

1010
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,800
later in 1969.

1011
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:43,360
One of them was the May 68 riots because the surrealists felt that it had actually gotten

1012
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:50,840
out of there, it had passed them by, that the students were using surrealist ideas and

1013
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:55,000
putting, scrolling surrealist slogans on the walls and they felt that this thing that

1014
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,960
we've created has now just completely steamrolled over us.

1015
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,400
We have no further place in it.

1016
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,400
That was one.

1017
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:06,600
And the other one was the fact that Schuistaire realized that without Breton there as a kind

1018
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,320
of a force, just a personal force that could hold all the little factions together in that

1019
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,240
group, it just fell apart.

1020
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,280
There was no one there who could keep it going anymore.

1021
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,760
There was no one there who had the force of personality.

1022
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:25,040
So on the one hand, you've got this wonderful call to freedom and to the primacy of love

1023
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:35,920
and absolute imagination sort of cemented against or sort of laminated to this other

1024
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:40,080
need and will toward real regulation.

1025
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:43,040
And oddly enough, that was the energy that kept it going.

1026
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:49,640
You will have one statement of Breton, the imaginary tends to become the real kind of

1027
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,640
wonderful.

1028
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,480
I just thought you brought up in 3,000 years ago where there is no vision the people will

1029
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,480
perish.

1030
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,240
And Jung said image is everything.

1031
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,760
I mean, human potentiality is presented in the form of an image or word is just a name

1032
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,920
for an object, it doesn't mean anything.

1033
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:09,040
But Jung said, and might unfortunately take 600 years for the rest of the world to catch

1034
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,040
on.

1035
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,040
So thank you.

1036
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,040
Thank you.

1037
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,640
Well, I was also very glad to hear all of this.

1038
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,720
I'm a painter and also art historian.

1039
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:22,920
And I've been interested in the subject for a long time, starting with the symbolist with

1040
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,760
Bodleaire and Rambo and Malarmé.

1041
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:31,320
And I'm very interested in the relationship to the painters because earlier on, but even

1042
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:38,440
later, Bonard and Braque and Matisse were very allied with the poets.

1043
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:46,040
There is no particularly with Braque and Robert D. And Matisse even began to speak about his

1044
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,600
world of signs.

1045
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:53,800
And what I'd like to ask is did the poets use this word signs or was it more from the

1046
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:59,640
phenomenologists and Bachellard and the philosophers of France that brought up the concept of

1047
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,640
signs?

1048
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,800
Or does it go back to Bodleaire?

1049
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:08,040
Because Matisse, particularly now that his cutout show is there, you can see how he

1050
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,760
transpose this concept of signs into visual signs.

1051
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,240
So I just want to ask a little bit about that.

1052
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,640
The relationship, if you know anything about the relationship with the painters and the

1053
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:24,200
word signs, does that come up in the language with the poets?

1054
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:30,640
Well, the Mihou and the Mihou and Waton, the constellatius and Mihou and the sign, very

1055
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,120
big there.

1056
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,440
But Mark probably can go on from.

1057
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:43,680
No, the relationship with the painters between the painters and the poets was, historically,

1058
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:51,320
it's actually rather interesting and rather difficult one because, as Henry pointed out,

1059
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:56,880
at first there was a kind of a, Breton had actually initially begun by saying that there

1060
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,640
could be no such thing as surrealist painting and sort of had eliminated the idea of a visual

1061
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:10,480
surrealism at the very beginning of the movement and was partly pushed into having to then make

1062
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,360
a theoretical statement, which of course became surrealism and painting, a book that he started

1063
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:19,920
in 1928 as an essay and eventually was added to throughout the rest of his life.

1064
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:26,800
A major statement about what visual surrealism is, but oddly enough, it was sort of arm-twisted

1065
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:36,920
a little bit into making that statement because one of the other members of the group had

1066
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:41,320
actually started making statements about visual surrealism and I think that that kind of forced

1067
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:44,360
him to take a stand on it.

1068
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:49,080
And also, honestly, it was a way of bringing some of the painters who he found interesting

1069
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,800
into the group as well.

1070
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:56,120
You know, he'd been fascinated by Max Ernst from back in the data days.

1071
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,040
He was interested in Miro very early on.

1072
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,200
He was interested in Masson.

1073
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:03,360
He was interested in Picasso with someone that he courted all of his life, who never

1074
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:08,360
really joined surrealism but is always kind of a friendly fellow traveler, same with Duchamp.

1075
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:14,600
It was a way of kind of creating a visual corpus that would be complementary to the written

1076
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,600
corpus of surrealism.

1077
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,080
I'm not sure that that quite answers your question, but.

1078
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,600
Yeah, I just wondered too.

1079
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:26,080
Did they realize that the symbolist poets, I mean Malarmé and Bernard were good friends

1080
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,280
and they would see each other every day and they would talk there.

1081
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,920
I mean, there was a lot of communication at a certain point, particularly in the late

1082
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,440
19th century.

1083
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,260
And so I think it's a continuum really.

1084
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:41,760
And I wondered how the surrealists saw themselves in relationship to the symbolist because they

1085
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,520
really start a lot of this.

1086
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,960
But there are Miro and Malarmé and all of that.

1087
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,600
Miro was a huge admirer of Malarmé.

1088
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,280
And he knew Paul Valeré personally.

1089
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,760
He was younger.

1090
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:58,360
He went to see Valeré as a young man as a kind of a guarantor and a mentor for his own

1091
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,840
poetry.

1092
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,200
He knew of the Malarmé's gatherings.

1093
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:07,800
He knew a number of the symbolist poets early in the century.

1094
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,560
And in fact, his first poems are basically symbolist poems.

1095
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:16,680
I mean, really before the war, the earliest poems that Brittone wrote and published were

1096
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,000
good classical symbolist poetry.

1097
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,800
And so he was very aware of the relationships between the poets and the painters.

1098
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:37,640
In fact, I think it was Malarmé's daughter when he was not as a soldier, as a medical

1099
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,640
orderly.

1100
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:42,880
He lived for a little while with Malarmé's daughter and her husband.

1101
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:47,400
And they were able to tell them all kinds of stories about the relationship with Mene

1102
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,600
and all of that.

1103
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,320
So I mean, he was quite aware of it.

1104
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:55,840
And yes, the surrealists in there, the writers' dealings with the painters is very much of

1105
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,840
a continuum in French life.

1106
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,320
They distinguished themselves from symbolism.

1107
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:04,360
And how would you call them, what is the bridge or what is the difference between, you would

1108
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,000
say, surrealist poetry in the earlier symbolist movement?

1109
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,880
Well, I mean, symbolism, I think.

1110
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:13,120
You know, it was very controlled and it was very precious by nature.

1111
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,960
It really tried to pull away from life.

1112
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:24,440
And I think that there was something in that, I think that there was something in the conscious

1113
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:29,200
rejection of the outside world, the Breton light.

1114
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,760
But it was also, you know, it was like hot house flowers.

1115
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:35,520
I mean, they're very self-contained.

1116
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,480
And then the war came along and you just couldn't do that.

1117
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:44,520
And I think that the experiences of the war and his meeting also with certain people during

1118
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:49,040
the war, in particular this young man named Jacques Vashé, who's sort of one of the patron

1119
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:54,960
saints of really surrealism, and who just had a completely different way of disdaining

1120
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:55,960
the world.

1121
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:59,160
It was much brasher, it was much more violent in a way.

1122
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,040
And I think that that really turned Breton's head around.

1123
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:05,160
And that's when you start seeing the poetry take completely different attitudes.

1124
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:09,440
The discovery of Rambo was another one, that there was this kind of, you know, a much more

1125
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:15,120
sarcastic and sardonic way of disdaining the world.

1126
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,760
So I think that what interested him in symbolism was the fact that they had pushed the world

1127
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:24,200
away, but there was a little bit of an ivory tower aspect to it.

1128
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,720
And what this did was allow you to get back into the streets, but disdain the world at

1129
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:31,280
the same time in a slightly more aggressive way.

1130
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:38,120
The futures have helped push it more into the violence of contemporary life, or they have

1131
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,120
played a role, Marionetti at all.

1132
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:43,000
Well, they certainly knew Marionetti, but I think there were a little bit of a rival

1133
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,360
as well, the futurists.

1134
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,360
Yeah.

1135
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,360
Yeah.

1136
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,360
They didn't get along too well.

1137
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,360
No.

1138
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:54,800
That is the ask if people like Annie B. something thought for him.

1139
01:22:54,800 --> 01:23:01,280
And the whole, the theosophistic movement, which was around between the words certainly

1140
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:11,260
in this country, it will be very very critical to me, especially, to the insutes of the

1141
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:29,600
suff discipline, to be very literary and I wonder if it was ill and I was very impressed

1142
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:44,100
who also were influenced by the

1143
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:46,600
black-born people and who claimed

1144
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:48,600
connections also to various

1145
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:51,600
young people in Paris and London

1146
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:55,600
and Germany between the wars who

1147
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:56,600
were who were gone.

1148
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:03,600
And what everybody else was doing.

1149
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:07,600
The Dades were, you know, from

1150
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:11,100
Lithuania were aware of the Dades

1151
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:11,100
movements in Romania and you know

1152
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:11,100
and all across the board they were

1153
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:13,100
centered in Switzerland.

1154
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:13,100
They were in close contact with

1155
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:18,100
Griton and their ideas and their

1156
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:19,100
interested psychoanalysis was

1157
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:20,100
enormous.

1158
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:22,100
They always talked about it but they

1159
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:26,100
did it through visual means.

1160
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:31,100
They're own sources and their own

1161
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:34,600
needs but it was certainly done

1162
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:34,600
visually as much as it was done.

1163
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,600
And you did, I don't know if you

1164
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:40,600
can choose music but there was

1165
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:42,600
I mentioned it but he but but

1166
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,600
don't didn't allow it.

1167
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:46,600
It's really it's incomprehensible.

1168
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:50,600
And we already had we already had

1169
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:50,600
sati.

1170
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:55,600
And it's all there no matter what

1171
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:58,100
you're talking about the language

1172
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:01,600
of walking can be a surrealist

1173
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:01,600
language.

1174
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:05,600
It doesn't matter what form it

1175
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:08,600
takes Ted Sean and whatever her

1176
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:11,600
name is I can't think of his

1177
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:13,100
partner.

1178
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:15,100
We're doing that in dance in the

1179
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:16,100
1920s in Paris.

1180
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:19,100
Well we all agree that it was very

1181
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:20,100
widespread movements.

1182
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:28,100
Just as you all have apparently

1183
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:29,100
disavowed connection with the

1184
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:30,100
thought forms with you know he

1185
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:37,600
was not interested in that and a

1186
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:39,600
lot of his,

1187
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:44,100
I mean I'll just say very

1188
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:44,600
quickly that you know it depends

1189
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:45,100
on how you define the words

1190
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:48,100
surrealist.

1191
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:52,140
movement and there were two things that you touched upon there that I think

1192
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:56,020
would have been absolute anathema to Brito himself. One of them was religion or

1193
01:25:56,020 --> 01:26:00,460
anything that smacks of organized religion and the other thing was music

1194
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:02,460
which he just personally could not stand.

1195
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,460
What was music?

1196
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,460
Which he personally couldn't stand. Now why?

1197
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,460
That's four o'clock.

1198
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,460
That's four o'clock. Okay.

1199
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:12,460
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1200
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,460
Thank you.

1201
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:21,460
That was fun.
