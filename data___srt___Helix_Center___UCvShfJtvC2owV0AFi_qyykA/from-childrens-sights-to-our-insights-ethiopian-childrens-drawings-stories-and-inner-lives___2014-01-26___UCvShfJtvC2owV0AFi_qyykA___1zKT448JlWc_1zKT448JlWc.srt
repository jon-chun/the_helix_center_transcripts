at the Hebrew University, he is the author, editor of four books and one novella, educating

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,080
the emotions on Bruno Betelheim's ideas, lives across time with Henry Massey, reluctant

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,440
warriors, the maturation and inner lives of elite Israeli soldiers, and Sheba and Solomon's

51
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,120
return Ethiopian children in Israel, the foundational study for today's roundtable.

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
Nathan.

57
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,200
Thank you to Helix, Rob, and for arranging this.

58
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,240
When I was asked to do this, can you all hear?

59
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,920
They put the mic on me.

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,280
One of the attractions was to have Ted and Ellen be involved so that I could hear from

61
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
them too.

62
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,520
So this is, I've been looking forward to this for some time.

63
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:42,840
The beginning of this project came from when I was working on Sheba and Solomon's return,

64
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,280
which was a study, a three-year study of six-year-old children, Ethiopian children, and their families

65
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,160
in a small town near Gaza in Israel.

66
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,280
While I was at the Hebrew University, I would drive down twice a week to work and play and

67
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,920
do research there.

68
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:09,720
And the book is a description of what I learned about the children's inner lives, nature of

69
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,840
their attachment ties, their parents' attachment ties, and their parents' backgrounds to give

70
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,920
you a sense of the population.

71
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:23,000
All of the mothers and fathers were born in rural subsistence agricultural villages

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,760
in Ethiopia, in a pre-literate society.

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,520
Very few of the parents, almost none of the mothers went to school and a few of the fathers

74
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,440
were sent to two or three grades of school, but that was a big sacrifice for them to do.

75
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:45,680
And most of the kids, the parents, I'm speaking of, were doing some sort of economically meaningful

76
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,120
activity by the age of eight.

77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,560
So the boys had their own goats or sheep, they were shepherds, or one boy's job was

78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,880
to be both a shepherd and to keep the homodrias baboons out of his house because they would

79
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,640
raid for food.

80
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,920
And the girls would help out with the mother in cooking.

81
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:14,640
And most of the fathers were involved in growing fava beans, little plots of land with a cow,

82
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:21,120
in a very lovely sort of setting, small trees in a river nearby.

83
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:29,200
Many of the villages they came from were half Jewish, half not Jewish, or all Jewish.

84
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,120
Only one of the 46 mothers came from a disababa, that is from a major city.

85
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:42,120
And all of these Jews were moved, I won't describe the details, but in a rather heroic

86
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,680
evacuation during the turmoil in Ethiopia when I think 1.3 million people were killed

87
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,280
by the Ethiopians.

88
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,320
They were bought from the Ethiopians by the Israeli government, and I met the daughter

89
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:01,040
of the ambassador in Ethiopia at the time from Israel who did the deal, and what the

90
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,000
generals wanted for the Jews was guns, and he said, well I can't get you guns.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,480
They said, okay, money.

92
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,800
He said fine, so how much?

93
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,320
And they said so many million works about $12,000 a person.

94
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
He said yes.

95
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,400
And then he called his government and said I need so many million, they said we don't

96
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
have it.

97
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,040
They said, call the American Jews.

98
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:29,400
So he got the money from some New York donors, and in a 72-hour window, cargo planes, which

99
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,080
were completely emptied out, were flown in and flown out.

100
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,760
And the reason for the 72-hour window, as some of you may know, is that Ethiopian government

101
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,560
didn't want the Arab countries to know that they were exporting Jews to Israel.

102
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,120
So it had to be done secretly and in that period of time.

103
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,680
So the population that I lived and worked with, most of them were from that immigration in

104
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
91.

105
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,960
However, us a new immigration or of the Falaschmura, of the Falasch Jews are those who were

106
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,000
the Ethiopian Jewish Jews.

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,440
The Falaschmura were forced, converted to Christianity under threat of death in the 1890s

108
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,160
by the then emperor of Ethiopia.

109
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:22,600
And they called themselves a penumbra population because they lived in the shadow of the Christian

110
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,320
community and in the shadow of the Jewish community and felt didn't belong to either.

111
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,120
It would be hard to marry off your daughter because the Christians thought you weren't

112
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,640
really Christian and the Jews thought you're not really Jewish.

113
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,920
So there was this sort of shadowy quality to this community.

114
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,840
And they are currently coming in that with a new immigration into my town where I was

115
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,280
working and that population actually looks quite different.

116
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,480
I can describe that if we have time.

117
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,080
But the fundamental question for today was when I meeting with kids, I spent three years

118
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,200
with them and I was in this special after school program that was funded by the Wiesel

119
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,840
family.

120
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,080
Most of the kids were within walking distance from home started to walk home with them,

121
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
spent time in the playground.

122
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,200
All the kids invited me to their home so I could do formal assessments in the home and

123
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,360
do attachment interviews and so on.

124
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,360
The question is how do you, how does one learn from a kid?

125
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
What do you think?

126
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
What do you feel?

127
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
What do you like?

128
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Who are you?

129
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,320
If those are our questions, tell me about yourself.

130
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,520
It would be the short version if we spoke with an adult perhaps.

131
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,160
So for those of us who work with children, we learn other ways to ask that question.

132
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,320
Usually not asking that question.

133
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,720
But watching them play or playing with them, watching them play on the playground with

134
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:50,800
other friends, sibs and so on or playing with them or asking to draw pictures.

135
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,080
And there we have, I think both Ted and Ellen will talk about this, a limit developmentally.

136
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,280
I have a limit because I just can't draw very well.

137
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,880
But these kids, if you ask a four-year-old to draw a picture or a four and a half or

138
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,680
a five-year-old or a six or seven-year-old, you have different developmental capacities

139
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,760
and there are apparently gender differences in capacities so that the acute angle that

140
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:22,080
you need to draw at A or a V or a W according to Gazelle, girls learn that sort of in boys

141
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,160
in classroom.

142
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,600
So there are variations on that.

143
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,720
But once the child draws something, one can look at it, but how does one learn as much

144
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,040
as one can about what's in the picture?

145
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,720
And that's the second part, which is to ask a child, tell me a story about the picture

146
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,640
and to put on exactly what the child does.

147
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,880
So that's what I did and I'll show you a few examples of this and I use these pictures.

148
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,800
There are other ways I use to assess the children, including an attachment to academic

149
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,120
performance using the child behavior checklist.

150
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,360
There are many other ways that I won't approach here that I read the book.

151
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,560
But I use these to design a liquor type instrument to compare emotional life and a brief look

152
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,680
at their developmental capacity from their picture drawing and their stories.

153
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
So I'll give you some examples.

154
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,440
I have about 300 pictures from the 46 children.

155
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,400
I picked a few to show you and I think I'll just show you that.

156
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Tell you some of the stories and then I'd like to hand it over to Ted and to Alan to

157
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,640
talk about the question of how do we learn about inner lives?

158
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,680
What's the nature of visual representation?

159
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,680
What's the nature of narrative representation?

160
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,000
The both.

161
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So here's an example.

162
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,680
I'm going to show you first the three pictures.

163
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,160
In the book I had to limit the number of pictures significantly here.

164
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,120
I'll show you three pictures from the same channel, one of our healthiest kids.

165
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,280
And she draws a picture and as in the original the kids could pick colors, she did it as

166
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,920
pencil.

167
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,480
And she calls this girl Rudy.

168
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,280
She says she's going to a dancing party.

169
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,800
She's finished with the party.

170
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,640
Had a great time and wanted to go next week.

171
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,720
She has a job.

172
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,600
She's a piano and music teacher.

173
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,640
Five days a week she's a teacher and then she's at a party.

174
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,800
If she'll be invited by the headmaster in her office.

175
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,920
She's 18 years old, has blonde hair and a pony haircut.

176
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,320
Now in Israel, pony haircut has bangs.

177
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,200
I found out.

178
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,520
The haircut covers her eyebrows and she has blue eyes.

179
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,560
And I asked her at some point.

180
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,440
I said blue eyes.

181
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,920
She says, stum.

182
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,840
She's wearing colored lenses.

183
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,680
So you hear you have both the picture that if you just read the narrative but I tried

184
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,560
to read it the way she told the story with that tone.

185
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
The next picture.

186
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,120
I have all this as children.

187
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,920
All children are six years old.

188
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,560
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,640
In their summer six and a half and their summer six none are younger than six.

190
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,960
There is one who's seven, for instance, but all the kids are six years old.

191
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,400
So I'm asking this is what's called a house tree person.

192
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,840
I asked her to draw a person.

193
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
She draws a routine.

194
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,920
Then she draws a boy.

195
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,600
And she says this is Rudy's headmaster.

196
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,240
He's also 18.

197
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,560
Everything is similar to Rudy.

198
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,040
Blue eyes, white skin.

199
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,240
And so does Rudy.

200
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,640
His name is Gil.

201
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,160
His job is to be a headmaster in a high school.

202
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,480
And he invites Rudy to be a teacher and come to party as well.

203
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,160
He's her friend and they like each other a lot.

204
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,200
And he likes dancing too.

205
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,600
Rudy teaches him piano music.

206
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,840
She is talented.

207
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,320
And he looks like Rudy's brother.

208
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,880
And Rudy loves her three-year-old baby brother.

209
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,600
Gil is the prime minister's son.

210
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,680
And he puts glass lenses, colored lenses, so that he'll have blue eyes.

211
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,880
He is his aunt, no, his cousin.

212
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,240
They met that kindergarten up to fourth grade and were in high school together.

213
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,360
And they would very much like to be together in 11th grade.

214
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,400
And then one more picture from this girl just to give you a sense of art.

215
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,280
What happens with stories with one child?

216
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,960
I can't do this for all the children, but it gives you a sense.

217
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,400
I say draw a picture of a family doing something, kinetic family drawing.

218
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,760
And she draws this very detailed, very careful.

219
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,240
And then she tells the following story, which I'll read through a little more quickly than

220
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
I should.

221
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Yes?

222
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:34,280
A baby in bed, a mother and a girl.

223
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,240
The baby is eight months and the family, everybody has blue eyes.

224
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,400
And the daughter, Dina, always goes to parties because she's a dancing teacher.

225
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,040
Dina has blonde hair with orange stripes and a pony haircut.

226
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,320
And I ask orange stripes.

227
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,720
She says she dies it on each side.

228
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,040
They both have heart shaped earrings and the mother has the same hair color and they have

229
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,760
round earrings like adults have.

230
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,040
Their house is a palace.

231
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,600
Now I ask the word she uses in Hebrew is palace.

232
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,560
I ask her, tell me what a palace is.

233
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:12,760
And she explained, is any house with a separate entrance and steps going inside?

234
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:18,760
All these kids live in, looks like Soviet style apartment buildings with peeling stucco,

235
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,080
just to give you a sense.

236
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,880
This is imagination in your head.

237
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,520
And almost every one of the kids, what we would consider, and even in Israel was considered

238
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
impoverished.

239
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,800
I had one family that was what we would consider upper working class.

240
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,640
So these were quite poor families.

241
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,240
They work in the factory mom and dad.

242
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
They have the same job.

243
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,480
They get a lot of money.

244
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,080
When the parents are always working, the kids feel all right.

245
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,480
They have brown eyes, the parents.

246
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,480
The real color of their eyes is blue.

247
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,760
The baby has blonde hair like his father and the mother is, the baby is mothers.

248
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,000
When the baby is asleep, he gets a pacifier and a doll and the mother returns, she gives

249
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
him a turnip, a baby bottle.

250
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,880
Later he goes back to the doll and sleeps with it and he doesn't go to the daycare in

251
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,640
the morning because mother has prepared him a surprise.

252
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,840
You have to keep quiet so he doesn't wake up.

253
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,800
He can fall from his playpen and hit his head.

254
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,400
That can be prevented with a playpen that has a fence and the family bought the baby

255
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,200
pen with a fence that can go up and down.

256
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,240
And the story.

257
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:34,200
Let me turn to an extreme, in the other end of a child that we thought was quite troubled.

258
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,600
And I'll just show you one picture and one story.

259
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,240
Here's this picture, same age.

260
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,280
In his first picture, it looks like it and he describes it as a girl.

261
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,160
This is a boy, his first picture is a girl.

262
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
And the story is this.

263
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,000
It's raining and then comes a son and then she, the girl, needs to bring her coat.

264
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,240
She goes for a trip.

265
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,720
She wants to still be on the trip because she has no home.

266
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,200
Kids broke into her home with fire.

267
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,040
It's better for her on the trip because she has no home.

268
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,660
She's alone on the trip.

269
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,520
Her children have homes to go back to and she doesn't.

270
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,800
So she doesn't feel good.

271
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,880
She wanted to burn down her house too.

272
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,480
She did it because she wanted to go on a trip for a long time.

273
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,320
No, she did it by mistake.

274
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,560
She can't go inside the house because it burned down.

275
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,080
She made her own colors and her hair because she wanted long hair.

276
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
It's a real girl.

277
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Her name is Hannah.

278
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
I know her.

279
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,960
She's having fun.

280
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,320
Now, this is a child on our scale.

281
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,840
We rated the first girl someplace close to five, a very high score.

282
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,200
This boy would be closer to one and a half, a child who we thought needed imminent treatment.

283
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Could you move back?

284
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,080
Just go back to the previous one for a minute.

285
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
Yes.

286
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
What's happened?

287
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,720
Just to, do you mind?

288
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,840
Just to see the difference in the way that these children draw the figure.

289
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:10,240
I want everyone to notice that the high functioning child draws the figure very much.

290
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:20,960
How many people in these children's daily life actually have blonde hair and blue eyes?

291
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
A percentage.

292
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
No.

293
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Okay.

294
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Zero.

295
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
So that's very interesting.

296
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
It's Israel.

297
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,880
I want to make that, I'd like everyone to be aware of that.

298
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,280
That's a very important thing.

299
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,760
This child is focusing on the blonde hair and the blue eyes, although the child has no

300
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,760
actual experience of seeing people who look that way.

301
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,440
So I think it's important to notice that.

302
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,280
Although one of my students from the university pointed out that I have the closest thing

303
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,480
to blue eyes that they've seen there.

304
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,520
They have access to the larger culture.

305
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Absolutely.

306
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,280
So they know, they're comparing themselves.

307
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,760
This is an idealized.

308
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Yes.

309
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Absolutely.

310
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,040
And one of the fathers complained to me that he doesn't raise his children.

311
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,800
Israel culture raises his children.

312
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Okay.

313
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:10,320
Just a parenthetically for those of you who may not know, testimony during Brown versus

314
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:19,640
the Board of Education from Kenneth Clark, a psychologist, bore witness to the fact that

315
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:27,320
black little girls preferred white baby dolls to black showing that separate but equal is

316
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,480
not equal.

317
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:37,320
So it is an interesting historical counterpart to idealizing the other rather than.

318
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,760
It's very important to notice that the child is so young.

319
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,280
This child is six years old.

320
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,560
And this is nothing that was told to her by her parents.

321
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,880
It was nothing that anybody tried to teach her.

322
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,080
But it's something that she learned so profoundly that it's in her spontaneous story.

323
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
Okay.

324
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Sorry for interrupting.

325
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,840
But you're getting at the difference in the form of the figures.

326
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,920
The drawing is here.

327
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,480
The figure here is highly articulated.

328
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,080
And the proportions of the figure are different.

329
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,680
And the child is making an effort to give you some sense of the costume.

330
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,240
Maybe Nathan, could you show the second one?

331
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Shoot to the family.

332
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,480
I bring your mic up for one second.

333
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,160
We have some problems with feedback.

334
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,640
Do you want this one?

335
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
Yes.

336
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:35,560
I think that's because I think that it's very important to see how carefully the child has

337
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:44,000
made an effort to draw these figures with necks, with arms, with hands, with belts distinguishing

338
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,960
the different sections of the body.

339
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,080
And the sizes of the figures are articulated.

340
00:20:53,080 --> 00:21:05,880
And now if we go to the next child's drawing, same age.

341
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,440
It's very primitive.

342
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Let me show you the next one.

343
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,800
I need to show you to give you a sense of that.

344
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
I mean, one of the things that...

345
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Sir, may I ask you a question?

346
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Sir.

347
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Well...

348
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:21,800
I think it's better that we hold the questions from the audience.

349
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Okay.

350
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Don't forget your question.

351
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Don't forget your question.

352
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,080
But a way to begin to address what Ellen and I think Ted are pointing out in Ted will

353
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:39,600
talk more about, I hope, is I used as a rough measure of looking at the form of the child

354
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,560
gazelle score for the human figure.

355
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,960
Here's a six-year-old boy drawing person.

356
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
And you see...

357
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
You see the look, right?

358
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Yes.

359
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,280
I'll tell you the story in a moment, but just looking at it, Ellen, this is even more primitive

360
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
than the previous.

361
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
This is...

362
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:04,400
Actually, this is very interesting what you show here because we know it's fascinating.

363
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:12,080
We know that cross-culturally, the first image that a child of you gives the child the problem

364
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,600
draw person.

365
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,200
What happens is this.

366
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:25,200
It's one closed form which represents some kind of confluence of head and body.

367
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,680
Head is not distinguished from the body.

368
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,800
It's one oval or circle or shape.

369
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,960
One of which we find two eyes, sometimes...

370
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,960
But usually eyes more than mouth.

371
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,520
And the limbs protrude from that one shape.

372
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,160
And the child will draw legs first.

373
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,200
Only later will the child draw arms.

374
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,720
But so the most primitive, earliest representation of the human form is this shape.

375
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:03,560
And what's so incredibly fascinating is that the very child who draws this is the same

376
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,800
child who, if you say to that child, what is this?

377
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,320
The child will say ear.

378
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
You say, what is this?

379
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,760
The child will say nose.

380
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:19,200
The child has the cognitive capacity to name all the parts of the body, or many, but when

381
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,600
the child draws, the child will draw this.

382
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,840
So we'll get into that later.

383
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,040
I don't want to interrupt your presentation.

384
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
This is fine.

385
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,520
In the few minutes I'll show you the sequence, how that happens and so forth.

386
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,360
These little primitive head feet think...

387
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,920
Some people call them tadpoles.

388
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,800
The Germans call them fuscupptions.

389
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Little footed heads.

390
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,600
But just so...

391
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,280
I can tell you the story it's written up there, but just so you know.

392
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,680
That picture has one girl or two possibly, and the rest are all boys.

393
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,000
The boys have all legs, no arms.

394
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,440
The girl who has the crown around her, do you see her?

395
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,720
Has arms.

396
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,280
And the story about this, there's one other girl that's two persons over to the right.

397
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,000
You see that with a little bit of a crown around her?

398
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,080
So the only one figures with arms and there are women girls.

399
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,440
And all the boys, the story he tells.

400
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,040
So just the pictures alone we can read something from, but then listen to this boys story.

401
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,320
And as you know, those of you who were children know, this is like a snapshot of the final

402
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
product.

403
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,960
If you watch the actual drawing of it and get a videotape, you see he's telling the story

404
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,800
and he's drawing and drawing and drawing.

405
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,720
As he's doing it and he says, this is a monster chasing him.

406
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,440
That one with the girl with the arms.

407
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,920
It's a kid, a girl, but she's a monster, a bad monster.

408
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,760
She wants to devour someone.

409
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,240
She eats boys and girls too.

410
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,560
These are the roots of the monster, the stuff around the hair of the head.

411
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
She has big teeth.

412
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
She's angry because she hasn't eaten anything.

413
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,840
And I ask, what happened to the boy?

414
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
Because he's going to draw a boy.

415
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,240
Oh, he ran and then a good monster came and drove her the bad monster away.

416
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,440
Later another kid came and then another kid and ran away.

417
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Another kid.

418
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,840
He's pulling on his tongue.

419
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,240
He's licking his hand and he stops answering my questions and he's drawing pictures.

420
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:29,880
Later at the very bottom, a big kid came and spooked the monster and she ran away.

421
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,800
He's 27.

422
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,960
He has courage.

423
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,720
And later they carry him upwards.

424
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,080
He licks his hand and he draws a lot of kids carrying the big kid because he killed the

425
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,320
monster.

426
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,640
That's his draw person.

427
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:53,560
I'm thinking maybe I could just, I prefer to pause here and then, and here Ted and Alan

428
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
take it from here.

429
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Is that okay with you?

430
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
Sure.

431
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,440
Why don't you go to my thing?

432
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:08,880
I just want to tell you a bit about some studies that I did earlier on which have the developmental

433
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,080
implications that we're talking about.

434
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:20,280
That Nathan already mentioned the fact that we, can you find me?

435
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,760
I'll go ahead.

436
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,400
That we use drawings with children because sometimes it's easier to talk to them that

437
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,880
way and you can talk about the drawings.

438
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,280
We dare not take the drawings for being all there is because we want the inquiry about

439
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
the drawings.

440
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,440
We can tell from the form some things but we can't tell what the content means.

441
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,960
It's a little bit like Freud's idea about dreams having manifest content and then latent

442
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,160
content.

443
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,040
You dare not use the drawing itself as the end.

444
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,560
All it can tell you is something about the developmental process and what they're pulling

445
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
it from.

446
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,720
Go to the first one.

447
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,920
We use all these techniques to get around talking directly to kids.

448
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,880
This is the sequence that Ellen was talking about.

449
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:15,560
Another top is eyes in the circle then the little footed heads and then as you can see

450
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,840
the arms even come off from the head and it's only later that maybe something else goes

451
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
on.

452
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,000
Now what can we say about that from the standpoint of what is this the case?

453
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,840
Why, if this is a projection and people suggest that the most important part of the head

454
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,840
for an infant is the mouth.

455
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Why aren't the mouths there first?

456
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,480
First of all we didn't know.

457
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:47,280
I then did a study next slide which derived from the Good enough scoring method.

458
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,280
The Good enough scoring method says that by three years of age you ought to be any of

459
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,160
you body psychologists here can know.

460
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,680
If you count, give a child 36 months and you count the number of features that it has you

461
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:10,320
can add them all up and what three months for each item and then you add them up and

462
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,560
you put them over their chronological age you get a rough estimate of IQ from this.

463
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,760
So it does have developmental salience.

464
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,240
It works up until about 12 years of age.

465
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,840
You can get an approximation just from the form.

466
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,440
You don't have to trust it but it correlates usually with something else.

467
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,120
Next one please.

468
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,400
Now along the way I and we do these little other figures that they're supposed to be

469
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,600
able to do from two to seven.

470
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:43,800
I then had a youngster who came from a very ache acidic family.

471
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,960
He was somewhat challenged intellectually and so forth and I asked him to do a figure

472
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
drawing.

473
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,640
I wish I had the original there and he did the figure drawing which suggested that his

474
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,800
mental age was not very good.

475
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,920
But notice what's on his head.

476
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,840
So now how does that fit into the developmental sequence?

477
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,480
We have to add to all of the developmental propensities that salience in regard to the

478
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,120
culture and what's there is also going to be added according to how much exposure they

479
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,240
have which would be interestingly related to some of the things that he's telling you

480
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,400
about this.

481
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:26,560
I actually did a systematic study to see if indeed young children drew eyes and not mouths

482
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:33,040
and sure enough it seemed to be true and we had good statistical findings.

483
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,280
Go on.

484
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,760
Don't bother.

485
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,040
These are just the files.

486
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Okay.

487
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,640
Now why eyes and a head from a biological vantage point?

488
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,600
What is going on here?

489
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,640
One of the things that Spitz showed us is developmentally at six weeks you get what

490
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,760
they call a social smile.

491
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,520
All you need to get a social smile is a full face and movement.

492
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:06,800
You can pair that down by putting eyes on a balloon together and movement and you'll

493
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,480
get the social smile.

494
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,880
You mix those eyes up in different places.

495
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,160
So what we have is a biological readiness for face recognition and social relatedness

496
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:24,120
which always struck me as being a wonderful common factor in regard to three-year-olds.

497
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,800
The three-year-olds are not projecting themselves.

498
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,160
They're projecting the image of the other if you will at that moment.

499
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:36,400
And it's only later that you begin to get the projective ideas that are being talked

500
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,560
about here.

501
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:45,520
Curiously on a biological level the representations are there are two areas of the brain which

502
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,360
light up with face recognition.

503
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,880
By the way, human beings are face experts.

504
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,440
By the way, cross racially we're not very good because we don't have enough experience

505
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
with it.

506
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,000
But within racial groups, you know, that comes to the notion that people say when people

507
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,080
of other races all look alike to them, that's not prejudice.

508
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,840
It may indeed be something that is going on.

509
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,560
So we're face experts.

510
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:16,200
There's an area in the base of the brain called a fusiform area where this expertise is registered

511
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,040
even at a biological level.

512
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,760
Look at that.

513
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,720
If you don't look at the eyes and the face as autistic children for example do not.

514
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,000
They tend to look elsewhere.

515
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You realize this area is no longer used in the modular way that it was meant to for

516
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,880
faces, for face recognition.

517
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:44,520
If you get one of these kids who has obsessions as one of these Ari Klinn at Yale did, he studied

518
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,720
a child who had a Pokemon craze.

519
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,880
And he put Pokemon figures up there, that area lit up in the brain.

520
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:02,120
So if you're a car nut, that's the area you're going to light up.

521
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:09,000
So these are expertise differential areas that the brain subsumes in regard to this.

522
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,360
Now on top of this we have all kinds of cultural issues of course once the child grows further.

523
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:27,840
And we talked about the Clark study for the Brown versus the Board of Education.

524
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,000
Go on, next one please.

525
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,080
Now here's another area where salience becomes terribly important.

526
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,320
This comes from a study that I did many years ago when I was at Bellevue NYU.

527
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:52,320
I was asking an autistic boy who was probably eight years of age at that point to copy a

528
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,120
square.

529
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,680
He copied and he put those things and then he does these.

530
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:04,480
The fact is in his day to day activity he was obsessed by wheels and spinning.

531
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Next one.

532
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,440
Philip, he then incorporated it into his human figure drawings.

533
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,000
Those are arms, those are legs.

534
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,080
In the same way.

535
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,720
So he didn't lose it.

536
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,620
He kept it going because for him that was the essence of what he wanted to portray even

537
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,880
in cooperating it into his new figure drawings.

538
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
Next one.

539
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,960
Oh, oh, there's a creative process that goes in.

540
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,640
It's the kind of integration which goes on always.

541
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,720
Here it is again, now he's a little more mature.

542
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,480
Those look like pretty good stick figures and there's these circles.

543
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,800
But notice the circles at the top very much mimic what we saw before.

544
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:51,000
During the next year when his maturation was at his best and his language was beginning

545
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,120
to get better.

546
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,720
Next slide.

547
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,880
This is what I got.

548
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,920
Now these are pretty dynamic drawings if you look at it.

549
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,480
He's doing a wheelie on his motorcycle and so forth.

550
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,880
I just want to bring these to your attention that even though kids may be developmentally

551
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:14,160
disabled or what have you, their capacity to represent themselves or others is a uniquely

552
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:21,640
human situation but gets curtailed and modulated by the experiences that the child is capable

553
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:28,000
of having because of some biological disability or because of some social disability.

554
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,640
People who've studied figure drawings across nations and across cultures, if you don't

555
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:41,280
have access to drawing materials, figure drawings are not a good thing to use because it isn't

556
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,200
trained into their doing.

557
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,680
In fact, what many parents do who have disordered kids and they realize they're doing developmental

558
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:56,880
testing on them so they train them up to the task just like kids do SAT via studies and

559
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,800
so forth which is unfortunate because that's not what this is all about.

560
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:08,000
I just want to just highlight the idea of form versus function and salience in regard

561
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,640
to content analysis in terms of what the meanings of these things may be.

562
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:21,000
Here the meaning doesn't have a kind of psychodynamic but much more a developmental persistence

563
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,000
perseverativeness from early on which they'll take this.

564
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
There's so much pleasure in this drawing.

565
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Imagine the child enjoying making that.

566
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,200
The function's looks look so great in the drawing.

567
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,400
That's another element I think we have to factor in.

568
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,160
As we go on I will show you some other stuff that I got from a use of drawings.

569
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:55,520
Two studies, one was single consultation using what Winnicott called the squiggle game when

570
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,440
you have nonverbal children and how complex it could get in regard to interpsychic variables.

571
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:09,960
And then later on another study that we did, great traumatologist Bob Pineous was a resident

572
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,200
at Bellevue at Cornell at the time.

573
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:22,480
When we did a study of we learned that children of suicidal patients in the hospital were not

574
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,720
really ever told the facts about their parent suicide for fear of exposure but the kids

575
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,720
knew it.

576
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,320
I want to show you some drawings from that.

577
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:39,200
So I just want to keep that in advance.

578
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:49,040
I was told that we were supposed to be speaking spontaneously and not to prepare a text.

579
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:55,080
So I really haven't but I do want to say a couple of things.

580
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:00,320
First of all, in regard to your work, first of all I'm just thrilled to be here on this

581
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,400
distinguished panel and I want to say for those of you who don't know Dr. Shapiro, he

582
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:12,920
has made major contributions to this field and if I would be a very rich lady, if I had

583
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:19,680
a dollar for every time in the past decades, I don't know how many decades, I have recommended

584
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,520
his paper on the child age plus or minus seven.

585
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
What is the exact-

586
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
Six plus.

587
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,200
No, seven plus or minus one.

588
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:38,440
It is, if you don't know this paper, it's absolutely marvelous and I recommend it not

589
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,320
just to students but to teachers, parents, everyone.

590
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,520
So I'm very thrilled to be here.

591
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:54,040
I know just to go back to Nathan's presentation, it's very interesting what you did, that

592
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:00,040
you had the child do the drawing and then you asked the child to tell the story after

593
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,640
doing the drawing and the focus was very much on the story.

594
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Now how different is it we might ask ourselves for the child to do a drawing herself or himself

595
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:23,720
and tell a story about the drawing that he or she has just made and to tell a story about

596
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,920
a drawing that somebody else has made.

597
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,760
How is that different from telling a child a story and asking a child to illustrate a

598
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,080
story that the child has heard or to ask a child to tell a story and then do a picture

599
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
related to the story.

600
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:49,920
Now those questions that I'm asking, I'm asking them with malice of forethought because

601
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:58,400
I think that after the drawing is made, the drawing stimulates ideas in the child that

602
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,360
were not there when the child made the drawing.

603
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:08,400
Therefore, that has to be, it seems to me, a part of the research.

604
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
It's very different.

605
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,640
The temporal sequence here is, I think, is important.

606
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:21,040
I also think it's extremely important the context in which a child draws.

607
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,560
Heidegger has a famous paper, George from the origin of the work of art in which he

608
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:36,480
conceives of the work not as a drawing but as the work of the drawing, the process of

609
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
the drawing.

610
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,200
And I myself in my work am very interested in that, in the process by which the child

611
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
draws.

612
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,440
You give a child drawing implements.

613
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:54,400
And you know in Darfur when there were all of the horrible genocide going on in Darfur,

614
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,400
the human rights workers were interviewing the parents.

615
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,360
The children were there.

616
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,920
And just to keep the children busy and quiet, the front of the French workers gave the children

617
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,040
some drawing materials.

618
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,200
Children began to drop.

619
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,160
They weren't told to do a drawing.

620
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,480
They just drew.

621
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,400
The drawings are stunning because the children drew the atrocities that were going on.

622
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,480
Uninhibitedly they drew blood and death.

623
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,920
And they even developed an iconography for it.

624
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,720
So when you had a human being turned upside down, that was a dead person in the iconography

625
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,800
that these children spontaneously evolved.

626
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,440
But the children did the drawings without being told to do anything.

627
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
We saw guns.

628
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,360
We saw, I gave a lecture on this at the Sperdiss Institute in Chicago shortly after this.

629
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,800
I got hold of this drawing.

630
00:40:53,800 --> 00:41:01,800
If you tell children, draw a boy or draw a girl, draw a human being, you are giving

631
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,880
a task to the child.

632
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:12,400
And part of what the child will do, I think, is to want to please the adult.

633
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,840
In the same way that we have this problem with every kind of questionnaire that's given,

634
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:24,840
where the person answering wants to please or do something appropriate or something acceptable.

635
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,720
But I think that's very different from the child who gets something.

636
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,160
And then we want to ask why.

637
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:38,200
When you give a child drawing materials and the child starts to draw, why is the child

638
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
drawing?

639
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,640
What is the impetus for that?

640
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,120
So in the literature, there are two schools of thought about that.

641
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,120
The schools of thought are matching and marking.

642
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,880
So you have scholars who say there's just a desire to make a mark.

643
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,400
You know, kill or I was here.

644
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
You make your mark.

645
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:05,720
And then there's a school of thought that the idea is to represent something.

646
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,600
Draw something that looks like something, that represents something.

647
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:15,400
As we see, for example, in Lesco in the cave paintings.

648
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,120
And there's a division about which of these impulses is primary.

649
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:27,880
In the psychoanalytic literature, there's a brilliant paper by Ernst Chris, who's a great,

650
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,720
not only a great psychoanalytic writer, but he was an art historian at the Kriśtus

651
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Dorsches Museum in Vienna.

652
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,600
And it has this amazing paper.

653
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,000
It's not in his book, Psychoanalytic Explorations in Art.

654
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It's not.

655
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,320
It's in the psychoanalytic study, The Child, I think.

656
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,560
And in this paper, he describes a little boy at the easel.

657
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,200
I think it's a boy, I think, but it doesn't make, it could make absolutely no difference

658
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,160
to you, a girl just as easily.

659
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:59,760
And the child is taking paint and brush and making wonderful marks and just the pleasure

660
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,960
of putting the paint on this paper is the impetus, impetus.

661
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:15,200
And Chris describes it, and then at a certain point, the child looks at what's there.

662
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:24,080
And the child takes a color and puts something on the page in response to what is actually

663
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,080
there.

664
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:30,000
And in that moment, Chris suggests this is the moment when art is born.

665
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
This is the moment where you begin to have an artist because the artist isn't just enjoying

666
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,120
the smearing and the fun of the materials.

667
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:46,800
The artist is actually making what we're using ego functions of judgment and developing skill

668
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,400
to try to make something that pleases him cognitively, intellectually, aesthetically.

669
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,640
So I don't think we have to choose, but when we think about children's drawings, I think

670
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,560
we may want to ask ourselves about these questions of marking and matching.

671
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:12,440
The second point I want to make, which is another big, huge conflict in the literature

672
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:20,960
on children's drawings, is the question which really bears on these two, both of your presentations.

673
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:28,320
The presentation that you gave Nathan, where we see these children who are exile children

674
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:35,560
coming to Israel from Ethiopia in a new land with all kinds of problems of immigration

675
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:42,040
and so on, attachment which was then the perspective that you brought.

676
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:47,600
Yeah, I call you Ted.

677
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,320
Where you talked about the scientific, the universal kinds of issues.

678
00:44:52,320 --> 00:45:02,200
So there are certain scholars who say the children will draw because this is how it

679
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,200
is.

680
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,400
This is the biological necessity to do certain things.

681
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:14,480
Other people will say absolutely not, but children are drawing its profoundly conditioned

682
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,680
by the cultural context in which the child draws.

683
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:25,920
And I see these two perspectives as, there's a lot of fighting in the literature about

684
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,280
this, but I don't think we have to fight about it.

685
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:35,680
I think we can simply see that it's a huge mistake to just talk about what's lighting

686
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,600
up in the brain without understanding the culture.

687
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:44,960
Ellen, I have a parallel comment about that that may be related to.

688
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,600
That human beings, whatever culture they are, whatever language is spoken, speak a language

689
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:56,160
and fairly competently by three years of age is a human issue.

690
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,480
Whether you speak English or German depends on what your mother took, spoke to you.

691
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,160
So that's a parallel notion.

692
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,640
The capacity to do it is one thing.

693
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,640
What you do and what its content is.

694
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:22,280
It doesn't solve a third issue, which is the issue of why is it that the child takes so

695
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:31,440
much longer to draw what the child can articulate, describe, and say.

696
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,360
Once again, there are a lot of theories about this.

697
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:41,720
A great root of Aernheim has a theory about this, but we know that every child by three

698
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:49,360
can name every toe and every finger and so on, but the child will not draw that.

699
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:56,640
I think that's probably a matter of maturation and biological integration.

700
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:06,680
In fact, one of the questions that comes up, I showed you, the head end of the organism

701
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,080
is highly put together in the beginning of life.

702
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:11,440
Development goes from the head down, Cephalocore.

703
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,720
The child doesn't even appreciate too stimuli, for example, if you touch a hand in the face,

704
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,360
they won't appreciate the hand until they're pushing towards six.

705
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,720
All of these are newly integrated aspects of it.

706
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,320
They don't represent the middle of the body, you'll notice, but they represent the hands

707
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,520
and the toes, which is just the way the brain is organized.

708
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:39,400
If you look at the sensory strip, the thumb has a huge area of that brain compared to

709
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,640
what the middle of the body.

710
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:46,120
If you use something as simple as two-point discrimination on your finger, you can get

711
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,520
it a millimeter away.

712
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,880
You'll get two points.

713
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,320
You do it on your back.

714
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,240
You can get three inches, and they won't feel two points.

715
00:47:54,240 --> 00:48:00,120
There is a maturational aspect of this, I think, which is involved in control of the

716
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:06,520
pencil to do the thing, which is different from how wonderfully language apparatus is.

717
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,320
Remember, the first year is nonverbal.

718
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,680
Infancy means without speech.

719
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:18,440
Then all of a sudden, between one year and three years of age, you become a one-word person

720
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:25,840
to a well-articulated seven-word sentence phrase, representational stuff.

721
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:32,680
The language apparatus is much more maturationally available to you than the representational

722
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,680
thing.

723
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:40,480
The only people who's, the only creatures on Earth who not only speak and think in language

724
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,080
of that sort, but also write and represent themselves.

725
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:56,440
I also think that there is a brilliant kind of symbolism in these early drawings that

726
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:07,200
they are somehow, the child shows what's important in a way that Picasso famously said, it's

727
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,280
taken me years to learn to draw like a child.

728
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:20,080
There's a certain way in which the child gets down when the child is left to do it.

729
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,920
Why did you say in use of a wonderful phrase, trained up for it?

730
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,640
Well, the child isn't trained up for it, but when the child is left, the child has a way

731
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:33,080
of getting down in the simplest way what really matters.

732
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,680
That drawing was amazing.

733
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,920
That drawing was the scooter bicycle thing.

734
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:47,320
So I think that's also a part of it, that there's a certain beautiful simplicity with

735
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:53,640
all the little details that we learn sort of shunted aside because they're not what matters.

736
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,040
I wanted to tell you that, Ellen, as you were talking, I was looking for one example that

737
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:04,640
I don't have here, but you mentioned how as a child is drawing things happen, change,

738
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,240
and influences what happens next.

739
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,280
I wanted to give you one example of that.

740
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,680
One I wanted wasn't here, but I'll find it is, again, in asking the child to do a house

741
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,920
tree person, a family drawing, we get to see picture picture picture.

742
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,920
So here, for instance, this is one girl, happens to be seven.

743
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,920
So she does a person.

744
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,240
We know she can draw a person.

745
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,000
It's not maybe very clear, but there's a stick person with a fancy head.

746
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Then another person, next to it, she can draw the person.

747
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,720
She can draw a tree.

748
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,680
She can draw a house.

749
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,280
And then I asked her to draw a picture of a family doing something, and she does that

750
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,560
thing up there on the right hand side.

751
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,440
Do you see it?

752
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,560
So, and very careful and detailed.

753
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,640
And I said, tell me about this.

754
00:50:49,640 --> 00:51:00,160
And she says, the two light purple balls, which are at six and nine o'clock, and there

755
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,720
are two dark purple balls at twelve and three o'clock.

756
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,160
I think you can see the colors and differences.

757
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,520
And then she says, the vertical yellow line connects the light and dark balls, that's

758
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,480
at twelve and six.

759
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,240
And then there's this line drawing horizontally between three and nine o'clock.

760
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,240
She's going through this very carefully.

761
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:23,520
And then she explains that these lines keep the balls apart because if they get too close,

762
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,920
they explode.

763
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,080
So here you have something else that's crept into.

764
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,520
This girl can draw figures, and this is her kinetic family drawing, and the answer is,

765
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,840
this is her kinetic family drawing.

766
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:44,480
Family therapists talk about trying in families, this is a drawing of it.

767
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,880
But another more profound example was a boy who drew very tiny figures.

768
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:55,200
A boy, really tiny in the middle of a big page, only pencil, no color.

769
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,200
And then he does a tiny tree in a tiny house, and then I say, no, and not draw a picture

770
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,760
of a family doing something.

771
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:09,320
And he looks, if I'm you, he's looking at me during the pencil, it's pointed and poisoned

772
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,240
the air, and then he goes like this.

773
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,360
Looking up in the corner over there, and my student from the university is sitting there

774
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,960
ready to take notes, and nothing's happening.

775
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,720
And I ask, do you understand what I mean by a family doing something?

776
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,200
And the student says, do you know what a family is?

777
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:30,200
And he goes, and he goes like this.

778
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,360
So this boy says something in what he doesn't do.

779
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,000
That is something about the family for him.

780
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,920
Let's say, interferes with his, what he can do, which is to draw figures.

781
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,360
So this is so important.

782
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,920
That's what I'm interested in.

783
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,080
I'm very interested in that.

784
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:52,040
I'm interested in that, in the child taking time, not doing something.

785
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,960
And also, what does the child draw first?

786
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,000
So you have a family.

787
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,160
Which figure does the child draw first?

788
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,680
Does the child draw the father first?

789
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,160
Does the child draw himself first?

790
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,720
And where are these figures placed?

791
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,920
And which ones are close?

792
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,080
Which ones are far away from each other?

793
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:18,600
But I really think it's dangerous, or not dangerous, that's too strong a word.

794
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:25,920
But I think it's maybe irresponsible to put too much, I think you said this, to put too

795
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:32,800
much weight on any thing of this kind.

796
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:40,720
It's only useful when it's in the context, in a much larger context.

797
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:48,520
And what I think we really can't do is to treat a child's drawing as we would treat

798
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:53,960
a complex work of our, you know, a statue by Bernini or a painting by Rembrandt.

799
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,480
A child's drawing is something else.

800
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,600
It's something which is spontaneous.

801
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,600
It does have psychological content.

802
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,800
Indubitably, it does.

803
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:20,680
But I think that it needs a great deal of context before it can be said to have any kind of

804
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,680
definitive.

805
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,000
Does that make sense to you?

806
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,440
Why one does a study as I did over three years with these families?

807
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,440
But that's also why you ask them to draw something and then you use it as a vehicle

808
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:40,440
to then probe ideas that you might have asked directly because you know if you ask it directly,

809
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:46,240
you're not going to get the same rich experience that you got or the kind of creative aspects

810
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,480
that we're talking about.

811
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,000
Maybe it's, let me show you two images.

812
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Push ahead.

813
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,840
More.

814
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,600
Down further.

815
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,080
Further further.

816
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,960
More.

817
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,960
More.

818
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,960
There we go.

819
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,880
Okay.

820
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,880
Go one more.

821
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,040
And then I'll go back to this because this is, okay.

822
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:21,000
This came from the study that I mentioned before of kids whose parents were hospitalized

823
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,800
for suicide attempts.

824
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,280
And we used only drawings as a starting point.

825
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,720
We didn't ask them about anything.

826
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,560
And one of the things we became aware of as if the parents lied to them about what they

827
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,800
were doing, while everything was perfectly evident, and then many of the kids knew, in

828
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,960
fact, even knew when the parents were doing.

829
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:47,680
This is a drawing of a youngster who drew his father, who was in the hospital, who had

830
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:52,240
slashed up his neck and his wrists.

831
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,640
And those are direct representations of his father's bandaged hands and his father's

832
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,720
straggly beard, which was covering up everything else.

833
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:10,080
Now there the manifest content is smashing in relation to its immediacy.

834
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:17,600
But the further inquiry was to realize that there's more behind this.

835
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,520
We knew he realized that we knew it was there, and so forth and so on.

836
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,640
No matter how many people lied to him, at least we had some evidentiary base that this is his

837
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,600
acknowledgment of it.

838
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,480
So there the manifest content is useful to us.

839
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,200
But it's not, didn't tell us what he was thinking, feeling and what have you.

840
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,120
By the way, one of the outcomes of this study, which was then advanced later on at other

841
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:47,000
places, Bob became a great student of trauma.

842
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,000
He interviewed a lot of kids who was one parent killed the other right in the police station

843
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,400
and used these drawing techniques.

844
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,840
I just wanted to tell you about how useful it is.

845
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,320
Go one back now.

846
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,720
Okay.

847
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,400
Let me tell you the background of this because I'm going to get to this drawing.

848
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,960
It was a little girl, very shy, very tiring, five years of age.

849
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:21,160
Her father, a surgeon, had brought it to see me many years ago.

850
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,920
The family had suffered a loss.

851
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:30,720
A relative of theirs had lost two children and a mother in a fire in a country home.

852
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,640
And she knew about it, etc., and was having, wasn't sleeping very well.

853
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:41,560
Well, her father brought her into the office after I had gotten some history and so forth

854
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,480
from them separately.

855
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,680
And she was very shy.

856
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,080
She was hanging behind her father.

857
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,520
She wasn't going to talk and so forth and so on.

858
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:54,240
So I let them both come into the consulting room together.

859
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,520
And I realized I wasn't going to get very far with her.

860
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,080
I started peppering her with questions or doing anything.

861
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,320
So I took a stack of paper and I said, I just read Winnicott and Winnicott has something

862
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,320
called a squiggle game.

863
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,360
You make a little squiggle and they finish it and then you take another sheet of paper

864
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,560
and then we go further.

865
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,760
We must have had 15 squiggles in the midst of it.

866
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,680
I was brave enough to ask her father to go out.

867
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,280
And he goes out and she stayed with me and she loosened up and she began talking about

868
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,280
things.

869
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,280
And Winnicott talks about when things become precongous.

870
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,960
And anyway, along the way there's a lot of stuff.

871
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,400
Until finally she gets to her being very fond of parties and parties which have this kind

872
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,800
of represent they snoopy parties and so forth.

873
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:42,240
And then her brother she said was having a party where there was a fireman theme.

874
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:53,160
So I picked up on that and I said I heard that there was a sad fire in the family and

875
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,680
there was a sad fire in the family.

876
00:58:54,680 --> 00:59:02,520
Okay, she says, yes, I said that they died so she spontaneously now tells me without my

877
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,760
asking her about it.

878
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:09,200
You know the sister did get out so there's some repair in the fact that not everybody

879
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,200
went.

880
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,000
I look at my daddy's surgery book.

881
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,600
Now where did that come from?

882
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,680
So you pay attention to the associated path and so forth as to what's going on.

883
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:28,440
Now she had made reference to her father being a surgeon and he put people to sleep with

884
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,560
what she calls sleepy air.

885
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:36,480
And by the way, she remembers she has a sleep disturbance.

886
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,160
I looked at my daddy's surgery book and the pictures of them doing dog surgery.

887
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:50,240
My mother and Amy, these are fictitious names, had their appendixes out.

888
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,960
Where does this come from?

889
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,920
You sit there amazed as to where, what's happening here?

890
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,920
Okay.

891
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:03,040
I said, your mother and Amy, she said, well they only had to take it out if it's infected

892
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,680
and you cut a hole in a blanket and then you're asleep.

893
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,160
I saw my mother scar.

894
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,760
I hear she's going on.

895
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,440
I said, maybe you'd like to draw it.

896
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,920
That's a picture.

897
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:24,000
If she says to me, what if it comes out looking like a child?

898
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,520
I'll leave it up to you as we go along to make the inferences.

899
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,520
Okay.

900
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,120
I said, do it as you like to do it.

901
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:38,160
She draws and says, the oval part of the scar is what I'm going to show and she has a ponytail

902
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,160
too.

903
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:44,960
I said, you have one too because she had a long, she looked at me disdainfully.

904
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,120
She said, it's a braid, not a ponytail.

905
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,480
And then she says, my hair is as long.

906
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,800
No, it's longer than my mother's.

907
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,120
And then we went on to something else.

908
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,520
Okay.

909
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,560
What has this got to do with the loss of those two kids?

910
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,440
Her not being able to go to sleep.

911
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:13,520
Her father being a surgeon and whatever is going on with her about the marvel that while

912
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:19,160
someone sleeps, his father makes holes in their body.

913
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:26,280
And then juxtaposed to that as a long ponytail to make up for it.

914
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,280
Adepish medapists.

915
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,440
So, I know what she is.

916
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,440
But five.

917
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,160
So, she's, to me, the most absolutely.

918
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:40,000
By the way, you notice she has the flipper arms of the other child.

919
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,440
Very common thing.

920
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,000
But she has five fingers on it.

921
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,160
That she, that she sneaks that remark.

922
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,720
The appendix, something is going to come out.

923
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,720
Supposed it looks like a child.

924
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,920
I mean, that's absolutely stunning.

925
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,200
That is stunning.

926
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,080
And it's so, it's so real.

927
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:01,440
I mean, children, that's exactly the kind of thing a child would think, would say, would

928
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,320
imagine what could come out.

929
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,160
We know it comes out of mommies.

930
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,640
Oh my God.

931
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,960
And the drawing is, and it's interesting, you know, what, one thing interesting about

932
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,880
the drawing when you look at it is that you have to remember also aesthetically how

933
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,480
do children learn to draw?

934
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,560
This is again going back to this remark about the culture.

935
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,200
Look at the nose.

936
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:30,880
That little upside down you is a convention for doing a nose that some children learn

937
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,640
by looking at some picture books that have that as a convention.

938
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,040
We've all seen that.

939
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:42,920
So certain, certain mannerisms in the drawing, when you're interpreting, if you are in

940
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:49,840
interpreting it, you have to remember that children will develop mannerisms that come

941
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,640
from the culture.

942
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,560
And that is definitely a mannerism.

943
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,800
We can't assume that the mother who knows it looks anything like that.

944
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:02,720
That's simply probably every drawing, that will be the way the nose, this child will

945
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,720
draw the nose.

946
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:08,880
Another child will draw the nose with a flat line or a straight line or a u that goes the

947
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,880
other way.

948
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:16,480
We have about 15 minutes remaining, so I thought maybe it was time to open up for questions

949
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,480
from others.

950
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,480
Is that okay?

951
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:48,460
The blonde child, how do you determine the ability of the person drawing, the child

952
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:58,080
drawing against his or her creativity or individuality?

953
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:09,560
Then you've got another picture, the artist show that girls with arms and boys without

954
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,080
arms.

955
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:20,240
Would this not be imagination running faster than the ability to draw, to get it down.

956
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,400
The girls came first, I think.

957
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,400
No?

958
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:28,240
All right, then I'm wrong about let that go.

959
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:35,080
But one thing that runs through what I have heard today, as it seems to me, you're making

960
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:42,080
an assumption that drawing ability of all children of the same age or to be the same

961
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,080
or is the same.

962
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,080
Not at all.

963
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,080
Well, that's what I mean.

964
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,080
Not at all.

965
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,280
I think that's what Ted was laying out here.

966
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:53,720
But in fact, I didn't take all the time, I didn't want to take all the time I should,

967
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:59,920
but part of the study in the book is we looked at how very different developmental capacity

968
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,680
for drawing was at the same age.

969
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,800
That's the advantage and that's why I chose to look only at six years of age.

970
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,480
But go ahead, something else you wanted to ask her.

971
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,800
Yeah, just a couple of quick points because they all are around the same issue.

972
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:17,880
It's not what I heard, by the way.

973
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,440
Read the autistic child and the bicycle.

974
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:28,440
I don't know how many people in this room could draw that bicycle as stunningly as

975
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,640
this autistic.

976
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,320
That child has artistic ability.

977
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:38,680
I mean, I certainly couldn't do it.

978
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:44,560
And then the idea of, well, you went into this which came first, the drawing on the

979
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,080
other.

980
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,640
So the bike and the, where was the family?

981
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,640
Oh, yes.

982
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:54,160
The abstract drawing of you told her to draw a family.

983
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,680
That abstract with the dots, so the yellow line and so on.

984
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:06,800
In this case, what I see, and I'm not a professional, but what I see, is in the bike, the artist,

985
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:13,520
or the youngster has extraordinary drawing ability, capacity, even though he's artistic.

986
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:23,120
And as far as the child who did the abstract family, think of the abstract ability of that

987
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:31,520
child far beyond her age, far beyond her age, to be able to contemplate such a representation

988
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,520
of her family.

989
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,080
Well, anyway, that's what I wanted to say.

990
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,440
Could I respond to the first two, to your first point?

991
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,880
Because I'm so glad you made that point.

992
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:46,440
I think that I was sort of, when you started, I knew, I kind of knew where you were going

993
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,440
with that.

994
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,200
Because I think it's really important.

995
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:59,040
So what you're suggesting is that that image, which I plead guilty to calling primitive,

996
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:07,160
what could in fact be an amazingly creative expression on the part of the child who could

997
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:11,840
have possibly drawn the figure in other ways.

998
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,440
And I think that's very, very important to keep in mind.

999
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:24,920
And the cognitive ability, the ability to draw something, is something which you did,

1000
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,680
is trained up.

1001
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,200
It is something that is trained up a child, and is rewarded.

1002
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:35,920
The parent will say, oh, wow, when a child does it correctly, like coloring in the lines

1003
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,520
on the coloring book.

1004
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,200
These are things that the culture is rewarding.

1005
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:46,920
But a child who does it in that magical way, like the bicycle or the other way, that child

1006
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,840
might not be rewarded.

1007
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,960
And it might not be right to call it primitive.

1008
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,920
It might be right to call it something else.

1009
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,440
So I really, I appreciate that so much.

1010
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,960
And I plead guilty and I stand corrected.

1011
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,320
And I think that's a wonderful contribution.

1012
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,320
Thank you.

1013
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:05,200
If I'm going to add one thing, I have a granddaughter who's going to be three, but I,

1014
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:10,400
she's a little over two and a half, because the right time for the system, anyway, she

1015
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,400
loves to draw.

1016
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,280
She can't draw to save her life.

1017
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,720
I mean, you know, she can't, she just scribbles.

1018
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:29,560
But give her stickies, the stickons, and she will create a montage with an oddest sensibility,

1019
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:35,560
you know, an equal number of horizontal followed by an equal number of vertical or a circle.

1020
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,160
And it has four.

1021
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:41,560
So we have about ten minutes.

1022
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:48,600
So to get an idea so that you all know how many questions there are, perhaps as Rob

1023
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:53,560
suggested, those who have questions, if you would step up and line so we know how many

1024
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:58,240
people have questions, then you can keep that in mind when you ask your own question.

1025
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,320
There should not be a war between the artists and the humanists here.

1026
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:06,120
I mean, this is not that I'm not against creativity.

1027
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:12,280
I just want to know what aspects of capacity with developmental achievement.

1028
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,600
There are people who have very different abilities to be sure to be creative.

1029
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,880
I'll tell you one point where you hit a lot of tension between those who wish for and

1030
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,280
foster creativity and the kids in another camp.

1031
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:29,320
You get six and seven year olds, you tend into art school, everybody wants them to be terrifically

1032
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,320
creative.

1033
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,600
You know what a six and seven year old wants?

1034
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,040
Control of the medium.

1035
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:38,640
So he can make it work for himself in the way in which he wants to.

1036
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:45,200
Also there's a tension between our encouraging, you know, the artistic.

1037
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,640
Go ahead.

1038
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:51,760
Thank you so much for your good work in coming out today.

1039
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:55,280
And sometimes I've been a teaching artist early childhood education.

1040
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,480
So first of all, you might find it interesting anybody here that I have a video up on YouTube

1041
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:05,240
where five year old kindergarten kids from Inwood say no adults left behind.

1042
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:09,000
They sit in their little kindergarten chairs and they ask each other questions about life

1043
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,160
what makes you happy, say, why do people like, cheat and fight?

1044
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:17,600
And the five year old spontaneously, no adults in this have better answers than most adults.

1045
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,800
So my question is going back to as Alice Miller who I greatly admire, she's one of

1046
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,560
her main ideas was emotion attaches meaning to experience.

1047
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,960
If there's no emotion, there's no way that anybody can create meaning and understanding

1048
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,760
and of reading, writing experiences got to be an emotion.

1049
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:39,520
When it comes to education, emotion is left out like it's the plague.

1050
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:45,240
So for a five year old and I'm still like a recovering five year old in my own life,

1051
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:50,320
it is like all the emotionality is that if my mommy and daddy scream yell and fight like

1052
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:57,080
some of these things with from Ethiopia, it must be because I'm a monster.

1053
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:03,120
And that's like the emperor's new, you know, the P under the 20 blankets of saying I am

1054
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,200
a horrible and my whole life is predicated, I'm a monster.

1055
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:14,280
But to use this because language hasn't evolved yet, but when it comes to like primary and

1056
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:19,400
basic education, institutionalized education rather than just somebody who has a psychiatric

1057
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:25,760
problem that you have lots of experience credentials that these kinds of ideas to help a child

1058
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:34,360
emotionally express the feelings that lead to meaning and understanding, but in a way

1059
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:39,800
that is connected with the development of the brain.

1060
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:46,720
Do you see positive things about how these things could be introduced into everyday education

1061
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:53,080
in the classroom rather than making a five year old be a grown up adult when he's five?

1062
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,640
You know, I mean, is it something you're doing?

1063
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:01,320
You're taking action on or, you know, how would that, what you're doing?

1064
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,960
This is my, I'll finish up here.

1065
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:08,800
Compliment, you know, the push to get a five year old to read and write.

1066
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,800
Okay.

1067
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:15,480
I think you have articulated a wonderful new topic for the healing foundation, but we couldn't

1068
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:20,640
possibly address it in this, it's a huge problem in America today.

1069
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,160
And not just in America, but in China and India and everywhere.

1070
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,760
It's a huge problem.

1071
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,720
You're addressing something enormous, sir.

1072
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,520
What I'm just saying.

1073
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,800
We're asking you for addressing it, but I don't think we can answer it yet.

1074
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:40,240
I'm also motivating you all who have credentials, who are greatly admired to maybe take the

1075
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:45,040
initiative that you can do something about this and make a difference in the lives of

1076
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,960
hundreds of children.

1077
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:47,960
You can do it.

1078
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:51,200
But it takes people like you to take the initiative.

1079
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:56,760
And I greatly, you know, in the name of children, you know, I'm sorry.

1080
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,720
Thank you very much.

1081
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,720
Thank you.

1082
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:04,320
I'm not going to move to you, I just maybe just a supplement to this.

1083
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:08,320
The program that I worked in, I chose very carefully in Israel.

1084
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:12,240
In general, the Ethiopian kids are integrated into all the public school systems, but the

1085
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:18,120
public school systems in Israel, the classrooms are 35 to 38 children.

1086
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:22,160
I can't even begin to understand how they do that, but the kids learn, they're really

1087
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,880
smart and they do well academically.

1088
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,920
When the Weizels were asked when they wanted to do something significant in Israel, and

1089
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,360
the Weizel used his Nobel Prize money to do this, he specifically set up an after school

1090
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:38,800
program for Ethiopian kids only in two communities, Ashkelon, the one that I was in in Kiyah

1091
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,320
Malahi.

1092
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,880
And the focus on the program was on academics, reading and writing.

1093
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,320
These parents who are illiterate or pre-literate, it's very important to them that their kids

1094
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,320
learn to read and write.

1095
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,720
And to get ahead in Israel, you need to read and write.

1096
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:59,000
And the focus in the program really is helping them with their academics.

1097
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,360
They do it in a remarkably warm way.

1098
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:06,600
The classrooms are 18 children, or 15 children, or 17 children.

1099
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,040
And I chose of all the classrooms, I picked one where I thought there was a teacher who

1100
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:16,640
was really very connected with the kids and effective.

1101
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:23,680
So the teachers did say, when I asked, I took the kids out to draw, I was the picture doctor,

1102
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:27,040
they called me from Jerusalem.

1103
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,440
They would sometimes be surprised at what the kids revealed.

1104
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:35,240
First they didn't know that was going on in the family, or they might have known, but

1105
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,240
they didn't know the details.

1106
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:38,920
So they were surprised at what the kids could reveal with that.

1107
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,280
So that can maybe supplement or compliment what their work was.

1108
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:46,760
But it was clearly important, and I support what they were doing, that the kids should

1109
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,560
learn their academics.

1110
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,840
And the kids enjoyed it.

1111
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:55,760
I had the pleasure of writing a blog for Nathan's book.

1112
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,240
And one of the things that hasn't come out today, and you ought to read it, is that most

1113
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:06,000
of these families were traumatized.

1114
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,160
And whatever they were doing there must have come through in some of these drawings here

1115
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,840
or there and so forth.

1116
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,960
The women were forced into marriage when they were teenagers.

1117
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:21,560
The second thing is that they were immigrants from a culture which was persecuting them

1118
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:26,760
and then they were here and they found this place to live and bring up their children.

1119
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,680
So there's a lot that's not being told about this that you ought to learn somewhere else.

1120
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,680
But I just want to...

1121
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:38,240
I think three or seventeen plus or minus two short questions.

1122
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,280
One has to do with...

1123
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:44,920
I really thought your discussion was very stimulating.

1124
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,360
One had to do with the relationship between the drawings and the writings.

1125
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,360
The stories.

1126
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,120
The stories seemed to be, as you...

1127
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,560
And none say them, were very sophisticated.

1128
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,520
They seemed like they were pretty...

1129
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,120
They weren't in any way illiterate.

1130
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,760
They were pretty sophisticated.

1131
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:05,200
So I was curious about the relationship that you perceived having to do with that.

1132
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:09,600
The second question is somewhat related and it had to do with the extent to which these

1133
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,800
drawings or stories have a therapeutic value in and of themselves.

1134
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,800
Right.

1135
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,440
The third is a little bit more...

1136
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,440
That's a question.

1137
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:23,240
The third is a little more of a comment and I was very impressed that I am with the international

1138
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:28,120
relation, the global and comparative cultural differences that exist.

1139
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,880
And I think they have pretty significant.

1140
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:37,360
Because there are stick drawings that kids in Africa use because they haven't seen sort

1141
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,360
of...

1142
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,600
They can use photographs as well or three-dimensional because they haven't seen them.

1143
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,080
They haven't seen airplanes, well now they do maybe.

1144
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,320
But they're more familiar with cartoon stick drawings.

1145
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,040
Anyway, those are the two main questions.

1146
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,400
The second one I'll start with is the therapeutic quality.

1147
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,880
One of the things that comes out in our work and tend to refer to it is to a Winnicott

1148
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:04,760
squiggle game is that it's hard as a doc to not try to do something that's helpful, even

1149
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:07,600
if you're supposed to be diagnosing.

1150
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:13,560
Or I was trained in developmental assessment by Sally Provens and Sally's emphasis to

1151
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,280
us is to help the child do the best he or she can.

1152
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,160
You want to get the best picture that can do.

1153
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,880
Not literal drawing.

1154
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:27,040
So yes, but if I'd come in as a therapist, many of the parents would have been skeptical

1155
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,040
of me.

1156
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:32,640
In fact, one of the conditions of my doing the research by the parents, I could see the

1157
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:37,160
kids I could draw, I could tell stories, I could come to the homes, I could do no testing.

1158
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:44,840
No IQ, no projective, nothing like that because they were specific about this.

1159
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:48,880
They were worried that the Israeli government would get the information and would do something

1160
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,920
to their kids.

1161
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:54,840
So that's a subversive quality.

1162
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,040
The first question is a more complex one as I recall it.

1163
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:05,920
And that is I had over 300 pictures that the kids did in stories and it varied the nature

1164
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:11,480
of the story versus the picture, the richness of complexity, depending on the kid and so

1165
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,000
on.

1166
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,840
And I had kids who would start saying I don't know how to draw a person.

1167
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,920
And I said that's okay.

1168
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,000
Then they drew a person.

1169
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,400
This stuns me when I see this happen.

1170
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:35,080
So my sort of unsatisfactory answer is it depends when it comes to the relationship between

1171
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:43,640
story and drawing.

1172
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,200
Let me think, I think there are others can answer that.

1173
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,600
I want to think about that.

1174
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,800
I would like to relate this gentleman's question to this gentleman's question because I think

1175
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,240
those two questions really can be brought together.

1176
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:02,160
The second, your second question and your question.

1177
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,520
I think there is inherent therapeutic value.

1178
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:14,760
When a child is given a chance to express herself or himself, this is inherently in a

1179
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:20,760
constructive kind of way with drawing materials, with singing, with dancing, with writing a

1180
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:26,960
poem or with when a child has those experiences, it is inherently therapeutic.

1181
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:33,640
I was the Erickson scholar at Austin Riggs in Stockbridge and one of the most wonderful

1182
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:42,000
things in that community, which is an inpatient center, is that there are all kinds of places

1183
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,800
for patients to do drama, to do artwork, to do all these things.

1184
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:53,560
The person who was really responsible for that was Joan Erickson, who was an art therapist,

1185
01:19:53,560 --> 01:20:03,440
who did not believe in interpreting the content of the drawing, but who believed in something

1186
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,760
so amazing.

1187
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:13,720
She said, let's bring an artist, a practicing artist, a sculptor, for example, into Riggs

1188
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:21,240
and give the sculptor a studio and let the sculptor work and let patients come in and

1189
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:27,240
just be there with the sculptor and talk to them and interact with them and then they

1190
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,800
can have materials and they can do this work.

1191
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:35,440
So your point about what's good in education for kids and your point about is it inherently

1192
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:39,600
therapeutic are very easy to bring together.

1193
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,920
These are activities that we are not giving priority to and what you said Nathan is so

1194
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,640
true.

1195
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:50,680
Parents are so terrified that children won't make it in the world, that they won't be

1196
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,280
able to make it in the tough world out there.

1197
01:20:53,280 --> 01:21:03,560
We have to test them and prepare them and give them what we think they should know.

1198
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:11,880
What's really growing the whole person, Jerome Brunner, who is 98 years old now, wrote an

1199
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:15,160
amazing book called The Process of Education.

1200
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:21,840
He believes that the child constructs the world as did Piaget and we need to let the

1201
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,200
child construct the world and we need also to let the child take risks.

1202
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,800
We're so ready to step in.

1203
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:32,360
Parents, they are so ready to step in and not let the child take risks.

1204
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:38,840
I just published a little paper on creativity in childhood and it's very important to, I

1205
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:44,120
don't believe it not being safe, but I believe that we should let a child figure out something.

1206
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:49,680
And if it's a little bit risky sometimes because that's the only way, not just in art, but

1207
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,000
in other areas too.

1208
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,720
So I think those questions do come together.

1209
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:58,160
It's four o'clock and Rob said we could run over a bit.

1210
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,640
We go to the port there.

1211
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:00,640
For 30.

1212
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:01,640
Oh, we have time.

1213
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:02,640
Okay.

1214
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:03,640
We have time.

1215
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,640
Go ahead.

1216
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,640
Thanks for an interesting talk.

1217
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:12,640
What I found fascinating what I was thinking about was in your experience have you worked

1218
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:21,360
with kids who, when you give them the pencil and paper or the crayon and paper, if they

1219
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:26,640
draw outside of the boundaries of the paper, I found it fascinating that all the kids respected

1220
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:31,960
the medium so much that they stayed within the confines of the paper.

1221
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:37,840
And I wonder if the paper was larger or if it was a circle instead of a square or a triangular

1222
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:43,520
paper, how much it would influence what they would draw or feel that they could draw.

1223
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:48,160
If you say draw a house, what the paper was circular, what would happen.

1224
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:53,800
And I can't recall, I'm a child psychiatrist, but I can't recall giving even a young child

1225
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,880
pencil and paper or crayons and them drawing outside of the boundaries.

1226
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:02,080
And I'm just wondering if you guys had that experience and what do you think that means

1227
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,080
about that child?

1228
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:11,080
Well, I can tell you I worked at the Edelson Center for Child Research, this kids who

1229
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,080
are from my children.

1230
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,160
I'm a little boy that I wrote about this, I wrote an essay about it, but this little

1231
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:19,520
boy had no sense of boundaries.

1232
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:25,560
Everything, the paint went over onto the table, it went over onto him, it went into his mouth,

1233
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,560
it went everywhere.

1234
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:37,160
Actually, he was so in the material and it was in a way, it was okay because he really

1235
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,520
needed that.

1236
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:43,640
And I think you're getting at something which is again, this is the control that we put.

1237
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,240
Where are the boundaries that we want to give to the child?

1238
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,520
I mean, I think big is good.

1239
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:55,880
I think giving a child in a wall or a huge having kids, I've done this with kids because

1240
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:00,680
I've actually done a lot of work with, you know, giving them paper on the floor and letting

1241
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,960
them draw something big.

1242
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,200
I think big is important.

1243
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:10,800
Children need that, they need the big to draw, say everything so, it's very constricting

1244
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,040
to draw small all the time.

1245
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,400
Big is good, I think, for many children.

1246
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:19,480
Children are afraid of that, it was good to move them out of their comfort zone.

1247
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:23,640
The comfort zone is to do what the grownups want.

1248
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:28,800
But sometimes, and the thing is the teacher has to not be afraid.

1249
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,080
Teachers are the ones who are afraid.

1250
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,680
The teachers are afraid of the children.

1251
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,200
The teachers are afraid of what will come out of the child.

1252
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,000
I wanted to show you, I don't know if there's time, but I wanted to show you the drawings

1253
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:48,760
of the Children of Tarasian, the concentration camp that the Nazis made in near Prague.

1254
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:51,880
Children the children did drawings there.

1255
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,600
The teacher was a Bauhaus artist.

1256
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,760
She was, her name was Fiedel Dicker Brandeis.

1257
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:06,520
In the Bauhaus, it was universal arts, architecture, furniture design, fabric design, drawing,

1258
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,520
painting, sculpture.

1259
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,680
Everybody studied there had to try everything and do everything.

1260
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:17,240
And she worked with these kids who were separated from their parents living in separate houses.

1261
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:21,560
I don't know how many of you, are all of you familiar with what went on in Tarasian?

1262
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:27,400
I feel bad because my work, I didn't only brought the, probably just the ones that everybody

1263
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,400
knows.

1264
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,160
But, um, should I show them?

1265
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,200
Should I, should I, should I, I don't know if I should do.

1266
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:36,080
Are you interested to see them?

1267
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,000
No, I, I just have a few, I have a few of the drawings, but they're in, we put them

1268
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
onto the-

1269
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
We're going to transfer, huh?

1270
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
How about if we do this?

1271
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,440
Ted wants to show one picture of his question of boundaries.

1272
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,440
Yeah, that's wonderful.

1273
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,440
Then we can transfer over.

1274
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:53,920
I just wanted to show you this because it may relate to your question.

1275
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:58,320
I did a study once of kids' conceptions of growth, so I had them draw a ghost.

1276
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,440
This was the most elaborated ghost I've ever seen.

1277
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:08,840
Most of them are very slim and narrow, so, but this kid, I mean, you know, what you put

1278
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:17,120
down on the page is an overflow of, it has nothing to do with what a ghost looks like

1279
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,400
to him because later he drew a ghost from me.

1280
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,040
It has to do the feeling aspects of it.

1281
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:29,680
So yes, this is all of the unarticulated explosive aspects of his anxiety and fear and so forth

1282
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:30,680
and so on.

1283
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:35,520
So if you want a representation of that, I do want to make one comment on education.

1284
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:42,880
You know, there have been, I know in a group like this, we're all very touchy-feely.

1285
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,600
There have been movements in education which want to teach for the whole child and the

1286
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,920
creative and so forth.

1287
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:56,360
There's the Dewey movement, there's the Montessori movement, there's the Rudolf Steiner movement

1288
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,840
and so forth and so on.

1289
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:04,400
What's happened in America is a backlash against that kind of education which started

1290
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:10,800
with Sputnik in our competition with the fact that we weren't getting our, our math is not

1291
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,320
as good as it is in China.

1292
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:20,360
So we have a highly competitive, learn the three R's and then we can go on to who's creative.

1293
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,640
But not everybody's make greater.

1294
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:26,960
So that's an artifact of our culture, not the aims of education.

1295
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,600
So I just want you to.

1296
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:35,280
And then when I listen to Alan, my thought is, and your question about boundary, I worked

1297
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:42,400
in Israel, the schools are not very rich, for me to get clean white paper was a big deal.

1298
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,040
I brought my own finally.

1299
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,920
I brought my own crayons because it was too, and I know how to get crayons that don't

1300
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:49,920
break.

1301
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:55,040
No, no, seriously, you can get this kind of, I learned this from Sally Provence, this thickness

1302
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,600
crayons, they don't break.

1303
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,600
All sorts of little tricks like that.

1304
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:04,680
So maybe this would be optimal in certain settings, you know, to have different shapes,

1305
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,080
paper and different sizes.

1306
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:13,280
But for me, to have each kid have a ream of clean white paper and crayons that weren't

1307
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,360
broken was a big deal.

1308
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,360
And I still have.

1309
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:23,640
I had several, actually they were drawing pencils that they're like this thick and I

1310
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:26,520
sharpened them each time before I saw the kids and so on.

1311
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,200
And I had a sharpener there in case they broke it.

1312
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,000
I mean, those are the little practical things.

1313
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,280
But the other is, I hear Alan talking about helping a kid express whatever spontaneously

1314
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:40,000
is coming to him and helping that as a process to work it through.

1315
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,560
That is an important part of the process.

1316
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,640
My job was a different one, which is to ask each child of 46 children, tell me about

1317
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:50,720
yourself.

1318
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:55,840
Most of my kids also did spontaneous drawings, which I, some of which I included in the book.

1319
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:59,760
But in order to compare one child to another, I wanted to make sure that each kid drew the

1320
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,120
same picture.

1321
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:04,600
So I did that, unguilty of that, same draw person.

1322
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,960
By the way, most of the kids enjoyed doing that.

1323
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,440
Very few objected to it.

1324
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:13,400
So your questions are interesting ones and you could pursue that yourself and see how

1325
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,240
it comes out.

1326
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:20,280
In terms of boundaries, my experience, and it may be similar to what Alan is describing,

1327
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:24,600
that it's my more disturbed kids who go outside the boundaries of the paper.

1328
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,680
Most kids stay inside it.

1329
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:29,960
You could say some of the more disturbed kids are very constricted and stay right in the

1330
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:35,760
middle, but really disturbed kids are the ones that went beyond the paper onto the table.

1331
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,680
And none of these kids were that disturbed.

1332
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:40,520
Do you want to go down on your...

1333
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,320
I can't make it...

1334
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:43,320
Here you go.

1335
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,320
Other questions while Alan is showing up for pictures?

1336
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,880
I want to go back to the full screen.

1337
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:47,880
Okay.

1338
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:48,880
Any other questions?

1339
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:49,880
I can't get it to the full screen.

1340
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:54,200
By the way, there's copies of Alan's book and my book available afterwards for those

1341
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,200
who want to.

1342
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,200
Fine.

1343
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,200
You can't make it do this.

1344
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:58,200
Can I get it to the full screen?

1345
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:01,480
No, that won't do that.

1346
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,440
No.

1347
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,520
I don't know what it's doing.

1348
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,840
One thing I'm really bad is technology.

1349
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,240
Do you want to present something more?

1350
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,240
She's setting that up?

1351
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,240
I need to.

1352
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,240
She's got it.

1353
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,240
She's got it.

1354
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,240
Come.

1355
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,240
Two just can't get through the full screen.

1356
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:18,240
I just can't get...

1357
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,240
I'm trying to get it to the full screen.

1358
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,680
Bottom on the right.

1359
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,680
This...

1360
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:24,680
Oh, here.

1361
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:25,680
Bravo.

1362
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,680
Brilliant.

1363
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:27,680
Thank you, my dear.

1364
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:28,680
Thank you so much.

1365
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:29,680
Thank you so much.

1366
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,680
Okay.

1367
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,120
I think we need to have some left...

1368
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,040
Is there any way to get less light?

1369
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,040
Because...

1370
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,040
Or I guess now...

1371
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:41,800
Let's go ahead, Alan, because we'll spend so much time there.

1372
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,800
Okay.

1373
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,800
All right.

1374
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:51,480
So the Nazis created a concentration camp outside of Prague, which had been a fortress

1375
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:54,280
which held a relatively small number of people.

1376
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:58,200
And the Germans began to import...

1377
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,000
To bring Jews there.

1378
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,480
They took everybody out.

1379
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:05,160
They brought huge numbers of Jewish...

1380
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:08,280
Czech Jews there, including a lot of children.

1381
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:13,600
It was a place where there were a lot of artists, a lot of writers, musicians, composers.

1382
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:18,920
When you go to the archive, you're astonished by what went on in this camp artistically.

1383
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:24,600
But what happened was Frito-Dooker Brandeis, who was a Bauhaus trained artist, one of the

1384
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:33,360
very few women artists in the Bauhaus, was eventually captured with her husband and brought

1385
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,200
to this camp.

1386
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:41,240
When she got to the camp, she decided to separate it, of course, from her husband.

1387
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,840
All the men and women were separated.

1388
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,480
She decided to devote herself to the children.

1389
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:48,760
She lived in one of the girls' houses.

1390
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:53,320
The girls in her house were 12 to 14 years old.

1391
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:58,720
She decided to teach them to help them draw, to give them art, because the Nazis had forbidden

1392
01:31:58,720 --> 01:31:59,960
school.

1393
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,400
So they couldn't do any formal learning, but they could do music and art.

1394
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,960
They didn't think that was very important.

1395
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,240
So, of course, the children could do that.

1396
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,400
What did she do for materials?

1397
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,640
She scrounged materials.

1398
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,840
So whatever she could find, she used.

1399
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:17,560
This is a child's drawing.

1400
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,160
The Germans renamed the children.

1401
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,960
They gave them these Czech names were germanified.

1402
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:26,640
When I looked at these drawings, I just want to quickly tell you that what happened was

1403
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:29,320
she worked with these children for two years.

1404
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:32,160
Her husband was going to be deported to Auschwitz.

1405
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,600
She heard about that.

1406
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:40,800
She, without with a sun glimmer of hope, decided to try to join him to go to.

1407
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,400
Both of them were killed in the gas chambers.

1408
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:49,320
But when she realized that she was leaving, she took the drawings of the children.

1409
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,480
We thought, originally, there were about 2,000 of them.

1410
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:54,960
It turns out that they were close to 4,000 of these drawings.

1411
01:32:54,960 --> 01:33:02,680
She crammed the drawings into two suitcases and hid the suitcases of these drawings, hoping

1412
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,200
that they would be found.

1413
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:08,120
And then she went off to die in Auschwitz.

1414
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:12,160
After the war, the suitcases of the drawings were found.

1415
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:18,880
These drawings are now in the archive of the Jewish Museum in Prague.

1416
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:23,720
I spent time there on several occasions looking at the drawings, and they're amazing.

1417
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:28,880
And one thing that they tell you, which we didn't talk about today in the round table,

1418
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,280
we didn't mention is the element of wish.

1419
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:40,600
A dream Freud talks stunningly in the interpretation of dreams about how a dream is a wish, can

1420
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:41,880
be seen as a wish.

1421
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:44,360
And drawings can be wishes too.

1422
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:52,480
And when you look at these drawings by these children, you don't see atrocity.

1423
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:58,400
Almost none of the drawings show you the horrible things that were going on around them.

1424
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:03,360
What they show you is what the children missed, what the children longed for, what the children

1425
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:06,000
didn't have anymore, what they remembered.

1426
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,640
And sometimes you see what was going on.

1427
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:13,960
So here's a picture of the barracks at Terrazine by one of the children.

1428
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:19,720
This is a drawing by one of the artists in the camp, an adult artist in the camp.

1429
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,560
His name was Bedrick Fritta.

1430
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,440
And he did this drawing of one of the deportations.

1431
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:28,720
I'm not sure whether the people there are leaving or coming, but these drawings were

1432
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:31,320
done clandestinely, of course.

1433
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:34,280
This is a picture of one of the children.

1434
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:35,880
And here's another children's drawing.

1435
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:38,280
This is the doorway of Terrazine.

1436
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:44,320
When you go there today, if you visit the camp, you see the yellow painted plaster on

1437
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,600
the wooden door.

1438
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,840
This is another child's drawing.

1439
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:55,160
Now the children in Terrazine ranged from eight to about 16.

1440
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:56,160
No one was younger than eight.

1441
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:59,000
None of the children whose drawings we have were younger than eight.

1442
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,520
None of them was older than about 16.

1443
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,520
And when they're documented, when we have documentation, we have the birth of the child

1444
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:09,640
and the date of the deportation to Auschwitz, which is the date of the death, because no

1445
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:14,360
child would always die in the year of deportation.

1446
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:16,520
So you have those two days.

1447
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:21,960
And you can assume that the drawings were done within two years of the date of deportation.

1448
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:27,160
So this is what the inside look like from the child's point of view.

1449
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,640
This is another child's drawing.

1450
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,120
You have here the bunk beds.

1451
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:36,760
Everything was numbered, and you know the numbers were put on the arms, but everything

1452
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,560
was done according to the number.

1453
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:44,000
This house that Fiedel lived in was L104.

1454
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,560
The houses were also numbered.

1455
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:50,880
The Nazis were very good at dehumanizing people in every possible way, but giving somebody

1456
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:57,440
a number is a way of dehumanizing you.

1457
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:02,040
And we have no information, no information.

1458
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:09,160
So in my imagination, I see the matron on the right as Fiedel herself.

1459
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:12,480
She looked a little bit like that, but of course probably wasn't she.

1460
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:21,600
There is, you see the suitcases under the bed of the children who were in Tarazin.

1461
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:33,640
15,000 children passed through this camp from 1942 to 1944 of the 15,000 children, Jewish

1462
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,440
children in that camp.

1463
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:39,760
One hundred children survived.

1464
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,760
All the rest died.

1465
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:44,480
So the drawings are, by most of these drawings, are by the children who died.

1466
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:45,880
Now this is Stitchery.

1467
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:50,120
The children, she's scrounged, which you can see this is a ledger, some page torn out

1468
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:56,480
of some ledger, and she got some wool and you see the child doing flowers, butterflies,

1469
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:06,200
all the things that the children wanted, the wishes, but they couldn't, didn't have.

1470
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:12,320
So this is the family gathered for the Pesach Seder, which of course the children no longer

1471
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:17,320
could experience, but they remembered.

1472
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:23,360
I love the bows on the hair, the big bows, and the hats.

1473
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,360
So carefully, lovingly done.

1474
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:30,880
And this is one of the most poignant ones, very famous, because of course the children

1475
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,720
had to leave their hats behind.

1476
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:39,000
Little Scotty Dog.

1477
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:45,560
The one survivor that I met, they were, the children's opera performed written by a composer

1478
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:48,320
who was in the camp called Burundi Bar.

1479
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:53,920
And I actually wrote about this and I actually met one of the survivors who sang the role

1480
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,920
of the cat.

1481
01:37:54,920 --> 01:38:00,360
There was three animals in the opera, a dog of bird and a cat, and this, I'm Elle Beishberger

1482
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:05,440
who sang the role of the cat and the opera told me, I said, what did you miss most?

1483
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:12,760
And she said, I missed most, I wish, I could say it exactly the way she said, going between

1484
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:18,120
children in school, by which she meant being able to sit in school and learn with other

1485
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,120
children.

1486
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:24,120
So here you have the school and the little child in Terrazine is drawing the children

1487
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,880
coming out of school with their lunch boxes.

1488
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:31,280
I mean, it could be America today.

1489
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:40,000
It's so easy to go and look at these drawings and identify with this situation that occurred

1490
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,080
so long ago.

1491
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:47,600
Another drawing, you see a butterfly here, it's a watercolor, the child is struggling

1492
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:53,040
with the medium, watercolor is notoriously, some of you probably do watercolor is notoriously

1493
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,320
difficult medium, the child is working with it.

1494
01:38:56,320 --> 01:39:00,080
And Field did all kinds of things, her teaching was amazing.

1495
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,800
A couple of survivors wrote about her teaching.

1496
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:09,360
I mean, she would sometimes hear, this is a terrifying image, it's one of the most terrifying

1497
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:16,040
images that have come out, you see the child is very frightened, the door is black, and

1498
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:20,160
the child is running away from something, it's hard to see what it is, the child is just

1499
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:26,640
very, there's just fear, it just seems to be in the image of fear.

1500
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:33,040
And then this notion of solidarity, holding hands with children, trying to make some kind

1501
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:36,720
of solidarity that could protect them.

1502
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:45,440
This is one of the few images we have, which shows a guard with a bully stick.

1503
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,480
And it's very interesting, I don't know if you can say I don't have my little pointer

1504
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:53,840
that I usually use when I'm teaching by a little laser pointer, but you see that the

1505
01:39:53,840 --> 01:40:06,720
child graphically uses angular lines to do the frightening guy, but the sort of curving

1506
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:12,920
softer lines to show the other figure with a Jewish star.

1507
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:18,400
And the curving lines are the softer ones, the more vulnerable ones, and the angular

1508
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:24,880
ones are the lines of the ones who has the power and the danger, and you see the mug

1509
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:31,440
and debit, the stars of David there, that the children were of course forced to wear.

1510
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:37,440
And then this very, very sort of almost fairy tale like image where you have a princess,

1511
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:41,760
a dragon, what it looks like, and the upper left, can you see like an magician type of

1512
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:42,920
figure?

1513
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:48,040
And what I think about this is that sometimes Frito would read stories to the children, and

1514
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:52,160
the opposite way from what you did Nathan would read a story, and then the children

1515
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:54,800
would draw while she was reading.

1516
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:59,600
Sometimes she gave them still lifes, sometimes she showed them reproductions of famous artists.

1517
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:05,760
We have, we have, you can see the child trying to do something in imitation of, she did all

1518
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,440
kinds of things to try to stimulate them.

1519
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:12,960
And one of the things that was unique about her was that she was a no-nonsense apparently

1520
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:13,960
woman.

1521
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:19,200
She was a child in her self, she was not, but she was not afraid of anything that came

1522
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,880
out of a child.

1523
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,040
Nothing could frighten her.

1524
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:25,880
She would, she would let the child express anything.

1525
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:29,120
Ah, and this is a collage.

1526
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:30,400
We also work with collage.

1527
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:36,120
This means, this is a, this is a, like a puppet theater, the child is done, like a little,

1528
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:40,880
you know, punch and duty show type thing, and this is a puppet theater but done with cut

1529
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:45,120
paper and a collage.

1530
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:51,500
This is a drawing by Otto Unger of the composer Hans Krascha, who did the music for Brindy

1531
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:52,500
Barre.

1532
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:55,120
And if I should go on and show a few more.

1533
01:41:55,120 --> 01:42:03,440
So this, the Nazis made a film for the Red Cross to try to show that, to try to show

1534
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:06,600
the world, because they were very worried that the world would find out what was going

1535
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,920
on.

1536
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:14,720
And they made a film called Difuele, shankt de uden einichtad.

1537
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:17,120
Some of you know, I see people nodding.

1538
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:20,760
The fur, Hitler, gives the Jews a city.

1539
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:25,960
And what they did was they took people out into the sun, they put rouge on their faces,

1540
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:29,240
they tried to make them look okay and photograph them.

1541
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:35,920
And then they had the children perform this opera Brindy Barre, which is a story of a,

1542
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:41,000
it's like a Hansel and Gretel story, two children, a little boy and a little girl, need

1543
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,080
to get milk for their sick mother.

1544
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,400
And they don't know what to do, they have no money.

1545
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:52,240
But they noticed that there's an organ grinder called Brindy Barre, who grinds his organ

1546
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:58,560
and makes music and people throw money into his hat and they think, ah, we will sing and

1547
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,640
people will give us money.

1548
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:05,680
But when they sing, their voices are too soft and nobody hears them.

1549
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:10,760
And then they go, the organ grinder chases them away and they go and they sleep.

1550
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:15,760
You know how Hansel and Gretel has that moment in the middle where the children fall asleep

1551
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,840
and the angels come and they had this very beautiful music at that point.

1552
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,440
Children fall asleep and the little animals come out, the cat, the bird and the dog and

1553
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:30,520
they say to the children, if you all join together with all the children, your voice

1554
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:34,240
will be loud and people will give you the money for the milk for the mother.

1555
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,240
So that's what they do.

1556
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:38,280
And the children come out on stage and they sing together.

1557
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:40,280
The song that they sing is heartbreaking.

1558
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:48,520
It's a song that the words are, when my mother cradled me and the cradle, she never knew

1559
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:53,600
how I would grow up, what my life would be like when I would grow up, what I would be

1560
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,600
when I grew up.

1561
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:58,520
And of course it's heartbreaking because the children never grew up.

1562
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:05,200
And the people start to give money to them and the organ grinder steals the money and

1563
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:09,480
then the people chase the organ grinder and in the end the children prevail.

1564
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:11,920
This is the final scene of solidarity.

1565
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:17,200
You see the little sign, Skola School at the top and the children are singing together.

1566
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:24,600
And this finale of Brindy Bar was sung over and over again in the camp, adults sang it,

1567
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:25,600
children sang it.

1568
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:34,560
It was sort of a moment of, and here's the hand-lettered program for it showing that

1569
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,560
this is what they did.

1570
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:41,880
They did these little, and here you can see the set, that's Brindy Bar, the organ grinder.

1571
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:49,160
The set designer was called the Lanka, wonderful artist, and again the set.

1572
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:53,440
And then I just have this to show you that one of this artist, Frita, who did that transport

1573
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,200
picture had a three-year-old.

1574
01:44:55,200 --> 01:45:02,960
He died of starvation in Auschwitz, but he made a picture book for his child.

1575
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,960
And it's exquisite, and it exists today.

1576
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:09,440
So you see Tommy with his little boy's name is turning three.

1577
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:12,800
He's looking out the window of Tarazin.

1578
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:17,800
And there he has his birthday cake.

1579
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:20,080
He's drawing, he's scribbling.

1580
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:27,560
And his father says, will you grow up to be a painter like me?

1581
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:30,480
He's praying.

1582
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:34,520
And then it says, this is the truth.

1583
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,560
Pravda, this is the truth.

1584
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:41,560
Our places like this, where the sun shines and there's, you can play in the meadow,

1585
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:43,720
run around naked and there'll be butterflies and birds.

1586
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:48,200
There's really a place like this outside this camp.

1587
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:53,400
And also this is also true that you can go buy food.

1588
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:58,480
And then this is the most heartbreaking thing for us as Americans to see.

1589
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:08,680
The last page of the book, I wish you for your birthday in 1944, food, peace, sunshine,

1590
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:16,560
and that you should come to the United States of America, signed what we would call daddy

1591
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:18,840
in check.

1592
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:26,840
Quite a difference in the discussions between, on the one hand, the creativity that the father

1593
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:33,320
shows, on the other hand, the tragedy that these children were murdered.

1594
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:38,600
And also discrepancy, as I think, I'm fortunate to be able to work with kids who aren't getting

1595
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:44,080
murdered and who are in fact in a new country and are given a very good life, compared to

1596
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:47,760
what they were facing and their parents were facing in Ethiopia.

1597
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:48,760
Real difference.

1598
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:54,960
This child lived, the father died, but the child actually did live.

1599
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:58,080
We have to be stopping shortly.

1600
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,840
For those who are interested, books are available.

1601
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:01,840
We'll sign them.

1602
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:02,840
Thank you for coming.

1603
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:03,840
Thank you.

1604
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:04,840
Thank you.

1605
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:05,840
Thank you.

1606
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:06,840
I'm going to.

1607
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:07,840
Thank you.

1608
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:08,840
Thank you.

1609
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:25,720
Thank you.

1610
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:42,600
Thank you.

1611
01:47:42,600 --> 01:48:03,880
Peace out.
