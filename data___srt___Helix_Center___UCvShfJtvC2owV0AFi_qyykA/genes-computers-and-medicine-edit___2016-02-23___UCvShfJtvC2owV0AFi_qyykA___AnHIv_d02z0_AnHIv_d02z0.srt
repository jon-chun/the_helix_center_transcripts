1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
We're going to get started.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,720
Good afternoon, everybody.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,400
Welcome to the Helix Center.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,920
Before I introduce today's participants, let me tell you about a couple of round tables

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
that are coming up.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,760
On Saturday, March 12, the meditative state, with research psychologist Sarah Lazar, Peter

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,600
Melanowski, and Yi Yang Tang, and pastoral care leader, Koshan Paley Ellison, and psychoanalyst

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,360
Morgan Stevens.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:36,760
And on Saturday, March 26, understanding genius part two women, with historians Joyce Chaplin,

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:43,600
Kathleen Keat, and Darren McMahon, anthropologist Susan Seymour, and poet and visual artist,

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,360
Ann Marie Levine, who as Helix executive committee member also organized that round table.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,960
Now for today, jeans, computers, and medicine, James Domen, assistant professor of biomedical

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,200
engineering at Georgia Tech.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,440
Frances Lee, Mortimer D. Sackler professor and vice chair for research department of psychiatry

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,200
at Wile Cornell Medical College.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,840
Karen Mashke, research scholar at the Hastings Center, and Hans Guido Wendell, principal

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,160
investigator at the cancer genetics laboratory at Memorial Sloan Kettering.

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:25,880
Okay, we'll begin.

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,760
So what's the latest in genetics?

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:38,200
Well, I'm really pleased that you started off with a question I could answer quickly.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,040
So from my perspective as somebody who does genetic therapies, who looks into the future

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,880
and sees medicines where we target the genome, I think there's a revolution occurring in

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:59,000
biology where with different types of new small molecules or, excuse me, DNAs or RNAs,

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,800
we can actually go for the first time and effectively manipulate the genome the way that

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
we would like to.

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,720
So in genetics, one of the many revolutions is this ability to actually go in and edit

27
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,880
the genome as we would like or manipulate the genome and see what that can do therapeutically

28
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,080
and scientifically.

29
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,360
That's one of the advances in genetics, I would say.

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,360
If you were to take a guess, where would be the first clinical application of this type

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,480
of new wave of gene editing?

32
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,320
It's a difficult question.

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,440
I guess I'd answer it by outlining sort of one of the biggest hurdles to implementing

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,280
the gene editing therapies, which is the ability to safely deliver the new genetic drugs where

35
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,120
you want to deliver them.

36
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,480
As you might imagine, if you're going to go in and create a targeted therapy, you want

37
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,320
to make sure it's going to the right spot in the body.

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,880
For that reason, I would venture a guess and say that anywhere where you can administer

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,360
the genetic medicine locally, so for instance, your eye, you can literally spray it into

40
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,360
your eye.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,160
You can take cells out of the body like your immune cells and edit them and then put them

42
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
back in.

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,880
So immune cells and then perhaps also deliver, which is an organ that is a little easier

44
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,440
to target drugs to than other organs.

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,960
So just as since I'm sort of a layman of this gene editing, so what's the difference between

46
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,360
this and the revolution I had recalled in the 1990s with gene therapy?

47
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,400
Yeah, so again, it's tricky.

48
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,200
The revolution in gene therapy is really actually bearing some interesting therapeutic fruit

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
right now.

50
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,840
So again, back in the 90s, there were these advances where people started saying, all

51
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,040
right, we're going to actually start taking patients where they're not able to produce

52
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,240
a particular gene.

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,800
And then we're going to put that gene into patients and cure the patient in some way,

54
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
shape or form.

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,040
And unfortunately, in sort of the late 90s and early 2000s, there were a few hurdles

56
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
and events that set the field back.

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,240
But now because the delivery of some of these genetic therapies has become much more safe,

58
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,880
we're seeing a change and we're actually seeing really impressive clinical data come

59
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,880
out with gene therapies that were originally thought of in the 80s and 90s.

60
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,240
So an interject, because one of the step-backs was actually a death.

61
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Yeah, that's right.

62
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,680
That had to do with research ethics issues.

63
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,920
And with possibly one exception, there's no FDA-approved gene therapy at this time.

64
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,640
There's maybe more than one.

65
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,600
Yeah, one year up, there it is.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Yeah, but in the United States as a yet, so I'm not, I'm just sort of, as a part of the

67
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,520
revolutionary language.

68
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, of course.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,440
The revolution hasn't happened yet and there was a lot of hype.

70
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,440
That's right.

71
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,080
Some people wonder if there's the same kind of hype with gene editing, you know, with,

72
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,160
and also potential harms because of the exuberance that people are going into with this the same

73
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,560
way they did with gene therapies.

74
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Yeah.

75
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Not to put you on the spot because you're not the only person.

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Yeah, of course.

77
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,320
And I should clarify that when I say, you know, revolution, I'm not specifically only

78
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,440
referring to gene editing technologies.

79
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,840
I'm also referring to anti-sense technologies and RNAi, which, you know, small, interfering

80
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,400
sirna, or excuse me, small interfering RNAs or sirna.

81
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,640
So you know, I do think that there is a risk for overhyping new technologies, just like

82
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,920
with any other technology that has ever been, you know, reported.

83
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,440
But I think generally speaking, it is a relatively safe statement to make when we say that maybe

84
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,080
20 years, different classes of medicine based on either small RNAs or anti-sense will have

85
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,920
a much larger impact in the clinic than certainly they will now.

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,160
So, and I think that's primarily because the delivery is going to continue to improve.

87
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,440
So to the clinicians, are you seeing that in the clinical world?

88
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,040
But you see this in your path?

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,480
I have not seen a patient in 15 years.

90
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,280
I'm calling myself a clinician anymore.

91
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm my only patient if I have a fever that's about it.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't know.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,840
I think much of the technology is a long way to go before it's a clinical reality.

94
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:36,160
So no doubt it's cool new research tools that we can use to learn a lot about how cells

95
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,080
work, how cell biology works and what genes do and what happens if you change them and

96
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
so on.

97
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,320
I think the practical applications are very limited right at the moment.

98
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,880
You can maybe the most promising he mentioned is that you can isolate immune cells, pull

99
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,280
them out of your body, modify them and put them back and suddenly these cells have learned

100
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,640
to target a leukemia and that works sometimes right.

101
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,920
It's not risk free but if you don't have a choice then at the moment hey there's a

102
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,880
new thing on the horizon right.

103
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
So that's a reality.

104
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,000
If you open a newspaper you're going to find much more speculative things of how we're

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,560
going to engineer you know new super athletes or we'll make you know smarter children.

106
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,200
But all these things I think are not a reality and I mean but obviously if you think that

107
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,720
it might be then that has a lot of ethical implications that you have to think about.

108
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,920
I'm going to hold this because I'm having problems with that.

109
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,440
Well one of the things I wanted to point out and the reason for raising that question is

110
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,080
a lot of the science that does get hyped in the media is really what we might call discovery

111
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
science.

112
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,600
I mean you're in the lab and you're building a body of work and you're training a body

113
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:56,160
of scientists to continue to build on that work and science is a very incremental process

114
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,600
which often is two steps forward eight steps back and maybe even more than eight steps

115
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,880
back and cleaning up mistakes and errors and over sites and just not even thinking about

116
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,880
certain things that you thought might happen or didn't happen.

117
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,760
And yet in the media when we talk about technologies and we hear all these issues about brand technologies

118
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:24,320
and computer interfaces and therapy, gene splicing, gene editing, there's an intermediate point

119
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,960
and that's where I sit which is the research ethics point.

120
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,960
You don't just come up with a discovery in the lab and then say let's take it across

121
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,640
the street over to Well Cornale or to take it over to Slunk Hetteran and let's use it.

122
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:42,240
There's another whole step that can take anywhere from 10 to 15, 20, 30, 40 years.

123
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,240
When you were speaking I was just thinking about a month ago there was this amazing

124
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,040
article that was in both Washington Post and New York Times that we had now made a quantum

125
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,000
leap in our understanding of schizophrenia.

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,040
They had been able to find an immune gene, an MHC gene that was one of the largest hits

127
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,520
in the genome wide association studies.

128
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,080
And as you read the article you just were and it was elegant.

129
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,000
The genetics were elegant, the mouse model that they were, they found a compliment gene

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,840
that was somehow related to this that would actually prune spines and neurons.

131
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,480
And then ultimately when you read the fine print they said that this gene, this MHC complex

132
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:32,120
gene, possibly explains 0.25% of the risk factor for schizophrenia.

133
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,240
So that from a clinical point of view it has almost no worth.

134
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:44,080
It would possibly help us understand something about the pathophysiology for that 0.25% of

135
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,800
people on the planet earth who have this genetic variation.

136
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,200
But for the rest of the people it would have no effect.

137
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,000
So the way I think about it is that in terms of the genetic revolution, I think of it in

138
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,240
terms of either diagnosis, pathophysiology or some type of intermediate phenotype that

139
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,880
we could use to possibly understand things.

140
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:14,760
And I would put this in the pathophysiology that we could study, as you said, it's a discovery

141
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:22,720
science that possibly that there is some neuroimmune component to schizophrenia in 0.2% of the

142
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,480
population that increases your risk by 0.25%.

143
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,520
But by itself would not cause schizophrenia by no means at all.

144
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,400
And I think this is the kind of things that the media does, which actually does a disservice

145
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,640
to our field because psychiatry in particular has had many false starts.

146
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,040
I was at a talk recently where the Nobel Prize was given for frontal lobotomies and it's

147
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,680
absolutely clear that we do not understand many things and that when these types of articles

148
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:01,560
come out they actually, now people think that we're probably, as you said, one step closer

149
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,680
to probably eight steps back in terms of understanding this.

150
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,320
And that makes me wonder, so from the bioethics perspective, this is something I think that

151
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,280
many fields struggle with, how do you present your science to the public and how do you

152
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,560
tone down some of the popular press reports?

153
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,960
So when you guys look at the bioethics, do you guys ever consider questions like these?

154
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,760
Yes, it's been written about a lot.

155
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,640
And unfortunately, when I'm at sessions having these conversations, the scientists end up

156
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,880
being in the hot seat because we're asking you, well, is this really going to happen

157
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,320
in 10 years or 15 years.

158
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,520
Part of it's a media problem and part of it is also, I think, the nature of our culture

159
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,160
that institutions are in a position of competing because they want the best and the brightest

160
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,320
and they want the NIH money and they want the venture capital money and they want the

161
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:04,960
patents and they want, you know, and so they're part of the mix of promoting, I wouldn't say

162
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,960
hype, but promoting their work and their people.

163
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,600
And the media then takes those stories and translates it in ways and then you see movies

164
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,240
like The Matrix and you see other movies where this gets put into the popular culture in

165
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,520
ways that the, you know, the scientists and his or her team who are working in the lab

166
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,880
day after day, after day, you know, you know, wonder.

167
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,160
And yet in the popular discourse, we have these conversations about different human

168
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,920
brains, different human organs.

169
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,000
We can fix them in the lab.

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,800
We can do petri dish organs and put them in humans and they'll live forever and it's

171
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
not really close to reality.

172
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,280
Yet it becomes a part of the public discourse and then it becomes a part of the public fear

173
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,040
too, which can often hinder science going forward.

174
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:54,600
Yeah, I would also contend that it does a disservice because it sets expectations, you

175
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,840
know, pretty high.

176
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,040
And as you said, I think it's a really nice way of stating it science is really two steps

177
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
forward and eight steps backwards.

178
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,040
I mean, it takes a lot of effort to make even an incremental change.

179
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,360
And I think when we, you know, you read a popular press report about, you know, we're

180
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,880
going to create a new organ and, you know, now you're going to be able to have new kidneys

181
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,360
and new lungs and new whatever all the time.

182
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:26,440
I think if that's what's sort of understood in the popular media, that's what people are

183
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,760
going to read and that's how they're going to think about science and that, as you said,

184
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,400
that's not at all how it works.

185
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,120
It takes a really long time and there are a lot of failures before you get any kind of

186
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
even mild success.

187
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Yeah, okay.

188
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:50,080
So when you have a hypothesis that you have verified, like a gene editing, that has been

189
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
done.

190
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,680
So what causes the eight steps back?

191
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,200
If you know how to do the gene editing and you know what to apply it to.

192
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,400
And I think what Giro was saying, you can modify the immune system of the person.

193
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,480
So what causes the steps back?

194
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
I don't know.

195
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,040
I'd defer to the people closer to the clinic than I am on that.

196
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,120
I would defer to, I think the sex stories have mainly been in cancer.

197
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,840
So I would ask you, like, what would you think would be?

198
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:27,080
Because this is where you actually do have genetic biomarkers that inform diagnosis and

199
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,080
treatment.

200
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
The success stories.

201
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,320
Yeah, no, there are plenty.

202
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,000
And I think it's not just therapeutics, and it's not just gene editing and it's not science

203
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
fiction.

204
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,160
There's real life things that have improved light years since I've treated my last patient.

205
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,520
Now if you come to a major cancer center, your cancer is going to be sequenced.

206
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,640
The whole genome of the thing.

207
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,520
Previously, we didn't have that.

208
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,960
Now you can sequence the whole thing.

209
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,920
You can find what is the mutation that drives this disease.

210
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,920
And there's a chance you might have a drug specifically for that mutation.

211
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,320
For some patients that benefit directly from this, that's a major breakthrough.

212
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,520
Right suddenly you don't get, you know, the standard therapy, but you get something that

213
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,120
is essentially tailor-made for your disease.

214
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:25,320
I think that's where we are now, and probably with new drugs and we will go further.

215
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Right?

216
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,600
So I think there is a real breakthrough here that now we can sequence a whole tumor.

217
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,560
Now previously, how did you diagnose a tumor?

218
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,680
You look at it under a microscope and you say, well, this kind of looks like, you know,

219
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,440
figure 7B in the textbook, and therefore it has to be that tumor, and we usually treat

220
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,240
them with drug B, and that kind of works.

221
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,640
And now you have the whole genome, and you can find specific sensitive.

222
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,680
So on the diagnostic side, I think there's like a real breakthrough.

223
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,440
That's just sequencing, analyzing, being able to do this, which maybe 20 years ago was

224
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,920
like flying to the moon, it was impossible.

225
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,280
You couldn't do it.

226
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,160
You would count individual nucleotides.

227
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,120
Now you sequence everything.

228
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,560
So that's a major break.

229
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:14,880
And I think for us as a research group, the next major advances that we can use these

230
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:22,320
genetic tools like CRISPR, like gene editing, and RNA, RNA interference, and so on, as research

231
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:30,720
tools to ask in a leukemia or in a cancer, what would happen if we take away any of the

232
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,040
genes in this cancer?

233
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,480
Which ones can't they tolerate to lose?

234
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,880
What are they really sensitive to?

235
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,360
And what are these things maybe already?

236
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,040
Something that we can target with a drug that we have today?

237
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,200
Or maybe tell the pharmaceutical company and say, look, we keep finding this gene and we

238
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,840
think that these liver cancers, they really need this gene.

239
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,320
Can you help us make a drug?

240
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:06,800
And I think that's sort of the next research level that these technologies are practically

241
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,360
immediately useful for.

242
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,760
I think those for me are the biggest sort of advances that we have there.

243
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,040
Now along those lines, I'm stepping outside my field of expertise here a little bit because

244
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,360
I do therapeutics, but one of the things that's most interesting to me is using this idea

245
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,080
of genomics and looking for mutations early on in a patient sample because I know that

246
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:39,520
at least my understanding is that in the clinic, especially with cancer, one of the

247
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,320
biggest limitations is being able to find out that you have the disease early.

248
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,160
And if you catch it early, then you have a much better shot of surviving or being treated

249
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,760
successfully.

250
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,880
So is it true or is it realistic that, again, not to put everybody on the spot, but in a

251
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,320
reasonable amount of time that we'll have technologies available where you can, when

252
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,880
you get your annual checkup, you can take a blood sample and say, oh, there's something

253
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
going on here.

254
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:12,280
This looks kind of wonky and we need to take in to give a CT scan and look for early signs

255
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
that way using genetics.

256
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,720
Yeah, so that's a difficult, I have an echo, right?

257
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,920
I think that's very attractive, right?

258
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:26,720
Being able to pull blood and say, well, we're going to find a specific marker or a specific

259
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:34,520
cell that has a specific mutation and therefore we know that you have pancreatic cancer.

260
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,200
That has a lot of difficulties to this and they're not just technical.

261
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,800
So technically it's all possible.

262
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:48,280
You can pull blood and you can sequence it and you can analyze and you can find things.

263
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,880
But I think they're practical issues here.

264
00:18:50,880 --> 00:19:00,520
So let's say you find a mutation in your blood, a translocation, T1480 and it occurs in lymphomas.

265
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,560
Well it turns out 50% of healthy people, you can find it.

266
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,920
So what are you going to do with that?

267
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,040
I mean, take 50% of the population and roll them through a CAT scan and nobody's going

268
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
to pay for that.

269
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,360
It's impossible, right?

270
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,320
So there isn't the level of specificity to it yet that you can say, well, we really

271
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,440
have the tools to do it.

272
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,840
I think many of these diagnostic tests, they're very useful in following up.

273
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,440
So you have diagnosed someone with a cancer and you treat it and you know this marker

274
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,960
was at a certain level and you get treated and it disappears.

275
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,320
You know, you did the right thing.

276
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,480
If it comes back, you know, where we need to have another look.

277
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,440
So there are issues about specificity and about the cost associated.

278
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,240
All this was discussed and it's not just even genomics or genetic tools.

279
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,920
All this was discussed with PSA recently, right?

280
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,040
Which I mean, this is a marker that's been around for, I don't know, 30, 40, 50 years.

281
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,400
It's a protein marker you can measure in the blood and it indicates whether your prostate

282
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,360
is happy or not happy basically.

283
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,200
It also goes very high in prostate cancer.

284
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,840
But if you just screen the population for high levels of PSA, you're going to end up

285
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,680
doing a lot of biopsies and not everyone likes to have a needle stuck in their prostate

286
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,000
and it does cost a lot of money.

287
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,120
So there are practical problems of following through with these tests.

288
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,040
So yeah, I'll go ahead.

289
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:42,120
I'm also stepping out of my comfort area, but one of my colleagues is a geneticist and

290
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,560
he said that what he's now working on, he said, he's at Hudson Alpha in Alabama, is

291
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,400
that so what they're doing to study breast cancer, for example, some of the psychiatrists.

292
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,080
So this is obviously outside of it.

293
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,760
Is that they're actually isolating all the immune cells in the blood and they're sequencing

294
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,960
them because obviously your immune profile by genetics is different because you're generating

295
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
different antibodies.

296
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,040
And they'll notice that they get a completely different profile.

297
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,400
It's not a single gene.

298
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,800
It's just a different genetic profile biometratically.

299
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:20,280
And then after treatment, your immune system looks different on this genetic profile.

300
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Was he just making this up or have you heard of this?

301
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,720
I was just having a bit of it.

302
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,520
I had a similar idea a while ago.

303
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,440
I thought, you know, this would be fun, fun thing to do with people who are exposed to

304
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,880
a lot of pathogens.

305
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
So you know, bacteria or something.

306
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,560
So you just take everyone who takes the subway in New York and compare them to people who

307
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
don't take the subway.

308
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:46,600
You're going to get a completely different representation of the immune system, right?

309
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,160
Again, I don't know how specific this is.

310
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:55,840
I'm not familiar with the specific research he's doing.

311
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Maybe.

312
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,280
Your comment was what I was going to actually, it was a good comment because that's what

313
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,880
I was going to say over here was.

314
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:11,640
Again, I'm an enthusiastic skeptic or a skeptical enthusiastic.

315
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,920
Biomarkers are one whole category of skepticism in some ways.

316
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:22,160
And if we just look at genetics and look at a genetic biomarker and take out the environment

317
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,240
and the exposures of people and the epigenetic issues, we may not have the whole story.

318
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,160
So there's this much more complex picture that we don't hear about in the media and that

319
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,040
we don't even hear about in cancer genomics, which is absolutely right, it's had phenomenal

320
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:42,280
improvements and spectacular advances in terms of being able to sequence a cancer genome.

321
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,080
On the other hand, you have a vast amount of information that physicians and geneticists

322
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,080
know nothing about.

323
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,480
And I really understand how they interact with each other.

324
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,480
They don't understand how environmental factors interact.

325
00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:03,000
And even within categories of ancestry, age, when the disease was actually caught in that

326
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,080
sense, there are a lot of factors that don't necessarily mean there's going to be a drug

327
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,400
for that specific patient at that specific time or that editing some piece of the genome

328
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,280
is actually going to help and may help that patient but not another one who you would

329
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,480
think looks just like that patient in terms of biophysical characteristics.

330
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,120
So again, it's a lot more complex and my skepticism comes from the precision medicine,

331
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,760
personalized medicine hype in some sense that we're just going to be able to find just

332
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,720
one person, you don't want personalize, you want something that works for everyone.

333
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Exactly.

334
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,320
Who wants personalize, who wants something that works, right?

335
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,840
That was the first cancer war, that it's going to work for everybody.

336
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,880
We're going to find the drug and we're going to use powerful chemo therapeutic drugs for

337
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,880
lots of people and we're going to find the right combination and it's going to work for

338
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
everybody.

339
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,320
Well, the other thing I like to point out is when we think about precision medicine or

340
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,760
we think about personalized medicine, I like to sort of split diseases when I think about

341
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,160
them into basically cancer and everything else.

342
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,440
Because when I look at, you know, when I try to design something that will deliver a drug

343
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:24,960
to a tumor, I get a little nervous because the tumor thinks and will fight back against

344
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
whatever you're delivering.

345
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,760
So you'll deliver a drug and if you kill, if you have like the best drug delivering the

346
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:37,040
world and you have a tumor that for easy numbers has 100 cells in it and you get 99 of those

347
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,440
cells, that one little surviving cell is now smarter and won't respond to that therapy

348
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,720
later on.

349
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,200
I don't know many other diseases that evolve so rapidly in that way.

350
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,120
So a lot of times when we talk about personalized medicine, we automatically sort of default

351
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:03,960
to cancer and I don't, again, this is outside of my expertise but I'm a little less skeptical

352
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,800
that precision medicine will work for diseases outside of the cancer field.

353
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,400
Maybe we'll get lucky and we'll find something for aethro or we'll get something for some

354
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,640
other ischemic heart disease or something like this, something that isn't, you know,

355
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,040
so aggressively fighting against you.

356
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,280
So I think that's important to note is that, and I actually don't know if that's the case

357
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,920
in neuropsychiatric disease or not because that's complicated for a different reason,

358
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
is that what you're just saying?

359
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Yes, it's very complicated.

360
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,280
Well first of all, the brain's very complicated.

361
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,080
You know, but I would have to say what, just in my sort of like last five years of research,

362
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,680
is that what I'd never understood particularly well even though I was trained by Dr. Narsesian

363
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:50,840
and others in psychiatry, is that almost every psychiatric disorder emerges between the transition

364
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,600
from childhood to adolescence to late adolescence.

365
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,320
So the entire disease progresses and then you live for the rest of your life with this.

366
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,880
So when you actually start treating them, you're actually seeing people that have had

367
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,720
this disease for a while.

368
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:10,880
And the idea is that we might have had to treat them at that moment when it first started

369
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,080
because the, and it, and what we're now realizing is that the adolescent or child brain is very

370
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
different.

371
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:26,560
So whatever drugs that we now have in our current armamentarian is not really set for

372
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,520
this therapies we have or set for what we are treating.

373
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,880
So it's actually quite a moving target.

374
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:38,160
You have a disease that began in essentially an immature developing brain and you are treating

375
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,280
it based on a completely different roadmap later on.

376
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:49,480
So it's very hard to design particular, both behavioral or molecular therapies based on

377
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
that.

378
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,200
Ultimately you would want to treat that when your symptoms first emerge but it's very

379
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,440
difficult to, it's very difficult to do clinical trials in children and adolescents which is

380
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,600
probably when what we'll ultimately find, if I had to make a prediction 20 years from

381
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,400
now we realize that we'll have to, that's when you treat it.

382
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:14,520
Because ultimately 10 year, if you go to disease like chronic disease go on for 10 years,

383
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,960
it's just not going to be hard.

384
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,640
I think that's sort of the lesson we're learning in the field of Alzheimer's disease that actually

385
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,800
you need to actually treat them when they first have their cognitive impairments emerging

386
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:31,240
and the reason why almost every clinical trial has failed is because they're treating them

387
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,920
at age of 60 and above.

388
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,080
Let me ask in your field.

389
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,160
It's a kind of genetic research.

390
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,360
Come up with new targets, new ways of treating.

391
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,960
I mean for cancers I think being put a finger on a few things that we have new drugs and

392
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,280
we know they target certain mutations and that's how they work.

393
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,040
And psychiatry and neurological diseases has there been...

394
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,240
Well first of all I would say that there's been a great revolution in studying the fact

395
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:12,200
that both autism and schizophrenia, there's been massive advances in genome sequencing

396
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:19,560
and for example the study of the MHC gene was based on the capacity of large consortiums

397
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:25,560
to get essentially over 100,000 schizophrenic patients entire genome sequence and there you

398
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,280
can then get genome wide significant hits.

399
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:34,720
The problem that they ultimately found was that it explains so little of the vary.

400
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,960
Each of these genes don't explain much.

401
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:45,040
What's most befuddling for autism is that after 10 years what they realized is that almost

402
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,160
every mutation in autism is essentially rare.

403
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,680
And what they said in the last five years what they realized is the word rare actually

404
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,000
means rare.

405
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,320
So that ultimately there's not going to be a common biomarker or diagnostic tool and

406
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:07,000
every autism spectrum disorder patient is going to probably be unique because it's sort of

407
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
these spontaneous deletions and mutations and in that sense that for that one patient

408
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,720
if they found one interesting gene that will help that one patient but that's about it.

409
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:28,920
The hope is that in the future that there will be common mutation variants that have

410
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,400
been found that can be used because the genome is filled with people that have these genetic

411
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:39,640
variants in these special plasticity genes that my lab actually studies and the idea

412
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,560
is that we could use this to at least guide something.

413
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,280
It's still very early days of whether or not this will happen but that's the idea that

414
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,680
there would be some common genetic variation that could be used to at least but the bar

415
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
is so low inside.

416
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,880
But you think of these are mutations that you think of as inherited so that it's in

417
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,200
every cell in your body basically.

418
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,680
So I think it's very different from the idea we think about cancers arising where you know

419
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:14,760
most cancer genes are normal in every other cell but we think really there's mutations

420
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:22,280
that occur in one cell somewhere that triggers a cascade of further changes that ultimately

421
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,400
lead to the tumor.

422
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:31,680
But I think in your field you think of the genetics as a predisposing thing that will

423
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:39,160
make you more sensitive to environment, to stresses, to early life's traumas or something.

424
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,360
Right, whatever that actually is.

425
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,000
So you probably don't think of it then as much as a genetic disease.

426
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,360
I mean we think of cancer as a genetic disease.

427
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:55,840
Basically there is a cell that gets irradiated, something goes wrong and then the things happen.

428
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,560
But to what extent do you think psychiatric diseases are genetic?

429
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:06,400
They have to be genetic because this is just an example because my lab also studies obsessive

430
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,840
compulsive disorder.

431
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,120
If you have an identical twin there's a 65% chance that identical twin will have obsessive

432
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,400
compulsive disorder.

433
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,320
So something is definitely being transmitted and the same with schizophrenia is almost

434
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,120
that hot or bipolar disorder.

435
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,120
So these are incredibly heritable disorders and what the field has been dealing with is

436
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,200
what we call the missing heritability.

437
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,240
There's something massive, some large elephant we're missing.

438
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
And you can imagine.

439
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
What do you mean by missing?

440
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
What is missing here?

441
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,960
Because not all the genome wide association studies have not found a gene that can be

442
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,480
transmitted that is in identical twins even.

443
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,240
People are very smart now.

444
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,800
They're doing twin studies and family based studies with large pedigrees to try to find

445
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,520
even sort of rare genetic and they've not been able to find.

446
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,480
There have been so many false starts.

447
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,200
That's what I'm being very...

448
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,000
They thought they found some before.

449
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,560
They named them schizophrenia genes and now they're sort of discredited.

450
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,840
So how does the field reconcile?

451
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
Because that's...

452
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,200
How does the field reconcile that?

453
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,560
Because you might say, okay, well then we're just going to sequence more people to which

454
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,080
the kind of argument could be made.

455
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,920
Well, if it's really that ubiquitous then you shouldn't have to sequence very many people

456
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
at all.

457
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
You should be able to pick it up.

458
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,520
Well, it's going to be something new.

459
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,520
It's the three dimensional structure of the genome which we don't know how to characterize

460
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,560
or some other sort of currently black box mechanism.

461
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,800
No, I think the...

462
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:41,080
At least in the neuropsychiaty field we've come to terms with the fact that we actually

463
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,520
don't know how to diagnose our patients very well.

464
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:51,240
We use a criteria called the Diagnostic Statistical Manual which is essentially a syndromic manual.

465
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,960
There's no quantitative biomarkers.

466
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,280
You have a histology test or you have blood pressure even to measure hypertension.

467
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,000
I was at a wonderful grand rounds at Cornell the other day where Kathleen Merrick-Hang is

468
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,840
a very talented human geneticist.

469
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
I had done some...

470
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,280
A very fascinating study.

471
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:15,760
She took bipolar patients and gave them essentially fit bits and smart watches to walk around.

472
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,120
What she noticed that what every bipolar patient had was not what we think of as a DSM-5,

473
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:30,200
racing thoughts, whatever, mania or hypomania, she noticed that she could predict when they

474
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,400
would become functionally ill is by the fact that they traveled more within the city or

475
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
within their town.

476
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,480
So it was just physical activity that there are certain aspects of the way we diagnose

477
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,560
patients that don't actually capture the disorder.

478
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:50,360
As an example, another example, if someone is given a diagnosis of major depression, you

479
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,560
can either eat too much, eat too little, sleep too much, sleep too little and actually get

480
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,840
the same disorder.

481
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:04,480
So essentially you're studying the equivalent of 1940s cough or some bad x-ray, long x-ray.

482
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
You're not...

483
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,080
So it's not surprising that all the genome-wide association studies have failed.

484
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,080
I've always advocated that there are certain things in psychiatry which are incredibly

485
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,840
robust.

486
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,840
If you have a panic attack, no one will say there's no...

487
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
It looks...

488
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,120
No one will disagree that that was a panic attack or if you wash your hands ten times

489
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,920
a day, no one will disagree that that is a repetitive behavior and if your hands are

490
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,600
chapped, then you know you have a disorder.

491
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,160
So you need to study what we call phenotypic extremes or if you have a disorder of type

492
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,120
of depression where you start hallucinating, you're now studying a very specific type of

493
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,720
depression, a subtype that is extreme in some sense.

494
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:55,640
And I think that's where the field is moving, that we have failed and this was a sort of

495
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,920
an argument between the head of the APA and the head of NIMH a couple of years ago that

496
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,680
was played out in the New York Times where they disagreed about the...

497
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:11,680
How to diagnose patients and to my senses that the fact that there is even a discussion

498
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,400
about how we even diagnose our patients tells us that we're still at a very early stage

499
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,160
for this.

500
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,720
But I should not be so negative about psychiatry just because...

501
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,920
I know technology is going to help you there.

502
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:33,160
I mean it's a new imaging thing is going to help you out of a lot of other medical diagnostics

503
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,760
are based on imaging or measuring activities in your EEGs.

504
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,120
But are those things providing criteria at all or are they?

505
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,840
I would even step back further and just say that the brain is complex.

506
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:51,600
The model of genetic disorder in the brain is Huntington's disease.

507
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,240
It's autosomal dominant.

508
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,800
You have one copy, you have the disorder and the genetics is just beautiful.

509
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:04,400
You have 70 repeats, you get different gradations of this phenotype and you now have a genetic

510
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,320
test you have a great MR or whatever cat scanning to basically show you that the brain is shrink...

511
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:17,120
certain areas of the brain are shrinking and they've known this since the 1980s.

512
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:23,480
And to this day it is an incurable disorder and the reason only reason why it's decreasing

513
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,320
in prevalence is because the genetic testing will allow people to decide that if you have

514
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,680
the gene you will not have children or something.

515
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:39,800
So this should have been like the lowest hanging fruit in terms of neurological psychiatric

516
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:46,720
disorders and they've been trying to put in growth factors into the brain or somehow

517
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,480
because they know exactly what circuit they know that the striatum is degenerating.

518
00:36:51,480 --> 00:37:00,720
So even if you can't repair Huntington the protein you can at least pump it full of whatever

519
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,760
growth factors and that has not actually worked at this point.

520
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,480
Is that where this CRISPR thing should be useful?

521
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,040
So actually I think this proves your point beautifully.

522
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:20,840
Earlier you said you're very skeptical and that we should tone down at times our exuberance

523
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,640
for these new technologies and I think this is a great demonstration that you're correct.

524
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,600
We've known as you said the genetics on Huntington's have been clear for a very long time since

525
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,320
the original linkage studies and some of Dave Hausmann's work and worked by some really

526
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,400
other great scientists.

527
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,720
It's pretty clear that in theory if you could reduce the CAG repeats in that disease that

528
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:55,800
you could correct the phenotype and theory and despite that fact my field, this drug

529
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:04,920
delivery therapeutics field has not successfully been able to deliver a therapeutic that can

530
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,560
do this very simple genetic task despite the fact that we've known exactly what we needed

531
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,440
to do for 30 years.

532
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:18,160
And also to some extent proves your point when you say the brain is complex.

533
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,040
When I look at the brain from a drug delivery perspective I get extremely nervous because

534
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:29,880
of that fact it's just a big huge complicated organ and it's hard to get stuff to go to

535
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
the brain.

536
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,440
Which is a nice place in the brain.

537
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,680
Yeah I would even argue it's hard to get, I don't want to speak too broadly or too like

538
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,440
an over colloquial terminology here but I think about this very simply which is that there's

539
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,600
this thing that we're all aware of the blood brain barrier which is basically the blood

540
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,240
vessels in the brain are very good at keeping stuff out of the brain generally speaking.

541
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,640
And so if you want to deliver a drug into the brain it's really hard to do it because

542
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,080
the body has evolved and designed itself to prevent things from getting into the brain.

543
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,960
It's quite literally that simple, it's hard to get drugs into the brain so even if we have

544
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,960
clear genetics it's hard to make an impact which again like you said.

545
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,720
Well to second that with the imaging I think the next big hype is going to be the brain

546
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
imaging.

547
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:20,840
The reality is out there you can see things that we could never see before and the absolutely.

548
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:26,360
But it has a, well it's not a picture that's the other myth, it's not a picture of somebody's

549
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,960
brain it's a composite of a number of statistical and computerized.

550
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,720
Is this like the, half of my eyes.

551
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,480
Oh I think it's not a picture of my brain in the sense that people think of a picture.

552
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,520
So there's already the media, I have this slide in some ways.

553
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:45,880
But you know I think the next kind of potential hype is going to be brain imaging and Alzheimer's

554
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,960
disease because again there's pretty good information about what's happening.

555
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,720
You can see the same thing happening in Alzheimer's patients and Parkinson's patients.

556
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,600
And yet just because one can actually show that doesn't mean there's going to be some

557
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,800
kind of targeted delivery.

558
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,000
And yet we keep seeing over and over again you know the next, I have articles that said

559
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,560
in ten years we're going to have drugs or Alzheimer's, we had those articles 15 years

560
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
ago for gene therapy.

561
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,040
We're going to have gene therapy for these particular disorders in ten years.

562
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:23,400
It's an ethical problem what you do with, do you want to diagnose early a condition that

563
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,960
you can't do anything about?

564
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
Correct.

565
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
I mean.

566
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,960
And that's the whole genetics information in terms of the bio banking and the results.

567
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,960
I mean that's what I've been doing for ten years, research results exactly.

568
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,640
That's super interesting right?

569
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,840
This is, I'm so curious to hear your voice for a second on this.

570
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:47,040
Yeah, we have this wave, I mean total tsunami of genetic information available and it's

571
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,520
frankly difficult to interpret.

572
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,600
Even for somebody who's, you know you have a PhD in genetics you can get spin a tube

573
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,040
and get your 23andMe profile back and it's hard to interpret your own stuff.

574
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,640
So it's going to be difficult and we're going to need scientists and people who are trained

575
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,120
specifically to take all the genetic information and talk to patients in a way that's practical

576
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,120
and I don't know how you do that.

577
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,360
I mean do you guys have any idea how to do that?

578
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,000
Well the field is moving in that direction.

579
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
When I started thirteen years ago at the Hastings Center I was on a project, an NIH funded

580
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,400
project on the genetics education and ethics or something to that effect was the title.

581
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,920
And we talked about these issues about, you know the human genome had just started to,

582
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,560
it had just started to produce some data.

583
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,240
So this was in the early 2000s and you know the whole issue was oh my god we have all

584
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,400
this information now and we're going to have all these breakthroughs.

585
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,640
Well then the scientists and the clinicians started saying we have a lot of information

586
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,880
that tells us nothing.

587
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,880
We just have a lot of information.

588
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,520
And even if we have information that shows something that might be close to helping us

589
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,240
on a diagnosis we have no treatments.

590
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,560
And then all the other issues about familial connections and heritability and paternity

591
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,240
issues and all this came up.

592
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,760
The field in medicine and genetics has moved, I would in at least the last five years quite

593
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:15,760
a bit to trying to find ways for institutions and specialty groups to at least kind of have

594
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,480
some kind of a consensus on what is the key information they want to actually look at

595
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,200
and what do you actually know.

596
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,760
And to try to have that information filtered down to the clinical level as opposed to

597
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,440
everybody just has everything.

598
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,680
So a lot of institutions I'm sure your institution I know at the Mayo Clinic I had done some

599
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,040
work there.

600
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,760
At the larger professional society level there are these groups now these consortia

601
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,120
either regionally, institutionally or across the field of trying to find out you know what

602
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:49,880
are the key genetic variants that we need to be focused on in terms of clinical practice.

603
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,640
Even if we can't do anything is there enough information about something that we would

604
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,160
want to at least ask patients if they want that information and then try to find some

605
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,200
way to deal with even if you can't do anything with Huntington's at least you know if they

606
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
want to know.

607
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,640
Then you come into the ethical issue of what if they don't want to know.

608
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,280
Does a clinician have an obligation?

609
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,160
So you've got the right to know issue and right not to know issue.

610
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
Yeah.

611
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,080
It reminds me of the informed consent.

612
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:20,600
I remember as a medical student I had to consent a teenage year for an appendectomy taking

613
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,560
the appendix out and it was just really difficult to explain to him exactly what it involved

614
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,560
and so on.

615
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,280
This is just an appendix.

616
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Now you talk about risk factors that may by 2% or 5% or 17.3% or to your risk of something

617
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,520
for which you it just very hard to see how you will.

618
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Well if you're educated in the field how will you reach a conclusion how you will how

619
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:51,200
this affects your treatment and how you then tell this to broader.

620
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:57,480
It's really critical to take into account how your description you know when that patient

621
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,640
receives that information it could affect their even even if medically their genetic

622
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,040
code isn't going to really change the odds that they get a given disease.

623
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:13,520
If you say okay you know I'm your risk for disease X has now increased by 15% right as

624
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,960
a patient I might go oh my lord.

625
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:21,040
This is that's scary to me you know I am at risk for disease X however the overall risk

626
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,840
of any disease is like 1 in 10,000 so now you're like 1.15 out of 10,000 statistically

627
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,680
nothing really has changed.

628
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Correct.

629
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,960
Right and but that's I know that even if I got that information I would be like oh man

630
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,360
this is you know.

631
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,360
Most major diseases though even though they may be genetic components and maybe even the

632
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:43,280
science might get us to a point where you could be the next Nobel Prize winner for finding

633
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,920
a targeted you know pathway.

634
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,480
Most major diseases we already know if you're at risk for it.

635
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,400
You have family history, you have high blood pressure, you have certain markers in your

636
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,520
blood for diabetes and for prostate cancer, you have scans imaging from mammography,

637
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,280
CAT scans, MRIs.

638
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,280
So the genetic information may not in and of itself change much already and if you're

639
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,360
talking about trying to prevent those diseases we have tons of literature and studies showing

640
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:18,440
that people are very very very hard to get people to change their eating, exercise, lifestyle

641
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,080
habits even when they have the information that their dad died at 45.

642
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:28,960
So sometimes I wonder what you know from again from the discovery science point the discovery

643
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,800
science is critically important but from the clinical point what we already know about

644
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,000
patients what we already learn in the clinic you have a lot of information already.

645
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,720
Go into a new doctor and the first thing you do is go down the list what your family history

646
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,800
have you been in the hospital, have you had any operations, have you had a stroke, do

647
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,880
you have diabetes, do you ever get dizzy, do you ever have all these things that you

648
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,360
look at and it's not completely done but it gives you a lot of information already.

649
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:01,800
Correct, for example one of my colleagues is a stroke specialist and all he says is that

650
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,200
if you control your blood pressure that's probably the best thing to prevent stroke,

651
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,320
Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment much more so than much later on and that would

652
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:16,840
be probably from a public health impact that's probably much more important if you just control

653
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:22,880
your blood pressure your chances of all these devastating neurologic disorders that decrease

654
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,880
oxygen.

655
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:29,520
And it would be a lot easier if I can still eat the way I eat and get a gene chip or some

656
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:35,040
mechanism put into my brain to get your blood pressure checked and decrease salt intake

657
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,120
which is actually what you're supposed to do.

658
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,360
Well and the other thing I'll point out too is that so this is what it looks like right

659
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:47,720
now but you know things change and it could be in 20 years they play this video back and

660
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,840
everybody on the stage looks like a fool as I would actually statistically this is probably

661
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,840
a good case.

662
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,680
This is why it's always better to keep skeptical stance.

663
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,680
Yeah, that's right.

664
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,760
But you know things I mean things could change it could turn out that the precision medicine

665
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,320
didn't work out as much as we want to or it could turn out that you know we have cures

666
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,040
to three or four diseases that we didn't think were on the table because in eight years

667
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,520
I think that's actually more likely.

668
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,520
Yeah, that's right.

669
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,240
Because the focus is on a siloed science focus and yes absolutely right.

670
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,840
That's right it's just impossible to predict how these things evolve.

671
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,160
They're in the business of what discovery.

672
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,160
That's right.

673
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:26,560
One of the areas that was promising for the gene editing were the kind of diseases that

674
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:32,040
we know are inherited and we know that start early like muscular dystrophy for example.

675
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,040
More sickle salinine.

676
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,040
More sickle salinine.

677
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,920
I thought those are areas where the promise was the greatest.

678
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,360
Oh yeah that's right.

679
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,080
So there are a number of disease and I'm not an expert in this because we just work on

680
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,640
the delivery.

681
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,600
But there are a subset of biological diseases where again sort of akin to Huntington's

682
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,440
where the genetics and the biology is pretty clear.

683
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,880
As a broad statement we all know here that most diseases are very complicated biologically

684
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,240
but there are subset diseases where we know okay roughly you know this gene is messed

685
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,080
up and therefore you get the disease or that gene is messed up and therefore you get the

686
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,280
disease.

687
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,680
So for disease like that I do think there's a possibility that we'll see advances before.

688
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,400
This is definitely a safe statement to make.

689
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,240
We'll see famous lawswords.

690
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:26,040
I do think that we'll see advances in the simple diseases before we'll see advances

691
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,920
in the complicated diseases.

692
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,320
And I do think that's the case.

693
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:39,400
I was going to ask you don't these current ways of working with genes allow you to alter

694
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:45,880
the brain blood barrier at the brain, in other words isn't that part of the job to see how

695
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,080
you can alter that barrier.

696
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,080
So it kind of depends.

697
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:56,240
Alter can be a scary word in the brain and I guess the best way to describe it is there's

698
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,680
a reason why that blood barrier is there.

699
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,520
And so for instance let's say theoretically you said okay I want to deliver drugs to the

700
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,160
brain so we know that there is a gene.

701
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,640
So the blood vessels that line the brain all express this one particular gene called

702
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:20,520
VE kit here and the VE kit here basically takes the cells that line up the brain and

703
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,600
it makes the cells stick together so that there's a tight junction nothing can get in

704
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,120
between the cells.

705
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:30,680
So in theory you know you go in and inject an antibody towards VE kit here and direct

706
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:35,360
to SIR and A against VE kit here and knock down that protein so the cells become loosened

707
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,240
up and now you can deliver your drug and it would get out.

708
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:44,760
However they're going to be side effects to that and they could be pretty dramatic side

709
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,760
effects.

710
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:56,800
So I think manipulating the brain in order to get drugs to it is in theory a workable

711
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,920
strategy been practiced I would you know if I had to put money on the table I'd probably

712
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,920
bet against it.

713
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,960
Because you get to modify the drugs so they will go up and the other way around.

714
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:10,800
You can change the pharmacology of molecules so that they do go to the brain.

715
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,800
Yeah.

716
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:18,800
And there's a lot of utility in understanding some basic biology so you know there's a

717
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,360
there are certain they're very limited number but there are a small number of pathways where

718
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,600
you can actually these molecular pathways the cells use these pathways to get things

719
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,720
across the bloodstream into the brain because the brain does need to get stuff out of the

720
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,120
bloodstream so the body has ways to get certain things into the brain and you can hijack

721
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,400
some of these molecular pathways to get things across the brain.

722
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,960
Now the efficacy is can be limited but there are a small number of pathways where you can

723
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,360
exploit them to get things across.

724
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,360
There's a lot of things to the brain.

725
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,400
I would have to say one of the miracles of modern psychiatry or of psychiatry in the

726
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:02,480
20th to 20th century is that we actually were serendipitously able to find prozac and

727
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:08,360
halloparadol and lithium which are now sort of like everything is a mainstay of that but

728
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:14,160
if we and they get across very well and it's amazing because these actually change the

729
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:20,240
practice of psychiatry and if we did not have this we would not be in the state we are now

730
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,400
where it's so these definitely went across the board and they're actually quite effective

731
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:31,600
so it's not as if this is we're dealing with something that is 50 to 60% effective in most

732
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:36,520
people what we have the main issue that we're sort of grappling with now is what do we do

733
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:43,080
for the 40 to 50% of people that don't respond to the third and fourth generation of prozac

734
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,560
or the third and fourth generation of lithium at this point but it is quite miraculous that

735
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,560
we have these.

736
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:55,640
And it's also important to note here too that when you think about getting things across

737
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,960
or across the blood brain barrier into the brain there's a size limitation so the things

738
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,560
that get across to the things that cells can handle and sort of take across on their own

739
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,680
are typically extremely small so they might be on the order of like a chemical chemical

740
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:16,120
compound that might weigh 500 Dalton's or maybe a thousand Dalton's at most.

741
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,360
A lot of these biological drugs that we're talking about these sort of next generation

742
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:25,040
drugs if you put them inside a nanoparticle people don't know how to weigh a nanoparticle

743
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,680
but I've heard estimates on the order of 20 million to 100 million Dalton's which is certainly

744
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:37,240
a lot different than 500 Dalton's and so getting that delivery of these large biologics across

745
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,360
is going to be a different ball game.

746
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,200
What the technical hurdle of just getting RNA across?

747
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,680
It's RNA, that's a great question, thanks.

748
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:54,960
I love that question, I've been living with that question for years.

749
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:03,440
Yeah, so if you want to get RNA out of the bloodstream into a tissue it helps if the

750
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,440
tissue helps you out on its own.

751
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,720
In the liver there are certain blood vessels so I'll take a sit back and say that the blood

752
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,000
vessels that are sort of lying your liver are different than the blood vessels that line

753
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,560
your lung and the different ones that line your brain and the blood vessels that line

754
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:26,720
like an average artery in your heart for instance are different than the blood vessels that

755
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:32,920
line a vein in your heart so there's heterogeneity both across tissues and within the tissue

756
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,640
and you can use that to your advantage.

757
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,880
There are wonderful delivery vehicles for delivering small RNAs to hepatocytes in the

758
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,280
liver and one of the reasons why allegedly they work so well is because some of the blood

759
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,720
vessels in the liver actually a little holes punched in them so the holes might be between

760
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:57,400
a, you know, so imagine like a garden hose with like a bunch of holes punched in it and

761
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,720
then you want to get stuff out of the garden hose it's going to get out of the garden

762
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,640
hose more so than a garden hose that doesn't have any holes on it, right?

763
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,920
And so those fenestra or like little windows in the liver help drugs get across so that's

764
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:17,280
one thing and you know besides that to be honest I mean we don't really know, we don't really

765
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,160
know we know that we can use these physical barriers to our advantage but if we want to

766
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,040
actively target something like the brain or the lung or something that doesn't have those

767
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:32,680
physical advantages and we have to get clever and you know it's hard to get clever.

768
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,120
I was thinking as you were talking the two of you brain disorders are very different

769
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,720
too it's like cancers are different although they're finding some similarities and

770
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,760
listening to them are seeing cancers comparatively easier.

771
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:48,640
Yeah exactly because not all brain disorders are equal and you have the package of disorders

772
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,120
it had to do with depression and mania and psychosis and then you have the package it

773
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,880
has to do with neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and other

774
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:05,000
dimensions and then the other more complex kinds of ALS kinds of things they have spinal

775
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,720
connections it's such a complex area to try to figure out a can you just figure out can

776
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:15,720
you just explain what's happening number one which we're not there yet.

777
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:21,000
Number two even if you can't explain can you at least rejigger it somehow to get some kind

778
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,920
of different outcome than what the patient is experiencing and that's going to be complex

779
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,520
because you've got these different combinations.

780
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:38,640
Yes I think the biology is so complex but I would have to say since I'm I hope to be

781
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,320
an optimist is that is that as a society we have figured out how to treat patients in

782
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,960
a completely different way which is through psychotherapy right which I think is one

783
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,720
of the most effective ways people have shown that whether it be psychodynamic, psychoanalytic

784
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:59,160
or cognitive behavioral they all seem to have an effect size that is sometimes larger than

785
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,320
the drugs we use and I think this is something we can take advantage of.

786
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,680
I mean we which I think gets to the whole point that this is what we call targeted environment

787
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,480
you're actually using the environment you're trying to we program the brain by having a

788
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:19,520
discussion with someone else I mean obviously I'm simplifying it beyond means but the one

789
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,200
example I'm going to give and I apologize this is an example from my lab but so it's

790
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:30,360
sort of biased but so we've been studying post-traumatic stress disorder and actually

791
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:35,040
I actually see patients coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan and actually what I first

792
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:41,240
of all I've noticed is they're all really young they're like they're 22 to 24 years

793
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:46,240
old there's young soldiers and I really makes it what I've been working with them for about

794
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:52,040
five six years and and I realized that they're essentially adolescents so that we essentially

795
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:57,160
are sending our soldiers our adolescents to war because you don't send 30 year olds to

796
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:04,160
war you send 18 to 22 year olds and what we're what my colleague BJ Casey who was also at

797
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:10,280
the Sackler Institute we're in we're very we were very much trying to tailor treatments

798
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:15,440
at different stages of development and we recently have made a fairly significant we think well

799
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:21,960
and not not like New York time significant but just like lab significance advance in the

800
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,920
sense that we find that if we do different types of what we call exposure based treatments

801
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:33,680
in both humans and in our mice that we study that we actually get different what different

802
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:40,680
levels of attenuation of memories so in many ways you can imagine as I was discussing before

803
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:46,280
that that the brain is really developing during different stages and we've noticed now that

804
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:51,400
adolescents in particular is very plastic you're much more plastic during you're actually

805
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:57,320
much smarter than you are at other points in development and we think that we can possibly

806
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:02,440
tailor new types of behavioral treatments which are not whatever don't involve blood

807
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:08,360
brain barrier and so you can imagine another form of precision medicine is actually trying

808
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:13,800
to target the right time when your brain is ready it's very similar to the way we've

809
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:19,640
been very much informed by the work of like decades ago there was the Nobel Prize was

810
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,640
given for what they call critical periods of visual plasticity that if you have someone

811
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:30,920
that has doesn't have perfect aligned vision you had a window of about five years before

812
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:35,560
when you had to actually close one eye and let the other eye get stronger and basically

813
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:41,040
and if you miss that window you could not do things and we think that in psychiatric disorders

814
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:46,920
at least in the simple realm of something like fear learning or fear post traumatic stress

815
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:52,120
disorder you might be able to find a window where you can actually alter memories or alter

816
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:56,800
the emotional valence of memories because the brain is much more plastic again this is just

817
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:02,560
like the tip of the iceberg but then you could imagine if you could bootstrap this that ultimately

818
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:08,320
you could possibly then add a drug on top of it so right now we're doing a clinical trial

819
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,280
with these veterans where in addition to giving them exposure therapy we're actually giving

820
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,680
them a cognitive enhancer it's not a very good one I can say that but you can imagine

821
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:22,680
the future in the future of psychiatry might be where you combine what is probably the

822
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:27,680
most effective treatment where you actually get because not only psychotherapy is not

823
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:33,240
just what happens in the if you think about it for a patient to be in psychotherapy or

824
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:39,200
see a psychiatrist or psychologist they actually have to get out of their room and travel somewhere

825
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,880
so there's something about that whole movement which we think is much more important that

826
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:48,320
they're re-engaged with the environment in some way and that you could imagine in the

827
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:54,320
future it'll be this combination of using potentially drugs RNA or other biologics and

828
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:58,600
also but combining with psychotherapy I think we're now at a point where we're realizing

829
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:03,080
that one drug won't do it or one therapy won't do it so I think that's I mean that's sort

830
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:07,800
of the future I think you've touched you haven't you haven't gotten there but the logical discussion

831
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:12,880
that's going on in the ethics literature is so where so when you when if and when we get

832
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:20,320
to the point where you can fix PTSD and societies have always sent young boys to war that's

833
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:27,360
not new it's always been young boys by by draft in most in most historical moments you

834
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:34,000
don't have a choice the logical extension is well if you can fix the brain after this

835
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,560
horrific trauma and maybe even erase those horrible memories which you know there are

836
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:43,120
some drugs that are being discussed about that then what is what are the societal implications

837
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:47,760
for that for nation states and wars and so on if we can and even if you could gene edit

838
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:55,120
something later on to erase bad memories about killing and bad memories of trauma do we then

839
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:00,880
have a societal or other societal implications for the use of those therapeutics and the use

840
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,360
of those techniques or reasons that may be nefarious and not necessarily what we would

841
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:12,520
like to talk about yes no the brain is actually quite no I think it's a very good point I think

842
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:18,920
the best way the best anecdote I had heard about this is from Joe Lidou who's a neuroscientist

843
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:25,640
at New York University if you see a car crash outside you have a memory of it you go home

844
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,800
and within six hours for some reason has to be six hours but within six hours if you then

845
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:37,240
watch a TV news of episode of it and it's slightly different and you will update that

846
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,960
memory and the memory will be more like the newscast than your eyewitness account of it

847
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:46,160
and so this is what they call updating your memory so this I think is what you're saying

848
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,880
about this is actually quite dangerous which means that memories are not as fixed in this

849
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:58,200
I saw it as we think and it can it's always amenable to updating or in many some cases

850
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:03,280
potentially erasure right yeah so that you can update or and this is how I think this

851
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,280
is the danger that you could imagine that you there are various forms of treatments

852
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:13,400
that could actually lead to significant updating in a different way than it was we of course

853
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,920
want to think of it in a therapeutic way that we're going to try to update it and make

854
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,840
previously bad memories lose their emotional or fearful valence but you can imagine they

855
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:28,720
could go the other way the best example I have of this is I was talking to a general

856
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:35,160
from when we're doing a DoD study the Department of Defense study and when the soldiers first

857
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:39,160
came off the field and this has not been published but he said that what they did add

858
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:43,560
and totally they were and they know that they had been under a very traumatic experience

859
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:50,040
they gave all of them either ambient or clonipin these are sort of tranquilizer drugs and but

860
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:57,200
what all neuroscientists know is that sleep consolidates memories so so they looked temporarily

861
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:03,520
calmer they woke up and became more frightened because their memories had been consoled

862
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:10,520
acquired and consolidated so you can imagine that that that especially when we put our our

863
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:16,680
our adolescent citizens into war situations this is actually quite a dangerous situation

864
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:21,520
because we could actually make things much worse and my colleague also I have a colleague

865
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:27,560
Richard Friedman who is a psychiatrist but also writes for the New York Times and what

866
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,520
he mentioned is that he's noticed that the people and he's written about this so this

867
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:36,000
is in the New York Times that that there's an incredibly high use of amphetamines because

868
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,360
when you're on on in the field you have to stay awake and so then the but then this also

869
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:48,160
consolidates and makes you remember things much better just as anyone who's given a patient

870
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,800
ritalin this is essentially they're giving ritalin to others the soldiers and that ultimately

871
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:58,880
your your fearful memories also get hyper consolidated as a result of this so again we're we are

872
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:04,120
already doing things right now manipulating memories even potentially inadvertently even

873
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:08,600
though the government doesn't really think they're doing it and it was actually very

874
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:13,640
hard for Richard to actually extract this information from the government actually they've been using

875
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:19,560
amphetamines for a long time at least since World War II absolutely yeah in the military

876
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:25,720
yeah I mean from my perspective I don't from a drug discovery perspective I don't think

877
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:33,240
we're gonna be in the game but yeah we're looking to hemophilia and cystic fibrosis

878
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:38,120
and yeah that's kind of what we look at where does your field does it intersect at all with

879
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:45,920
brain interface in any way sure I mean we look at trying to design drugs for Alzheimer's

880
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:53,000
or Parkinson's I mean my field specifically asks a more simple question which is can we

881
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,920
full stop can we get drugs into the brain genetic drugs into the brain the underlying

882
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:03,320
hypothesis is that the biologists and the geneticists are going to come up with genetic

883
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:08,640
targets to treat disease X or disease Y or disease Z the one thing that those diseases

884
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,120
have in common is that no matter what gene you're going after you have to deliver that

885
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,480
genetic therapy so that that's where we live as we ask the simple question which is you

886
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:22,760
know can we use chemical engineering or nanotechnology or bioengineering to just get a

887
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:28,040
genetic drug into the brain period and then you know if we succeed and we say okay we're

888
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,880
gonna go after Parkinson's or if we get it to the long we're gonna go after cystic fibrosis

889
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:36,400
so we do interface with with neurologists and neuroscientists but only in that context

890
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:43,440
yeah and when you talk about getting targeted therapeutics to the brain are you talking

891
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,800
through a pill or through a transfusion or through brain surgery or all three so a pill

892
01:05:48,800 --> 01:06:01,040
would be great but ideally yeah but but we're talking IV infusion oral delivery is incredibly

893
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:10,560
hard and it's kind of interesting why it's hard IV administration is already hard enough

894
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:15,000
because it goes to the liver right yeah well IV just it'll go through it'll pump out everywhere

895
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:22,480
and then the liver tends to soak things up as does the spleen and kidney but but if you

896
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,800
give something orally if you have a hamburger 20 minutes before you take that pill or you

897
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:34,040
don't the entire environment in your gut the receptors that are expressed the bacteria

898
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:41,520
that are everything changes so it's extremely hard to get something to get oral oral delivery

899
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:47,280
so I think you know the first genetic drugs that you'll see are likely to be either subcutaneous

900
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:52,880
administration or intravenous administration well so with Parkinson's other doing stem

901
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:58,520
cell injections actually through surgery through so so do you work with people who are thinking

902
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,800
about going that route or are you in a different kind of fall this is kind of a third rail

903
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,560
for me right now because I'm not a stem cell biologist so I don't want to sip out on too

904
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,600
much of a limb here but I do have colleagues who work on stem cell therapies I think that

905
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:18,400
some stem cell therapies will have the potential to be useful others others will not I can't

906
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:23,080
speak to Parkinson's but would you but would you think would but would there be a potential

907
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:29,360
drug that would that you might be able to discover that would only be able to be through

908
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,920
brain through brain surgery actually directly into the brain so this is one of the advantages

909
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:39,160
to the new gene editing technology so we were talking about distinguishing between like

910
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:45,640
sort of traditional gene therapies and new gene therapies one of the advantages to in

911
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:53,800
theory and again theory to these new gene therapies is that the effects are to some extent fairly

912
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:59,960
permanent so the analogy is that if you were to use an sirna which has a temporary effect

913
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:04,880
and you wanted to do something in cardiomyocytes you know like writing though or I will just

914
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:10,360
stick in the brain you want to do you want to do it in the brain you know if the effect

915
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,520
of the drug lasts like if you're lucky in the last three months you're not going to be able

916
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,800
to go in and perform brain surgery every three months right so that's not really an option

917
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:23,480
however if you have one of these new gene therapies where the effect is again in theory

918
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:28,400
pretty permanent then if you got the therapy to be effective enough then you could do you

919
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,600
could say okay we're going to perform a brain surgery and just spray a ton of this stuff

920
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:37,360
where we want it and we know just because we're these new gene therapies are semi-permanent

921
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:41,200
that the effects are going to last a really long time and therefore you know we're going

922
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:46,360
to look at this therapy now I don't know if people are looking into that but I know that

923
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:50,040
my colleagues and I when we think about this say oh this is actually kind of interesting

924
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:54,360
because it would open up like the pancreas or local administration to the heart in ways

925
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:58,240
that we haven't thought about before simply because the effect in the right type of cells

926
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:03,320
quiescent cells long-lasting cells is actually pretty pretty so how would you how would you

927
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,520
actually do this in human research because you can't go from the bench to the bedside

928
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:13,120
without doing studies and how would you actually study the long-term effects what kind of

929
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:21,240
endpoints would you be looking for that would be reasonably acceptable risk and yeah over

930
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,840
time I mean at least you can go back if you give somebody in some kind of a therapy with

931
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:30,560
the kidney or the heart or diabetes you can go back into follow-up testing that's not

932
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,120
sometimes it's invasive but it may be minimally invasive whereas if you're doing gene editing

933
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:41,760
yeah so and again there are people both probably on this panel and even in this room they probably

934
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:47,920
have more of an expertise in this and I do but when I when I think about this and I try

935
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,280
to think practically in the way that I would ever consider doing something like this I'd

936
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:56,040
say okay well what procedures are minimally invasive and access that tissue already in

937
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,120
other words are we going in already in a bunch of patients so if you're you know putting

938
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:06,000
a scope in and you're like in the heart as is could you just spray some stuff in there

939
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,920
while you're taking your pictures or if you're you know doing a colonoscopy and you're already

940
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:16,040
you know in that area can you just spray stuff in locally and I imagine that would be a reasonable

941
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:21,000
starting starting point but again there there you know that's really an answer for a practicing

942
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,480
clinician because they would say no you idiot like you know that isn't going to work you

943
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,920
know it's better to you know this would be useful I'm looking to the clinician from cancer

944
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:34,880
perspective because you can follow up by looking at yeah I said that one so my only

945
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:41,320
excursion and distanced those for Parkinson's and editing them was from a cancer point of

946
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:49,600
view and the idea of implanting basically precursors of neurons into the brain it's a dangerous

947
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:55,560
proposition too because these cells do have plasticity in the wrong ways right they can

948
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:02,600
in fact form tumors and so with I think a lot of these new technologies whether it's genome

949
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:11,840
editing or stem cells you need to think of engineering a fail-safe switch what happens

950
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,840
if these cells suddenly decided now they will form a tumor and there are studies on stem

951
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:23,480
cells they are just more likely to cause tumors so you need to to anticipate that and you need

952
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:30,280
to be able to to get rid of them genetic ways of doing it and then we can do a lot of cool

953
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:38,520
things genetically and we can eliminate them that's sort of my my an option basically an

954
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:44,320
ideally you'd want it in a way that you know let's say someone needs a new liver and you're

955
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:51,120
able to grow it in the lab right and some population of these liver cells decide to become a liver

956
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:56,360
cancer the patient still needs the rest of the liver so you don't want to wipe out everything

957
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:02,160
you want to have a way that ideally selectively destroys these tumor cells but perhaps leaves

958
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:10,160
the rest of the liver intact and even that you can you can do there are ways of doing

959
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:17,880
this you know these are suicide genes basically that kill specific cells and a specific circumstances

960
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:24,680
these things are all technically possible you can engineer cells before implanting them

961
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:32,680
in a patient or an animal for a time being and have those cells perform specific functions

962
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:38,880
and you can install failsafe mechanisms to take them out when they misbehave in a way

963
01:12:38,880 --> 01:13:00,960
that you didn't want them okay questions thank you for a very interesting discussion there's

964
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:10,520
an area that perhaps ought to receive some attention in this age of over promise how

965
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:18,400
do we pay for the research when Galileo made his observations it didn't cost a billion

966
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:26,320
dollars the way it did to show the two black holes went were in collision so the cost of

967
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:35,480
this kind of research has mounted exponentially what about the cost for biomedical research

968
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:42,120
right now I have friends who when they hear the word socialism they faint but when I suggest

969
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:50,640
that the NIH is funding research they don't see that that's a form of socialism where

970
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:56,480
should the funding come from are we funding adequately do we need to fund it more and

971
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:08,360
are we over promising well of course research is expensive new therapies are expensive too

972
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:16,120
I think still in the context of the budget of the country it's nothing it's a drop in

973
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:22,160
the buckets compared to military spending compared to this successful operation in Iraq

974
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:28,920
a few years ago the money that is spent on cancer or psychological research is basically

975
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:39,840
nothing in comparison and I think it's ultimately more useful even if 99% of it will never lead

976
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:47,480
to clinical application a few things that actually do work immensely valuable so if

977
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:52,600
you are a government and you want to spend your money wisely it's probably one way to

978
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:58,840
go the related question I mentioned that the new therapies are also expensive so if you

979
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:04,360
think about the controversy about drug expenses and so on so there's a company that makes

980
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:10,920
a new drug against hepatitis C it's a pill it's a pill right you take it for a certain

981
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:15,040
number of months and they want a hundred thousand dollars for it prevent just the new other

982
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:20,240
other drug for cancer for a second cancer thirty thousand dollars three times and you'd

983
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:27,280
say that's insane how's it possible and it's expensive on the other hand up to now the same

984
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:34,280
patient would need a liver transplant it's gone across 200 300 400 thousand dollars even

985
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:40,280
even in those extreme cases where a company is really trying to make a lot of profit on

986
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:47,400
what is not even their own research partially maybe even there I think you still have a

987
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:52,760
benefits so Galileo and others were funded by the Catholic Church

988
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:59,760
a fairly wealthy and they were patrons of they were patrons of very wealthy people in

989
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:05,760
this culture so as an educator and an enthusiastic skeptic I absolutely agree we make prior we

990
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,960
make bad prior decision making in this country we have our priorities are wrong this is my

991
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:15,680
own personal view and I come from being trained and wanting to be an educator my whole life

992
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:20,600
and I think our priorities are wrong until recently the National Institutes of Health was

993
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:25,840
the largest funder of research that is in happens surpassed by private sector and mainly

994
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,680
by venture capital firms which many people here are familiar with which sometimes the

995
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:37,680
term venture capital sounds to those who are socialistic inclined bad but I think it's

996
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:42,160
a good thing that there's a mix but there's a huge problem now with conflicts of interest

997
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:47,120
in science and so that's another whole ethical dimension about where the money is coming

998
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:51,000
from and if you know all the movies that you watch you just follow the money there are

999
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,080
lots of complex issues many people argue for public private partnerships with and I come

1000
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:00,320
from a political science background so I'm the person who always says in the sunshine

1001
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:05,320
in the sunshine in the sunshine transparency accountability good governance with public

1002
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:12,320
participation that's my fantasy as a non scientist where I would like to get yeah and just

1003
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:18,880
in your early point I'd like just to sort of reemphasize things here which is that first

1004
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:25,880
it may seem like the NIH budget is very large but it is not and I can say for a fact that

1005
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:34,840
many of the colleagues that have grown up in sort of my scientific generation who would

1006
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:41,840
make incredible professors incredible researchers I'd say I won't put in a exact number many

1007
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:49,520
of them more than 50 percent well more than 50 percent do not go into academic science

1008
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:56,800
because there is no research money and that is the exact reason why I know that when I

1009
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,920
was considering taking a faculty job there were other jobs that were on the table as

1010
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:06,800
well and I've always wanted to be a professor I think teaching students is incredible I'm

1011
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,800
proud of the students I've taught so far it's the greatest joy in my life and yet I almost

1012
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:18,680
took a different type of position because the grants are so hard to get that is the reason

1013
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:22,680
why I almost didn't go in and it's the reason why everybody in my generation if they do

1014
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:28,600
not go in that's the reason why they don't go in the other thing I think is a really

1015
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:35,600
important point to understand is that it's really hard I would say it is impossible to

1016
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:41,080
predict what is going to be useful down the line so today we've discussed a lot about

1017
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:45,600
this new technology called these gene editing technologies and right now the most easy to

1018
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:50,760
use gene editing technologies called CRISPR-Cas9 and right now I mean everybody knows about

1019
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:55,000
CRISPR-Cas9 in the biological field it's considered arguably the biggest biotechnology

1020
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,480
discovery in 40 years totally changing the world and that was originally discovered by

1021
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:07,280
a bunch of bacteriologists sequencing some random repeats in an unknown bacteria and

1022
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:12,440
saying oh that's weird these things look the same now if you put that grant in that 1980s

1023
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:17,560
grant into the NIH system right now that doesn't get funded and 30 years down the line we don't

1024
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:23,080
have CRISPR-Cas9 and that's the huge risk that we're facing right now is that there's

1025
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:27,120
all these incredible transformational potentially transformational technologies 30 years 40 years

1026
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:32,840
down the line that we're not stumbling onto because that's how science works so I think

1027
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,320
it's really important to support increase in NIH funding you guys can believe me or not

1028
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:42,720
obviously I'm sort of biased in that because this is important to me but I think there's

1029
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:47,080
ample evidence to support the fact that that these discoveries are hard to make and there

1030
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,480
are many people who want to do a great job who just are leaving the field right now because

1031
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:55,760
there's no money but it's not just NIH funding because let's state so NIH is federal funding

1032
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:59,280
so yes our federal dollars paper research but state funding for research and education

1033
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:06,160
has been decimated in my lifetime I started as an academic teaching in 1989 or no age 1985

1034
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:10,920
and it was being decimated in its continued science programs that were at public schools

1035
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:16,440
you're at a private school but Georgia Georgia Tech gets public funding I've been cut dramatically

1036
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:26,080
I wanted to ask a question I studied computer science and not biotechnology so when I look

1037
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:33,320
at something like you know the RNA you know delivery of you know whether it's transmission

1038
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:38,480
or messaging I think in sort of a computer model where you know we might send something

1039
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:44,920
with an assist and rather than waiting for it to eventually succeed or break down we immediately

1040
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:50,600
see an acknowledgement like we would see you know like an AC or an ACK it would say right

1041
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:56,360
away send back this message and you say yes it succeeded it's failed and I've never heard

1042
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:03,400
of anything like that within sort of the study of medicine where you know I think in terms

1043
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:10,440
of you know is there it's more like eventually you see a cancer marker or you see a disorder

1044
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:16,240
in the blood or this thing happens and it's measured maybe through a blood test but I wondered

1045
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:20,280
I don't know enough about it to know is there something that you can immediately see that

1046
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:27,000
is this sort of feedback within the system loop.

1047
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,360
So it's you know it's a difficult question to say yes or no to I will point you to a

1048
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:37,200
field you may like reading about just for fun it's called synthetic biology it's a new

1049
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:42,080
field very experimental right now but actually that sits right at the interface of basically

1050
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:48,680
computer scientists like yourself and bioengineers and there are many universities now that actually

1051
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:54,600
have faculty members whose research are sort of dedicated to living right at that interface

1052
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:59,720
and it's really funny you'll see a biological paper published and they'll put in diagrams

1053
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:04,680
that have resistors and transistors and the equivalent of that stuff in the circuitry of

1054
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:10,280
the cell and so you know I don't know the field one enough to say yes or no that hazard

1055
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:14,840
hasn't happened yet but it may have and if so I would say synthetic biology is a likely

1056
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,080
place to find that.

1057
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:24,280
I think you sort of asked about immediate readouts of whether you know your message arrives and

1058
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,320
whether you get an effect.

1059
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:33,360
Sorry and I think so in drug studies certainly that's something that you need to be able

1060
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:37,720
to measure immediately you give a new drug and you want to be able to know the drug hit

1061
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:43,360
the target and how effectively and for how long it suppresses that so that's certainly

1062
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,560
part of any medical any drug study that you want.

1063
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:53,080
You have a call it a biomarker just something that says it got there and it did what it's

1064
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,080
supposed to do.

1065
01:22:55,080 --> 01:23:03,160
I have a question about the field of optogenetics and channel redoxins and also the delivery

1066
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:07,640
how did they get it into the specific parts of the brain I've read a lot about it and

1067
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:13,080
confused about that part and also the ethical implications of turning on and off neurons

1068
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:16,800
in particular parts of the brain using channel redoxins.

1069
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:22,760
Well I'll quickly address the delivery part and I'll let the experts handle the media

1070
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,440
part of the question.

1071
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,920
Luckily the answer is pretty simple as far as understand it.

1072
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,920
No black magic here they basically say okay we're going to take a virus that encodes the

1073
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,600
optogenetic whatever channel redoxins you would like and they spray it in where they want

1074
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,600
to spray it in.

1075
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:40,120
They might use a cell type specific promoter to make sure it's only expressed in neurons

1076
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:46,440
as opposed to glia but yeah they basically just and then you know you're good.

1077
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:52,520
But I think interesting enough mainly because there's a technical glitch almost all optogenetics

1078
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:56,760
now is in rats and mice because all the promoters have been done.

1079
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,680
There seems to be a technical glitch of getting to primates so that there is not that much

1080
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:06,440
of the ultimate use of optogenetics in humans is probably not going to be the reason why

1081
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:11,440
optogenetics is so powerful up until now is because we had these very powerful promoter

1082
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:16,360
specific expressions so you could go right to one type of dopamine neuron for example

1083
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,320
and turn it on and in the monkey you cannot do it.

1084
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:27,000
So all the experiments so far in monkey and you can tell scientists are not stupid so

1085
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,520
if you see how many people are going towards trying to translate this to human optogenetics

1086
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:36,880
it seems to be very low it seems to be something that not is not something because you have

1087
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,120
to actually put a fiber optic cable it's very complicated.

1088
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:47,520
I think in the future there is another type of technology which is still in its sort of

1089
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:52,000
in essence is now being developed at many places but in particular at Rockefeller University

1090
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,360
where instead of putting a virus that gets turned on by light but will get turned on

1091
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:03,600
by a magnetic beam so that is something that is possible in terms of developing better

1092
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:09,200
and stronger ways of turning on magnetic fields within a darkened chamber like the brain and

1093
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,680
I think that's an area.

1094
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:16,240
What they have definitely been able to do is turn on a magnetic beam on the pancreas and

1095
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:20,760
get it to secrete insulin so that they can definitely do something like that so I think

1096
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:25,240
that will probably be something that will people would much rather have a magnet put

1097
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:32,480
on your abdomen than a fiber optic cable so I think that will probably be the 10, 5, 10

1098
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,480
years from now.

1099
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:40,000
But the ethical concerns of optogenetics for primate human and non-human are probably

1100
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,440
not that critical because the technical difficulties are a little bit too great right now and

1101
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,560
you can't get funding for it.

1102
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,360
Well there are some questions that have come up about controlling the brain though in some

1103
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:57,680
other technologies so deep brain stimulation and neuro enhancement not drug neuro enhancement

1104
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,520
but mechanisms the electronic.

1105
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:07,040
There's two issues, well there's more than two issues but free will is one but another

1106
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:15,200
one is what if I like what happens to me when I have deep brain stimulation or I'm using

1107
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:19,760
a neuro enhancer and I can figure out how to do it and jigger with it on my own and

1108
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,080
the clinician does not want to go there for a variety of reasons and there have been some

1109
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:28,680
discussions in the ethical field about the rights of the patient to be able to say either

1110
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:34,240
stop this which we in medical ethics we basically acknowledge the patients right to say I don't

1111
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:39,400
want chemotherapy, I don't want the heart surgery, whatever, I don't want a brain interface.

1112
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:44,080
But the other flip side is I really like this, I like being manic and there's some literature

1113
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:48,800
on this now and I like what this has done to me and I don't want to come down from whatever

1114
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:53,760
the particular brain not drugs we're talking about are the kinds of interventions although

1115
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:57,600
we could be talking about drugs but this is in the non drug field so it does raise some

1116
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:03,840
interesting questions about individual control and then if people have control over what's

1117
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:10,040
happening in terms of computers and chips and then the data that comes from that information

1118
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:13,480
and who has access to that data is another whole realm.

1119
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:21,040
I think the only comment I have is analgesia right so there were and maybe there's still

1120
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:26,880
their pain control where patients can control their own medication and basically give themselves

1121
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:32,720
opiates right and I think the conclusion of that research was that they actually administer

1122
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:37,520
less than if it is given by the doctors and the nurses who have been self-controllable

1123
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:44,520
actually do less than for better or worse it's actually a surprising.

1124
01:27:44,520 --> 01:28:05,040
And you will know when you mention that we knew all there was to know about Huntington

1125
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:11,360
you know identifying it but we didn't know how to control or to take interventions this

1126
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:19,760
is very disturbing to me not what you said but that it's like it's closing it's as though

1127
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:25,280
it's closing so much because I think that I just heard of something and it was about

1128
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:30,440
post-traumatic syndrome and that other people have it you know we begin to realize under

1129
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:35,200
other circumstances and it had a lot to do with mindfulness now and this was people

1130
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:40,360
who were rather responsible saying that you know just controlling your mind and that gets

1131
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:46,480
into the psychoanalysis of it but it seems that how do you get support when you have

1132
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:53,160
some idea that's way out there that I have one more question and it was do you divide

1133
01:28:53,160 --> 01:29:00,160
your field into dimensions you know this is this is what is happening in the cell this

1134
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:06,600
is what we can do to control that thing that's happening in the cell I mean are there all

1135
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:11,040
these steps that you you know do you go into this and different this I should know this

1136
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:17,360
but do you go into different disciplines or aspects of your discipline so I there were

1137
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:23,480
kind of three questions well it's a great set of questions so to your first question

1138
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:33,360
about about Huntington's so I remain optimistic that we will be able to deliver to Huntington's

1139
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:37,440
and my lab works on new delivery technologies and there are many great labs across the

1140
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:44,000
U.S. and also work on on the delivery technologies I think historically science most of the time

1141
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,560
fails but a friend of mine says that you know all your failure all your failures don't

1142
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:53,400
don't matter it's really your the few wins that you get that actually make a difference

1143
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:58,160
and I agree with that so I wouldn't be dissuaded or feel pessimistic yeah

1144
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:12,200
oh well you who's who's doing more basic oh by the way you're absolutely correct we don't

1145
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:16,800
know what the protein Huntington actually does yep we really still don't understand

1146
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,640
that yeah so and I should have been more clear earlier what I meant is from a therapeutic

1147
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:25,440
perspective we know the sequence to go after and that is an important distinction I didn't

1148
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:30,960
make that clearly so that's my fault to your second question I'll I'll intro that quickly

1149
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:36,560
in my lab we do think about things in different layers and we purposefully try to position

1150
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:40,640
ourselves at interfaces of new technology or different fields and that's how we try to

1151
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:48,600
thrive so we try to use genomics and genetics and really big data sets to make our chemical

1152
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:52,920
engineering systems better that's how we try to distinguish ourselves so I know that

1153
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:59,560
are in our lab we do purposefully subdivide things and then right look right where that

1154
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:02,000
interface is.

1155
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:14,960
Thank you very much for very professional conversation and I have a lot of questions

1156
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:25,520
but I would like to ask about simple techniques not like generating interventions for example

1157
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:36,120
couple of years ago I on routine tests I it was I got really bad results on very routine

1158
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:45,360
tests and I of course I straight was sent to more invasive tests and I was scared to

1159
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:52,040
that that I should do this instead of this I start to read and that I a lot of information

1160
01:31:52,040 --> 01:32:02,080
right now a lot of research that could some got some way but then lost finding and in

1161
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:13,460
my case it was actually I should just change diet I just stop stop drink what I liked I

1162
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:23,240
liked very much so milk that was it in couple of months my test was okay everybody but everybody

1163
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:33,600
you're amazed it was it was not possible from their point of view so why we cannot yes maybe

1164
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:41,040
really test more people and give them these some kind of connection that probably some

1165
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:48,240
something in your environment in your diet could cause it why don't don't try it for

1166
01:32:48,240 --> 01:33:00,160
example there are some research that psychological problems could be caused by our gut flow

1167
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:11,760
micro flow and just prebiotics could change our brain functions or there are some research

1168
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:23,720
that fish oil could really improve a lot of brain functions why we don't make these simple

1169
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:31,720
connections without go to invasive tests and very expensive treatments because there are

1170
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:36,520
a lot of great doctors out there who probably make a lot of those connections and can probably

1171
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:43,560
help you I'm glad that you got better by changing the diet I think there first of all you I

1172
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:48,560
can leave you there's smarter doctors but then also at Cornell I just realized this also we

1173
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:55,080
hired we have a new microbiome project and I didn't realize that our entire gut floor

1174
01:33:55,080 --> 01:34:01,080
all our bacteria weighs more than our brain the mouth it's like five or six pounds of

1175
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:08,120
bacteria inside our body so it's not so simple it's not one bacteria and it's the genome of

1176
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:13,880
the bacteria is 30 to 40 times more complex than the genome we have ourselves so that

1177
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:19,360
you can imagine it's it looks like on the surface like it's simple it's actually much

1178
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:24,400
more complex because then you're it's almost like we were studying a lake and that's an

1179
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:32,600
ocean okay anyone else okay thank you very much thank you
