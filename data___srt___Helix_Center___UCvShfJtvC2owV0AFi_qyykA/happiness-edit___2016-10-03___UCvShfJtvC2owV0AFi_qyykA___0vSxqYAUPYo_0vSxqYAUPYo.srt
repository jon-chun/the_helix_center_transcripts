1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,640
Now to today's roundtable on happiness.

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,120
Shimon Edelman, Professor of Psychology at Cornell University,

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,240

00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,200
University, and Christine Vittrano, Associate Professor

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,720
of Philosophy at Brooklyn College.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,760
And now we'll begin.

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,720
Let's have a question for the panel.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,580
I wonder whether you know whether happiness

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,760
has been measured as a function of stress levels

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,160
in a country or a society, and physiological cortisol

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,120
levels in the blood, or wherever other stress levels you have.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,560
There's been some work done on that.

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,560
I know that people with hypertension

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,400
are less happy than other people.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,640
But in terms of cross-national comparisons,

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,680
I don't know.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,800
The other thing they do not exactly measure,

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,360
they correlate it with the way you smile.

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,680
There are measurements of how you smile, which

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,000
relate to how happy you are.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,280
And they naturally do that.

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,160
So OK, the idea of what she is happy.

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,200
Yeah, exactly.

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,800
So they also have measured, yes, so I actually

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,960
don't know which kind of a blood testing group.

29
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,280
But there's an enormous battery of correlation.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,720
I just wonder, because I did a study,

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,720
kind of another microcosm level in Y students,

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,120
who were students doing exercise one time a week more

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,960
during the whole semester, compared

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,920
to another class that didn't exercise that much,

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,640
beginning at the end of the semester.

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,520
I didn't realize that I was doing a stress study,

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,240
because stress goes up a lot at the end of the semester.

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,520
What I found was the performance

39
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,720
on cognitive tests, memory tests, of my students

40
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,040
that exercised stayed the same from the beginning to the end.

41
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,000
But the other class that didn't exercise with me in class

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,080
went significantly down, because exercise protects

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,840
the perciput campus from stress, protects the prefrontal cortex

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,120
from cortisol.

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,720
And so I just started wondering about stress levels.

46
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,320
Yeah, I know that they measured the exact stress level.

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,920
So I don't know how you would measure stress level,

48
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,280
but there's all sorts of patterns.

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,720
Yeah, exactly.

50
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,160
On a group level, there have been several recent studies

51
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,160
about socioeconomic strata groups that are better off

52
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,000
or worse off at different times of the year.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,200
You've probably not studied from MIT.

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,600
So farmers who grow one crop a year,

55
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,280
just before they harvest, they are the most stressed.

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,160
And so they have the proper control.

57
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,040
It's a wonderful study.

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,240
I forget the names of the people.

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,120
It's very easy to Google them.

60
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,320
But the interesting aspect was that the amount of stress

61
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,280
seriously affected negatively, seriously affected

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,560
the cognitive abilities of the people.

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,520
Yeah, it does.

64
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,600
And of course, if this is not a seasonal thing for you,

65
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,520
if you're stressed because you are economically,

66
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,720
I mean, if you are physically stressed

67
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,440
because economically stressed, you're

68
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,040
in a hole that becomes more and more difficult for you

69
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,280
to get out of.

70
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,440
You just dig yourself more in because you're

71
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,480
cognitively impaired.

72
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,800
Right.

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,480
And it's really a travesty when someone says,

74
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,320
there's a famous quote about, I think,

75
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,240
Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish writer, said,

76
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,280
the biggest mistake people made in the last thousand years

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,920
was to assume that poor people are stupid.

78
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,760
So there are two sides to this coin.

79
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,560
They wouldn't be.

80
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,960
They were not poor, I guess.

81
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,120
That's one way of putting it.

82
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,800
And another comment that your question, when you brought

83
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,040
to mind, is in Baboon's stress was studied across stress.

84
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,120
Robert Sapolsky's work.

85
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,720
I'm sure you know that the guy who

86
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,040
was running around taking saliva tests from Baboon's,

87
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,280
not an easy task, and discovered wonderful things

88
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,840
about social status, especially younger,

89
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,480
the lessened males, and how they can be very negatively

90
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,600
affected by being rejected, by being a young.

91
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,640
If you're number 20 in the Baboon's of males,

92
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,520
you basically have a brain and the physiology of somebody

93
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,560
with PTSD.

94
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:38,960
Right.

95
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,400
Because you're chronic stress.

96
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,760
You get beat up all the time, you don't have sex at all.

97
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
And so this is another aspect.

98
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,560
This is a complementary aspect in which someone who is already

99
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,640
in the hole gets even worse because of the dynamics of this.

100
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,800
And we have to recognize this is our nature.

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
This is our physical nature.

102
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,560
Exactly.

103
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,200
And that is why the main reason why social democracy makes

104
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,400
people happier in part is it reduces their stress levels

105
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,840
and permanent levels of anxiety about living in a market

106
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,960
society, and particularly people at the lower end

107
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,840
of that spectrum.

108
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,920
At least it makes them think they live in a market.

109
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,480
I just saw an ad on the subway coming in here.

110
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,120
I think it was from 7-Eleven.

111
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,800
You can buy now your drink in two colors of cup, red or blue.

112
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,200
And you know, have your say.

113
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,000
Have your choice, free choice, land of free choice.

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
The elephant or the donkey.

115
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,920
You have your choice.

116
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,200
So are you coming to the conclusion

117
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:44,320
that happiness can be defined as low stress and low anxiety

118
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,320
on an individual level and that those social things that

119
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,920
alter it have to do with the fact that they bring down

120
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,240
the stress level in people?

121
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,480
The last part I would agree with that.

122
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,080
I personally would not say that happiness is

123
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,960
isomorphic or equivalent to low levels of anxiety.

124
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,880
But that anxiety is a cause or a correlate of happiness.

125
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,120
So if you reduce anxiety, you reduce you increase happiness.

126
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,640
So they're not identical by any means.

127
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,400
There's a normal variation, again,

128
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,600
of the things equal, right?

129
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,600
So all these studies are done correctly

130
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,880
from a statistical point of view.

131
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,200
They are done at the same sequence.

132
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,920
So you keep your own regressions where essentially you

133
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,440
put these individual variables and a bunch of other things.

134
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,720
So again, happiness depends on how they take.

135
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,160
So given the level of your anxiety, you're happier.

136
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,720
If you're rich, given the level of your wealth,

137
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,320
you're happier if you're less anxious.

138
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,960
Given the level of your wealth and anxiety,

139
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,240
you're happier if you have more sex.

140
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,040
You're happier if you exercise.

141
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,480
If you don't have kids or things of this sort.

142
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,200
So these are all correlates.

143
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,120
It's actually true.

144
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,520
This is one of the puzzles is this issue of kids.

145
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,880
It's very widespread in the literature

146
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,600
that people with kids are not as happy as me without kids.

147
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,480
No, that's absolutely true.

148
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,880
And of course, and people.

149
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Yeah, until they leave.

150
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Right.

151
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,240
It goes back, right?

152
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,720
So, again, from the economist point of view,

153
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,240
people still are doing kids.

154
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,040
Why aren't they?

155
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,680
So one of the two measures is a problem.

156
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,960
But on other dimensions, no, right?

157
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,520
On the stress or sex or other things,

158
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,640
people are happy when they do it and they do it.

159
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
But the kids is the other way around.

160
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,640
So the point I want to try and make is these things all move.

161
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,400
They're all correlated.

162
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,480
It's very hard to do any causation argument.

163
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,960
And in a case, they are all correlated.

164
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,000
So we look at variations where you keep one thing cost

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,800
and you move the rest.

166
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,080
So all contribute.

167
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,560
If you think of them in a causal manner, which perhaps you

168
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,240
shouldn't, but if you do, still all of these are causing

169
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,480
all of these measures are causing happiness.

170
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,920
I think you can, from a philosophical standpoint,

171
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,520
I don't think it's so hard to explain.

172
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,120
I know people think that it's so, you know,

173
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,800
it's comical and sort of mysterious.

174
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,440
And I always, in like my first day of class and my happiness

175
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,240
class, I always hit my students with that because they're

176
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,120
always like, oh, you know, a lot of them

177
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,840
don't have children and they're thinking they want to have

178
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,560
children and I tell them, well, if you want to be happy,

179
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,200
that's not one of the things you want to do.

180
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,200
But I think that the reason that the studies show that

181
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,360
is because when you pull people the way that typically

182
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,080
these results come from these poles of people,

183
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,320
happiness is a very limited, I mean, if you think of happiness

184
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,680
as just your sort of satisfaction with your life,

185
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,720
kids are, I mean, I have two children.

186
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,480
So I mean, they're a huge source of, you know, very, very

187
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,280
positive and very, very negative emotions.

188
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,320
I felt like before I had kids, my emotional range was like this.

189
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,280
And then when I had kids, I was like, wow,

190
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,200
there's this whole spectrum I didn't even know existed

191
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,600
in terms of like, I've never been happier and like,

192
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,800
I've never been more miserable, more frustrated,

193
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,320
more terrified, et cetera, et cetera.

194
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,240
And I think that that speaks to the idea

195
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,600
that there are a lot of values out there that

196
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,240
make for a good life other than happiness

197
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,600
and that the, you know, this fixation we have on just being

198
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,840
happy, that's a very limited thing.

199
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,440
It's, you know, was my life easier before I could?

200
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,400
Absolutely, especially because I had a job.

201
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,320
You know, I could write and work whenever I wanted,

202
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,360
I could travel whenever, now I have kids.

203
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,000
So when my life is bound to them and very limited,

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,880
I have to put myself last all the time

205
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,280
because they're my kids and I love them and I do it willingly.

206
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,880
But that in terms of my personal happiness,

207
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,760
life was way easier before I had them.

208
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,360
And I think that, do they make my life more meaningful?

209
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,440
Do they give me purpose?

210
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,640
Do they, you know, I would never,

211
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,760
have wanted to live without them, you know?

212
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,200
But at the same time, in terms of like,

213
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,480
personal happiness, no, you know,

214
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,720
they feel a lot of frustration and anxiety there.

215
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,760
I'm up at two a.m. worrying about, you know,

216
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,280
not myself, them.

217
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,480
So, you know, I think that, you know,

218
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,760
and speaking to what you said before,

219
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,640
about, you know, sort of the dangers of, you know,

220
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,920
because happiness is reflective of your expectations

221
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,480
and everything else, it is dangerous

222
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,640
when you just focus on happiness

223
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,080
because you can make people happier

224
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,440
by just convincing them that they don't,

225
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,040
they're perfectly fine with the life they have

226
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,920
versus, you know, wanting more

227
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,520
and risking being more unsatisfied with your life.

228
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,840
And I think that's perfectly fine, you know,

229
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,360
because there are these other values, you know,

230
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,680
when you strive for something, when you work towards something,

231
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,640
you're gonna be dissatisfied in the process

232
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,120
and that's good, you know?

233
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,440
Doesn't that suggest that perhaps you could take up

234
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,200
a little bit more discussion of, you know,

235
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,960
the, the, the, the, the, the,

236
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,600
the, the, the, the, the, the, the judgment of,

237
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,080
the value of the good in life

238
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,440
and how that bears unhappiness

239
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,040
because the way you're describing it,

240
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,960
it's almost as if you could separate happiness

241
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,120
from defining what the good is

242
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,440
because as you're saying, well, there are,

243
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,160
there are elements of having a child

244
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,320
that pertains to a higher good.

245
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,280
Do you derive happiness from that?

246
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
I think, yeah.

247
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
I think, yeah.

248
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

249
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,280
I mean, my view of, we just wrote a book on this topic too,

250
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,280
so my view of what makes for a good life would be,

251
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
happiness is a necessary component.

252
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,280
I would definitely say that if you're not satisfied

253
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,280
with your life, you're not having a good life.

254
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
And I would say it's happiness achieved

255
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
in sort of morally acceptable ways

256
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
where that sort of is a very personal choice

257
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
about what that is.

258
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,280
But I think that there are a lot of goods in life

259
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,280
and philosophers love to, which we sort of rail against them,

260
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,280
tell people what they ought to be doing,

261
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,280
aesthetic, this, intellectual, that, and blah, blah, blah.

262
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Philosophy is always on that list.

263
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
And we sort of reject all of those lists

264
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
of what is the good life.

265
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,280
And we sort of say, look, it's how you can find happiness

266
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,280
with your life, but there are a lot of goods out there.

267
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,280
There are a lot of, and you have to have a long-term approach

268
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,280
to not just the sort of short-term, you know,

269
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
I'm going to do what makes me feel good right now,

270
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
but what is ultimately going to be good in the long-term.

271
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,280
That, by the way, has a clear evolutionary advantage.

272
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
So the major finding of this study,

273
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,280
of mine that I mentioned, is agents, those simulated little agents

274
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,280
that compete, those that have a longer window of memory looking back

275
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,280
over which things are counted, like successes with any account,

276
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
they do better on the evolutionary timescale.

277
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
So we kind of have evolved, I guess,

278
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,280
extrapolating to real agents like ourselves, in that sense,

279
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,280
we have evolved to have, and this is actually well-known

280
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
by psychologists who would discover the independently

281
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
just by asking people different types of questions.

282
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,280
You can ask them, are you happy just right now?

283
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
And also, what's your life evaluation?

284
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Those are the two classes of questions.

285
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
So can we go back?

286
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
So this is a good question.

287
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:50,280
This is the arguments you were making are exactly the reason

288
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
why economics don't like happiness.

289
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,280
And they like a choice-based measure, right?

290
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Because the people who have kids and they want to have them,

291
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,280
the people who don't have them and don't want to have them,

292
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
the people who have them, they don't want them,

293
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
the people who don't when they want.

294
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Okay, so you look at these people and you rent them.

295
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,280
You can see what they want, what they have and so on.

296
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:19,280
So the word, and then call whatever they get in exchange

297
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,280
for these choices that are, in some of these cases,

298
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
are what they are chosen.

299
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
They have a really choice in some cases.

300
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,280
So what they get in exchange, we call it utility,

301
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
but you can still call it happiness now.

302
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,280
And this is a way of getting at the point without finding

303
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,280
all these paradoxes of, you know,

304
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,280
and really this is really the fundamental reason why

305
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,280
economists tend to or at least classical economists,

306
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,280
certain kind of economists, so however you want to characterize

307
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,280
and don't like the concept.

308
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Now, the other way you can go, so one way is just,

309
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,280
let's not define happiness and let's see what people do

310
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,280
and wearing strange conditions, typically they do what they want

311
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
to do, not all.

312
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
So you have to be careful about that too, but, okay,

313
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,280
you try and do that.

314
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,280
The other way, of course, is going the way we're talking

315
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,280
before, which is you try and get a little bit more into the

316
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,280
details of what happiness means, because again,

317
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
happiness is the way it's measured.

318
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,280
So in many places, the GSS measures it with general questions

319
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,280
of the sort, you know, how even taking stock of your life

320
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,280
at this point, how happy do you think you are?

321
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Other people, other experiment asks questions where

322
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,280
how happy are you right now, right this moment, right?

323
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,280
So these are two very different constants of happiness

324
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
and you can imagine many more.

325
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,280
So not just in terms of time, you can imagine many more,

326
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
you can imagine asking the question in many different ways,

327
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,280
you can imagine stressing various different aspects.

328
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,280
And so at this point, so that's the sense in which then the question

329
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
becomes kind of meaningless, because if there are a million

330
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,280
questions which are more or less correlated, we need

331
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
theorizing behind it.

332
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
So just all you need is factor analysis.

333
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,280
And you ask a whole lot of questions or even give them an

334
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,280
opportunity to get freely and then you use natural language

335
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
processing.

336
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
You can try and do that.

337
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Or once again, you can have them choose, make choices,

338
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
and you're going to have to do factor analysis.

339
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
It doesn't always work.

340
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
The choices are three in many aspects.

341
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:28,280
So just to add another challenge to the way that we're talking

342
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,280
about this, is happiness always self-evident or can someone

343
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,280
not be aware that they're unhappy?

344
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Or happy?

345
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Yeah, I think this is a very big question.

346
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
I don't know.

347
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,280
There are certainly, so one issue certainly, so I don't,

348
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,280
of course, I don't know how would I know.

349
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,280
I'm trying to translate in terms of what we know in the

350
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
happening, in the happiness literature.

351
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,280
So I can go back to what we were saying before.

352
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,280
One fundamental aspect of measures of happiness, realize

353
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,280
measures of happiness, is expectations.

354
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,280
So those are perhaps a little bit less conscious.

355
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,280
So I think I should be very rich because whatever, and I'm not,

356
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,280
and I don't really know why I'm answering that I'm not happy.

357
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,280
So a lot of this is playing a big role.

358
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,280
To me, so that's certainly a dimension where I don't know how

359
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,280
conscious I am about my expectations.

360
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Some certainly I am conscious about.

361
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Maybe there are some that I'm not.

362
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,280
And the impression is that all of this play a big role in the

363
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
answering this question.

364
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,280
So all this idea about people adapting to situations, they all

365
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
have to do with expectations.

366
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,280
So at some point you're on a wheelchair, and you're not

367
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,280
that unhappy anymore, your expectations obviously are not

368
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
the place of current somehow.

369
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Or to do it.

370
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,280
And somehow this, at the moment where you go on a wheelchair,

371
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,280
your happiness drops to a bit more levels, and then you go back.

372
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
So this is the fact of us.

373
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
And how conscious is that?

374
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,280
I don't know how much there's actually a rationalization

375
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
exposed.

376
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
I'm sure if you ask people why are you happy, they'll tell you,

377
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,280
yes, I was running before, but they discover that happiness,

378
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
it's only a sign.

379
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
It's only my mind.

380
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,280
That's perfectly possible.

381
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,280
I may weigh in on this.

382
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,280
One of my other lines of research is consciousness,

383
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
computational phenomenology.

384
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I think in phenomenology or consciousness research, the first

385
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,280
rule is that you have to take the conscious, report the face

386
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
value.

387
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Because think of someone seeing red or not seeing red when

388
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,280
looking at a picture that's obviously red.

389
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
But they don't see red.

390
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
You can't tell them, no, no.

391
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
You see red.

392
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,280
You just don't realize that that just doesn't work in conscious

393
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
research.

394
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,280
It cannot work in any field in which you want to quantify or study

395
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
human feelings.

396
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Because you as the perceiver and experiencer are the ultimate

397
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
and only authority in what you feel.

398
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Right?

399
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Yeah, I'm inclined to agree.

400
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
I give the first person authority.

401
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
I remember it.

402
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
My dissertation defense, somebody was like, well, what about

403
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
self-deception?

404
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Well, you know, and I didn't have a good answer.

405
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
I still don't have a great answer.

406
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,280
I tried to read a bit of that literature and it was just, I

407
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
didn't really get anywhere.

408
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,280
But I would just simply say that I think you don't always know

409
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
going back to what you were saying.

410
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,280
I don't know that everybody can enumerate what factors are

411
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,280
bothering them or contributing or detracting from happiness.

412
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,280
With a bit of thought, I think you can get there.

413
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
But I don't know that everybody, but I do think that when you ask

414
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
people, how's it going right now?

415
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
How satisfied are you?

416
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,280
They can give you an answer and then sort of backtrack and

417
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
figure out why that answer is what it is.

418
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,280
And then the more you think about it, you might find, yeah,

419
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
I'm not that satisfied actually.

420
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
You know, my job isn't going that well.

421
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
I got passed up for promotion or whatever.

422
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,280
But I do think that people do have a sense of how their lives

423
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
are going.

424
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,280
And some people are very sort of self-aware and they're

425
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,280
constantly doing these analyses of, I mean, I'm one of those

426
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,280
people, what's right, what's wrong, what do I need to fix?

427
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,280
Other people I think are just kind of more, you know,

428
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
things are fine.

429
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
It's going well.

430
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,280
But I give the first person authority there.

431
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,280
I think that nobody can tell you that you're not happy because

432
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
they don't think your life is matching up to what they expect

433
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,280
from you or the reverse that, you know, you should be happy

434
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
because your life is so great.

435
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
If you're not feeling it, then clearly something that you

436
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,280
either expect or want or, you know, is not working out for you.

437
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Can we ask a question?

438
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Sure.

439
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,280
So do a lot of scientists measure non-conscious activity in

440
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
any way?

441
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
So the question here was, what's it?

442
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
You do, right?

443
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
Yeah.

444
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,280
So why are we saying that, why are we saying that, you know,

445
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,280
I understand one issue is the one of paternalism, you know,

446
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,280
but can I measure the fact that, can she measure the fact that

447
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,280
I don't see that thing read, I guess, in a certain way?

448
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
There are such things you can do, right?

449
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
The concept of happiness that becomes difficult.

450
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
No, no, no, I understand.

451
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
I understand.

452
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
But yeah, I mean, the answer to your questions.

453
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Yes.

454
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Okay.

455
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Wow.

456
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
Wow.

457
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
How do you...

458
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Yes.

459
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
Yes.

460
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Because there are very specific studies in both psychology

461
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,280
and neuroscience that show that you can see.

462
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,280
You can measure, for example, parts of the brain are responding

463
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,280
correctly, even when the person does not respond

464
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
behaviorally correctly.

465
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,280
You calibrate an instrument.

466
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,280
And you always have to do it by triangulation.

467
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,280
You know, this is wonderful simile in Willard, the Norman

468
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Klein's theory of science, about science being like a donkey

469
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,280
skin on a drum, you know, you make it taught so you can play the

470
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
drum.

471
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,280
And the places where the skin is fixed to the hoop are the

472
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
experimental data.

473
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,280
But science also tells you what's happening in between

474
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
by interpolating.

475
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,280
And in regard to subconscious things, you have to go by that

476
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
route.

477
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,280
I mean, we can't just put your finger literally or metaphorically

478
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
on it.

479
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
So it always takes...

480
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
You have to involve neuroscientists and computational

481
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,280
scientists who do the analysis of the data and brain

482
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
scientists and what not psychologists.

483
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
It's always a collective effort.

484
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
That's science.

485
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:44,280
I wanted to go back to this issue of stress and anxiety

486
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
and happiness.

487
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Obviously, happiness is a different feeling from, let's say,

488
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
anxiety.

489
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,280
But is it possible to be happy if you are under stress or you

490
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,280
have a lot of anxiety?

491
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Well, I think it's obviously an empirical question.

492
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,280
I guess I would say yes, but you are easier to be happy without

493
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
stress and anxiety.

494
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Because it seems to me many of the things you were talking about

495
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,280
economically have to do with things that diminish people's

496
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
stress.

497
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,280
So that would imply, and I think what Wendy is saying in terms of

498
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:25,280
her work with exercise is that exercise decreases stress and

499
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,280
therefore can contribute to happiness.

500
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Well, to some way, well, for income to be

501
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
diminished stress.

502
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
In terms of security.

503
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Yeah.

504
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,280
So in that sense, yes.

505
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,280
But the question, can you say that somebody who is very

506
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,280
anxious is happy, it's difficult to define because happiness here

507
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
still is a relative concept.

508
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
So what does it mean happy?

509
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,280
If you are saying, can, so if you reformulate the question

510
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,280
saying, can somebody weed that specific level or that you just

511
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,280
level of anxiety, can be happy five?

512
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
I don't know.

513
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
We can go and measure.

514
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
I'm sure there are some people.

515
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,280
You shouldn't say, but it can be happy unfortunately the

516
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,280
literature can't be defined because we just define them.

517
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,280
We just measure in a scale from one to five or one to ten or

518
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
whoever we measure it.

519
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,280
So unless you define a cutoff, it's very hard to say, can somebody

520
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,280
receive this problem, psychological problem be happy?

521
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,280
So I had a comment and a question on your initial kind of

522
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,280
concern about how do we talk about happiness.

523
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,280
One of the things that makes me happy is that the research that

524
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,280
I do on exercise and meditation is helping to define things that

525
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,280
increase people's mood, that protects their brain from

526
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,280
degenerative damage of stress.

527
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:04,280
And yes, it puts mood up and that's one measure of happiness.

528
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:11,280
But you express some discontent with studies that have been

529
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,280
done and what should we be doing more to what can we do more to

530
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,280
help these numbers in the United States go up of happiness?

531
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,280
To some terms of both of those questions, you pose the

532
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,280
question, how do we make people happier?

533
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,280
The research that I've done, which isn't paid for by anybody

534
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,280
except the University of Notre Dame, it can give you very

535
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,280
clear prescriptions on how to make, I've mentioned them

536
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
already.

537
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,280
We want to make our country or the world a happier place and do

538
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,280
it in a broad systematic way.

539
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,280
We can't, it's hard to make people exercise, it's hard to

540
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,280
make people meditate or keep gratitude journals, right?

541
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,280
We probably want to legislate those things.

542
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,280
We can legislate a higher minimum wage, we can legislate

543
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,280
getting rid of right to work laws, we can have a more

544
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,280
generous welfare state, we can do all kinds of things which would

545
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280
move the United States at least towards Denmark.

546
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,280
The right to work law, this expression became tainted because

547
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,280
of course now it's associated with union busting and that

548
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,280
statistic just out which shows that in states with those so-called

549
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,280
right to work laws, the average income is much lower

550
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
significantly.

551
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
And so it's happiness.

552
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,280
Exactly.

553
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Yeah.

554
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,280
So.

555
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,280
I would still be worried about the causal argument, if you

556
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,280
think I may say.

557
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,280
So these are correlations, there are so many things moving

558
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
at home.

559
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,280
There are causal studies, there are studies on giving cash donations

560
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,280
to people in the so-called third world.

561
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
So these are small things of course.

562
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,280
Johannes Halswofer, there are serious states.

563
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,280
I have no doubt about the cash transfers, that's a very

564
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,280
different issue from social security which I'm all in

565
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
favor of.

566
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
It's a whole different story.

567
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,280
There are amount of things that move with social security,

568
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
the understanding, so it's huge.

569
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:06,280
So one thing is to give cash to kids and all sorts of things

570
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,280
increase, happiness increase, the drinking of the father

571
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,280
increase, by the way typically in those studies the father is

572
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
not the mother's.

573
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,280
You keep it to the mother's because the father's drinking.

574
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,280
And they're happy, of sure by the way.

575
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,280
So I'm not saying that I don't buy.

576
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
How long are you going to start?

577
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Completely in favor, I would just, you know, as a academic stress

578
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,280
aspect, that it's very easy to do the causal arguments here

579
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,280
in particular because they make sense, in particular because

580
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,280
we all tend, many of us tend to think that, you know,

581
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,280
social security is a good thing.

582
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,280
We can imagine easily how we'd be happier in a place with more

583
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,280
security in a place with less security.

584
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,280
We don't always account for the costs of these issues in our

585
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
argument.

586
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,280
So the point I'm trying to make is it's easy to do this.

587
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,280
The same argument says make sure that nobody has kids.

588
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,280
I'm not sure you want to do that.

589
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,280
The causal argument, no, I did the kid's argument.

590
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,280
I did the example before exactly because of this because the

591
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,280
causal argument is difficult now.

592
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,280
No, you actually get very close to hearing at least that the wrong

593
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
people shouldn't have kids.

594
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,280
We are this close to hearing that on the national TV.

595
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,280
So don't put that up as a joke because it's not a joking matter

596
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
anymore.

597
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
It used to be a joking matter maybe 30 years ago.

598
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
It's not a joking matter.

599
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
Right, I'm not sure.

600
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,280
But in any case, that's obviously not the sense in which I meant it.

601
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:52,280
It's an example about not using causal arguments when you don't

602
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:58,280
have causal studies, especially in situations of this sort where

603
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:04,280
people are not able to do that.

604
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,280
At least between outside of the people you have in mind now,

605
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,280
at least between reasonable people, we all tend to be on the same

606
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,280
side, which is all social security.

607
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,280
So that's just what I'm saying.

608
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,280
Just a word of caution.

609
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:27,280
There is no neuroscientific way of measuring that.

610
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
I wish I was.

611
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,280
But you know, MRI studies are happy people versus not.

612
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,280
Well, you know, people have approached it.

613
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,280
There are the studies of people that have couples that are in

614
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
deep love.

615
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,280
They just fell in love with what's happening to their brain.

616
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,280
But that just shows all the reward centers get activated.

617
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
Your motivational centers get activated.

618
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,280
That doesn't help you define happiness itself.

619
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,280
So we're still at the same point we were at the beginning here.

620
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
How do you define happiness?

621
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,280
Coming back to the point you raised with the sort of

622
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,280
tangentially, would we want anybody else to be able to tell us

623
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,280
whether we're happy or not?

624
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,280
I think we're all in agreement quite that, right?

625
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,280
So we would want to resist some kind of external standard.

626
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:21,280
I think I was getting at something a little different from that.

627
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,280
Let me give you a composite clinical example.

628
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
A psychoanalytically speaking.

629
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,280
A wife insists that her husband come for a consultation because

630
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,280
she thinks he's unhappy.

631
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,280
So this may be a maternalistic attitude here.

632
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,280
And he comes in and he says, I'm perfectly happy.

633
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
I don't have any problems.

634
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,280
And over the course of the consultations, he's complaining

635
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,280
about this, he's complaining about that.

636
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,280
And he doesn't connect it with any sense that he's unhappy.

637
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,280
The consultation continues and you discover something about a

638
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,280
parent who was chronically depressed and unhappy all the time.

639
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,280
The wife's pain?

640
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,280
No, the pay...

641
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
That's right.

642
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,280
Obviously that...

643
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,280
That was good.

644
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
They also...

645
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,280
So, you know, the question was, was there something that didn't allow

646
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,280
this man to recognize how unhappy he was that it was such a dangerous

647
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,280
identification with an impaired parent?

648
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,280
So, it's not about things like a red shirt because, you know, for most

649
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,280
people, a red shirt is not a conflictual issue.

650
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,280
But when something is more deeply conflictual, what can you say

651
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,280
about the degree of veracity of someone's self-report?

652
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
I mean, I don't have the answers to that, but I think it's something

653
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
worth thinking about.

654
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,280
That's exactly how I reacted to the imagining of no question

655
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,280
of state in neuroscience, because, I mean, of course, there are other

656
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,280
methods you can go with psychoanalysis, but the whole point is

657
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
exactly this, which is...

658
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,280
It doesn't seem so obvious to me that the only thing you can look at

659
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,280
are the conscious states, that the only thing you should measure is

660
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,280
how happy people to tell you they are, because there's all sorts of

661
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
other things.

662
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
People might hide it, might...

663
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Exactly.

664
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:16,280
So, it'd be, in general, important to try and, you know, again,

665
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:22,280
this goes back to theorizing, trying to understand various

666
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,280
aspects of, you know, components, theoretically, components of

667
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:31,280
happiness, so that you can hopefully try and measure them,

668
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
measure them separately, right?

669
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
So...

670
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,280
But I think what you're raising to just speaks to limitations of

671
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,280
polling people using that as the only measure, and you obviously

672
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,280
want to check that against some of the more objective measures that

673
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,280
are out there to see if, you know, people are reporting that they're so

674
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,280
happy, but their suicide rates are, you know, drastically increasing,

675
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,280
or, you know, because there is this sort of cross-cultural problems

676
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
with this, too, right?

677
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,280
That Western countries, where we fix it on happiness, we're very good at

678
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,280
reporting it, and we're constantly trying to brag about how happy we are.

679
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,280
Eastern countries where the suicide rates are lower, but they don't

680
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,280
have this fixation on individual happiness.

681
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
Just kind of here, because there's no...

682
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,280
You can define the suicide rate with the gutless single person, right?

683
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,280
So...

684
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,280
Yeah.

685
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
There's a bit of the...

686
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,280
But in other countries where they report happiness levels much lower.

687
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,280
That's exactly the issue with the aggregation, right?

688
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
Right.

689
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,280
And with regard to seeing red or not, or to being happy or not,

690
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,280
I think the level of his question was a single person,

691
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,280
what the person feels, not what the aggregate of our country is, right?

692
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
It sounds too...

693
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,280
But I think the same limitation applies, whether it's on a large level or a

694
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
small level.

695
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,280
The question is how much should we take people's word at happiness,

696
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,280
and if you were taught by your mother or your country that your

697
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,280
happiness doesn't matter, or that you should be so happy and you are so happy

698
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,280
and your life is so great, obviously that's going to be reflected in your

699
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
self-report.

700
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
Right.

701
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,280
And that's again why there's a limit to...

702
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,280
I mean, we theorize in philosophy about this stuff, but there's a limit to the

703
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,280
social scientific data, how good it is and which is why economists hate this

704
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
stuff.

705
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Makes sense, because it is sort of all over the place.

706
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,280
And some of these psychological studies are not well done and not...

707
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,280
That's why it has to be cross-disciplinary effort.

708
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,280
That's the neuroscientist, psychologist, computer scientist,

709
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,280
political scientist, psychoanalysts.

710
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,280
So we have...

711
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,280
Everyone at this table with me is exactly yes.

712
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:29,280
You want to go to the question?

713
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Please line up and state your name and come on up to the microphone here,

714
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:44,280
line up and please keep your statements in the form of a question.

715
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Thank you.

716
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Hi, my name is Catherine.

717
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:57,280
Can more be said about the happiness of women in the 50s?

718
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:06,280
And does it conflict with the idea that children are not a source of happiness?

719
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:11,280
Some total of what I know is that there's a general pattern.

720
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,280
A bunch of articles recently asking the question, why is the happiness advantage

721
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
of women disappearing?

722
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
So you see all kinds of data over time.

723
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,280
In the 80s, women were clearly happier than men now on average.

724
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
It's just a little bit happier.

725
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,280
Why that is, I don't know, I'll leave that to someone else.

726
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,280
But that's the basic trend, which I think everybody agrees on.

727
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,280
I think my understanding of some of it, and it speaks to...

728
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,280
I mean, in the 80s, our wage differential was even greater.

729
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
Now we're making...

730
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I mean, we're still 70 or 80 cents to the man, but it's clearly better.

731
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,280
So a lot of the trends for women in the object of men are clearly better.

732
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
Men are doing more in the house.

733
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Men are helping out more.

734
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Why are we getting less happy?

735
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,280
And I think some of the data I've seen is, again, it's partly expectations that girls today grow up.

736
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
Being told, you can do whatever you want.

737
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
You're equal to men.

738
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Yet we still don't make the same money.

739
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,280
And clearly, there are so many signs that it's not that way.

740
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,280
And then I think the other problem that keeps women back and doesn't keep men back

741
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,280
is the whole managing of work, life, and more women work now.

742
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
And the fact that you have to balance these two things,

743
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,280
and American corporations do nothing to help us, we're very little.

744
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,280
I mean, some do some things, but it's not enough.

745
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,280
And I think that women feel the stress much more than men, even men who are about.

746
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
And I think women still...

747
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
The studies that I've seen, again, women still do more in the house,

748
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
even though we all do much less overall.

749
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Women still do more for the kids, even though men contribute more.

750
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,280
And so I think that all of that affects our happiness.

751
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,280
Are there any studies being done on present day full-time homemakers,

752
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,280
women having children alone?

753
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,280
Probably, aren't they?

754
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,280
I'm not familiar with it.

755
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,280
I don't know that it is specific, but women are happier.

756
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Still, a little bit happier than men.

757
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,280
I mean, they were very happy.

758
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,280
They're still happier than men on it.

759
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:12,280
No, I think there's a lot of people...

760
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Of course, one of the reasons why this kind of literature is a problem

761
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
is that you tend to give the explanations that you like,

762
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
and you tend to go for course issues that you like.

763
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,280
So a very right-wing person would say women should be in the house,

764
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,280
they were in the house and they were happy.

765
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:37,280
I'm a very reasonable person, would say women thought they had to be in the house,

766
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,280
and so they were very happy because they had reached whatever.

767
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,280
They had told them it was their potential.

768
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:51,280
While now, of course, women have much more ambitious goals,

769
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,280
and it's true that they are taken back by society from achieving these goals.

770
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,280
So then, of course, then disconnect.

771
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,280
But very hard to...

772
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,280
How would children's happiness be infected by this?

773
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,280
Are there changes, like a mother's happiness?

774
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,280
I don't know if anybody knows.

775
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,280
I've never seen any study correlating the happiness of mothers or fathers with the kids.

776
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,280
That is actually a very good point that I hope somebody is done,

777
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,280
but I don't know what they're doing.

778
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Thank you.

779
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,280
I'm sorry, on that point, I don't know any specific studies either,

780
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,280
but there is a lot of work done on network analysis

781
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,280
where you can connect my happiness to the people that I know and the people that they know.

782
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,280
So you can find out that the example in the article was that your happiness will go down

783
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,280
if you have a friend who has a friend who's unhappy.

784
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,280
So I imagine the relationships between children and mothers and other people are quite strong.

785
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Great, thank you.

786
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,280
My name is Sharon.

787
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Happiness is a choice.

788
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,280
It actually can be a learned skill.

789
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:05,280
What can be done to help teach people how they can be happy?

790
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,280
For instance, everyone here is a victim of all sorts of horrible things,

791
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,280
and everyone here is also in the recipient of some very nice things

792
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,280
where you choose to put your focus, determines how happy it will be.

793
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,280
I think a lot of people can learn the skill of happiness,

794
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,280
and I think it also is very much tied to gratitude.

795
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:36,280
Is there any effort to teach people who are unhappy that they can be happier?

796
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
At a general level?

797
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
In a general level?

798
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
I think the answer is no.

799
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
I totally agree with you.

800
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,280
I think it is a large part of choice

801
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,280
and how you view all the great things that have come

802
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,280
versus all the difficult things that have come

803
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,280
really helps define how you are dealing with your life stress.

804
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:02,280
I think that it would be great if we added this component to education.

805
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
It's not a radical view.

806
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,280
It's a way of looking at the world, and I agree with you.

807
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
I think it would be better.

808
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
But is it done?

809
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
No.

810
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,280
I think it's a very important answer that you are giving with the proportion of variance,

811
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,280
explained by personal traits versus choice traits.

812
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,280
I think we only have in our control maybe 10% of the variance.

813
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,280
With regard to being or not being happy, so to a large part, like I would say,

814
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,280
90% you are incorrect in your assumption that it's all up to us.

815
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
Who is us?

816
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,280
You are your physical body.

817
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,280
What you are is your physical body.

818
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,280
The level of hormones circulating in your blood right now

819
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,280
determined to a certain extent your perception.

820
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,280
The working of your brain cells determined to a certain extent your perception.

821
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,280
Nobody is there apart from your body.

822
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
But you can't.

823
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Once we realize that, once we realize that, we will get to a place where we should be able to devise better interventions.

824
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,280
As opposed to coasting on this wave of imagined freedom,

825
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,280
we are not free to the extent that you are assuming.

826
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:19,280
But the studies of mindset and psychology have shown how strongly our ideas about how we view the world,

827
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:26,280
how we view what we've eaten or how much exercise the placebo effect really affect our physiology.

828
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
It's the mind, body connection.

829
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,280
So I think that's how I interpret your question and that's how I answered in terms of yes,

830
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:42,280
there's growing evidence that there is a strong link and if we can influence mindset in the way that psychology studies have been done,

831
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:51,280
then we do have a very powerful way to be able to help people deal with unhappiness to get towards more happiness.

832
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,280
That's my question.

833
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Can I have a quick point?

834
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,280
There's this whole field of positive psychology that takes up exactly what you're saying.

835
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,280
Train yourself to be happy regardless of the circumstances of your life.

836
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
Obviously that's a good thing to do. You mentioned gratitude.

837
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:10,280
There's all kinds of evidence that keeping gratitude, journals and focusing on gratitude, all that stuff really does make people happier.

838
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:16,280
So you can find lots of self-help books on doing that which are not complete psychobabble.

839
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,280
But I think the main point comes back to where does happiness ultimately come from?

840
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Some scholars want to think that it's purely an internal mental process and the way you are describing,

841
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,280
that you can make yourself happy if you just know how to or try.

842
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,280
But I think most of us think that happiness is primarily due to things that happen to you

843
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,280
and the circumstances of your life which are beyond your control.

844
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,280
If you live in Aleppo, you're not going to be very happy.

845
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
If you're a quadriplegic, you're not going to be very happy.

846
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,280
If you're poor in the United States, you're not going to be very happy.

847
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,280
And I think that those people can also learn to be happy.

848
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
To some point, I agree.

849
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,280
I acknowledge biochemical issues that do happen for some people.

850
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
But yes, I...

851
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,280
It's a good question.

852
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:08,280
Hi. My question is about how your view on happiness change through the spiritual lens.

853
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,280
For instance, you talk about happiness as relative to other people, as transient.

854
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,280
Today you have a house. Tomorrow your neighbor has a bigger house so your happiness is gone.

855
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,280
I doubt that will stay when you study about happiness amongst the monks, about amongst the priest.

856
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,280
There must be something changed when you look at happiness through the spiritual lens.

857
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,280
So we'd love to hear what you're thinking about that.

858
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,280
Are you just people out happy?

859
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,280
That's just everywhere.

860
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,280
So what can we learn about happiness?

861
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,280
I don't know. I would...

862
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,280
I would think it's not.

863
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,280
I would go back to the kids again. I'm not sure.

864
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
No, I wouldn't go back to the kids.

865
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
But they're just people that are happy.

866
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:55,280
I would go back to mindset that the monks and spiritual people have a particular mindset that I don't care whether I have a big house.

867
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:02,280
I have a belief in something that is beautiful and that helps me get through whatever comes.

868
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,280
I think that is mindset when psychologists are starting to suffer.

869
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
Why they call it the Opium for the masses.

870
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,280
What?

871
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,280
That's why they call it the Opium for the masses.

872
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,280
That's right. That's right.

873
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,280
And there's definitely truth to that.

874
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,280
People on Opium are happier too.

875
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,280
I'm not joking.

876
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,280
Actually, it's obvious to me too.

877
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:27,280
So the view that happiness is relative and that happiness is transient.

878
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,280
It's only true in the practical lens when you apply the spiritual lens.

879
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,280
Those criteria are attributes are not applied.

880
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,280
But you can't eat spiritualism or you can't eat faith.

881
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,280
Most of us are going to have our lives determined by the extent to which our needs as human animals are met.

882
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,280
And monks may be very commendable and great role models, precisely because they can get past that.

883
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,280
But 99.99% of people will never be monks.

884
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,280
So I admire what you're saying and agree with you.

885
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,280
But I think as a political scientist, I think how to help the world, making us all monks is infeasible.

886
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:19,280
There is a sense in which you can think of the question a different way, which is we typically think again in terms of linear regressions where you take somebody whose religious are the things equally happier.

887
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,280
But then between religious people, the rich guys are happier than the poor guy, he would say the equation.

888
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,280
Now, if that's not the case, if there are nonlinearities there, I don't know that people have looked at that.

889
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
But that's kind of interesting.

890
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:43,280
What she's saying is that if you are religious, how much condition of the fact that you're a region, the wealth or income or other variables enter less strongly.

891
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,280
And that might be true. I actually don't know that that's true.

892
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,280
Yeah.

893
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,280
Thank you.

894
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
Hi.

895
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,280
Hello.

896
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,280
My name is Yolanda Merchant.

897
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,280
I'm an artist.

898
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,280
And I'm going to somewhat pierce your bubble altogether.

899
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:08,280
Because according to the Dalai Lama, we are born with a disposition.

900
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:22,280
And like fish, we're born either with a, I would use the word happy or content disposition or a miserable disposition.

901
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:34,280
And the way that he reflects on that is someone who goes to a terrible tragedy with a more positive disposition,

902
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:40,280
reverts back to that fairly quickly, even though it could be jail time.

903
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:47,280
You know, I don't know if he talks about the Holocaust, but something quite devastating.

904
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:57,280
So I guess my question is, you know, if that's a given that we have a certain mindset, we have very little control over that.

905
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:04,280
Although I agree with, you know, meditation and prayer and other ways to bring peace and calm.

906
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:16,280
My second reflection on what you're talking about is with regard to the wife that thinks her husband is unhappy or they're all these circumstances.

907
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:22,280
That would, you know, reflect that he should be a very unhappy person.

908
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,280
I guess reverting back to the philosophy of meditation.

909
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:35,280
If you live in the moment, if you wake up and you're happy in your being because you're having a nice coffee, you know, happens to be a pleasant day.

910
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,280
You happen to live in New York City.

911
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:51,280
You know, that's where you are at that moment. And reflecting on it is, you know, you may feel well within your body and within yourself.

912
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,280
To have other people impose or project, you know, you should be a millionaire.

913
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,280
You, you know, should be traveling to whatever Venice.

914
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:11,280
Those are other people imposing their reality or as people who meditate, you know, say that's projecting.

915
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,280
So you're not really being in the moment. You're absorbing the moment.

916
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:25,280
So to my popping the bubble and also to other people imposing their definition of content or happiness.

917
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:31,280
I thought we all agreed that that's the one thing we all agreed about that we shouldn't do.

918
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,280
What was that? I'm sorry.

919
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:43,280
I'm sorry. At one point in the conversation, I asked everyone to agree that the one thing we all agreed about was that we shouldn't be imposing our idea of happiness on other people.

920
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,280
That there's no external standard by which to judge happiness.

921
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,280
Right.

922
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:55,280
Just two points about what you said. And I could correct me if I'm wrong, but I think New Yorkers of the moment, the least happiest in the nation.

923
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,280
I think we're like 49 out of 50 New York, New Jersey and Connecticut with the bottom three typically.

924
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,280
So we're actually less happy here than everywhere else in the country.

925
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,280
I don't know. It changes.

926
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,280
So we, I think we only beat New Jersey actually. I think Connecticut beats us.

927
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:19,280
And to your point about, again, my understanding is that we have this polyana complex.

928
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,280
So we typically as a whole actually see our lives as better than they are. And all of this sort of biases we have.

929
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,280
We view ourselves as better, smarter, better drivers than in reality we actually are.

930
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:37,280
So most, it's hardwired in. It's not something that, you know, so most people have a disposition to be optimistic, not pessimistic,

931
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,280
contrary to what they may say or what you may think. It's not the case.

932
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,280
We're actually as a whole are fairly resilient, very resilient actually.

933
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:50,280
We recover very nicely from a lot of, you know, things and adversities and whatnot.

934
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:56,280
And we actually are optimistic about things more so than.

935
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,280
Any feedback on the Dalai Lama?

936
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,280
Yeah, he's wrong. I'm very sorry, but he's just wrong.

937
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:11,280
It's not true. It's not true that, so let me,

938
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,280
let me be a little bit clear on what I meant.

939
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:22,280
So I think it's correct that there are individual effects so that, you know, I might be on average.

940
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,280
Other things equal, less happy than you are.

941
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,280
If that's the statement that I'm sure it's correct.

942
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:37,280
It is not correct that I will stay at this level more or less along my life independent on what happens.

943
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,280
That's not correct.

944
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:48,280
So I might always be, I might be incredibly richer than she is, but, and always less happy because I have a disposition to be less happy.

945
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:54,280
That's okay, but be much happier than I would be not being rich or not being, or being stressed or anything.

946
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,280
Of course psychological research, tons of psychological research on this.

947
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,280
Sonia Lubomirsky is the first name he is.

948
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:07,280
She's one of the many who shows that people have a set level for happiness.

949
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:20,280
And then the so-called hedonic treadmill that you run up, up, up, and don't get anywhere sees to eat that you, if you get an up, a boost, the boost is temporary, and you return to your set level.

950
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:27,280
Well, I understand that these would mean that everything we've spoken about today is completely irrelevant because there would be no variation on their size.

951
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,280
No, yes, that's exactly what it means.

952
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,280
With regard to the set level, there is a certain range of possible variation.

953
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,280
So there is an individual effect, and that's it, that's the whole point.

954
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:43,280
There is an individual effect, of course there is an individual effect, but outside effects have an effect on happiness.

955
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:51,280
But I think the light on actually was correct in assessing the percentage where the set point is and how much intervention people are.

956
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,280
Oh, that might be.

957
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,280
There are individual effects, I don't, I'm not saying anything.

958
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,280
I'm just saying it's not true that, you know, these effects are, the other effects are transitory, it's just not.

959
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:11,280
At least if we trust our measurement now, you know, you might have a different definition of happiness, I don't have a different definition of happiness, but if we stay with the definition of happiness we have, that's not true, right?

960
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,280
That's not the case.

961
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,280
Sorry.

962
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,280
That's going to save time.

963
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:25,280
I'm baddie, usually I am not comfortable speaking in front of a group, but I couldn't resist.

964
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:34,280
I am a woman of the 50s.

965
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:40,280
I do have some comments.

966
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:45,280
Number one, we didn't know how we felt.

967
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,280
We really, no one cared, and to my knowledge, no one ever asked.

968
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:57,280
And I was part of the generation of IBM, I've been moved.

969
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:03,280
Husbands would make a decision, come home and tell his wife.

970
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,280
Companies would say how to approach it in talking to your wife.

971
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:18,280
You could live two years in one place, travel to a state halfway across the country, maybe three years.

972
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:42,280
And the men today, and I have sons and five grand sons, and a lot of what they do now with their wives has to do with their mothers, who didn't, a husband who didn't know how to turn on the washing machine, whose mother had ironed his under shorts,

973
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:54,280
who never ironed, who would travel, come home, set standards or null and void, something that had happened with one of the children.

974
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:11,280
So I do know, and when we talked, we talked to each other, and we were reading books, Gloria Steinem, and then, and I thought, usually I wouldn't say this, a book that a woman wrote about reading your husband,

975
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,280
or a new or with whipped cream on you.

976
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,280
I tell you, we didn't know where we stood.

977
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,280
So that's my comment.

978
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:51,280
I'm Woody Walther, I'm a psychoanalyst, and my comments have to do both with the clinical work that we do, and whether or not we enhance our patient's happiness, a pretty key issue that

979
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,280
this has been more macro happiness, you might say, and less micro.

980
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:19,280
And I think that it's interesting that some research on dynamic therapy, especially done by Leborski in Philadelphia, showed that when people went through psychotherapy, there was an increased balance of positive experiences that they had, as opposed to negative ones.

981
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:30,280
And you mentioned the reward center, and the connection between reward centers and happiness, and it does seem reasonable to think about that.

982
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:48,280
The other thing that's related to that, two other things that I'd be interested in, you guys, comments, is the role of meaningful life, and what your goals are, and how much that seems to have to do with people's lives.

983
00:54:48,280 --> 00:55:02,280
And the related thing is unconscious issues versus consciousness, which is what we deal with every day in the office.

984
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:15,280
There's the whole group called the Mount Zion Research Group out in San Francisco that studied the patient's unconscious plan when they come into treatment.

985
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,280
What is it that they are trying to resolve, and how do they bring it into the transference, and how do you work with it?

986
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:30,280
So there's quite a lot that has a very clinical aspect, it seems to me, that we want to think about more.

987
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:35,280
Can I ask you, are you trying to make your patients happier?

988
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,280
What part of your goal for the patients that you see is to make them happier?

989
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:50,280
Actually, I think it's a great question. I personally believe that if you want to have a practice, you bloody better way of trying to make your patients happier.

990
00:55:50,280 --> 00:56:07,280
So I think that it's a central issue to what is it that's making them unhappy, to clarify that, to help them to clarify it, and to do something that used to be sort of foreboding, to give advice even,

991
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:20,280
to say, if you're afraid to do X, Y, and C to get to this goal that you would really like to get to, and we need to clarify what keeps you from trying.

992
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:28,280
I had a patient just this week where the issue is his father hadn't done that well.

993
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:44,280
So every time he started to really do well, and he's a very gifted guy, he had to find some excuse to get away from the potential success, because it made him feel bad to separate himself from his father who was actually unhappy.

994
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:50,280
So, can I comment on that?

995
00:56:50,280 --> 00:57:08,280
My wife, I'm very, very happy to be married to a psychotherapist, and she reports that about half of the clients that come the first session, she makes a point of asking them, what would you like to see the end of this process, and they say we want to be happier, I want to be happier.

996
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:13,280
Nice to say. How can I help you?

997
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:29,280
Hi, Michael. I love the subject so much for that for the past couple of years, a couple of times a month, I run a happiness discussion group with all people who want to discuss all things happening. So that's happening right after this.

998
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:46,280
If those want to talk on that, and my question is about the whole study and talk of your happiness being a function of the five people you spend the most time with, of the five people you kind of keep in mind the most.

999
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:59,280
I'm wondering if people on the panel had any thoughts on that particular study or anything having to do with that.

1000
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:05,280
Those are difficult things to do because there's a selection problem.

1001
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,280
So, you choose the five people you spend time with.

1002
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:21,280
So, do you choose happy people because you're happy or do you choose unhappy or are you happy and unhappy people make you unhappy. So these are things that are essentially impossible to identify.

1003
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,280
So, very hard.

1004
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,280
Any other thoughts?

1005
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,280
Ideas about that particular.

1006
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:48,280
Okay, and just as like a final comment, the lady in red that brought up spirituality, I guess my my thought on spirituality, I think it's your ability to create sensitivities arises which allows you to be more in touch with subtleties and sub subtleties, which allows you to have a more

1007
00:58:48,280 --> 00:59:01,280
wider spectrum of feelings, thoughts, ideas, open-mindedness, and the results of all this is connectedness with all things. So I think there is a lot of value in spirituality.

1008
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,280
Thank you.

1009
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,280
Thank you very much.

1010
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:25,280
I have a question and it's about meaningfulness in life and to have to lead no life. It's not extraordinary but meaningful to you and about the women in the 50s. I'm the class of 50, went Stanford about a five-day key and was very

1011
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:42,280
difficult. It was a difficult life and I woke up going to it. My husband committed suicide after we divorced but got into real trouble and I was very naive, did not know many things. But I want to know, my mother would always say, I don't know why you're unhappy and this is for the

1012
00:59:42,280 --> 01:00:05,280
gentleman from Italy and then I married the lawyer who was from Italy. This was a big mistake. I went from one extreme. I went from one extreme to the other, one that was very dismissive but my mother would always say, but he doesn't go out with other women and he doesn't drink. I was so lucky.

1013
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:15,280
I'm just wondering how can we recognize the fact that all of our lives should have meaning no matter whether we come.

1014
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:26,280
I'm sorry. No matter whether we come very ambitious or very laid back or whatever our nature. I don't know who talked about nature but I thought that was a very interesting thing to contemplate.

1015
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:46,280
But I don't know, was it here to Mr. Nazarian or Dr. Nazarian that we said there were cultures that there was no such word as happiness. Was that here or was it not here? But it was a seminar and there was no such word as anyway.

1016
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:59,280
And I guess that's it. Thank you very much. Can I make one little comment? There's a great book by a historian named Darren McMahon who talks about the history of happiness.

1017
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:12,280
History of happiness. History of happiness. That's the name of his book I think. One of the things that he stresses which has always been on my mind too is that happiness is a post enlightenment construct in some ways.

1018
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:23,280
People like Aristotle talk about happiness but he didn't think any of us were going to be it. I think the blurb for this presentation began with only the only happy man is a dead man.

1019
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:35,280
So there's a lot of reason to believe that what we think of as happiness involving choice and someone in our lives are lives being motivated by the pursuit of happiness is the result of the enlightenment, the French Revolution, the American Revolution,

1020
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:46,280
and that fundamentally as weird as it may sound the people before us may not have had a word for happiness but it wasn't part of what they expected from their lives.

1021
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:55,280
Happiness is what you got maybe when you were dead but they didn't have the privilege living subsistence lives and stuff like that.

1022
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:07,280
Even a subsistence culture where people were very poor but they all had a role and they all had a sense of satisfaction in playing that role.

1023
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,280
Possibly they certainly had a role but that's exactly the whole role they didn't have any choice.

1024
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,280
They didn't see it. Oh they didn't have a choice you're right.

1025
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:26,280
Well there's a book I'm reading now and it's called Why Philosophy Never Goes Away.

1026
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:30,280
And it's written by Rebecca Newberger Goldstein. Why Philosophy Never Goes Away.

1027
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:39,280
And it's very interesting is why were they happy and what made them miserable and what made us miserable that they accepted.

1028
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:49,280
And we just want to be happy but you know confusing but if you could talk about that.

1029
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,280
I'm Alex. It's a really excellent conversation today.

1030
01:02:54,280 --> 01:03:06,280
I'm really grateful and surprised that the social and macro elements of happiness were discussed so thoroughly and deeply.

1031
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:20,280
A complicated issue that I find myself running into is in whatever rebel rousing or radicalizing or addressing the political crises of our times I find myself in the thick of.

1032
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:32,280
You know concerning myself with the happiness of the population seeing the extent to which institutions that are poorly thought out and to the benefit of a few decrease the happiness of so many.

1033
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:36,280
And I find myself becoming unhappy when I think about all these things.

1034
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:41,280
And I think that this is often a distillama that people face. They're like okay so I know there's all this bad news out there.

1035
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:58,280
I know that there are actually steps to take and groups to join and solidarity to express and realize how do people work through that specific dilemma of being an individual in the midst of a world that needs institutional change to actually increase everyone's happiness.

1036
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:08,280
Knowing that all of our happiness is connected but also having to be happy enough myself that I'll actually be a good instrument raising all that happiness.

1037
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,280
Any of your reflections on that would be welcome.

1038
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:22,280
When I give talks on happiness people always ask me what's so great about being happy or are we losing only a fool wants to be happy or only the selfish want to be happy.

1039
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:30,280
For the reasons you just described that I guess the question I always asked back to them was was Gandhi unhappy into the Dalai Lama unhappy.

1040
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:35,280
But obviously people deeply committed to social change and the welfare of others but where they.

1041
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:51,280
Does that mean you have to be miserable. I mean I guess I hope at least that those people are exemplars of how we can be committed to making the world a better place and and worry about other people but at the same time leaving lives that we find not only meaningful but happy.

1042
01:04:51,280 --> 01:05:11,280
As many as that is one that shows that when you are altruistic and give something to others that's one of the easiest ways to activate your own reward system and you have to think especially in life or comment that that might be an evolutionarily developed kind of kind of response.

1043
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:22,280
So give to others and that might make you feel happy and help everybody else at the same time.

1044
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:29,280
My name is Charles Markovski. I'm a psychiatrist and I'm very happy I'm here today.

1045
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:44,280
Most stimulating conversation. What I'm struck by is the absence of discussion of depression which seems to me is the opposite number of happiness.

1046
01:05:44,280 --> 01:06:01,280
And as a clinician it's at least been my experience that overwhelmingly the work I do deals with people suffering with depression. Many of whom are actually not cognizant on the fact that they have depression.

1047
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:23,280
It's presents in a myriad of ways very often hidden from the patient themselves. And what I want to ask is how you would integrate the fact that some of the people who suffer with depression cannot fight their way out of it no matter how they try.

1048
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:33,280
And that somatic treatments particularly medications are become relevant to the treatment and to the management of their happiness or lack of it.

1049
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:42,280
And I just wonder if how that sort of fits with your thinking as up to now.

1050
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:57,280
I just answered the wrong question. I don't quite buy the distinction but to a certain extent one can speak about the body versus the processes that make use of it.

1051
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:17,280
It still depends on it completely. And certain disorders are just too deep to be as I'm sure you know you just said that much to be amenable to an intervention merely by talk. I mean it's a miracle in some sense that the talk saying cognitive behavioral setting can get you as far as it can.

1052
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:31,280
It's fantastic. Think of it. You know you someone reaches down inside your brain or you yourself do so and change things change the electrical impulses in the chemical balance because it's all about this.

1053
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:38,280
As I said before I'll say it again. It's nothing beyond the chemical balance and the electrical impulses. That's what you are.

1054
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:53,280
And so to some extent you can change that from the outside by talk. I mean right now I'm causing immediate early gene expression in your brain. I mean genes get some get transcribed others do not because I talk to you so I'm making changes in your brain.

1055
01:07:53,280 --> 01:08:03,280
I know I can only reach luckily for you. I can only reach this far not farther for some of the things in the psychiatry school prescribed for you something more serious than just talk.

1056
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:19,280
I think it depends on the value of unhappiness. I think there's some interesting research on this by psychiatrists who feel that we are over medicating people that it's too quick of a solution to say oh you're not happy let's give you some you know prozac or whatever the drug of choice is

1057
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:36,280
and well but so I think it depends on the cause of you know are you talking about somebody who's clinically depressed who clearly it's not related to the conditions of their life. It's you know postpartum depression it's something that is clearly uni medication but that's not everybody who's on medication today.

1058
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:48,280
In fact it's not even the majority right because the rates of I mean the rates they show of you know the people suffering from clinical depression have remained road to end schizophrenia and these other diseases that require these heavy duty drugs.

1059
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:52,280
Have remained relatively stable yet the drug doesn't correlate at all.

1060
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:59,280
Siric polemies other really serious drugs are being prescribed to people who are saying well I have a little trouble sleeping I'm not you know I'm not feeling so great.

1061
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,280
Oh let's get you on some medication.

1062
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:07,280
Social problem that's like you know like the army answering 911 call which is what happening in our cities right.

1063
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:12,280
You should I mean the first line of defense should be psychotherapists who talks to you know the psychiatrist prescribed drugs.

1064
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:20,280
Exactly and they show that the combination of both is obviously more effective than you know for for some people it's you know they need the talk therapy even if they need the drugs.

1065
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:31,280
So I mean there's a case that I remember reading about in one of these where they were and they were there's a whole study now of the evolutionary benefits of depression again not that sort of pathological clinical depression but the idea that when you

1066
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:43,280
ruminate on your problems and you pull away from pleasurable you're not experiencing pleasure so you're not with your friends you're not having sex you're not eating you're focusing on your problems and you're solving them better than if you were getting pleasure out of these things

1067
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:52,280
so they're clearly evolutionary benefits to not being happy with your life at the moment which force you to reexamine reevaluate and figure out what's wrong.

1068
01:09:52,280 --> 01:10:03,280
There was a case that in one of these articles by one of these psychiatrists of a patient of his who was on you know was doing very well on antidepressants and then finally came back to him and said I want to go off the antidepressants

1069
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:12,280
and he said oh but they're working well for you know what what's what's the problem and she said the problem she goes are you are you they're not working or are you are you not happy anymore.

1070
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:21,280
And she said no she said the reason I want to go off of them is because I feel fine but I'm still married to the same alcoholic SOP and I realize that it's not that my problem.

1071
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:30,280
It's my life problem and although I feel fine I'm not happy that I feel fine and I want to go off the medication in order to fix my life.

1072
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:42,280
So I just want to make one quick point I think clearly there's over treatment with drugs but there's under diagnosis of depression so that's sort of a curious paradox.

1073
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:56,280
And a quick point in agreement there's over treatment but under diagnosis and if we're going to treat depression or happiness or in that sense as a social problem as opposed to something that only the privileged are privileged to.

1074
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:05,280
We have to begin with a healthcare system that provides everybody with access which helps diagnose them and helps them get treatment so sorry.

1075
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:12,280
I have to check to.

1076
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,280
Hi I'm Samuel.

1077
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:26,280
I'm not really a speaker in front of crowds either but Betty gave me the inspiration so even though I'm not a woman from the 50s.

1078
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:47,280
I enjoyed this conversation very much. One of the things that one of the reasons why it didn't speak to me so much is because I'm a part of what I think is not an insignificant number of people in this class of young pretty well educated.

1079
01:11:47,280 --> 01:12:07,280
I don't have many real anxieties financial issues but still I don't have data to support this but I sense that there's still a great sense among sort of maybe my generation of a sense of like unfulfillment or emptiness.

1080
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:32,280
I think part of it has to do with to echo some of what psychotherapist said but I'm not sure what it really means to pursue a meaningful life or how to choose to pursue a meaningful life but I'm not convinced that one of you said that a better work life balance

1081
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:46,280
would necessarily help. I'm not convinced that more time watching Netflix or prozing Facebook or lying on the beach would necessarily help that.

1082
01:12:46,280 --> 01:13:03,280
I think part of one of the flaws I think in this conversation is sort of this assumption or this methodology of if I achieve X then I'll be happy. And then the problem with happiness is we have to manage our expectations.

1083
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:27,280
If only X wasn't so great or you know we weren't on this in this paradox or this hedonic treadmill or whatever. And I think sort of this problem is probably exacerbated by social media and technology that sort of give us this same type of promise

1084
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:40,280
that you know if you look like this or if you buy this or if you have this then you'll be happier than you know because they're dictating what success means and what happiness should look like.

1085
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:56,280
So I guess if you have any thoughts on that I'm not sure exactly what my question or I guess if you want to pinpoint the question I guess it's you know do you think in the age of social media and this heavy heavy advertising and stuff like that

1086
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:01,280
the pursuit of happiness is even more difficult.

1087
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,280
I have a couple of kids you won't think about.

1088
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:13,280
There's a meaning for you. Yeah. I'm not being so good if you have kids you have meaning therefore you don't have time to worry about the lack of fulfillment that you just described.

1089
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,280
Right.

1090
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,280
Exactly.

1091
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:26,280
Thank you for your audience.

1092
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:39,280
Hi my name is Olga and thank you very much for very interesting conversation I have a lot of questions but I can even ask all of them.

1093
01:14:39,280 --> 01:15:04,280
For me it's very interesting why happiness became so big figure in American mythology like American freedom or democracy and for example in the Soviet Union we didn't talk about happiness at all we talked about meaning in life,

1094
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:15,280
meaningful life and the creating but a future but not happy future but a future.

1095
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:33,280
And it was different mythology and but what I would like to talk about I recently read about theories psychological theory by psychology professor.

1096
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,280
In Colorado June.

1097
01:15:38,280 --> 01:16:01,280
Grover she wrote an article missing the standing of positive thinking and what she is she comparing our mind with ecological system and talking about biodiversity and diversity of emotions.

1098
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:27,280
And she's saying that we know that in the physical ecosystem by diversity is healthy and important people can buy into that we know that biodiversity was just was just resistance to pathogens and invasive species.

1099
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:45,280
And that human mind may be not so different and that's it's important to have a diversity array of emotions joy sadness love admiration guilt and so on.

1100
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:58,280
So would you yes would you comment on your statements.

1101
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:07,280
She sounds like she was right but not for the reasons that that you recounted.

1102
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:15,280
I think it's irresponsible to make for scientists to make an analogy basis for an argument because analogy is not valid argument.

1103
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:21,280
You know saying like the mind is like the ecosystem from that point on everything you say is completely up in the air.

1104
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:34,280
But it so happens I think this came up that in this discussion here that sometimes less than happy states can be more adapted for the individual.

1105
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:43,280
This is not ecosystem and because sometimes there might be need for focus or whatever. So to that extent I would agree with that.

1106
01:17:43,280 --> 01:18:00,280
There is some very good psychological research published in the best journals psychological science I think you read mouse is one of the authors on the value of unhappiness and I know that Christine here wrote you did the deal right about that so there are people here more qualified

1107
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:12,280
than I can speak to that but it's like you say.

1108
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:18,280
Yeah, my name is Doug I'm a financial planner and you know money is very quantifiable.

1109
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:29,280
I think I'll agree happiness is not and a lot of the prevailing thought when you're working financial services that people make these huge financial decisions based on two emotions fear agreed.

1110
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:33,280
And it seems my experience is a whole lot deeper than that.

1111
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:46,280
But you know I'm not a psychiatrist a lot of psychiatrists are not financial planners so we can't really have that overlap and a lot of the books that I've read you know you get halfway through it and you realize oh this is a training manual on how to sell

1112
01:18:46,280 --> 01:19:05,280
a newity to someone. So how do you kind of get people to open up up about their relationship with money. How does that impact their happiness. You know if you have any thoughts on that I would greatly appreciate it.

1113
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:18,280
And then watch me because I'm the economist. I always don't know don't some Congress don't have any things with money. I'm one of them.

1114
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:25,280
No I don't think people I mean really I don't think people have looked that deep.

1115
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:38,280
The issue of the relationship the psychological relationship that people have with money and how that can affect financial plans. It's it's a very interesting question. I really don't know.

1116
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:43,280
I really don't know anybody who's that honest.

1117
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:57,280
There are psychologists that work in psychologists and economists that work in related questions but that's a specific question.

1118
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:02,280
I think it's a very interesting question. We've heard quite a few actually.

1119
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:15,280
I think that would be interesting to go and look at and this one but I can write a book.

1120
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:22,280
As you helped people make these decisions based based on you know what is it what's motivating is this a right.

1121
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:29,280
Yeah it's what's the motivation what's the end goal in mind and you know is it something you feel that you need to do or something that you want to do.

1122
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,280
So it's a good question to you.

1123
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,280
Yeah and it's more it's more a question how do I unlock that thinking in their head.

1124
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:40,280
I think I would advise you to cite Tolkien to them from the Lord of the Rings.

1125
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:46,280
You know when when the gimli the dwarf asks of glad me of a gift.

1126
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:57,280
I will not go into details what the gift was but she tells him that with the gift go those words that your hands will flow with gold but over your gold will have no dominion.

1127
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,280
Not the bad advice.

1128
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,280
Yeah I think.

1129
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,280
Help me yet.

1130
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,280
Thanks a lot.

1131
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:20,280
Hi I don't have a question I kind of just want to make a statement which seems to work for me and that and that's what attracted me to this conference the name happiness.

1132
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:26,280
I'm also a psychoanalyst but that's not why I'm here.

1133
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:37,280
My philosophy is that contentness is what's important to be content was what you have.

1134
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:54,280
Happiness of those special times in life when whether it's love in the beginning or birth of a child or whatever we all know what those moments are.

1135
01:21:54,280 --> 01:22:01,280
If we were happy meaning happy all the time we really wouldn't know that we're happy.

1136
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:08,280
It's just like if we were drinking champagne and eating caviar all the time we wouldn't know it's special.

1137
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:12,280
So that's basically my comment for today.

1138
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,280
Thank you.

1139
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:18,280
Any comments?

1140
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:22,280
Allow me to give Sophocles the final word.

1141
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:31,280
The final chorus from the Antigone where he said of happiness the crown and chief is part is wisdom and to hold the gods in awe.

1142
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:37,280
That is the law that seeing the stricken heart pride brought down we learn when we are old.

1143
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:56,280
Thank you to all of our discussions today.
