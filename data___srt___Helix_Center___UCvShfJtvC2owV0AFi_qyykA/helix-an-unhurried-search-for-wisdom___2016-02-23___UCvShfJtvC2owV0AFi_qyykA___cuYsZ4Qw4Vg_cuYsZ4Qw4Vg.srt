1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
When we talk about free will and when we get really heated debates over that, what we're

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,480
actually talking about is human behavior.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,000
If we all held the exact same idea and it was the wrong idea, that would be detrimental.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,760
And so having this debate and having ideas kind of develop it is the thing we want to

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,260
do.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,960
In the late 80s, early 90s, I came to realize that people from the different areas of neuroscience

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,920
psychology, biology didn't really talk to each other.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,680
And it seemed to me that's a major loss because each of them had something to say that could

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,000
be useful to the other.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,760
The first round table we had actors, philosophers, neuroscientists.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,960
I invited them to my home.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,280
I served them dinner and wine.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,800
Then we went to my living room and what I recognized was that these meetings in and

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,400
some of them themselves were extremely enlightening.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:08,040
And so that's where Helix comes from.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,320
The mission of Helix is to bring together thought leaders from different disciplines,

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,960
speaking with one another in spontaneous a way as possible.

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,360
The discussions are not aimed to answer a question because if that were the case, there

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,440
would be more homogeneity and you'd have a monolithic group of experts.

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,560
And it's just the opposite.

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,360
It's more of an intellectual free for all.

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,920
It's true in different ways, in different phases of child development.

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,480
But what preoccupies a kid at a certain stage in life is going to influence what he

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,720
or she actually experiences.

25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
We all know that.

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,000
We're in a terrible mood.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,760
If something horrible just happened to us, we misperceive what someone else said.

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,840
I don't think we're in some sense moving toward a steady state of objectivity.

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
You disagree?

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Go ahead.

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,040
I think you never get to a stage of objectivity.

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,640
There's no such thing.

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,600
But I think kids are more limited because they have more limited minds.

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,440
That's what you get in an interdisciplinary conversation.

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,560
You get to realize that there's no one privileged point of view or one privileged kind of information.

36
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,960
So I think it's essential if we're going to understand anything about the world.

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,520
I'm a lab scientist.

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,720
I'm being a lab scientist, I spend a lot of time in the four walls of my laboratory.

39
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,800
So when you have an opportunity to sit around with colleagues who are coming from very different

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,520
perspectives, it changes the way you think about your subject matter in a way that I

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,960
hope I will then take back into my laboratory and import some of those different perspectives

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,200
into the work that we do there.

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,040
We cover a very broad area.

44
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,320
We do neuroscience, biology, medicine.

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,120
We have auditory, surrealism.

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,000
And there isn't a meeting I walk out of that I haven't learned something.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,960
It's very important to see how carefully the child has made an effort to draw these figures.

48
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:13,000
And now if we go to the next child's drawing, same age, it's very primitive.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,720
How do you determine the ability of the child drawing against his or her creativity or individuality?

50
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,080
It seems to me you're making an assumption that drawing ability of all children of the

51
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,560
same age ought to be the same.

52
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,760
I'm so glad you made that point.

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:42,960
So what you're suggesting is that that image, which I plead guilty to calling primitive,

54
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:52,640
could in fact be an amazingly creative expression on the part of the child, who could have possibly

55
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,840
drawn the figure in other ways.

56
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,960
It might not be right to call primitive, it might be right to call it something else.

57
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,440
So I really appreciate that so much.

58
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,920
I plead guilty and I stand corrected.

59
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,520
And I think that's a wonderful contribution.

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,600
We had a series on music and cognition.

61
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:19,040
We asked Nacho Armani, a percussionist, to give a performance where he engaged not only

62
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:44,680
all the roundtable participants, but the entire audience.

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,360
And I think that's a great thing.

64
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,200
So genius requires intelligence, but then there's something else.

65
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,960
And originally the idea was that, you know, the genius, that extra something was breathed

66
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,360
into you by a god or a muse or implanted in you by the gods.

67
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,920
But it was a divine special something that ordinary human beings didn't have.

68
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:13,200
We submitted an application identifying 14 areas within the big questions about sciences

69
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,000
and humanities.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,920
And we were very pleased for them to fund us for those.

71
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,400
It's when we get puzzling phenomena that is observable physical phenomena that are

72
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,520
current inventory, physical inventory of properties and enforces doesn't seem adequate

73
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,160
to capture that we then have to broaden out our physical understanding.

74
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,640
In the case of consciousness, it's not the behavior of consciousness that leads us to

75
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,280
think we're going to need some new fundamental explanatory principle.

76
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,080
It's the intrinsic character.

77
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,720
Is it epiphenomenal?

78
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,320
Is it such that it's just there?

79
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,800
There's an interesting form of overstatement that scientists are prone to in this, that

80
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:03,280
we have biology and we have a mechanism by which you can see how random variation plus

81
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,720
natural selection could give you complicated organisms like us.

82
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
That's true.

83
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,440
What you often see scientists do is convert that into a very different statement which

84
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,880
is we know that random mutations plus natural selection gave rise to us.

85
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,960
Those are two very distant statements and the second one is completely beyond what we know.

86
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,240
Of course, we don't know that all those mutations were random.

87
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,560
We have no idea.

88
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,120
With the John Templeton Foundation grant, we had one about immortality that I thought

89
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,480
was really enchanting and nerve-racking.

90
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,640
If we were to be able to say on such and such a date, this will be the end of the human

91
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,320
race, what would that do to all human endeavor?

92
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,760
We can accept to a certain extent the fact that we individually, each one of us is going

93
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
to end.

94
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,160
But the idea that the entire thing is going to end, all humanity I think is as close to

95
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,000
unthinkable as we can get.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,400
I feel like we've changed a great deal in this recent period of time since modernity

97
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
basically.

98
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:14,800
There are sensibilities that are arising and not just in academic frameworks but in the

99
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:24,360
popular realm as well that would say it might be possible to accept endings, accept one's

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:32,680
own death, accept the deep uncertainty of our existence, that that might be kind of

101
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,240
cool.

102
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,880
It was just a discussion but you did in some way feel that something really large was at

103
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,880
stake.

104
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,360
There will always be a irreducible degree of unpredictability of human behavior.

105
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Even given all the addictions, even given all the neurological conditions that people

106
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:01,560
have, there is an element of choice in humans which is inherent to that human for one reason

107
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,200
or another.

108
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,920
These events really democratize the intellectual life in the city.

109
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:19,240
I think it's very important not to restrict ideas to elites and universities.

110
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:26,080
We have an audience here and we simulcast it and we put it on YouTube and that way a

111
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,840
lot more people can benefit from it.

112
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,320
A lot of you have been talking about the fact that when we are conscious we have a feeling

113
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,400
inside that we have an experience inside.

114
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,720
So my question is inside what?

115
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,320
Because if we say that conscious experience is inside the mind it's kind of circular

116
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,520
definition because just the thing, so it cannot be literally inside the head.

117
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,200
We do not expect to find consciousness like we find sugar in the blood.

118
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,960
So I just wanted to ask inside what?

119
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,480
Something we haven't really talked at all about which I guess we'll wait until the last

120
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,320
minute to throw it out there is that consciousness is as far as we know embodied.

121
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,960
When I stub my toe I feel pain in my toe, not in my brain and I don't feel it in the

122
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,360
rock that I stubbed my toe against.

123
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,640
There seems to be this deep interface of consciousness that blends into the body even though we've

124
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,800
been talking about it being situated in the brain.

125
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,960
So when you ask the question we've been talking about consciousness being inside what the

126
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,880
first thing I think of is it's inside the body and that gets us out of that immediate

127
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,280
circularity and then you can say well what is the consciousness, the embodied consciousness

128
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,280
inside of and then that's a different question.

129
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:48,800
Do you think that if given unlimited resources and the ultimate proficiency in algorithms

130
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,800
could we create a machine that's capable of replicating itself enough to become freewheeling?

131
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,400
I really like that each of the panelists really just talked about their own experiences with

132
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,480
the topic and questions from their own approaches and I really gave like a multifaceted understanding

133
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,000
to the questions.

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,360
My hope is to provide this to various universities around the country and around the world especially

135
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,200
in lesser fortunate places around the world.

136
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,080
I've always been in favor of independent thinking and critical thinking.

137
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:29,800
This is a perfect way to bring it to as many people as possible.

138
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:36,200
These kinds of events remind us all in academia that it is really about relevance of what

139
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
we are doing.

140
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,880
It is ultimately the question how do we contribute to the betterment of society or to the greater

141
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,980
good.

142
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,640
The more individuals who can engage in this kind of high quality discussion the more we're

143
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,080
raising not only the awareness but the potential for contributions of people both participants

144
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:22,080
and non-participants to the greater wisdom and knowledge of the world.
