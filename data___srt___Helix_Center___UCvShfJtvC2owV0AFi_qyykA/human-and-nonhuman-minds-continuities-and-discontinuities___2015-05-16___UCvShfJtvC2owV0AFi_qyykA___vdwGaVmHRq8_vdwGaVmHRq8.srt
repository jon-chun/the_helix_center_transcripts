1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Okay, we're going to get started.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
Welcome everyone.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,760
I'm Rob Penzer.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,760
I'm the associate director of the Helix Center.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,480
Thank you for coming out today for what promises to be a fascinating program on human and

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,200
non-human minds.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,920
Before we get to the introductions of today's participants, just have a few announcements.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,480
This is the last of our roundtables for the academic year, and I want to just give you

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,920
a little bit of a taste of some of the roundtables coming in the fall.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,920
We're going to start out in September on the subject of interdisciplinary investigations.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,920
Our John Templeton Foundation roundtables continue in October, a standing genius, followed

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,000
by genes, computers, and computers in November.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,200
We'll be addressing epigenetics.

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,040
We have a new arts and humanities program, and the topic toward the end of November will

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,520
be on translation.

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,480
Then we're going to have a three-day symposium in December, a Freudian perspective on what

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:22,360
hails the world today, and that will be an international event with participants from

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,120
Europe and the states.

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:33,160
Then in mid-December, capital with an A, notions, the future of the American economy.

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:39,680
Then we continue again with the Templeton Foundation-sponsored roundtable on memory,

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,600
followed by the meditative state, and then the realm of mystery.

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,400
I also wanted to mention that we had a very successful fundraiser on May 8th, and nothing

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,160
breeds success like success.

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:01,080
So I hope it might inspire some of you to consider donating to our nonprofit organization

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,680
so that we can continue to provide you with such programs, and as always, they are free

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,600
and open to the public.

27
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,960
So now, on to today's participants.

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,480
To my right is Alexandra Horowitz, professor of psychology at Barnard College, whose dog

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,720
cognition lab conducts research on a wide range of topics, including dog, old-fashioned,

30
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,880
interspecies play behavior, and attributions of secondary emotions to dogs.

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:38,520
Among her books are Inside of a Dog, What She Smell and Know, and Unlooking, Eleven Walks

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,960
with Expert Eyes.

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,840
To her right is Diana Reese, professor of psychology at Hunter College, and professor

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,000
of biopsychology and behavioral neuroscience at the Graduate Center of CUNY, whose research

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,200
focuses on Sotitian cognition, communication, comparative animal cognition, and the evolution

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,640
of intelligence.

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,680
She is the author of Secrets of the Dolphins, and the book The Dolphin in the Mirror, Exploring

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,280
Dolphin Minds, Dolphin Lives.

39
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,280
To her right is Theodore Diamond, director of the Diamond Instance, joint assistant professor

40
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,000
at Columbia Teachers College, covers the study of the human mental and physical system as

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
a holistic entity.

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,640
Among his books are The Body in Motion, Its Evolution and Design, and Neurodynamics,

43
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,600
the Art of Mindfulness in Action.

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,800
To his right, Stuart Fierstein is the former chair of Department of Biological Sciences

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,360
at Columbia University, where he studies the vertebrate olfactory system, and he's the

46
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,640
author of the book's Ignorance, How it Drives Science, and Failure by Science is So Successful.

47
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,480
And to his right, it's a research associate in lecture at Harvard University, an author

48
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,400
of the Alex Studies describing over 20 years of peer-reviewed experiments on the cognitive

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:03,120
and communicative abilities of Gray Parrots, X and Me, her memoir of a 30-year collaboration.

50
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,880
Now to our round table.

51
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,760
No, you're going to start it.

52
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,560
You see, that's where we are here.

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,920
That's the first question.

54
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Who starts?

55
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,920
This is Ed Nurse-Sassian, the director, but I think most of you know.

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,920
It's so typical that we can't get a round table on cognitive.

57
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Diana, you'll start.

58
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Yes.

59
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,840
So I think what we're hoping to do today is talk about, as we advertise, the continuities

60
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,120
and discontinuities between human and non-human animal minds.

61
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,600
And it's wonderful to be here together to do this with you, all of us, and we obviously

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,680
encourage discussion, not just us, but you as well.

63
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,720
I think some of the ways we might start this is from a perspective of Darwinian, the continuity

64
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:22,880
of evolution, emotion, thinking from a Darwinian perspective, as contrasted by a few, Descartes

65
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,720
view that humans had a body, that they also had this ghost in the machine, a thinking

66
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,920
substance of mind.

67
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,000
And again, the view that Descartes had was that other animals only had the body.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,600
They were devoid of this thinking substance.

69
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,840
And I guess I just want to kick in a first idea here to get us going, that for a little

70
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,880
bit, there's been this running debate as to whether other animals think or not.

71
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,520
Of course, I'll just mention this because there were arguments that, well, parrots

72
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,680
certainly are vocal.

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,560
They're using words, but it's just a devoid of thought.

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,560
And their thought were dismissed.

75
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,400
And I know Irene's going to have a lot to say about that.

76
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,480
And then, you know, other animals are doing behavior that looks complex, but it's not

77
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
complex.

78
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
It's that.

79
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,600
I think we can just start talking about what some of the things we're learning.

80
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
There you go.

81
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,600
You just have to bring the speakers to many of the students in my class.

82
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:33,200
So, and I mean that only partly as a joke, actually, because I think one of the difficult

83
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,120
issues is, in fact, defining what we mean, first of all, by the idea of continuity and

84
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
discontinuity.

85
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,680
We don't look for it.

86
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,920
And how to identify what we consider to be conscious or cognitive behavior, whether there's

87
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:55,400
anything to do with the is a difference between, I guess, what you would call, programmed behavior

88
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,240
or things like that, or instinctive behavior and more cognitive behavior.

89
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,440
I mean, I don't, I think we know, okay, that's intuitive, whatever.

90
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,360
The dog does something that all dogs do, and that looks intuitive.

91
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,360
And then something is affirmative, but it just looks that way.

92
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,920
It's very difficult to actually, can I tell a quick story actually about this?

93
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,360
It has nothing to do with cognition, but it does have to do with behavior and the idea

94
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,160
of instinct.

95
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,640
So when a bird, not a pigeon, a chicken is born, the very first thing it does when it

96
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,160
gets out of the egg is it begins pecking the ground for food.

97
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,680
Appears to be an instinctive behavior.

98
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,920
For years it was considered an instinctive behavior.

99
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,680
So Japanese scientist whose name now eludes me.

100
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,840
But anyway, Japanese scientist, this is a weird thing to do, I know.

101
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,040
But if you spread Vaseline on an egg and hold it up to the other side and hold it as a light,

102
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,160
it becomes transparent and you can see through it with a light behind it.

103
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,800
I don't know how we discovered that.

104
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
That's a whole other story.

105
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
I suspect.

106
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
But anyway.

107
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,200
So this enabled him to take chicken eggs and put them in an incubator and then he goes

108
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,400
Vaseline and watch the chicken develop.

109
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,720
And that develops, it turns out that the chicken develops in the egg with its head bent over

110
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,200
this way and it's bent directly over the region that becomes the heart.

111
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,480
And at some point about four days before the thing cracks up, it begins beating actually.

112
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,000
I think it's sooner than that, but it's better.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,240
And you watch the head of the chicken go up and down and up and down with the beat of

114
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
the heart.

115
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,600
And it comes out of the egg, it just keeps on going up and down and then it kind of binds

116
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,560
up picking up some food and well there you go, right?

117
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,080
So it's not instinctive at all.

118
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,200
It's a behavior that's learned in fact in some way or another.

119
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,480
So I just think that's a problem that's worth discussing, how we make this discriminate.

120
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,280
We say discontinuity versus content.

121
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,480
I don't really know where to draw the lines here.

122
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,640
There's a similar story with Jack Hammond studies on the goals.

123
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,720
I mean people know that goals, parental goals have a little red spot on their beak and supposedly

124
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,160
the chicks come out and stay in that red dot.

125
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,320
It turns out what is instinctual is something like what you're describing a response to

126
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,660
some kind of dates and they happen to hit the red dot at one point and mom and dad barf

127
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,720
up some food and you know there you go.

128
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,960
But it's these things, many of these things people thought were instinctual.

129
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,720
Turns out to have a learning component, to have different aspects, behavioral intuition

130
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,200
plus these other aspects.

131
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,000
So much of what we do in our lab now to look at the effects of context and that's another

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,320
issue where we're studying these so many different types of behavior patterns that are exquisitely

133
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,440
sensitive to the context in which you study them.

134
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,840
We did a study where some people were looking at fish behavior.

135
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,520
There's a fish that lives in a reef that a cleaner fish and the other fish that live

136
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,080
in the reef come over and get all the parasites taken off.

137
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,520
But every once in a while another fish comes by and these cleaner fish will jump out and

138
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,520
grab those fish because the local residents they're going to just sit there.

139
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,400
They're not going to come back but you can basically optimize your food intake by jumping

140
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,880
out to these other fish.

141
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,160
So it's too complicated to explain the whole study but based on that people were comparing

142
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,080
chimpanzees and these fish and it turns out a regular task.

143
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,400
The fish outperformed the chimpanzees.

144
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,000
So we looked at this, I worked with parrots and I said, wait a minute, my birds can do

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,560
this really easily.

146
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,880
And so we did the task and the parrots outperformed everybody.

147
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,400
But it was the way we set up what we call the initial conditions.

148
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,640
And when you compare exactly how to experiment you're going to find in so many ways different

149
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,600
animals just based on how you set up the experiment.

150
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,760
So this is another thing that people are not sensitive to when they say, well, you know,

151
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,000
this animal does this and this animal.

152
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
Can't do this in blah blah blah.

153
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,280
So much of it depends on exactly how you set up the experiment.

154
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,120
I mean, I think that what that highlights and what we're going to highlight is that we're

155
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,280
still trapped in a way of working for us, right?

156
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,880
The instinctive or learning or reflexive versus cognitive.

157
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,480
And the science that drove an interest in non-human animals, which is a psychological

158
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,640
science really, but they wind up being categories that now we're stuck.

159
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,640
We're trying to fit our behavior into one or the other and it'd be the ideal.

160
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,000
Resization of most of the behavior that we're seeing.

161
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,360
I mean, context, the importance of context seems to me to rise above that a little bit.

162
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,600
But somebody will still want you to say, well, is it instinctive or is it learned?

163
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,400
Which might not be easy to.

164
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,240
There are also some other issues, I think, as scientists that we face.

165
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,480
And some of them are, you know, we're stuck looking through this human lens, that other

166
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,280
animal behavior and intelligence.

167
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,640
And, you know, the eyeward, intelligence.

168
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,920
How do you measure that?

169
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,760
Is the intelligence of a dolphin the same thing as the intelligence of a chimpanzee?

170
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
I mean, morphologically, they're different.

171
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,440
Very different environments.

172
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,880
They've been separated by 95 million years of separate evolution.

173
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,680
We might expect that they'll do very different things.

174
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,160
And, you know, that to me, that's one of the most challenging things of it.

175
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,560
How do you even think about intelligence in an animal and even know that you're not missing

176
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
most of it?

177
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,760
Because simply, they're using different kinds of, you know, ways of thinking.

178
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,840
They have perspectives there in environment we can't imagine.

179
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,520
I'll tell you one story that was very telling to me.

180
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,560
A couple of years ago, one of the doctoral students in my lab pressed in further and

181
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,000
I did a study at the Smithsonian's National Zoo with Elephants.

182
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,520
I joke about saying that I study big gray brains and big gray mammals, elephants and

183
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,800
dolphins.

184
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,120
And so we worked with elephants this time, not dolphins.

185
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,960
And I don't know how many of you are familiar with this study that was done many years ago

186
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:03,120
by Wolfgang Köhler with showing the first evidence for insightful problem solving in

187
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
chimpanzees.

188
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,520
So insightful problem solving has been defined as being faced with a novel problem or situation

189
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,880
and without trial and error.

190
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,440
You come up with, you have sort of this aha moment and you see the solution suddenly,

191
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,920
a sudden, you know, solution, a reorganization of your thinking so you can solve this problem.

192
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:32,560
So what he did with his attempts is he hung bananas high above their reach and he placed

193
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,400
variety of eggs in their environment.

194
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,280
This was done at a zoo in Tenerife and he gave them, there were some sticks and there

195
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
were some boxes.

196
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,760
And you know the chimps, one of them's name was Sultan, you know, I forget the names of

197
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,560
the others, were looking up, obviously couldn't reach it.

198
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,000
And finally, one of the chimps without trial and error apparently stacked the boxes, took

199
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,800
a couple boxes, stacked them up and then took a stick and was able to reach the banana.

200
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,240
And that was sort of the first evidence that a non-human species showed this aha moment,

201
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,080
they sort of got it.

202
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,160
And we were really interested because there had been a lot of discussion about elephants.

203
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,120
Being elephants are big tool users, they're one of the biggest tool users.

204
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,760
But somehow they weren't showing this kind of insightful problem solving when people

205
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,600
gave them sticks to solve problems.

206
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,720
So we went to Smithsonian's National Zoo and we simulated or replicated this curler experiment.

207
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,520
We didn't hang bananas above their reach but we strung up a sort of a clothes line out

208
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:38,440
of wire and shot out tree limbs, baited with tasty fruit that they would eat.

209
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,320
What we did was we put boxes that they could stack and sticks and wrong.

210
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,160
Well, what we saw was that this elephant never picked up a stick.

211
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,240
Again, in bother he got stuck with his trunk and he didn't know if he didn't know if he

212
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
never did it.

213
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,760
But what he did was he went for the block and he, which was much more effort, there was

214
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,560
much more effort involved in this.

215
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,200
He pushed the block right under, got up on the block and got his trunk where the fruit

216
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,400
was.

217
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,880
And it was interesting and he continued and gave him repeated trials where we hid the

218
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,360
block, we moved the block, he had a search for the block.

219
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,920
Once he got it, he got it, he could solve the problem.

220
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,240
But if we had only given him sticks, he may never have shown that.

221
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,720
Well, let's think about this.

222
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,600
So an elephant's trunk is a really cool sensory organ.

223
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,000
First of all, they're optimal vision.

224
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,800
Their best visual acuity is at the end of the trunk.

225
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,280
They have two little points that we call fingers that can pick up something that's a dime so

226
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,040
they can see, touch, smell with this great.

227
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,800
It's not a tool because it's part of their body.

228
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,600
And what they needed to do perhaps is get this cool sensory organ up where the food was

229
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,640
and the stick would have shut off their ability to touch the food, smell the object and perhaps

230
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
their visual acuity.

231
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:02,120
Again, it was at these past experiments where we only gave them sticks and they do.

232
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,400
So again, I think there's a lesson to be learned in some of that.

233
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,200
Maybe a elephant if we can if we're going to test them.

234
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,320
Well, we saw that with the...

235
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,600
Pulling.

236
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
So this is a study.

237
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,480
This was developed by Baron Heinrich for work with crows and ravens.

238
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,680
What you do is you have a perch and you put a really long string with a tasty treat on

239
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,080
the bottom.

240
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,280
And he showed this to the ravens and the raven sort of flew over and looked at it and flew

241
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,120
back and flew over and looked at it.

242
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,360
And then again, without any trial and error, reach down, grabbed the string with his beak,

243
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,840
pulled it up, clumped his foot on it and basically reeled it in.

244
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,360
Crows weren't so good at this.

245
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,480
So we thought, hey, we got these brilliant parrots.

246
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Let's try this.

247
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,160
Well, it turned out that the parrots in our lab that had not yet learned to speak did

248
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,360
extremely well on this.

249
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,560
I mean, it took them, you know, ten seconds or so, they figured it out.

250
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Ones that did speak, Alex and Griffin looked at it, looked at us and went, go pick up

251
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
nut.

252
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Now...

253
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,560
That's not...

254
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,560
Language is a tool.

255
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,320
But had we done it only with our older, more intelligent parrots, we would have said

256
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,520
they can't figure out how to do the task.

257
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,920
But it wasn't that they couldn't.

258
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,720
It was like, that's not...

259
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,000
You know, we don't do physical work.

260
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,640
You know, we know how to manipulate you to do it.

261
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,320
Well, that actually reminds me a lot of the comparison between wolves and dogs because

262
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,920
on a string pulling task where a string...

263
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,880
The researchers create this convoluted apparatus where there's essentially a ball of old's

264
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,520
meat and... which can open the door and wolves and dogs will learn to pull the string to

265
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
open the door.

266
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
They both will use their mouth.

267
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,200
But then the researchers make it an impossible task.

268
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,480
In other words, they jimmy it so that it won't open if you pull the string.

269
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,240
And wolves will go up this task, you know, until they wreck the cage.

270
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,160
You know, they'll go at it until they're...

271
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,520
From their gums.

272
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,680
Dogs start to pull at it.

273
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
It's not opening.

274
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,520
They pull at it and they stop and look at the handler or the person.

275
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,280
We're sort of the tool who solves the problem for the dogs.

276
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
And the question is, which is more intelligent?

277
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,520
The wolves with their persistence?

278
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,440
That's useful in their environment or the dogs with their using us who have hands and

279
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,800
brains which can solve that problem.

280
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Hmm.

281
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,640
I have a question.

282
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,800
Here's a question.

283
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,840
My question is this.

284
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,560
If the dog...

285
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,600
If the elephant has a certain kind of intelligence, if the dog has a certain kind of intelligence,

286
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,040
humans, are they all limited and why?

287
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,560
Why is it that the human intelligence seems unlimited?

288
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,640
Why is it grown to the point it's grown?

289
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,560
I have my own views on this, which I'll say a tiny bit about.

290
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:01,240
But why is the intelligence that we see in elephants not going to go beyond where it

291
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
is?

292
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,880
It's interesting in your example, Dan, because it's almost like the example with the elephant

293
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,680
and the trunk is sort of an example of embodied cognition.

294
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,560
We're applying the stick to an elephant, but it doesn't deal with sticks, where it's chimpanzees

295
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,920
like sticks.

296
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Humans have...

297
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,560
They do use sticks as tools to run themselves, try open things where they don't have to

298
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,200
smell and get to them.

299
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,760
But in this case, it wouldn't necessarily facilitate it.

300
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:39,480
But what I want to know is why is it that the elephant intelligence doesn't go beyond

301
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,160
that and what happened to humans that somehow led beyond...

302
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,640
I believe it's related to physical design.

303
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,240
I believe that the upright design was sort of the...

304
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:55,600
Kind of like a breakthrough design that allowed human intelligence to evolve in a completely

305
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,560
different way and lead to an expansion of the brain, a whole set of different behaviors.

306
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:09,640
But I wonder if the elephant design doesn't allow further development in that direction.

307
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,760
Well, actually, I'd like to switch it in a different way.

308
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:19,240
I think symbolic representation is one of the critical issues here, because we've done

309
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,000
some studies with our birds on evidence.

310
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And by giving them...

311
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,640
I mean, they don't know the way you and I have language.

312
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,680
I couldn't put Alex on the table here and we couldn't have had the conversation we're

313
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,120
having, okay.

314
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,880
But he had symbolic representation.

315
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,760
My other birds do too.

316
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:43,600
And they can do numerical tasks that animals without symbolic representation cannot do

317
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,480
at all, all right?

318
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,520
And this seems to be an incredible difference.

319
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,480
And of course, we've given these birds a symbolic representation.

320
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,800
Whatever symbolic representation they have in the wild seems to be much more limited,

321
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
okay?

322
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
But it's...

323
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,640
That's to me seems to be an incredible difference.

324
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:10,800
And to me, it seems to be that for humans, we've kind of ratcheted things up by using

325
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,880
you know, symbolics and then thinking things, using the symbols to think things through

326
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,480
and then getting more complicated symbols, et cetera, et cetera.

327
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,320
I guess the question is when does a difference in quantity become a difference in quality?

328
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,280
And where does that ever happen?

329
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,880
So I mean these...

330
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,160
I don't think anybody would deny that human intelligence is in some ways further developed

331
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,160
and virtually any other intelligence on the planet maybe, more close to or near the top

332
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,920
or whatever way you want to put it.

333
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
But is it different?

334
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,000
Is it fundamentally different in some way, in this discontinuous way?

335
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,160
Or are we just looking at a kind of a quantum leap, a gap?

336
00:21:53,160 --> 00:22:00,360
I mean I'm personally philosophically against the idea of discontinuity because that immediate

337
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,920
magic sauce of some sort or another special sauce that I mean assuming we all believe

338
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:12,600
that mentality of all sorts is basically physically embodied in this thing called the brain and

339
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,720
the rest of the nervous system then if you think human intelligence is different than

340
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,240
other animals' intelligence then it has to be because we have some special sauce which

341
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,160
I don't think is the case.

342
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,920
So I'm a kind of a no-miracles kind of person in that sense.

343
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,440
So it can't be totally discontinuous and yet you're absolutely right that you can't fool

344
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,520
yourself into believing that it's perfectly continuous either in some just tiny incremental

345
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
way.

346
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
So it's an interesting question.

347
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
I mean where are the differences?

348
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,880
And I think there are differences not only between say elephants and humans or chimps

349
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,040
and humans or dolphins and humans whatever you want to consider the next best thing to

350
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,600
us or something like that in some scale but there are differences all the way through

351
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,200
the animal kingdom where there are these jumps that may look discontinuous but are not.

352
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,680
They're just using the same stuff for different purposes, for new purposes perhaps.

353
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,760
Did you ever have, oh I thought you were.

354
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
We do questions after.

355
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Oh okay.

356
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
I guess.

357
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,760
Is that right?

358
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
No, no, no, no.

359
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
No, no.

360
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
No, no, no.

361
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Right.

362
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Okay.

363
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Is that human intelligence evolves but that animal intelligence doesn't evolve.

364
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
Am I any question correct?

365
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
I think it is.

366
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,440
Humans are more intelligent today than they were 5,000 years ago but the elephant is the

367
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
same.

368
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
Well that's hard to say.

369
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
You don't have that.

370
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,000
You have that question then 5,000 years ago but there's something that happened in the

371
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,680
human design that led to so many different faculties, so many different faculties arose

372
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,160
with hominids.

373
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,360
Now you could say that that's part just a circumfusion.

374
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,440
You have an animal that's upright, capable of you in a way that you know they're forelimbs

375
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,200
in a way that no other animal can and all of a sudden because of that they were you know

376
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,960
they were capable of new behaviors and one of them is simply eating differently.

377
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,880
Maybe that alone could account for the change in the size of the brain and yet the question

378
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,200
I ask myself just studying anatomy is an area that I'm interested in.

379
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,280
I've been interested in it for a long time.

380
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,560
What is, why is it that it seems that just being upright is associated with being more

381
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
conscious?

382
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,080
To me there's some, so almost like a qualitative connection.

383
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:34,920
I mean you know Jane Goodall used to say that she felt that chimpanzees were capable of awe.

384
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,080
Certain pretty unusual emotions she said she believed that.

385
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm not sure that's.

386
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,640
But she believed that a chimpanzee seen a new beautiful setting that they could look and

387
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,400
experience some kind of emotion.

388
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:56,520
It seems to me that in primates something happened where going, the mere fact of being upright

389
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,040
seems to decouple thinking from motor function.

390
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,800
Not in the sense that Stuart and I were, Stuart was mentioning how function is the basis of

391
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,760
so much complexity in cognition.

392
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,040
I'd agree.

393
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:20,960
That motor function, separate function functionally but it says if in the human motor system cognition

394
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,320
begins to find a separate way of operating separately from motor action so that as far

395
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:37,560
as I know, and I could be, I'm not an expert in animal cognition, but as far as I know animals

396
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:43,120
almost, I could stand corrected just from what you said to Anna, but so many animals

397
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,400
when you see them thinking, they're thinking is linked with movement.

398
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,920
So a dog that sees prey.

399
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:56,400
It may stop and look at the prey and lose interest and walk away, but even when it's

400
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,160
stopped, it's either loses interest or it's calculating how to get the prey.

401
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,840
It never seems to move independently of the action.

402
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,480
It's like it's one operating system, but a human being could do something in my view

403
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:18,680
that's unique, whereas a human being can sit and look at a piece of food and deliberate

404
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,000
whether they want the food and say, I'm not even sure.

405
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,960
You're going to say a bird can do it.

406
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,000
Griffin passed the marshmallow test.

407
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,800
Well, I want to hear.

408
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
I'm going to test.

409
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
You know, wait 15 minutes.

410
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,040
We can give him, he has a nut in front of him.

411
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,200
We show him if you wait for the nut, wait, you'll get a skittle, which he loves much

412
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,960
more, and I'll sit there for 15 minutes and he does the same behavior patterns as the

413
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,040
kids do.

414
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,880
He pushes the nut away.

415
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,800
He turns around and he starts preening so he doesn't have to look at it.

416
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,880
He tries to fall asleep.

417
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,160
I mean, he starts talking to himself and muttering things to himself and things.

418
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
It's...

419
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
You don't walk easily.

420
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
The same type of thing.

421
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
You just train.

422
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
I actually...

423
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
No, but this was not trained.

424
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Our dog, I have it on video.

425
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,800
Our dog does it.

426
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,080
We have him share a dog.

427
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
And we did a...

428
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,280
I put a treat down there and I said, just stay in the sense of training.

429
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,440
Like the videos you showed me, I mean, we didn't do a whole system.

430
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,120
I'm at Big Newfoundland and he's looking at it and he looks at me and he looks at the

431
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
thing.

432
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
He looks away.

433
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,280
It's like, he looks...

434
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
Finally, he just...

435
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
He's like real...

436
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
He's like every...

437
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,840
He finally leaves and then he comes back and he...

438
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,920
You know, similar kinds of things.

439
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,960
We have these similarities in patterns.

440
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,600
I think animals, you know, I think the constraint we have...

441
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
I do think they're thinking.

442
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,280
I mean, we've had situations where...

443
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Okay, so this is my...

444
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,280
Like study.

445
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,960
So he was trained to use the word none for the absence of similarity.

446
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,720
So you could take any two things out of your pocket and say, what's the same, what's different?

447
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,960
He'd say, color, shape, matte, or none.

448
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,800
If nothing, we're same or different.

449
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,160
So we're now doing a number of comprehension study.

450
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,680
He's already at the point where you can put a tray out with red and blue balls and blocks.

451
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,560
So you've got four sets of things mixed in...

452
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,200
You know, how many blue blocks and I'll tell you.

453
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,040
So now we got to do comprehension.

454
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,680
So there's three, four, and six things on the tray.

455
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,040
And we've already had like a dozen trials where you say, you know, what...

456
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,160
Then he says blue because there are six blue blocks on the tray.

457
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,000
So now I come in with the three...

458
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,880
You know, this set of things and I say, Alex, what color three?

459
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,920
And he looks at me and he goes five.

460
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,600
There's no five things on the tray.

461
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,360
Now usually when he doesn't want to work, he takes his beak and wax everything off on

462
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,080
the floor or turns around and starts...

463
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,560
But he's giving me a number...

464
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,520
Or he gives me all the wrong colors.

465
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,760
So if the color's on the tray of red, blue, and green, he says purple, orange, and yellow

466
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
and stuff.

467
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
So...

468
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,760
But now he's giving me this number.

469
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
So...

470
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,920
You know, what color three?

471
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Five.

472
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,720
Finally I go, okay, smarty.

473
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
What color five?

474
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,480
And he looks at me and he goes, none.

475
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:07,160
So not only did he, you know, use none as a zero-like concept, which we in the West didn't

476
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,480
do till the 1600s, but he figured out how to manipulate me into...

477
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,960
And asking the question he wanted to answer.

478
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,800
But he's using language, that's interesting.

479
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,480
In that case, he seems like he's using language in a meaningful way.

480
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,440
I have to say, just as quick as I...

481
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,640
Are you training this bird to be a synestee?

482
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,640
I'm just...

483
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
I can't...

484
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
Can you train synestee?

485
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
Call those.

486
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
No, I'm just...

487
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,200
I just wanted to follow up with something because I mean, you also told me these some anecdotes.

488
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,080
I mean, a lot of what happens to us is we see something happen once.

489
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
Yeah.

490
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,240
You know, experiment.

491
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,520
But you told me a series of things, similar to this, where you were with Alex when he

492
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,000
chewed up your paper and you yelled at him and then...

493
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Can you talk to...

494
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Because this says a lot.

495
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,520
It's similar to what you just talked about.

496
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,760
He had actually had gone out of the room and he had dropped A. I think this is the

497
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,280
sorry one, okay.

498
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:08,760
So he had managed to climb off his perch and he smashed a coffee cup.

499
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,840
And I come back into the room and there is this bird in the midst of shattered crockery.

500
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,000
And like...

501
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,480
I have to say, I was really careful not to anthropomorphize and to try to be a scientist,

502
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,360
but I come in and it's this instinct of going, you know, the danger thing.

503
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,920
If you came into the room and you saw your child on the floor with shattered crockery,

504
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,720
you're saying, how could you do that?

505
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,640
And then all of a sudden you realize, you know, this is not useful.

506
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,760
So I realized he's...

507
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,040
And not just sometimes you bird, he's scared because this thing has been made a huge noise

508
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,840
and there's all this stuff around here.

509
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,880
And he's looking at me and I pick him and I say, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

510
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,600
You know, and then he learned to use this.

511
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,080
There was no contrition necessarily.

512
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,760
But he figured out that if he was being yelled at for something and he said, I'm sorry in

513
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,800
this little pathetic voice, it completely, you know, took down our anger levels.

514
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:16,640
So it was again a way of learning how to manipulate us using speech.

515
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,440
He may not know what it means, but how many of you...

516
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:27,760
And others who say I'm sorry all the time and there's no contrition.

517
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,480
Well actually I wanted to kind of attach to that a little bit, which was the study I did

518
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,760
on dogs and whether they have...

519
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,080
Or they do have a guilty look, but whether it indicates that they experience guilt.

520
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,680
But to me it highlights an interesting kind of tension that is coming up here, which is

521
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,600
do they have some emotional experience, which indicates that they have a complexity of mind

522
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:58,240
that we do and are maybe ruminating on what's been about to happen or did happen.

523
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,600
Or are they just an instinctive actor or is there some manipulation going on?

524
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,560
And so in this study that I did, I just looked at whether this guilty look, the dog show,

525
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:14,360
which is you might have a dog right if we had a head down and the tail and maybe moving

526
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,680
away from you, actually indicates that they're experiencing something like guilt or whether

527
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,520
it rises from some prompt.

528
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,320
And so I asked...

529
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,000
I went to owners homes, which is a really nice thing about dealing with dogs instead of elephants.

530
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,800
And I asked the owners, they solved in this study and they put a treat in front of their

531
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,720
dog, told their dog not to eat it, left the root.

532
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,920
And we just sort of saw what happened next.

533
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,360
If they ate the treat, I called the owners back in the room and said they ate it and they

534
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,440
were asked to scold their dogs.

535
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,720
If they didn't eat the treat, I called the owners back in the room and I said they were

536
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,200
obedient and they just greet their dogs happily like you do when you come back from the other

537
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
room.

538
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,760
But of course it's as I called...

539
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,040
I misled the owners in half the trials.

540
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:06,600
So sometimes when the dog was obedient, I said actually they ate the treat and so they'd

541
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,040
be scolded.

542
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,760
It was very deceptive.

543
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,680
And sometimes when the dog was disobedient, sometimes when the dog was disobedient, they

544
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
got away with it.

545
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,880
I said they didn't eat the treat and so they were greeted.

546
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,680
And then I just taped how much...

547
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
What the dog was...

548
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,440
Of these conditions.

549
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,840
And what was clear, clear, clear is that they showed guilty look, a little bit of guilty

550
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:32,640
look all the time, but they showed most guilty look not when they were actually guilty of

551
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,200
having disobeyed their owner and eating the treat.

552
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,360
It was when the owner scolded them.

553
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,160
You could say a lot of things about that.

554
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,720
You could say dogs don't feel guilt.

555
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,520
I don't think I can say that based on that.

556
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,760
But certainly when we think based on that look that we're getting some access into their

557
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,440
minds, that seems to be a disconnect.

558
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,920
On the other hand, what is that reaction?

559
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:00,560
It's probably a reaction to the unlearn behavior, kind of like I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

560
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,520
to avoid punishment by the owner.

561
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,480
So is that kind of more intelligent?

562
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
Is it more clever?

563
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Is it certainly...

564
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Is it less like us?

565
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
I don't know.

566
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
It's manipulative as well.

567
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,480
You have the tail head.

568
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,400
Okay, I'll tell the fish story.

569
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,960
This is like the big fish story.

570
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,400
So I was as graduate student.

571
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,400
I was doing my PhD and I was working with this young dolphin who I was asked to teach

572
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,640
her to station, which means the dolphin stays in front of you as long as you have a bucket

573
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,120
on the side of a pool.

574
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,040
It's been caught from in the wild, which I am saying this publicly.

575
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,200
We shouldn't be taking dolphins and whales from the wild.

576
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,600
This was a long time ago when people still did it.

577
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,080
She was a young dolphin and I had to teach her to station.

578
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,320
So I handed these big mackerels to mackerel fish, which are like this big, the dolphin's

579
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,840
head is this big.

580
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,960
And I cut the fish up into three sections, heads, middles and tails.

581
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,160
It would be easier for her to eat and it would give me more fish to work with.

582
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,200
And she ate the heads, she ate the middle sections, she spit out every tail I gave her.

583
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
So I looked at it.

584
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,800
Maybe it's the fins that are, you know, she doesn't like.

585
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,920
So I cut the fins off.

586
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,720
I fed her the fish and she ate everything.

587
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,000
So I make the joke who trained who here.

588
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,880
You know, she's now trained me to prepare her fish.

589
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,000
Anyway, she had been a smart dolphin and she had learned to station within a day or

590
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
so.

591
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,640
And I'm feeding her and everything's fine.

592
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,440
But in the course of me training her to station, if she didn't stay with me, I would use a

593
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,880
correction procedure who will 10 to 15 feet.

594
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,800
And I just stand there and stare at her and she'd watch me.

595
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,800
That was my way of letting her know she did the wrong thing.

596
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,520
It was breaking social contact and she couldn't get.

597
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,720
I come back.

598
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,920
It seemed to work and she learned to stay if she didn't want me to back up.

599
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
Everything's going fine.

600
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,600
It's two or three or four days down the line.

601
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,800
And by this time now, I throw her.

602
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,360
She's stationing perfectly.

603
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,120
One day I threw her an untakened steak.

604
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,620
She looks up at me.

605
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,760
She spits the fish out and she makes a beeline for the other side of the pool and takes a

606
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,920
horizontal position and just stands there.

607
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
Right?

608
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,200
And I'm thinking, can this possibly be very much like what you talked about with Alex?

609
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,440
And I'm thinking, is she really using this timeout back on me?

610
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
Was it a timeout?

611
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
I forgot to tell you that.

612
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,760
So, now this is an anecdote and you're not going to write this one up in a paper.

613
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,040
And I was working on my doctoral thesis at the time.

614
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,880
And I thought, wait a minute, maybe I can make this into an experiment.

615
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,120
So what I did was I was really careful over the next couple of sessions to cut all the

616
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
fish right.

617
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,880
And she stayed with me the whole time.

618
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,200
But then a couple days later on purpose, I gave her another uncut tale to see.

619
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
And don't you know it?

620
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,040
Bum across the side of the pool.

621
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,600
She does the timeout again.

622
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,080
And she did this on three other occasions over the course of the next weeks.

623
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,720
I love this story because first of all, she went to Dolphin gave me.

624
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,080
She was a complete collaborator on this.

625
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,400
And it just goes to show you to me what's the essence of communication and how it develops.

626
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,080
As a graduate student, that was my field, bioacoustics and communication is when children

627
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:11,960
learn, when we're interacting at home or animals that we're working with in labs or

628
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,760
the field, there's this mutual synthesis of behavior, synchrony of behavior.

629
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,600
We don't know what the other is, what's in the head of another.

630
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,640
You open any communication textbook.

631
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,440
The meaning is not in the message.

632
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,880
It's in our interpretation.

633
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,000
And what true communication in my mind is about is how we synchronize our behavior patterns,

634
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
how it functions.

635
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,600
I'll give you one more example.

636
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,160
Gregory Bates, and many of you have heard of Gregory Bates in a communication theorist,

637
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,560
he talked about the fact that his son and his wife and he, I think it was Margaret Mead,

638
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,320
he was married to at the time, traveled to South America.

639
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,080
His child didn't know any Spanish and they were unpacking their luggage and his child

640
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,000
went out onto the street and he and his wife look out on the street, they're amazed to

641
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,240
see their kid playing kickball or football in the street.

642
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:04,320
And every so often they hear him yelling, aki aki and the ball gets thrown to the child.

643
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,720
And you know, he's using it and the kid comes back up into the hotel room and Bates and

644
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,520
says, learn that so fast.

645
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,000
How did you learn what a kimen?

646
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,440
He goes, I don't know what it meant, I just saw how it worked.

647
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,120
When anybody yelled aki, they got the ball.

648
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,000
And I think that's very much what Cersei did.

649
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,880
She learned the function and I think that is really how we start to communicate.

650
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,680
And I think, Alex, when you probably talk to people about their dogs and ask how many

651
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,480
of you think they're communicating, they say, yeah, we communicate with our pets because

652
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
we do.

653
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,360
They're learning our patterns, we're learning their patterns, it may not mean the same

654
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,960
thing, but there's some organization and pattern behavior that develops.

655
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
So.

656
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,680
I just wanted to go back if it's okay for a moment to the question that Ed asked of

657
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,640
you and your idea that you've been somehow or another have developed a different kind

658
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,200
or a more advanced kind of intelligence and whether or not we would think that was true

659
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,240
of humans 5,000 years ago, whether they were smarter.

660
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,040
And I'd like to suggest that actually.

661
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:12,640
If Alex is the parent, if Alex has children or the children smarter than other parents.

662
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,320
Well, he didn't have children.

663
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:22,000
And what happened was he, when we had another little bird in the lab, he was so aggressive

664
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,200
that he had this little bird and interrupt all of his sessions.

665
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,080
You know, Griffin learned some things from Alex, but Alex did not want to teach him.

666
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,800
It was only towards the end of his life that we figured out how to see that he would get

667
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,520
a lot more attention if he helped teach Griffin, but that was the end of his life.

668
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:49,080
But, you know, I mean, I'm sorry, but it's an interesting question.

669
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,400
And the funny thing is that we now have a little female, so there's no aggression.

670
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,640
And that was one of the reasons we got a female to see if Griffin's going to teach her.

671
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:03,720
But to add to your question, I think, if we look across other animal societies like elephants,

672
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,400
dolphins, dogs, I'm sure, as well, many animals, dolphins, we see that there is what we think

673
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,160
is growing evidence for cultural transmission.

674
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,520
And yeah, but learning through observation.

675
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
What do you do?

676
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,600
I'm actually sort of, in spite of cultural transmission, I mean, I think, Ted, I think

677
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,840
if you were here 5,000 years ago, you would have the same low opinion of humans that you

678
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,640
have of elephants.

679
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,440
Because for 5,000 years, they fricking did nothing, frankly.

680
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,920
I mean, the Bronze Age went on for 2,000 years.

681
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,720
50 generations were born, grew up, and died, and precisely the same technology.

682
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,720
I'm just not like it is today.

683
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Today is different.

684
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
I agree.

685
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,000
Since the enlightenment, something has changed, but that can't clearly be evolution because

686
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
it's not enough time.

687
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,480
I mean, now, if you go away for a holiday for two weeks, you come back and you're operating

688
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,480
systems out of date.

689
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't know, everything is wrong.

690
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,160
You're not like part of it anymore, you know.

691
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,720
You're hopelessly behind.

692
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,520
But I mean, there were long, long stretches of time while we were upright and had this

693
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,680
very same brain we had now when kind enough and much happened when we didn't really develop

694
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,760
anything of any particular value and just kept beating the crap out of each other in

695
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,040
little trouble, we still do, in fact.

696
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
So...

697
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,400
But it is an interesting issue is why us, why us with technology, what stopped...

698
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,000
That's a discontinuity, I agree.

699
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
But it's not an...

700
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,920
One or a physical one or maybe even one of cognition.

701
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,600
I mean, it's a discontinuity of, I don't know, it's a certain kind of thinking that may have

702
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,760
been quite accidental.

703
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,640
It's not as though science had a bunch of times and then petered out.

704
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,400
The Greeks had science, but then it kind of stopped after all the Arabs had a very flourishing

705
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,840
science in it that kind of didn't continue in a way.

706
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,320
So so far, we have one that continues and I think that's in many ways what we refer to

707
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
when we...

708
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,160
I mean, not just science, physics and all that, but a scientific frame of mind is what

709
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,640
we refer to as a kind of a modern mind and to me that is different and that's what gives

710
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,240
us I think the impression that we're different than so many other animals or cone habitants.

711
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,880
I think about the fossil record for certain other species.

712
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,200
I'm only going to talk about dolphins.

713
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,760
It's the only one I really feel comfortable talking about that I know anything about.

714
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,880
But you know, there's evidence that over time their brains got larger and the bodies remained

715
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,880
somewhat smaller.

716
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,440
So brain size has increased.

717
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
There's always the...

718
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Dolphins, cetaceans.

719
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
Dolphins and whales.

720
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,800
There's always the constraint of with mammals.

721
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,120
They have to be able to pass through a pelvic bone.

722
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,240
But the brains are large and complex and they've increased in size over time.

723
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
So that's interesting.

724
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,760
Again, those brains, you know, the overall bodies of these guys are pretty big and they're

725
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,160
in an aquatic environment.

726
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,640
So perhaps they're less constrained that way.

727
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:55,720
And then also you have arguments that depending on the...

728
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,720
That animals have.

729
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,680
For example, elephants and dolphins have been...

730
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,480
And humans are considered by many of the show the highest levels of...

731
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,600
There's some papers that have come out recently.

732
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,080
And some of that's really been attributed to...

733
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,040
In these groups and things like that.

734
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,280
So there are all sorts of different ways of thinking about intelligence and how we measure

735
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,280
it.

736
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,760
And I'm sorry, I'd go ahead.

737
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,600
I am on the fact that I don't...

738
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,280
Maybe I just disagree with everyone else here that there is just like a linear progression

739
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,920
that man is at...

740
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,920
Humans are at the Acme.

741
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,920
I just...

742
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,880
I actually don't believe that.

743
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,880
I mean, I don't...

744
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,880
How do you feel?

745
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
You feel there is a...

746
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,720
As opposed, I don't necessarily mean there have to be multiple intelligences.

747
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,720
I don't...

748
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,360
I'm not sure that I love the word intelligence to describe what any animal is doing, including

749
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,360
the human animal.

750
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,400
But I guess I'm more ethologically driven.

751
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,080
I'm interested in how the animal is fitting into its environment.

752
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,880
And if the question is maybe it's about success, you know?

753
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,720
I mean, if humans are going to survive, or I don't know if we're going to survive for

754
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,120
another 150 years, but there might be plenty of animals who do.

755
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,920
So are they then the Acme of biological, you know, of...

756
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,920
of neural...

757
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,360
Nearly founded organisms?

758
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,360
To me, I'm still...

759
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,360
I feel like it's a very...

760
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:16,520
Sometimes you squirrels, you know, get through the bird feeder that you've tried every single

761
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,440
conceivable way of, you know.

762
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,320
And if we're talking about your downing, your type of thing, then we see other animals doing.

763
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,440
So there are things which we seem to do alone.

764
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,840
That I absolutely assent to.

765
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:36,000
But I find the kind of complexities of other animals' behavior to be as radical.

766
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,160
And the fact that we can't go into their minds and say what they're doing in those moments

767
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,000
when they seem to be doing nothing doesn't mean to me that they're doing nothing.

768
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,800
It seems to me that we don't know what they're doing, which is a fault of our mind, not theirs.

769
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,440
I'm just trying to understand.

770
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,600
I thought a moment ago, you didn't agree with that you felt that there was a discontinuity.

771
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,600
Now it sounds like...

772
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,800
I'm not clear.

773
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,960
I think it's an odd way to pose the whole structure.

774
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:12,160
There either has to be a continuum or not, because we're at the top of it, right?

775
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,840
That there's some progression of sophistication of cognition.

776
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,000
And then the question you seem to be asking is how do we get very top of that?

777
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,840
What is it through some radical thing that happened?

778
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,720
Or is it sort of through small changes?

779
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,040
And I'm saying I don't think we're up at the top at all.

780
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,720
I think it's sort of messier than that.

781
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,720
That's the wrong...

782
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,880
I mean, that's also...

783
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,600
We now know that's the completely wrong way to think of evolution.

784
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,720
I mean, evolution is not a pyramid.

785
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,720
It's a bush.

786
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,720
It's a tree.

787
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,680
It's a plurality.

788
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,960
Every creature that currently exists is at the top of the evolutionary branch that it's

789
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
sifting.

790
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,960
Yeah.

791
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
But it's only...

792
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,040
I think you're absolutely right.

793
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:57,080
It's only when it comes to mentality or cognition that we insist on this more linear idea that

794
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,000
continuity no longer means a tree, which is also...

795
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,200
I mean, we believe in evolutionary continuity, but it no longer means a plurality of continuities.

796
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,760
It means a single one, a single line.

797
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,680
Here's the dumbest thing and we're the smartest thing.

798
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,560
And everybody has some place along the line, which I think is completely wrong.

799
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,560
Why not?

800
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,320
That's not the point of all of the stuff that we do.

801
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
I mean, what did you say?

802
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,400
90 million years for the dolphin, humans?

803
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
95...

804
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
Okay.

805
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,840
280 million for the parrots versus our last common ancestor with a dinosaur is 280 million

806
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,840
years ago.

807
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,400
I mean, yet, I've got this bird that's doing the same thing a five-year-old can do.

808
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Okay?

809
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,400
I mean, and again, we don't know some of the things that they're...

810
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,640
So why do you have to get it to do what a five-year-old can do and it didn't develop

811
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
itself?

812
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,640
The ability to do what a five-year-old can do?

813
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,920
Because I gave it a symbolic representation, which is what you give your five-year-old

814
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,920
to.

815
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,760
I mean, you don't put the five-year-old in a cage and say, here's some food and treats

816
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,120
and I'll come back in five years and see what you've done.

817
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,480
I mean, we give it this symbolic representation.

818
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,760
Our five-year-old representation and parrots didn't.

819
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,760
Well, we don't...

820
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:16,160
You know, the interesting thing is with all of these animals is that we are just beginning

821
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,280
to understand their communication systems and that's a whole mother, totally another

822
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,240
game plan here, is that...

823
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,240
I mean, we've been...

824
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,640
You know, for bird song, we've been sending bird songs since the 60s and we're just now

825
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,080
because we got so much better equipment.

826
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,160
Okay, being able to start to...

827
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,400
Just really start to tease apart what they're doing when they're sitting out there, you

828
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,560
know, it sounds like just pretty song to us, but we're beginning to learn that there's

829
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,040
so much more complexity.

830
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,520
Each song has a different...

831
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,880
I don't want to say exactly meaning because then you think of it as meaning like our language,

832
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:01,120
but each song has a different effect on the recipient and the recipient responds in a

833
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,720
different way depending on which song it's heard.

834
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,720
I mean, they're...

835
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,720
I used to call it Marsha Ren Poker, okay, because the bird would...

836
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,240
Each bird has like 50 songs and they have them in different orders and the birds know

837
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,400
not only their 50 songs orders, but their neighbor's 50 songs orders and they'll match

838
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,520
them and raise them one, okay?

839
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:26,520
So you know, you sing your 47 and I'll go, I'm going to sing your 48, but that's my 32,

840
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,000
but I know it's your 48, so I'm going to match you and raise you one to tell you that I want,

841
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,200
you know, your elbow is getting too close into my territory here.

842
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,800
I mean, these are things we're just beginning to learn, so I'm never going to argue that

843
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,240
their communication systems are as rich and as varied as ours.

844
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,400
At this point, it's not clear that they can sit there and tell you what they did yesterday,

845
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,400
okay?

846
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:59,440
Right, depends on us too, but the issue is that it is more complicated than we thought,

847
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,360
and I don't think...the one thing I'm sure of is that I couldn't have mapped whatever

848
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:11,320
English I did onto his abilities if there wasn't some basic cognitive architecture there.

849
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,280
I mean, if he didn't have some kind of innate, quote-unquote, sense of same and different,

850
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:21,520
I couldn't have mapped English terms of same and different onto it.

851
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,040
And that's a really critical point.

852
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,120
I sort of say, you know, again, we're pretty blind and deaf to what they can do.

853
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,760
We can't decode.

854
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,440
We don't have that magic decoder thing with these guys.

855
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,440
Yeah.

856
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,440
Right.

857
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,000
I mean, we have the sense system compared to a dog, there's like, there's such primitive

858
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
idiots.

859
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I mean...

860
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,480
So, I mean, the problem is not the one of them.

861
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,880
It's sort of something that we would all claim that we're against, but which we're all participating

862
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,360
in, and we're not careful, which is a kind of an anthropocentrism, right?

863
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:58,720
A anthropocentrism doesn't give other creatures human-like qualities, it's just the opposite.

864
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,880
It uses humans as the only way to measure anything.

865
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,880
Right.

866
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,720
Instead of looking at a plurality of cognitive abilities, a plurality of cognitions, a plurality

867
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:13,280
of consciousness, all the things brain tissue can do in whatever vehicle that happens to

868
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,680
be running in.

869
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,680
That seems to me to be a much more interesting kind of pursuit than worrying about how to

870
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:29,160
classify this stuff on a scale in which humans sort of denote the top level, some bug, the

871
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,160
bug, something like that.

872
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,160
If this is kidding, we don't have an octopus.

873
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,200
Let me kind of say something to challenge this idea.

874
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:41,360
Because the reason why, apart from the question of what's actually true about what happens

875
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:46,920
in human evolution, I've had the experience very often when I, let's say, give a talk

876
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,640
on anatomy.

877
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:57,480
When someone speaks up in a group and says, you know, we're really not, I've had people

878
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,560
say this to me in a group, in a seminar.

879
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,600
We're really not like monkeys.

880
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,480
We really have no connection to monkeys.

881
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,640
It turns out that they have very religious creationist kind of view.

882
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:16,360
People often side with Darwin, say, and very sort of come up to me later on and say, wow,

883
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,040
we don't believe in that.

884
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,600
We're not the animals.

885
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,840
We're part of the animal kingdom.

886
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,320
But I've also had the experience on the flip side that if I say to a group of people, you

887
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,560
don't really think that the law of natural selection explains what's happened with the

888
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,320
emergence of complex life forms, particularly the human life form, which by the way, I

889
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,080
have no trouble at all unique for vaccines.

890
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,080
And I think one way that we don't understand birds, I don't think we understand all the

891
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,640
human faculties either.

892
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:51,000
And when I say that flip side of it, people will often say, you're right, I don't believe

893
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
it.

894
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
And I've found that to be the same group, we'll go both ways.

895
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,480
In other words, our lived beliefs often don't reflect our intellectual beliefs.

896
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,920
Our intellectual belief in natural selection is often not people's lived belief.

897
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,720
And I want to know why, because the fact is that we all, why is it that, yes, I agree,

898
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:19,720
birds can do things we didn't dream of 100 years ago, but why is it that a six-year-old

899
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,600
can often outstrip what any bird can do?

900
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,600
Why?

901
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,120
What happened in humans to make them so smart?

902
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:32,960
Well, I'm not, when I say this, I don't, well, and birds can do things that six-year-olds

903
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,960
cannot do.

904
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:39,600
I don't mean to, I don't mean to say that humans are better in every respect than animals.

905
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,200
That's not my point of view.

906
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:47,240
I mean, Darwin remarked that the instincts of bees were as wonderful as human intelligence

907
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,480
in that comment.

908
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,040
He was, Darwin loved the animal kingdom.

909
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,040
He sort of almost worshiped it.

910
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,040
I agree with that.

911
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,600
I think cats, we have three cats, and I think they're unbelievable.

912
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:04,760
And they're far more sensitive in my home in many ways.

913
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,160
So I'm not saying humans are just somehow better in every respect, but with respect

914
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:16,320
to the question of decoupled cognizance, something has happened in humans that hasn't

915
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,920
happened with any other species.

916
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,600
And my question is why?

917
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,240
Does not explain it?

918
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,760
I think it only explains a part of it.

919
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,600
It can't explain all of it.

920
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,720
And one of the reasons why natural selection can't explain all of it is because natural

921
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:37,920
selection as a proposition already presupposes life and a proposition that includes something

922
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,480
like, in this case, life as part of the proposition can't explain something presupposed in the

923
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,280
process.

924
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,760
Natural selection sounds like an abstract principle, but it isn't.

925
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:55,160
It's a principle that says, hey, if they're a mating pair of birds that create four birds

926
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:01,600
every year, and the population of birds in a given area, assuming they're no incoming

927
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:06,360
and outgoing birds, remains the same, that means every year two out of four of the birds

928
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,360
are dying.

929
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:13,560
It's just a simple randomness principle that the ones that are let it for their environment

930
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,760
die and the ones that are slightly more, it's a randomness principle, but it presupposes

931
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,240
life and life is already moving toward a higher organization.

932
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
The question is why.

933
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,240
That's completely wrong.

934
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,120
Well, so I'm sorry.

935
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,080
So one of the things that evolution and natural selection...

936
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:34,920
Before you answer, I would like to hear from everyone on this question, not just told them

937
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,920
wrong, okay?

938
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,920
Okay.

939
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,960
So I would just say that I think one of the common errors about evolution and natural

940
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:47,720
selection is that it's an optimization procedure, that it's optimizing everything that the best

941
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,520
that there is and will continue to improve, that it's an improvement program, and that's

942
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,720
just simply not the case.

943
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,160
That's why 99.9% of the species that have ever existed on the planet are currently extinct.

944
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,840
So it's not very good at optimizing at all.

945
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,920
There's an old joke about this, which is a science joke, so it's not going to be funny.

946
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,160
Don't plan on laughing or anything, but two scientists are out camping one night in the

947
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,400
woods, you know, and the flated night and all of a sudden a bear begins to sort of attack

948
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,840
the tent and rattle the tent.

949
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,840
Well, they both jump up.

950
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,880
One of them starts putting his sneakers on, and the other one says, what are you telling

951
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,880
your sneakers over?

952
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,880
You can't outrun a bear.

953
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,320
He says, I just have to outrun you.

954
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,360
So you know, right?

955
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:32,200
So evolution is only optimized to outrun each other, so the other guy is the meal, not

956
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,680
the eater of the person.

957
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:42,680
So yeah, this is a better joke than I thought.

958
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,600
I didn't make it up.

959
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,040
So I think you will, I just think you have to be careful not to get in there.

960
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,240
So I in some ways agree with you.

961
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,280
I didn't say evolution is optimizing anything.

962
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:59,160
No, in fact, you might even have a better species than humans that doesn't get selected

963
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:05,360
next year, I mean, theoretically, because natural selection doesn't allow natural selection

964
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,440
as a principle isn't operating.

965
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,640
I'm saying it doesn't explain the whole question of how life is.

966
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,720
I agree with you because it's not an optimization thing.

967
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,560
It's nothing to do with optimization.

968
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,800
I mean, the fact that we're able to have this round table and smart enough to talk and all

969
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,360
the rest of this kind of stuff could just be some, probably likely is for sure some huge

970
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,360
accident.

971
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,080
It's a good one so far.

972
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,760
I mean, we don't really know how well it's going to work.

973
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,680
I mean, surely it will be extinct one day.

974
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,600
Everything else is why wouldn't we be?

975
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,400
So I'm just suggesting in some ways I'm actually supporting what you're saying.

976
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,160
I wouldn't use evolution to explain a scale of intelligence.

977
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,680
I wouldn't use it actually to explain a scale of anything.

978
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,800
So in that sense, I agree with you.

979
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,800
I just, so I think it's a strong man.

980
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,640
It's all arrow direction.

981
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,880
Evolution or there is.

982
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,000
So what's the purpose of that arrow direction?

983
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,240
Oh, there is no arrow of direction.

984
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,400
So I'm saying it's a sort of a strong man argument.

985
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,000
That's all I'm, my only point is not.

986
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,640
I don't believe evolution has an arrow either, but I believe life itself pushes toward organization.

987
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,680
And I know that's controversial, but the fact is that when you allow people to say, well,

988
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,680
you know, it does kind of appeal, this isn't species don't disappear.

989
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:22,480
There have been other, there seems to have been a species, an upright hominid that had

990
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,240
a larger brain than us that didn't make it.

991
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,360
So it's not as if something animal is meant to appear.

992
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,560
I'm not even suggesting that.

993
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:34,640
It does everything we've talked about is based on vertebrates.

994
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,280
I mean, most of our discussion.

995
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:44,200
And why is it that vertebrates go to, no, I know, cephalopods are amazing, but cephalopods

996
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:49,200
are not going to go past the design template that's allowed them.

997
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,720
I think some cephalopods appear to be incredibly smart in ways that we, I don't think we should

998
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,720
eat an octopus.

999
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,640
I think they seem to be to be too smart.

1000
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,480
And I don't like to eat animals that are, that's smart.

1001
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:10,400
But they have a design that's doesn't, isn't going to go past what their design allows.

1002
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,080
In the same way, I think that a bird design can't go past what a bird design allows.

1003
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,760
But do you say that you don't know what the design is going to go?

1004
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,760
Yeah.

1005
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,680
Well, they've been, because it's not, as far as I can tell, I mean, I'm the expert on an

1006
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,680
octopus.

1007
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:30,040
But as far as I know, design can't, it can't morph, it can't somehow get bones.

1008
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,600
We haven't seen an octopus appear.

1009
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,120
Didn't we come out of the water, basically?

1010
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,640
Well, no, what do we look like in the water?

1011
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,120
No, but an octopus has gone in a particular line of evolution.

1012
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,040
It can't go backwards in people's bones.

1013
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,040
I'm just saying.

1014
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,040
No, but I don't, I disagree.

1015
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,520
I don't think that's the case.

1016
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,760
I mean, it certainly, it's been for quite a period of time, but there's nothing that

1017
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:56,560
foundationally biologically is against it evolving into something slightly different.

1018
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:04,320
I think that are there, that, you know, there's a pile of scents that sits around and will

1019
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:08,600
only get expressed under certain conditions.

1020
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:13,560
I mean, it's the Darwin's Finches things, where you start switching things around and

1021
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,280
then they'll change and back and forth.

1022
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:22,320
Then it got the pie that actually walk sometimes on two of their, you know, legs, arms, and

1023
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,320
you could see where bipedal and you could see under certain circumstances that could

1024
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,040
be selected for, there might be advantages and things.

1025
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:33,440
I mean, I think we have to be really careful about saying where animals can, how they

1026
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,360
can and cannot change and the college epigenetic thing.

1027
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:42,720
What it looks like in the case of human cognition or human mental abilities is, there's something

1028
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,600
that's going faster than you could explain by evolution.

1029
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:51,600
Something has developed that you can't simply use an evolution for because there's been

1030
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,120
enough time in a way.

1031
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,440
And I mean, I agree with you.

1032
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,640
My only concern is I feel like it's a strong man argument.

1033
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,640
I'm not quite saying that.

1034
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,880
I'm saying that a natural selection alone doesn't explain it.

1035
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,320
Yeah, I also, but so I was a little concerned.

1036
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,440
So what do you mean by life tries to get better or so?

1037
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,440
What did you say?

1038
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,440
Exactly.

1039
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,440
About living matter, does something?

1040
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,440
It verdence.

1041
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,440
It sounds like it had a point.

1042
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:24,240
Well, you know, it sounds nice when you're using a, when we talk the language of science,

1043
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,040
it sounds, you know, we have a sort of, seem to have a preference for sort of arguments

1044
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:33,320
about randomness or, and we tend to get cynical and say, well, human beings at 30, everything

1045
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:37,320
deteriorates, you know, we're not really meant to be here.

1046
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:42,720
We're sort of meant to die off and we keep our elders alive because it seems more civilized.

1047
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:48,520
And so the cynical language, I don't think that's really what's going on with humans.

1048
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,680
I think with vertebrates are what they are.

1049
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,440
And intelligence has developed because they express a level of complexity that you don't

1050
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,760
find in other animals.

1051
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:06,040
I mean, an animal with an external skeleton can't, again, I'm no expert on insects, but

1052
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:11,960
an animal with an exoskeleton sort of is a dead end in terms of design.

1053
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:17,840
But the vertebrate design was so, with the internal skeleton, the internal skeleton,

1054
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:24,400
the musculature on the outside going on to land, which a flexible design that it allowed

1055
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,240
pull, you know, like a book of marvels.

1056
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,720
It allowed all these different animals to emerge, which we're looking at and we're

1057
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,800
one of them.

1058
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:38,240
And that is based on the complex multi-celled design that we have.

1059
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,240
How does life push in that direction?

1060
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,320
Why does it push in that direction?

1061
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,760
It's got organization.

1062
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,400
Life, we haven't understood what makes life what it is.

1063
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:53,560
And one of the properties seems to me is that it is self-organizing and it puts different

1064
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,520
ways of organizing itself.

1065
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,920
And I know scientists don't like that, but...

1066
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,240
I can't really understand as a useful expert.

1067
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,280
Well, I just can't understand it as a useful explanation.

1068
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,440
It looks that way.

1069
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,760
Yeah, but you don't defy the second law of thermodynamics.

1070
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,440
I don't care who you are.

1071
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,080
I don't care how great you think we are.

1072
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,440
The second law of thermodynamics, I'm sorry.

1073
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,560
What's remarkable about us is that we figured out there's a second law of thermodynamics.

1074
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,440
That I will admit to you, that's one of the most remarkable...

1075
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,720
A mentation I can ever imagine, but you don't get away with it.

1076
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,800
That's like biblical, second law of thermodynamics.

1077
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,120
You don't mess with that.

1078
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:38,200
I just don't think there's any indication that we ever get away with it.

1079
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,200
If life is...

1080
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,040
If there's only entropy, if things are only...

1081
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:47,240
How is it that we're all sitting here and can maintain our organized life forms in such

1082
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,400
a high level even...

1083
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,240
The other word, using up the planet to do it.

1084
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,240
That's how we do it.

1085
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,240
We use up the planet.

1086
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,240
Which is fine.

1087
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,240
I'm not even against that.

1088
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,400
You know, I don't necessarily...

1089
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,140
But within reason, I suppose.

1090
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,680
But in point, that's how we do it.

1091
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,600
The course of our life and species itself could fall apart.

1092
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,560
I mean, we're just a snapshot.

1093
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,520
I feel like we're very focused in our...

1094
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,640
We're very provincial in our looking.

1095
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,000
I mean, of course we're going to be anthropocentric.

1096
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,760
We're anthrows.

1097
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,760
That's...

1098
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:22,140
I think the only thing we can do is be aware, but also the temporal probability.

1099
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:27,300
like we see here and we see, you know, we know what's happening right then and maybe

1100
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,540
what happened yesterday.

1101
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:32,940
I mean, actually that is very narrow and what is actually happening in the species or what's

1102
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:37,260
actually the case with our species I think is very hard to say.

1103
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:38,820
I don't want to say it.

1104
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,740
You know, I think we are probably.

1105
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:46,140
I'm more of a believer in physics than biology there.

1106
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,140
We're falling apart.

1107
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:55,580
When I say this organization, I see some people nodding and when I say this, this organization

1108
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,580
is so people.

1109
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:05,900
Interesting sort of area of psychology, which I don't know that much about, but it really

1110
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:14,460
is again, a dependent thing, which means the way you phrase a particular question affects

1111
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,100
the kind of answer you get.

1112
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:21,900
And I'm wondering if we're dancing around that a little bit too.

1113
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,500
So that there's certain ways you say, well, you know, would you, it's a study about it

1114
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,140
says, you know, there's a certain amount of for doing something.

1115
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,940
You probably know this better than I and it's like you can say it's that 50% of the people

1116
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:37,100
will get this disease or you could say so many people out of a certain number will get this

1117
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:41,620
disease and if you phrase it one way, it's much more positive than the other.

1118
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:44,060
You probably can.

1119
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:49,580
There's something about being liars, damn liars, mathematicians.

1120
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:55,820
But this whole, it's an entire subset of psychology that basically, what do you think in Madison

1121
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,900
Avenue certainly takes advantage of it.

1122
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:03,980
So that there are, there are ways of phrasing certain types of questions and you have to

1123
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,380
be very careful about that too.

1124
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:07,380
Yes.

1125
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:14,620
I mean, I think the danger, I think what Alex Andrews saying is that we are trapped if

1126
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:18,100
we're not very careful in a fairly parochial view of things.

1127
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,700
It's very local and it's very hard.

1128
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:26,700
I mean, this is why pseudoscience is so, it gets purchased so easily because it's very

1129
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,220
hard not to look.

1130
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:33,420
I mean, there's a great story by Wittgenstein, apparently at some point was walking with

1131
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:40,020
a friend and said, it's always a man, people so long to figure out that the earth is rotating

1132
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,100
and the sun is standing still.

1133
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:46,220
And his friend said, well, but Ludwig, it looks that way, doesn't it?

1134
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:50,660
And we can see because what would it look like if the earth were rotating and the sun

1135
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:51,660
was standing still?

1136
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:53,780
It looks like what it is, you know?

1137
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:55,300
But it does just look that way.

1138
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:58,940
And indeed, it's still very hard to figure out why it is the earth is spinning in a thousand

1139
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:02,700
miles an hour and the birds and the clouds aren't being left behind.

1140
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,740
I mean, really, most people could not tell you how that is.

1141
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:10,180
I'm not so sure I could in a way that you would believe me.

1142
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:12,100
So but it's very easy to have these.

1143
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,540
I mean, we still all live in a pre-kapurnican world.

1144
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:19,260
We're real smart folks sitting in this room and we say, what time is the sun setting?

1145
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:25,500
Well, the sun's not setting and it's not, you know, but that's the way it goes, you

1146
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,800
know?

1147
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:32,260
We live in a Newtonian world and that's not true either, really, but it serves our purposes.

1148
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,980
But you're going to have these parochial views and believe there's a lot of truth in them.

1149
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:38,100
And I think that's a potential danger.

1150
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,100
You have to be covered.

1151
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:49,020
You do have to try and expand it a bit as much as you possibly can, it seems to me.

1152
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:56,020
We do, who are studying animals is give examples of animals doing something which seems to

1153
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:03,860
us who is evidence of a kind of cognition and then maybe somebody will give a counter-example

1154
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:06,300
of a person doing something like that.

1155
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:10,220
And that's also a way of defining our terms.

1156
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:14,460
I mean, we're trying to just get traction and to get any funding or anybody to take

1157
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,940
you seriously when you're dealing with the non-human animals.

1158
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:17,940
That's part of it.

1159
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:21,700
But also, what if we all just talked about the mistakes that we see animals make or the

1160
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:26,940
mistakes that humans make and had that be defining of what the species were, we would

1161
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:31,860
look very different as people as opposed to looking at our high achievements and being

1162
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:34,060
so impressed by our high achievements.

1163
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:39,740
I'm thinking about all the mistakes I've recently made.

1164
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:45,060
Would that be defining of me as a human being, as a member of the species?

1165
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:48,860
Would that be any more indicative maybe of what the human is?

1166
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:55,140
Human species and we talk about, well, no animal is a Picasso or a Beethoven or an Einstein,

1167
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,700
but there's only been a Picasso.

1168
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:05,140
I mean, the thing is we look at these exceptional individuals and we say, well, humans are capable

1169
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:08,700
of this because one or two of these individuals have done this.

1170
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:14,300
But the average person on the street, I mean, I can't comparatively carry a tune, much

1171
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:17,820
less do what Beethoven did.

1172
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:22,900
So again, we also have to think about it in those ways that we put ourselves on this

1173
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:28,780
pinnacle and also in academia, there's even a stronger chance of this because we hang

1174
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:32,180
out with all these elites and stuff.

1175
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,460
So this is another thing that we have to think about too.

1176
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:40,380
I mean, even the psych studies, we talk about now that these students being weird, you know,

1177
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:45,460
up educated, you know, I mean, it's like we're all the studies we do in psychology, they're

1178
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:49,980
all in, you know, college sophomores, okay, and we try to claim that this is representative

1179
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:50,980
of the human race.

1180
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,980
I mean, this is insane.

1181
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:58,620
I think one of the themes I think that's emerging or it's conversation from the idea

1182
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:02,860
of plurality and different ways of thinking is, you know, again, we're the ones talking

1183
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:03,860
about it.

1184
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:07,900
A really broad look and you look at insect societies, you look at the algebra, I keep

1185
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,900
remembering I have dolphins just because I study them.

1186
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:13,460
These are societies and they're in every way.

1187
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:17,460
When you look at a dolphin society, they have not altered their environment much.

1188
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,620
They can't relate it, but their bodies have changed morphologically.

1189
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:27,900
They've radically streamlined to adapt to their environment and beautifully continue

1190
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:30,060
to change, obviously, as we've seen it.

1191
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:33,420
And they find ways to coordinate their behavior.

1192
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:38,900
They show exquisite complexity and they're not destroying their environment.

1193
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:41,700
So you know, again, this sort of gets back to you.

1194
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:46,700
Big brains taking care of their own operating, helping others.

1195
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:52,860
I mean, that's pretty cool in my book about what is sort of evolved and it just hasn't

1196
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,740
evolved in our way.

1197
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:58,420
We've taken another route and we're facing a lot of problems now.

1198
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:01,100
Dolphins may be facing other problems we aren't aware of.

1199
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,660
But again, I think we have...

1200
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:07,060
The stream is at the Mark Moffatt who's an entomologist, a specialist.

1201
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,860
Have you ever had him at one of these things?

1202
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:10,340
You should have Mark Moffatt.

1203
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,540
Yeah, well, I'll get him to come over here.

1204
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,620
He's busy with his hands all the time.

1205
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:18,740
But Mark points out that there are really only two species on the planet that live in

1206
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:23,660
societies that number into the millions and that are willing to live in a society in which

1207
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:28,300
they don't pretty much know within one or two degrees of separation, at least everybody

1208
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,300
in the society.

1209
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,620
They don't live with strangers.

1210
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:34,580
So chimp troops and things like that, all number under 100...

1211
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:39,100
The only two species that are willing to live in vast numbers with strangers all around

1212
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,100
them.

1213
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:43,580
They're sitting in a room like full of strangers here, right?

1214
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,660
And it's just us and ants.

1215
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:47,660
And only certain...

1216
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,540
We live in these huge colonies where they just...

1217
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,660
There's no way they know everybody, but they do it.

1218
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:52,660
They're fine with it.

1219
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:53,660
And us, weird, huh?

1220
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:54,660
I don't know.

1221
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:55,660
It makes you feel creepy.

1222
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,660
That's...

1223
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:09,940
One of the reasons why I originally brought this subject up with Diana.

1224
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:14,940
And then you, Stuart, and I think...

1225
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:25,460
I think you were also there when we first discussed this was...

1226
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:28,860
I was looking at it the other way around.

1227
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:35,180
We focused on what animals can do and animals or intelligence and their ability to learn

1228
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:36,620
and so on.

1229
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:42,940
I was also interested the other way because with my background in psychoanalysis, so my

1230
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:46,620
focus has always been the mind.

1231
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:55,180
It has not been on, in what ways, a lot of things that we attribute motivation to are

1232
01:11:55,180 --> 01:12:02,220
really biologically determined just as they are in animals.

1233
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:09,340
And so a lot of things we do say similar to what you said.

1234
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:14,780
A newborn turns towards the mother's breast and sucks on the breast.

1235
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:21,860
And in psychoanalysis, there is an idea that from Freud that this is the beginning of

1236
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:26,100
psychosexual development and there's pleasure attached to it and so on.

1237
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,820
And so animals do it too.

1238
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:36,780
So my question is, and I wonder if you can say something a little bit more about that.

1239
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:43,500
This excessive focus on the mind in understanding people's behavior is incomplete.

1240
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:50,100
And how would understanding animals' behavior help us understand more human behavior?

1241
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,820
Can I raise my hand on that one?

1242
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:58,140
So this is something I find really interesting particularly when we get in the area of social

1243
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:01,500
sexual behavior in humans and other animals.

1244
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,580
Obviously, we're a lot more tolerant in our society now than we were before.

1245
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:13,540
You look at other animals like binobos, which are very sophisticated primates and dolphins,

1246
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:18,460
and you look at the development of what we call socio-sexual behavior.

1247
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:21,060
So I'll give you the shortest possible story here.

1248
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:26,020
So we had studied two mothers on their calves in a facility.

1249
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:31,740
What you see is that what looks to be the adult sexual behavior pattern and much of

1250
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:35,260
social behavior develops with mothers and infants.

1251
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:39,340
They are stimulating their babies, they're nursing their babies, they're nursing their

1252
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:42,580
babies, they're not the ventrum solicitors of babies.

1253
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:47,380
There may be some where we don't know where the baby starts nursing, one creases, the

1254
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:49,620
mother tends to direct it.

1255
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:54,540
Then the mother is also stimulating the big genital area with her big genital area.

1256
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:58,540
Then you see these chases that ensue, the baby sprints off from the mother, the mother's

1257
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:00,460
chasing the baby.

1258
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:05,980
As I was watching this, I was looking and I'm saying I'm seeing the courtship behavior

1259
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:09,740
pattern in the adult pattern.

1260
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:13,620
I found it fascinating because again, when you think about the roots of sociality and

1261
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:18,020
sexuality, it may come from these very early interactions.

1262
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:22,220
Then we saw these two young children had shown these interactions with their mothers.

1263
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:25,260
Now in their first months, that's how they start interacting.

1264
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:28,140
That's what they know, solicitors.

1265
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,340
You see this in the wild, it's not just in a captive situation.

1266
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,980
We obviously want to keep looking.

1267
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:36,740
But I think there's a great deal that can be learned about the nature of what, again,

1268
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:38,660
the socio-sexual behavior.

1269
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:45,900
You look at male dolphins and people who don't know about dolphins say, oh, they're gay

1270
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,020
or they're homosexual.

1271
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,020
They're not.

1272
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,260
They're interacting socially.

1273
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:51,700
That is their behavior.

1274
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:57,980
And female distress and start soliciting, it becomes reproductive behavior.

1275
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:02,140
I think it broadens our view of these big-brained animals.

1276
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:08,340
I think in our own species, take away the biblical underpinnings of what we should be

1277
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,580
doing and what we shouldn't.

1278
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,620
I think that may be much more natural state.

1279
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:16,380
We see with bonobo societies a great deal of behavior with penguins.

1280
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:21,220
We see much more socio-sexual behavior in the animal world.

1281
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:23,660
And humans are part of the animal world.

1282
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,660
So when I open her.

1283
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:34,020
A lot of things that we assume we are deciding to act in a certain way or do certain things

1284
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:36,460
are in fact biologically detailed.

1285
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:38,100
It's not like residing.

1286
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,660
What's a different meaning?

1287
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:40,660
No, no.

1288
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,660
It's a different panel.

1289
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:42,660
You're on the wrong panel.

1290
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:53,500
No, but what I'm trying to say is that there's certain that we assume we are an agenting,

1291
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:56,980
that we really are simply repeating what...

1292
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:57,980
One of many.

1293
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:02,540
Yeah, I'm guessing about 98% of the things we do are not.

1294
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:03,540
But that's...

1295
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:04,540
Yes.

1296
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,900
Franz de Valds going to be speaking next week at the American Museum and doing a great

1297
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,900
talk on empathy.

1298
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:12,300
But I'd also say there's another view as to how this kind of thing can tell us about human

1299
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:17,540
behavior, which is actually I think Alexandra's point of view, which is we can learn about

1300
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:23,020
our own behavior by the things we project onto a dog.

1301
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:28,140
So when it comes to domestic animals, of course, we're in a selection seat with domestic animals.

1302
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:31,900
So we select for things that appeal to us...

1303
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:35,580
...of lee or food wise maybe, our taste buds.

1304
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:40,180
But in the case of dogs that we don't eat, we're clearly selecting for traits that we

1305
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,180
find appealing.

1306
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:44,100
So this must tell us something about us.

1307
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:48,420
And I know you're work enough to know that we make all sorts of mistakes about what they

1308
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,700
do because we've rejected on them, right?

1309
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:51,700
Right.

1310
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,500
Many of our projections could probably...

1311
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,620
I mean, could be...

1312
01:16:55,620 --> 01:17:01,460
But most of them really are reflections on ourself, it seems to me.

1313
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:05,740
And as to that question of kind of what looking at animal behavior could tell us about human

1314
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:11,020
behavior, I think because we don't have an actual human mind, we do that.

1315
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:12,540
We just attribute.

1316
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:16,100
And as scientists, we say, okay, don't attribute and so just look at behavior.

1317
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,300
But so we're kind of...

1318
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,300
We're given...

1319
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,180
There's too much richness in the human.

1320
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:23,900
We have, we think, access to each other's minds, or at least a way we feel like it's

1321
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:27,900
going to be roughly analogous to my mind, right?

1322
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:30,100
And so we don't even really look at behavior so much.

1323
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:35,420
I mean, those who look at behavior like an ethologist, a human behavior, I think...

1324
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:40,500
One of those same types of patterns that Diane is talking about with the dolphins, right?

1325
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:47,100
And we recapitulate the kind of behavior, action patterns we have in our early life later

1326
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,100
on.

1327
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:53,860
And again, the ones that work to get the mate or get the friendship or get the job, we keep

1328
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:56,740
those ones and we do away with the other ones.

1329
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:58,660
But it's the same type of thing.

1330
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:01,460
It's just that we talk about it at a higher level, right?

1331
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,140
And all of those cognitive...

1332
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:04,140
The words we talk...

1333
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:07,700
I mean, this is what is so interesting about, you know, as...

1334
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:12,820
Narrative psychologists, all of us who are looking at non-human minds, are words are human

1335
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:13,940
words for human development.

1336
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,460
When do we get a theory of mind?

1337
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:16,900
When do we have self-awareness?

1338
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:20,740
When do we develop empathy or secondary emotions and so forth?

1339
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:23,900
But with all of those, we could say, well, do we really have it?

1340
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:27,900
You know, theory of mind is one of those great ones where the theory of mind is thinking

1341
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:32,620
the thing that all humans develop, that we're thinking at about age three or four, what

1342
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:35,300
other people know or believe that's different from ourselves.

1343
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:39,100
You know, before age three, children aren't really doing that, right?

1344
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:43,300
They're classically egocentric and they think everybody knows what we know.

1345
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:47,100
But at age four, they realize they have to wait until their mother is out of the room

1346
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,700
to cookie, right?

1347
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:51,940
And then they can deceive her because she doesn't know about that.

1348
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:55,740
Well, but you could also look at a lot of human behavior and say, are we really acting

1349
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:56,740
with a theory of mind?

1350
01:18:56,740 --> 01:19:02,540
I mean, it's what I'm doing now in my attempt to communicate, taking into account what everybody,

1351
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:07,140
maybe it's imploring everybody else is bringing to the subject so that we are best communicating,

1352
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,540
certainly not.

1353
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:12,420
I'm just talking, you know, and I'm hoping that some of it hits, right?

1354
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:17,220
And I have a general, I'd make a general guess as to what other people's understanding

1355
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:22,740
it, and how they came to their, the words they're using.

1356
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:26,940
But I certainly, I might be in the theory of mind at that level.

1357
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:32,380
And so the better way would really be, I mean, I am totally an ethologist, but to look at

1358
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:40,380
me and just say, how do I change my behavior to best suit situations?

1359
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:45,740
And that would explain to me huge amounts of, you know, what Freud also tries to explain

1360
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,740
using the mind.

1361
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:52,020
So Ed, so I, let me give an alternative.

1362
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:58,020
You could, I sort of am a human ethologist, as some of you know, I teach the Alexander

1363
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:00,660
technique and my own ideas on this.

1364
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:05,980
So I sort of daily observe people and I teach people performing actions.

1365
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:12,620
And one thing that I observed early on as a teacher, and I, as well, is that even a simple

1366
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:18,420
so-called voluntary movement in a human being is not nearly as voluntary as it appears.

1367
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:22,620
And you could demonstrate this with someone, you could ask them not to perform an action,

1368
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:27,380
and they'll agree with you that they will not, that they do not intend to and will not.

1369
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:32,420
And then you could actually vicariously perform the movement for them, and they will perform

1370
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:35,580
it against their will very often.

1371
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,500
And you're, in my view, by the way, you're demonstrating mind.

1372
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,940
I mean, you're demonstrating that they've, there's no way to account, except to say

1373
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:48,420
that they action, you know, borrowing from William James, who described this kind of thing

1374
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,620
years ago.

1375
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:56,980
So in even the simplest action, you could describe in humans, you could, you can observe

1376
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:02,460
something very mechanical and determined sort of.

1377
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:09,660
And in that respect, not very different from other animals, the problem is that humans,

1378
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:15,740
unlike any other animal, are capable of observing that and actually raising the process of how

1379
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:18,060
they do things to a more conscious level.

1380
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:19,100
And that's one thing that I study.

1381
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:24,700
I study, I use the word mindfulness, but I study kind of mindfulness as a psychophysical

1382
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:27,820
process, not just attentional.

1383
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:35,340
And my question is, if all, if all human behavior can be reduced, or 98% of it can be reduced

1384
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:40,900
to what we see in animals, why is it that we're capable of being mindful about it all

1385
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:41,900
the time?

1386
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:48,380
Why is it that we're capable of actually observing our, let's say, selfish motives and saying,

1387
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:49,660
I don't want to behave that way.

1388
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:53,740
I actually see that something I want to say is pretty much a need to speak, so I'm not

1389
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:55,300
going to say that.

1390
01:21:55,300 --> 01:22:02,020
This quality, this capacity in humans, to me, it separates humans from all the other animals.

1391
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:05,180
And it separates our behavior from any animal behavior.

1392
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:06,580
Mindfulness alone.

1393
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:15,140
And what worries me is that people will go to a Buddhist seminar, and they say, this

1394
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,140
is great.

1395
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:19,080
And then the next week, they'll go to a scientific seminar, and they say, no, we're

1396
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,900
not going to be animals.

1397
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:21,900
Well which is it?

1398
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:22,900
I mean, listen.

1399
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:23,900
I guess that.

1400
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:24,900
I get that.

1401
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:25,900
I get that.

1402
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:26,900
I get that.

1403
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:31,980
I'm saying that no other animals can show constraint or conscious thought about self or

1404
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:32,980
control.

1405
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:35,140
Here, I'll stand on my ground.

1406
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:40,820
And no animal is capable of being mindful of practicing conscious attention.

1407
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:41,820
Oh, wait.

1408
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:42,820
What does that mean?

1409
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:43,820
Yeah.

1410
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:45,820
Let's get into a definition here.

1411
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:46,820
Yeah.

1412
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:47,820
Define it.

1413
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:48,820
I don't know what you mean either.

1414
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:50,580
Can you tell us exactly what you mean?

1415
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:59,100
Well, a very simple, you know, sort of in the moment description of mindfulness is simply

1416
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:04,780
doing something and being able to do it, being consciously aware while you do it.

1417
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:05,780
Yes.

1418
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:06,780
Well, wait a minute.

1419
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:07,780
Let me talk about this.

1420
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:14,340
But this is only a very fringe of what humans are capable of.

1421
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,820
I mean, you're capable of.

1422
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:18,900
I really don't understand that either.

1423
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,660
Well, I know, but this is why I think I'm here.

1424
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:23,660
And this is because I noticed that everyone's pointing at me.

1425
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:25,940
But you need to articulate a little bit better.

1426
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:26,940
Okay.

1427
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,940
But give me an example.

1428
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,420
Give me a solid example.

1429
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:40,220
The other problem with when we try to explain human behavior by looking at animal behavior

1430
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:46,180
is that we segregate the aspects of human behavior that are clearly, in my view, clearly

1431
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:47,580
different.

1432
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:52,500
And then when you say, hey, this is what I think is clearly different, people say, well,

1433
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,780
is that even there?

1434
01:23:53,780 --> 01:24:03,660
Well, mindfulness is not an easy discipline to learn, but we know it can be learned.

1435
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:05,700
I mean, there's just no question about this.

1436
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:09,660
We know that martial artists practice it, people in meditation practice it.

1437
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:14,660
So, trying to explain what that is may not be so easy.

1438
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:19,340
I believe that there are a number of faculties like that similar to that that aren't not

1439
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:21,460
just mindfulness, but anyway.

1440
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:35,220
But what you're trying to argue is that a parrot sitting on a perd would not be mindful.

1441
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,220
How would we?

1442
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:39,140
Well, I'm not studying parrots.

1443
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:42,140
Well, I mean, any.

1444
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:44,940
You know, I study children.

1445
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:46,420
I study children.

1446
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:49,100
And I study children, you know, from a fairly young age.

1447
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:57,460
So, in my view, kids cannot even remotely approach what mindfulness is clearly not till

1448
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:03,100
they're in their teens and generally speaking later after their teens cannot even begin

1449
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:04,100
to approach it.

1450
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:07,620
So, to me, it's a cognitive skill.

1451
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:13,660
And so, because I see it, see it, how difficult it is, you can't even speak of a toddler being

1452
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:14,660
mindful.

1453
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:15,740
It's just not possible.

1454
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:19,380
And that's why I'm willing to make the transition to animals.

1455
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:24,620
From what I understand of mindfulness, and it's not something I've got the idea of sort

1456
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:29,540
of monitoring your own feelings and thoughts and becoming more aware of your motivations

1457
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:36,540
and your overall surrounding, it's an expanded awareness of you and one aspect of that.

1458
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:37,540
Okay.

1459
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:41,060
So, it can also be being aware of proprioceptively.

1460
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:48,140
Let's say you're sitting here and you're aware not just having kinesthetic or proprioceptive

1461
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:53,500
input about your body, but monitoring it constantly so that it's something that's always in your

1462
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:54,500
background awareness.

1463
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:59,620
It could be, there are various ways, or you could be focused on someone, as I am, let's

1464
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:03,340
say to you, but I also may be aware of my peripheral field.

1465
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:07,780
And I'm aware of you so that it's something that if I were a martial artist, I can't

1466
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:12,860
do that, so that even when I'm attending selectively, someone could enter the room and I would see

1467
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:14,820
them enter the room.

1468
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:15,820
This is...

1469
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:16,820
There's no animals going to survive if they can.

1470
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:20,540
No, I know, but yeah, I'll make a distinction.

1471
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:21,540
Cats, cats, and dog...

1472
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:22,980
I mean, again, I know cats and...

1473
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:24,380
Some cats and dogs pretty well.

1474
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:30,740
Cats are very, very alert in various ways, but they are...

1475
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:33,260
I think this is going to elicit a lot of controversy.

1476
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,180
They are subconsciously alert.

1477
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:38,420
They can't be consciously alert by definition.

1478
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:40,340
Oh, wait a minute.

1479
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:42,340
I don't understand that.

1480
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:45,580
Yeah, perhaps, but I'm going to make it.

1481
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:47,980
And I've written a whole book on this subject.

1482
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:52,980
Well, having written a book on this subject actually doesn't make it any less unfounded.

1483
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:53,980
Yeah, yeah.

1484
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:54,980
Okay.

1485
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:56,980
You know, the fact that we don't have any...

1486
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:59,980
It's like we have like...

1487
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:04,860
That's just that lovely thing, which we do with each other when we don't know something

1488
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:11,300
about a topic like the mind of a bird that we just assume there's nothing in there, or

1489
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:13,780
that it's just going to be some variation of ours.

1490
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:15,620
I get that, but it's as if now I'm saying...

1491
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:18,700
It's not that I get that, but it's that is...

1492
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:21,700
The core of your question, you're saying like the difference is...

1493
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,380
And I could be wrong, so please, correct me.

1494
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:28,980
But you're saying the difference is that animals might be alert and yet...

1495
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:33,420
Something that's happening, the periphery, sort of that mindful in the moment thing, but

1496
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:37,620
the difference is that we are conscious and animals are not conscious.

1497
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:41,900
However, I can't know that I'm right about saying that animals are not conscious, but

1498
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:43,900
that doesn't matter.

1499
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:44,900
Let me...

1500
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,940
I'll tell you why I think there's a...

1501
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:49,620
The distinction to me is...

1502
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:51,620
I don't think I'm making an unwarranted assumption.

1503
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:53,060
I'll say why.

1504
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:54,060
Because we all know...

1505
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,060
We've all...

1506
01:27:55,060 --> 01:28:00,060
I assume everyone here has handled infants and sees how an infant...

1507
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:05,300
So very often, let's say a four or five month old infant is highly alert.

1508
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:08,500
Do you think that the infant has a sense of self?

1509
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:12,460
In my experience, an infant has a sense of self in the way that we do.

1510
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:18,260
The consciousness that we ascribe to humans to add to humans, in general, I would not

1511
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:19,700
ascribe but to a four month old.

1512
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:20,700
I don't...

1513
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:25,900
Say that we do not know if an animal, if a child has a sense of self at that age, now

1514
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:30,020
the way we define it, it seems because we're using specific experiment...

1515
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:31,500
With the five year old...

1516
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,500
One could...

1517
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,500
But there's a lot more...

1518
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:37,180
They don't pass certain tests.

1519
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:38,180
That's fair.

1520
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:44,380
That suggests that these kids at four to six months old, and I wish I skimmed just the

1521
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:45,540
abstract of this paper.

1522
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:47,540
I wish I had read it before coming here.

1523
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:51,740
But there was something to do with, you know, attributing something or other.

1524
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:55,540
And they were showing this in a six month old through a looking task.

1525
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:59,220
The surprise about something or other.

1526
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:00,220
It's not just...

1527
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:04,300
But since somebody else was doing this, they were checking the...

1528
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:07,300
The cathekin and EKG type thing.

1529
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:13,660
And the brain was triggering in the way that it would only trigger if the child was very

1530
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:17,060
much aware of what it thought the other person was going to do.

1531
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,060
It's like the...

1532
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,060
Okay.

1533
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:22,940
It was something like the person was looking at a box and the person...

1534
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:26,860
And you put a ball into the box and the cover went over it.

1535
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:31,220
And the thing was either the surreptitiously taken off or taken off in view or something.

1536
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:34,860
And the child was either surprised or not at whether the person was going to go for the

1537
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:38,500
ball because they should or should not think the ball was there.

1538
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:42,740
I'm doing this in a very sloppy way, but I'm trying to give you a feeling for this experiment.

1539
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:49,060
The point was that the child's brain responded the same way an adult's brain would respond

1540
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:54,700
in that situation based on an attribution of what they thought this other person would

1541
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,860
expect to find in the box.

1542
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:58,860
Okay.

1543
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,860
Which, when I read that, I went, I want to read the whole paper because...

1544
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:05,500
They didn't even have the motor skills and the cognitive wear with all to express it.

1545
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,460
I mean, comprehension proceeds production in terms of language.

1546
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,460
They're stuck.

1547
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:12,020
I mean, when we look at animals, we're like looking at pre-verbal babies.

1548
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,020
You know, so...

1549
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:16,140
Just to read down, we are going in a different direction which has to do with the issue of

1550
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:17,140
consciousness.

1551
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:19,860
But since it's four o'clock, we will stop.

1552
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:20,860
Ah.

1553
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:27,980
So, please, here, make your comments brief.

1554
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:29,940
Don't make three different comments.

1555
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:30,940
Just one.

1556
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:31,940
Otherwise.

1557
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:32,940
Otherwise.

1558
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:33,940
Yeah.

1559
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:34,940
I stopped at consciousness.

1560
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:52,940
I didn't plan on this, but just a couple of quick observations.

1561
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:53,940
Just one.

1562
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:54,940
Just one.

1563
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:55,940
Please.

1564
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:56,940
The mic's not wrong.

1565
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:57,940
Well...

1566
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:00,940
It's half of the time I'm making one.

1567
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:05,940
I'm just talking about the other side.

1568
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:10,940
It occurs to me, and I can't be sure that there's been a sense that the understanding

1569
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:15,940
of the design is not taking into account the visceral understanding of geologic time and

1570
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:20,940
everything that they've designed.

1571
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:21,940
Yeah.

1572
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:22,940
Oh, yeah.

1573
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:23,940
Okay.

1574
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:24,940
So, I'll just...

1575
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:25,940
So, that...

1576
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:29,940
It's easy to think that a forum is in a non-changeable or final state if we don't consider it evolution.

1577
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:33,020
We consider it evolutionary time over hundreds of millions of years.

1578
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:40,100
We can use those numbers, but we have no macroscopic or cognitive experience of those timeframes.

1579
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:41,860
Quick story to illustrate this.

1580
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:44,820
There's a group of people called the Bajou.

1581
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:46,500
They're on houseboats.

1582
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:53,100
They only come to land to trade, fish for their boats.

1583
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:59,660
Their children spend so much time underwater that they see more clearly underwater and

1584
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:02,180
then they do in out of water.

1585
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:08,620
They have fish hunters that can do things without weights, without any apparatus that

1586
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:13,780
allow them to go down to 80 feet, slow their heartbeat to 30 beats a minute, and stay to

1587
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:15,900
8 minutes.

1588
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:21,260
And if one runs that out over thousands or more of years, you can see physiological

1589
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:25,100
changes in what appears to be an end state of design.

1590
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,500
So that's just the comment.

1591
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:33,620
And then the other is that about the speciality is that a few months ago I'll send the paper

1592
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:36,220
to anyone who hasn't seen it or wants it.

1593
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:44,060
Apparently it looks pretty, pretty, there's a single mutation in a single gene gave rise

1594
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:51,340
to our neocortical complexity over time and that develops at a rate roughly 300% fast

1595
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:53,940
in the rest of our physiology.

1596
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:56,780
So that accounts for some of the things you were talking about.

1597
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:58,460
That said, here's the question.

1598
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:03,900
It's an ethical question because we didn't, we didn't.

1599
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:09,540
And this is Sandra, Diana and Irene.

1600
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:15,420
If we got to the point of being able, using epigenetics and other biosynthetic techniques,

1601
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:25,060
to modify that corresponding gene, if it exists, or in non-human species such that we could

1602
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:29,460
artificially accelerate the development of their neocortex, this would be, of course,

1603
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:35,980
vertebrates insephalization, would that be something that any of you would consider doing?

1604
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:38,780
And if not, why not?

1605
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,780
I love it.

1606
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:44,820
Well if it was a pit like takeout.

1607
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:48,740
But an injection, I'm not having anything to do with it.

1608
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:50,740
Well, I agree.

1609
01:33:50,740 --> 01:34:00,100
I mean, for the speech study, the most dogs, I mean again, I am, it can be a little parochial

1610
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:04,620
intentionally, cognitively in my response.

1611
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:11,580
But I think that part of what works for them is actually not being self-sufficient.

1612
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:17,100
I mean, it is their dependency on it and therefore giving them something which kind of promoted

1613
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:23,660
their ability to evolve beyond us would not be useful for that species or to my feeling.

1614
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:28,500
I wanted to just link that to the difference, the one difference between us and everything

1615
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:35,020
and the other species is that we have this remarkably complex abstract language and then

1616
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:40,820
we can then categorize and refer to the world even if the correspondence with what we've

1617
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:47,820
modeled is not reliable, but that complexity of our linguistic capability is really what

1618
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:53,980
sets us apart as far as we can tell because no one else is giving, no parents are yet giving

1619
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:54,980
talks at Columbia.

1620
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:55,980
Okay.

1621
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:59,460
I'd love to be able to talk that way and also that I really want to be silenced by the

1622
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:00,460
way.

1623
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:02,460
Oh God, what if they had language?

1624
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:05,300
Oh, they'd be impossible, wouldn't they?

1625
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:14,620
I enjoy very much hearing about the tests that you ran measuring the intellectual intelligence

1626
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:15,620
of other species.

1627
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:22,980
I'm wondering if anyone is doing any work measuring the emotional intelligence in other

1628
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:25,340
species.

1629
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:34,220
It's extremely difficult and I'll say it because when we would, if we tried to do that, we

1630
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:42,580
would be even worse at imposing our patterns on them.

1631
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:47,180
So for example, I can work with the burden, I'll say stop doing that, you're going to

1632
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:50,100
get bitten and the student says how do you know that?

1633
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:51,820
And I said look at the body language.

1634
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:56,460
Okay, the feathers are ruffled, the eyes are slitted, the head of the parent versus the

1635
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:57,460
back of that.

1636
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,340
I'm reading his body language.

1637
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:00,740
Now is he angry?

1638
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:01,740
Is he bored?

1639
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:10,100
I don't know why he's what emotional underpinning is going on, but I can read the behavior.

1640
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:15,700
And I kind of joke about it that even as humans we're really rotten about understanding what

1641
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:19,540
somebody else is doing and interpreting it appropriately.

1642
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:23,180
I mean you'll go to your significant other and say why did you say that?

1643
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,980
Well I didn't mean to say it that way.

1644
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,460
I didn't remember that.

1645
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:32,340
And so it's really hard to do this emotional thing because we're so bad at it as humans

1646
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:36,380
with one another to impose it on animals I find it's just harder.

1647
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:38,380
I mean we can read the behavior.

1648
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:44,660
We know what behavioral actions are going to lead to other actions, but that underlying

1649
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:45,660
emotional...

1650
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:49,420
I think next time you have to bring your significant others.

1651
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:51,460
Well I no longer have one.

1652
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:53,420
I no longer have a human one.

1653
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:55,660
There's a reason for that.

1654
01:36:55,660 --> 01:37:01,180
I agree with Irene although I think that as a scientist what we try to do is increase

1655
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:06,180
our powers of observation and our ability to sort of bring together a lot of maybe anecdotal

1656
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:08,620
information and look at it more systematically.

1657
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:14,180
So for example with dolphins or ant elephants in our field we can watch responses to the

1658
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:17,460
death of a conspecific another of their own group.

1659
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:21,060
And again we don't know what it means, but what you'll see often is things that look

1660
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:23,380
very much like grieving in humans.

1661
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:29,420
If it's an example is you have eight dolphins in a facility, two are bonded, Spock and Shiloh.

1662
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:31,420
I'll just give goofy names.

1663
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:32,420
Spock dies.

1664
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:36,740
Shiloh is the one in the group that stops eating, starts sulking and takes a week to

1665
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:40,380
start eating and getting with the other animals again.

1666
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:43,620
And you know when we look at it in human terms it looks like grief.

1667
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,940
What it is to an animal may be...

1668
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:49,740
Or maybe physiological disturbances, all sorts of stressors.

1669
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:51,100
But that's sort of where we are.

1670
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:53,420
We try to look more systematically at that.

1671
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:59,420
We can look at signs for what we would say are empathy or caregiving or perspective taking

1672
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:03,500
in dolphins and elephants and binobos, other animals and dogs.

1673
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:09,540
You'll see behavior where an animal is injured or ill and the others will give caregiving,

1674
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:11,460
will hold them up at the surface.

1675
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:13,100
They don't all do it, they don't always do it.

1676
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,300
It's very flexible.

1677
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:16,500
It's often to the ones they're closest with.

1678
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:19,340
They'll often do something to provide care.

1679
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:23,860
So when we look at those kinds of things or look at a paper came out last year by Plotnik

1680
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:28,740
and Duval where they looked at one elephant showing conciliatory behavior to another that

1681
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:30,020
was distressed.

1682
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:33,340
They put their trunk around the animal and they look at how that happens.

1683
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:38,260
Again, we don't know what's going on in the emotional world of those animals.

1684
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:39,900
But what we do know is they...

1685
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,100
Many animals have...

1686
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:48,380
From rats to elephants to dolphins have similar sub-portical areas in their brain that respond

1687
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:53,460
emotionally in different ways to fear, to caring, for young and other things.

1688
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:57,940
So there's some interesting similarities, whether it's the same kind of emotion, but

1689
01:38:57,940 --> 01:39:01,660
maybe that doesn't make a difference if it's the same because we would never know if it's

1690
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:02,660
the same.

1691
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:04,420
How do you know if it's ever going to be the same?

1692
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:11,780
You know, my question that I asked before you just touched on it, that you said when the

1693
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:15,620
other dolphin is not eating and so on, you said it may not...

1694
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:20,540
We don't know what the emotion is, but it may be some physiological response.

1695
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:22,540
But that's also true with humans, right?

1696
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:23,540
Yeah.

1697
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:28,500
In that sense, we are identical, but we secondarily may have explanations for what we are doing.

1698
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:29,500
Right.

1699
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:33,460
And also animals, many animals show ulcers under conditions.

1700
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:36,580
And for us, it can come from different things, bacterial.

1701
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:42,500
I'm going to approach this from another angle because I'm coming from another field.

1702
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:45,220
I'm a painter and art historian.

1703
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:46,980
And I'm interested in...

1704
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:50,340
Painters often say, I'm only a link in a chain.

1705
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:55,100
I'm an individual, but I'm carrying on things that have happened in the past and the history

1706
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,180
of others.

1707
01:39:56,180 --> 01:40:01,220
So carrying within one is the history of other actions, other developments.

1708
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:08,460
So the mind is not just a sound, it's an entity, it's an entity, a depository of history,

1709
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:09,660
of all kinds.

1710
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:16,140
And therefore, that creates a form of evolution or development, a different kind of form,

1711
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:21,340
but it's a form that we are building constantly on others' lives who have gone through a conscious

1712
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:22,340
life.

1713
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:28,220
And I wonder how you can relate that to the animal kingdom, this history and culture in

1714
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:34,500
which an individual life is beyond their life because they have imbibed other lives, other

1715
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:35,500
consciousness.

1716
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:36,500
Great question.

1717
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,500
Anything?

1718
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:40,380
A bird song dialect.

1719
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:44,900
I mean, the birds will learn their area.

1720
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:48,260
It's a cultural tradition.

1721
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:50,780
We get a little bit for individual differences.

1722
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:53,020
That's their little take on it.

1723
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:54,420
But it's a cultural tradition.

1724
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:57,380
And you can see the changes over time.

1725
01:40:57,380 --> 01:41:02,540
You can see the evolution of these things based on what's happening in the world.

1726
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:09,860
I mean, if the area that they're living in gets more tree-like, they'll have to shift

1727
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:12,260
frequencies a little bit and things like that.

1728
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:15,940
I mean, that's one version of it.

1729
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:21,220
I went to graduate school with a number of people who believed and espoused that the unit

1730
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:25,380
of interest was really not the cognition and the brain, but a distributed cognition of

1731
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:26,540
a group.

1732
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:27,540
And that's how they studied.

1733
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:29,580
How do people work together in a group?

1734
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:32,700
It's not one person who's solving the problems.

1735
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:37,260
I, as a human and a tool user, speak most of the tools, which I use.

1736
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:38,540
I let somebody else make them.

1737
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:42,460
And so it makes more sense to talk about the cognition of a group.

1738
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:44,140
And you can define the group variously.

1739
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:48,420
And I think, in some ways, lots of different animal societies could also be described that

1740
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:49,420
way.

1741
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:51,380
And that is a kind of historical cognition.

1742
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:56,460
In other words, the group operates because lots of different members have different roles

1743
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:03,020
or understandings such that, as an entire group, they have a cognitive ability.

1744
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:07,460
I think that might be one way to recast the type of thing you're talking about, such

1745
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:10,940
that it might be relevant for humans and non-humans.

1746
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:16,940
I think the idea of also matriarchs, the older females, there's data coming out showing that

1747
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:23,580
an elephant societies and in cetacean societies, that these female matriarchs seem to carry

1748
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:24,980
the knowledge.

1749
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:26,980
And that's passed down.

1750
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:30,140
There's increasing evidence for cultural within these societies.

1751
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:37,980
But this matriarch, the non-reproductive female, leads the group in Africa to the right places

1752
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:39,740
based on seasons and things.

1753
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:46,420
And when those animals from poaching or whatever has detrimental effects on the groups, taking

1754
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:55,500
out males that are male elephants by poachers have effects on the acculturation and control

1755
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,500
of the younger males.

1756
01:42:56,500 --> 01:43:02,100
So these key roles are important, but carrying the knowledge, having a real effect on behavior

1757
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:03,100
of others around you.

1758
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:05,100
I think it's a great point.

1759
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:06,100
Thanks.

1760
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:07,100
Thank you.

1761
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:09,300
Do you not see anything about this?

1762
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:17,420
Boy, there's little bits of evidence here and there of this kind of cultural transmission,

1763
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:23,020
but you don't really find it in humans until you get to pretty modern humans.

1764
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:28,220
I think you have, you could trump me here on this, but I think much like technology in

1765
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:32,340
the Bronze Age, I think art in the Bronze Age are through thousands of years remained

1766
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:34,700
relatively similar.

1767
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:40,020
All made artifacts for thousands of years, the artifacts all look sort of the same.

1768
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:45,700
But now we have, now the arts are changing all the time.

1769
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:49,020
I mean, they move at a much more rapid pace.

1770
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:50,940
And that is nothing to do with evolution.

1771
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:52,660
That is a cultural thing that humans do.

1772
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:56,580
They move at a more rapid pace.

1773
01:43:56,580 --> 01:44:02,900
Maybe the concept of the individual, which evolve through time, has also changed things

1774
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:03,900
in that way.

1775
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:08,780
And that an individual feels that within themselves, a da Vinci or even earlier than

1776
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:14,460
that, can add a whole new dimension that this given, that aren't part of the canon of an

1777
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:15,460
age.

1778
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:16,980
But I think there's always been change.

1779
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:21,580
I don't think the Bronze Age was, I think it was a slower evolution, but it was there.

1780
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:24,300
I don't believe there's any stagnant period ever.

1781
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:26,140
I don't believe in vacuums.

1782
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:32,220
But the concept of the individual, individual life, did change that.

1783
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:33,220
Yes.

1784
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:41,580
I hope I won't be too unpopular.

1785
01:44:41,580 --> 01:44:47,380
If I start out by correcting two things that graded on my ears like fingernails on a

1786
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:48,780
fingernail.

1787
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:54,100
One being that there could be some evolution of human intelligence in the last 5,000 years,

1788
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:59,140
which will be 5,000 years is nothing in human evolution.

1789
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:03,740
They're talking about the emergence of a kind of mental…

1790
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:04,740
Between 100,000.

1791
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:05,740
So you don't get…

1792
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:08,740
We changed it to 50 million.

1793
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:09,740
You don't get upset.

1794
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:10,980
No, no, now you weigh up.

1795
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:12,540
No, now you weigh on the other side.

1796
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:13,540
But we did weigh up.

1797
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:14,540
We said just the opposite.

1798
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:15,540
I just want to be clear.

1799
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:16,540
We said just the opposite.

1800
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:19,460
It couldn't possibly be evolution in 5,000 years.

1801
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:20,460
All right.

1802
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:24,380
But I mean, they were building pyramids.

1803
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:26,300
They were quite as intelligent as we are.

1804
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:27,980
Have the same exact brain we have now?

1805
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:29,620
5,000, we believe it.

1806
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:31,540
We won't quibble over the time.

1807
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:28,480
But the paintings, the

1808
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:41,180
scale paintings and the shawty paintings were between 30,000 and 40 years ago.

1809
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:42,980
Neanderthals were still…

1810
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:49,700
We just discovered some new kinds of tools and possibly art in the rudiments of Neanderthals

1811
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:52,620
that died out 40,000 years ago.

1812
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:54,780
I leave that topic now.

1813
01:45:54,780 --> 01:46:02,940
Everything that bothered me was the idea of being upright somehow facilitates the kind

1814
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,900
of intelligence that we have.

1815
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:13,940
I needed to think that we had at least 17 different kinds of hominins wandering around

1816
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:18,740
the world that were all more or less upright.

1817
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:24,580
And only Homo sapiens came up with what we think we have.

1818
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:30,180
Antipythicists were creatures like aridipithecus, ramidus and Australopithecus.

1819
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:32,380
All of these creatures could walk.

1820
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:35,140
They had good hands.

1821
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:43,820
In fact, it's generally understood by anthropology now that walking upright was not correlated

1822
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,980
with intelligence at all.

1823
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:51,380
The intelligence came way after they were all of these upright hominins walking around.

1824
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:52,380
Look at bono.

1825
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:55,620
They're all for instance.

1826
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:57,180
They often walk upright.

1827
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:58,180
They're very bright.

1828
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:59,180
They don't do art.

1829
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:01,060
They don't do life.

1830
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:02,060
So it cannot be…

1831
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:04,740
But they're not upright.

1832
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:05,740
So I'm not sure why you…

1833
01:47:05,740 --> 01:47:06,740
They're not actually upright.

1834
01:47:06,740 --> 01:47:07,740
So what do you mention?

1835
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:08,740
Oh, they're very often upright.

1836
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:11,820
No, I mean, they're not a fully upright.

1837
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:13,820
I thought you were referring to a fully upright.

1838
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:14,820
Well, as fully upright.

1839
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:15,820
I'm talking about fully upright.

1840
01:47:15,820 --> 01:47:16,820
I'm talking about fully upright.

1841
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:23,820
I thought you just said homo sapiens.

1842
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:31,820
They're all these people.

1843
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:32,820
I don't mean to be disrespectful.

1844
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:34,740
I want to be polite.

1845
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:37,580
But you're totally off the beam.

1846
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:42,180
You don't have a grasp of the range of upright creatures that did not…

1847
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,180
I don't understand.

1848
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:44,180
You're talking about bipedalism.

1849
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:46,340
We're the only fully upright species.

1850
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:51,820
There's no debate on this among scientists.

1851
01:47:51,820 --> 01:47:54,060
We're the only fully upright species.

1852
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:55,500
Well, there is debate about it.

1853
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:56,500
But I want to drop it now.

1854
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:57,500
I want to drop it.

1855
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:58,500
I want to drop it.

1856
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,500
I want to drop it now.

1857
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:00,500
You can read my book.

1858
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:03,260
And maybe my book is totally wrong too.

1859
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:07,980
Paul Garvin's universe.

1860
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:10,380
What I really want to bring up is this.

1861
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:15,180
Because I've been fortunate for the last three years to be the director of a project

1862
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:19,980
on Alfred Russell for the Templeland Foundation.

1863
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:21,380
You may not know him.

1864
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:24,580
Some of you may know he was Darwin's junior.

1865
01:48:24,580 --> 01:48:32,180
He was the man that came up with the idea of evolution by natural selection to shorten

1866
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:33,180
the story.

1867
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:35,060
In time, Darwin did.

1868
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:37,580
They published it together.

1869
01:48:37,580 --> 01:48:41,060
They share co-credit.

1870
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:44,580
But they had a very interesting detail in him.

1871
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:52,620
And that difference of opinion was that Wallace, who was a great naturalist, out in the field

1872
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:59,300
for many years, observed many animals, he drew what I call a white picket fence around

1873
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:05,820
human mentality, around human consciousness, around human cognition.

1874
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:15,540
He thought that natural selection could not account the kind of consciousness that he's

1875
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:16,700
talking about.

1876
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:18,820
And Darwin said, what do you mean?

1877
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:20,220
Everything goes by gradual steps.

1878
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,380
There's no great leaps.

1879
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:25,380
And Wallace, I said you don't understand natural selection.

1880
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:27,780
Wallace said, I'm the inventor of it along with you.

1881
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:29,660
I understand natural selection.

1882
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:35,700
And what natural selection says is that a trait has to have a utility to an organism

1883
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:38,020
in order to be a person.

1884
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:44,220
Now if you have an ape, said Wallace, wandering around and eating lizards, and like a girl

1885
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:49,740
that's well surviving and having a social group and having all kinds of behavior, why

1886
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:57,980
would he need to have methadry, why would he need to have methadry, why would he need

1887
01:49:57,980 --> 01:50:07,180
to even need to have the sophistication of language beyond a very, very basic thing.

1888
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:17,500
And he said, you can't, an animal cannot develop something in advance of its needs.

1889
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:24,340
And Darwin wrote him a famous letter in 18th and said, I hope you have not murdered too

1890
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:31,380
completely your own and my child, meaning natural selection.

1891
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:36,300
Wallace wrote many books on this later, The Place of Man in Nature, The World of Life,

1892
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:39,140
and so on, in which he continued to steam.

1893
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:41,540
And you talked about the potential source.

1894
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:43,700
Wallace thought there was special source.

1895
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:49,460
Wallace thought there was an infusion of spirit from an unseen universe of spirit, a cosmic

1896
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:50,460
intelligence.

1897
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:51,860
He never used the word God.

1898
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:56,060
He did not like organized religion, but he thought there was some kind of intelligence

1899
01:50:56,060 --> 01:51:05,620
in nature, guiding evolution and responsible for infusing and injecting in humans this

1900
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:11,300
what some call emergent quality that was more than the sum of its parts.

1901
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:13,660
This is not a question and I don't want to hog the floor.

1902
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:14,660
I've said my piece.

1903
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:15,660
Thank you.

1904
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:22,660
Thank you.

1905
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:29,660
That was interesting.

1906
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:35,660
That was interesting and fun.

1907
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:48,660
Thank you.
