1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So I will introduce the participants today.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I will not go through everything here because I think all of you have already.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So just a summary of things.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Priyambhada Natarayan is a professor of astronomy and physics at Yale University.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And her research is focused on exotica in the universe, dark matter, dark energy and black holes.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
She is obviously very prominent in her field and also holds professorships at the Tico Brea,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Sophie and Tico Brea professorships at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark,

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and honorary professorships at the University of Delhi in India.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Tim Modlin has been here before with us and so has Tim.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Tim is a professor of philosophy at New York University and his most recent books are philosophy of physics, space and time,

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and new foundations for physical geometry.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Dorothy Vamyukke, I think is her first time here.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
She is professor of Germanic languages at Columbia University and she has just a number of books that are listed here.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Her latest book, which I guess is not out yet, is on changing models of authorship and creativity in the arts and sciences during the long 18th century.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So with that, I'll let you start.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There's no, okay, I thought we were going to be close to questions.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No questions?

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You've got a whole list of questions here.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I guess I was curious about trying to understand whether the way the theme was posed to us.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I read it as whether there are fundamental limits that may prevent extension of knowledge beyond certain points.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And so from the vantage point of cosmology, so there's sort of obvious limitations.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
First, in the sense that there's a limit to observation, in the sense because the speed of light is finite,

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
there's only a portion of the universe that is observable to us at any given time.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So given the finite age of the universe and finite speed of light, there is what is called an observable horizon.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So you are not privy to what is happening beyond, you have no knowledge of what's happening beyond that current horizon.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Of course that horizon shifts as time goes on, so a billion years later, more of the universe will come into view.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But at any given point, there's sort of a hard boundary of where you cannot get any information from.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And of course in quantum mechanics, we also know that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle tells you that you cannot simultaneously know the position and momentum of an object simultaneously.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So there's like one can sort of view that sort of as a limit.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So there's a limit to sort of observation, then there's a limit because I mean I'm thinking about cosmos and cosmic scales.

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There's also a limit to travel, right, so question of sort of interstellar, interspace travel.

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And that of course again has to do with, it's not just a technological limitation.

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It has to do with a human lifespan.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The fact is even if we have the technology that could propel us outside the solar system and take us to planets and on other stars and so on and so forth,

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
the fundamental limitation is that there is a finite human lifespan and we can't circumvent that.

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Even if we come up with ways to fuel rockets that can fly for 10,000 years or whatever power, right, so sort of thinking about that and then-

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And we're saying there is a limitation also to human lifespan?

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No, the human lifespan being what it is will contain, will necessarily give you a limit on travel.

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I understand that, but are you saying there's no way to extend human lifespan beyond a certain point?

40
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There may be. I'm not sure if it will be enough to take us to planets around other stars.

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Because you know the point is now we're finding all these so-called habitable planets around other stars.

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The question, you know, at least for someone like me, the first question is, is there any means by which we will actually reach it?

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And then you realize that there's a fundamental limitation, you wouldn't.

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Then if you look at sort of limits to- there are limits to the kinds of energies at which you could build colliders, like at CERN, the LHC.

45
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You know, you can go up by factor of 10, factor of 100 and so on.

46
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So this sort of fundamental limit in terms of the time that it is going to take to build something like that, like how many generations, but it's spent.

47
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Of course, as well as cost and all those sort of practical things.

48
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But once again, you know, sort of the human lifespan comes into view when you look at trying to understand the constituents of the cosmos.

49
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So, you know, I was really looking from that point of view, trying to understand our place in the universe and stuff like that.

50
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then the question, the one point that I think is very interesting is sort of the limit limits on thought.

51
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So, and I think that's where one of the reasons, you know, everyone's teasing me about my notes is that, you know, trying to stay focused and stable in my own opinion.

52
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There's a bit of me that feels that there is no reason to believe that human cognitive capacity should be infinite.

53
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
There are billions and billions of nerve cells, but the fact they're not infinite.

54
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And although the brain is plastic and it does morph and it does learn, even as we age and now we know that, it's not clear to me that it responds fast enough given, you know, what remains to be understood.

55
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So, that's like a fundamental limit that comes from just complexity, sheer complexity of whether we have the cognitive apparatus to fathom and all the complexity.

56
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And I think I'm not sure that we do.

57
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I mean, I see no reason to believe why we do.

58
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, should I?

59
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let me just jump in and respond or say some things maybe in the general area.

60
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I mean, I have two backgrounds, one in philosophy and one more in physics.

61
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Of course, if you're a philosopher, you're going to say the limit to human knowledge is that we have pretty much none of it about anything.

62
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That is, all of our beliefs are tentative to some degree.

63
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You could say we have tremendous amount of evidence for things, but we know sometimes well in trench beliefs get overthrown later.

64
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So, part of it is just to say we should always be very tentative to some degree or a little bit humble about anything we think we know.

65
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So, it's more a question of limits on evidence, limits on reasons to believe.

66
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And then the second thing I suppose, when you talk about limits, it sounds like, gee, that's a terrible thing.

67
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But you want to stop and ask for a second what you really care about because there may be things which we won't know.

68
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But on further reflection, we don't care all that much about.

69
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I could pick out a tree in Central Park and say nobody knows how many leaves there are.

70
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And I guess in principle, you could go count them, but nobody's going to, right?

71
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
By next spring, nobody will ever know. It's kind of a piece of trivia.

72
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So, there's a whole lot of trivia about the universe.

73
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And we shouldn't be too upset.

74
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Then there are more fundamental issues we'd really like to have settled.

75
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And the limits there are very interesting.

76
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll just mention one thing to show you how tricky it is in physics,

77
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
pre-existing the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, which probably most people have heard of one way or another,

78
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and described it this way that you can't simultaneously know, say, the position and momentum of a particle,

79
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
which you also might think is kind of a bit of trivia.

80
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But even the way that's phrased is contentious.

81
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The way it's phrased, it suggests that a particle always has a definite position in momentum,

82
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and we just can't know them both at the same time.

83
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But some understandings of quantum theory say, no, that's not the right way to think about it.

84
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The right way to think about it is that particles just don't have them both at the same time.

85
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So, there's nothing we're ignorant of.

86
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Now, that's going to differ on different understandings of the theory,

87
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and then that leads us to the question, can we settle that dispute?

88
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Can we decide between different fundamental physical pictures of the universe?

89
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And the interesting thing there is that, I think Einstein pointed this out,

90
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
how much you can find out about the physical world is itself the function of what the physical laws are.

91
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You sort of have to ask the theory of how much you can know about the world,

92
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
because we only acquire information by physical interaction with the world.

93
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So, the physics itself can put limits on what an inquirer can find out about the physics,

94
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
or the physics itself could, as it were, put us in a position where we can't know what the, be sure what the physics is.

95
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So, I think those are very interesting, because I actually just personally care about knowing the fundamental laws of nature

96
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
more than the leaves on the treaties.

97
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's the kind of thing that worries me a bit.

98
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
How do you react to that? Well, if that's the way the world is, you live with it.

99
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
There's lots of things about the world you wish could be different.

100
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And I think we'll only know when we have, you know, we'll continue the search.

101
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Do you wish to know more? I would like to know what the fundamental laws of nature are.

102
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, that's an interesting, I mean, that's just part of my intellectual character.

103
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I mean, I was bouncing around doing the philosophy, why philosophy?

104
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Because somehow you get down to the bottom of everything, right?

105
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And then doing some science and you say, oh, biology, that's interesting, but really it's just chemistry.

106
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You know, chemistry, that's interesting, but really it's just physics.

107
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay, what's really physics?

108
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Now, lots of people could feel differently.

109
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They could feel, I just really enjoy studying cells and I couldn't care less about electrons.

110
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But that same kind of desire to somehow, in a certain sense, get to the very bottom.

111
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's why I'm interested.

112
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well, you don't mean that anything would change.

113
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
If you knew that, you mean that you just are interested in that?

114
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Nothing would, I have a desire to know the facts, those particular facts.

115
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I would be pleased if I could find them out.

116
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The rest of my life would go on as usual, make breakfast the same way.

117
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You know, my interactions with people would be the same, my political views wouldn't change.

118
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You could say, all of this is a little bit, you know, isolated from lots of other big questions in life.

119
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But it's something that just fascinates me.

120
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, I'm probably the further the loss of nature in the universe since I'm in literature and intellectual history.

121
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But when I thought about the topic we're discussing, I couldn't help but think, well, the limitations are not just negative.

122
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
As you pre-up brought up the issue of increasing complexity, whenever you study something,

123
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you reach a point where you need to reduce the complexity.

124
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And you bring up the question of the limited lifespan of human being,

125
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and in a way the opacity of the observation process.

126
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So I thought it's probably productive also to think about these limitations in terms of the situatedness

127
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
of any situation of knowledge, production, knowledge, communication.

128
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's the language on institutions that have their power.

129
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And whenever we declare something to be an important research program that deserves funding

130
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
or that should be taught rather than something else,

131
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:55,000
their interests that have their own institutional dynamics and political ramifications.

132
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So, and then they are culturally historically changing conventions of what constitutes objectivity,

133
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
what constitutes facts, what constitutes evidence.

134
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And I was going to propose to think about the limitations of knowledge in terms of

135
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:34,000
situatedness of the production of knowledge, which I guess cannot be denied.

136
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And maybe also consider its social communicative dimension.

137
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You want to bring the math perspective?

138
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Well, I want to bring something in.

139
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'd like to look at the first question, which is a fundamental here.

140
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It says, what about the universe and how do we know it?

141
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And I want to start off by a Jewish joke, which may not be so funny,

142
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
but I think it illustrates something about this.

143
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You have these two disciples of two famous rabbis,

144
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and some God forsaken little town in Poland,

145
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and one of them is saying how wonderful their teachers are.

146
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And one of them says, I know, I know that my teachers,

147
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
hello, yes, the mic doesn't work, I'll speak louder, okay?

148
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Anybody can hear me?

149
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Mike is not working, he's working.

150
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Well, anyway, maybe if I speak louder, everybody can hear me.

151
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He's going to check the amplifier, I think.

152
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll speak louder.

153
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay, so,

154
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I know that my rabbi is an absolutely incredibly miraculous person.

155
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
He just, it says, it's just wonderful.

156
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What do you mean? What's so wonderful?

157
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What's the, I mean, many, many things, but just last month.

158
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Just last month we had this one.

159
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We had this remarkable thing happening here.

160
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll tell you, what happened?

161
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We were headed out daily prayer, and suddenly the rabbi in the middle of the prayer

162
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
screamed out and said, this is horrible, this is terrible.

163
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The chief rabbi of Prague has just died, he's just died.

164
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
In the middle of the service he had collapsed and died,

165
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and everybody was shocked, and they immediately organized a party to get there

166
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,960
funeral, which has to be done very quickly. So they got some horsemen, six horsemen, and

167
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,040
they were riding. You can imagine they were riding day and night, and everybody was praying

168
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:18,240
that they could make it. And amazingly enough, by dawn, they got all the way to Prague. And

169
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,880
it was just wonderful. And I said, well, but that's great now, did they? So they actually

170
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:34,480
got to the funeral? Because, well, it turns out that the rabbi didn't really die. It was

171
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:44,520
fine. So what's so wonderful about that? Because you idiot, you don't understand anything.

172
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,960
It has nothing to do with whether the rabbi died or not. It's how far this great man

173
00:17:49,960 --> 00:18:03,520
can see. So I think that this is my opinion. This is a very, this is a common, oh, this

174
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:12,680
matter, that we are, we're trying, what is knowledge? I mean, we, what do people know?

175
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:26,920
This disciple knew his rabbi. He was a wonderful man. Okay. So what, what is it that, I mean,

176
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:33,720
this fellow knew his rabbi very well, and you know everything, and he was an intelligent

177
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:41,840
guy, and he knew that he thought that he was a great man for many reasons. And he was one

178
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,520
of the examples. So all the way, and somehow things didn't quite work out at the end. That's

179
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:58,440
a small thing. It's a small experimental kind of variation. So I think, I think that knowledge

180
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,760
is something what we know is something very tricky. What, what is it? I mean, we, you

181
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,400
know, you pick up a phone and you hear somebody speaking and you know exactly who it is. Why?

182
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,680
I mean, the, his voice has been cut up into millions of pieces, a lot of things. And there's

183
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,760
something about it that you know the person. There are lots of things that you, that you

184
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:29,320
sort of know in some kind of way, which you can't really verbalize, or even write down.

185
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:40,280
It's, I would say there is, so you, you're in this, we're sort of in a kind of a fog,

186
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,240
and we have a way of perceiving certain signals. And then we say, I think we, then we have

187
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,480
to, our psychology tells us, we have to feel that we know something. You know, we, we sort

188
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,040
of feel that we, you know, we know very well that we're going to dive very soon, but we

189
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:04,080
somehow feel, extend things and we know that somehow we assume on the daily basis that

190
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,840
it's going to keep going on. A lot, lots of things inside us that make us, make us feel

191
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:17,080
that we know things. Now there is, there's a mathematical component to all this also,

192
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:27,600
but I, maybe I'll return to that later. And that is how you go from knowing some things

193
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,000
to knowing something else by logic. And that, that I think is a very important thing that

194
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,360
plays, plays a very important role in every kind of study of understanding things, mathematical

195
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:51,360
or not. There's that crucial step from going to, from, from, from something to, from something

196
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:59,200
that we think we know to something else by logic. And perhaps I'll, perhaps I'll discuss

197
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,000
that a little later.

198
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,840
So maybe, let me just make it. I mean, I think we do want to, there's a very difficult question,

199
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,480
which is both has to do with institutional structures and these sorts of things where

200
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,120
you might say, how do we know? How, how is knowledge produced? It's, how do we get the

201
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:26,400
evidence? As you say, recognizing someone's voice, can you really articulate? And that

202
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,920
may be very difficult, but I, I at least want to put on the other side not to get too lost

203
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:42,960
in that fog, because at least you can check whether certain claims, things are reliable.

204
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,680
I mean, I'm, I'm reminded of the great magician James Randy, who would challenge people who

205
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,720
claim to know all sorts of things that you would say, I don't know how they know them

206
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:02,280
because they were sort of like, or I mean, you know, extra sensory perception or someone,

207
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,440
is it that we're supposed to be outside the ambit of scientific explanation and the beauty

208
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:13,640
of it was that Randy wouldn't engage in the question of how, how could that possibly work,

209
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,680
but he could come up with nice experiments to see whether it does work. So I remember

210
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,760
once someone said they could see your aura, right, they could see sticking up a few inches

211
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,520
above your head and aura and it had different colors and on the basis of the colors you

212
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,200
could tell about your personality. And Randy said, okay, fine. And he had a set of boxes,

213
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:41,680
set up 10 boxes where the person would stand so their head was just below the box, right.

214
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:47,000
But if there was a three inch aura flowing out of them, however they could do it, the

215
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,200
aura sear could see the aura sticking up the top of the box and he'd say, okay, let's have

216
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:58,360
somebody come stand and you tell us where they're standing. That's a great test, right? And

217
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:05,720
what you find is that that person actually can't see anything at all. So how we know

218
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,960
is a very tricky question. Sometimes that we know or that something is good evidence or

219
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,800
a way of approaching things is reliable or not reliable, we can get at in a somewhat

220
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:23,880
more humble way. The world would be a lot better if there was a bit more of that.

221
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:33,960
I think it's quite clear that there's the experiential, and I'm not saying that they

222
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:40,120
are sort of binaries or they're in opposition. There's the experiential view of this question

223
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:48,360
and then there's the experimental view of how we know. And there is a well developed

224
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:57,200
scheme of garnering reliable knowledge of phenomena, reliable replicable knowledge,

225
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:07,440
that certifies what we know is there. So I think it's at least we know one way of knowing

226
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:16,840
that is not as foggy, sort of the scientific experimental observational way. And of course

227
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,800
you know the questions that you brought up are that this observation is an entirely

228
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:28,440
objective, who we are, interferes, then there's the issue of what a measurement device actually

229
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,160
does because you're convolving the phenomenon via the device that you're using to actually

230
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:41,200
study the phenomenon. So there's all of that, but still, I think as Tim pointed out, that

231
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:51,360
we do have one very reliable scheme, experimental scheme within science of producing knowledge.

232
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,400
So you would limit knowledge, experimental scientific knowledge? No, but I think that

233
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:06,400
I wouldn't limit it, but I think that there's at least one kind of knowledge that we understand

234
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:13,560
quite well how it's produced, how it's replicated in its complications and its stability, its

235
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,560
provisionality. We have a whole understanding of how when you learn something new, you have

236
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,600
new evidence, you have many different independent lines of new evidence, you revise your understanding

237
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:31,920
of phenomena. So you know, that process within science of generating knowledge and facts is

238
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,400
sort of a nice well-oiled machine, are we understanding? No, I understand. But then you

239
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:45,680
limit right now, you limit your definition of knowledge to the we of the scientific community

240
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:55,760
trained in that procedure. And I guess the question you would want to ask is limitations

241
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,800
between disciplines and the communication between disciplines of scientific knowledge

242
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:08,840
production. And then I guess you would also want to ask about whether you actually want

243
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:20,120
to limit that we as trained scientists. Right. I mean, I'm only giving a perspective. I'm

244
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:27,120
not saying that this is limited in any way. There's obviously other ways of knowing and

245
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:36,680
other knowledge. But I think the scientific one is an interesting one to jump into and

246
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:43,680
to use as a lens to look at the other ways of knowing is because in science there is

247
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:53,920
the issue of limits that come from intractability, i.e. the apparatus, the methods of thinking

248
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:07,400
that you've developed are inadequate at this particular time to study in better detail.

249
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:14,840
And the fact that there are different kinds of intractability. So for example, we have

250
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:20,960
when you do climate models, right? So it's quite possible we have models which we understand

251
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:28,560
well enough, including their limitations of what the average temperature would be on

252
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:38,760
earth in 2025, for example. However, we will never ever be able to predict what will the

253
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:46,960
average temperature be in New Haven where I live on 13 December 2025 or New York, for

254
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,320
that matter. Right. So cold.

255
00:27:52,320 --> 00:28:00,080
So there's that kind of intractability, right? And the question is, will you be able to

256
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,560
build a better model? Will you get a more sophisticated model? Or will there always

257
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,560
be some fundamental uncertainties imposed by the complexity of a problem? So I think

258
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:17,880
the kinds of intractability that you have in science are different from the intractability

259
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,000
that you would have, for example, other disciplines, right? So for example, you put on average

260
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,080
no, so if you look at anthropology, right, when on average you could probably tell what

261
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:36,680
the diet of someone 4000 years ago was on average if you have fossils. But if you had

262
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:44,040
their skeleton, you could figure out what you can't say what they actually literally

263
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:51,280
ate on a given day, right? So that kind of, I think, crosses disciplines. But then there

264
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,360
are other kinds of intractability that don't quite cross. And I think that's sort of the

265
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,560
kinds of intractability.

266
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:08,120
Well, I certainly agree with what you say, but being sort of skeptical of mine, how can

267
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,840
you be so sure that we won't know exactly what the temperature will be 100 years from

268
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,840
now? I mean, right now we don't know how to do it. But who knows? Maybe they will come

269
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:25,840
up with some method where he'll understand exactly how things work and we will predict

270
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:36,920
temperature will be within 10 degrees or whatever. You know, the intractability depends on what

271
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:47,560
we have right now. Somebody may discover some weird thing, which, you know, I've heard,

272
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:58,440
an example, I've heard a student in the 50s, I've heard people coming on and people were

273
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:05,720
discussing how it would be absolutely impossible to analyze the game of chess in a kind of

274
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,000
a way that you sort of list the games and make these trees like they do now. Because

275
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,520
it would be such a huge amount of information that you would need that just inconceivable

276
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:22,160
that people do that. So the only way you could have computers play chess is somehow to emulate

277
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:28,480
the human thinking and intuition and so on. There was a whole discussion of that and everybody

278
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,520
agreed. Well, it turned out that those limits were surpassed and you can do it the crude

279
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:42,000
way of just listing all the games or try to list partially all the games and now computers

280
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:52,120
pay very good chess. So I think that there is an intractability but to predict what it

281
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:59,000
is is a dangerous ground. But that intractability has to do with enumeration, right? So it's a

282
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,520
quantitative thing. Right. If you can map out the kinds of intractability I'm talking

283
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:10,760
about are sort of chaos, right? In a complex system. But in the end, in the end, that's

284
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:20,440
the point that you can, once you reduce things to enumeration, then you have a chance and

285
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:27,440
a lot of things that we thought cannot be reduced to enumeration can be in fact reduced to enumeration.

286
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,520
So it can never be structured. No, of course not. But to say now what it is that won't

287
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:49,440
be able to within 10 years is dangerous grounds. So I want to be contrary to whatever it is.

288
00:31:49,440 --> 00:32:01,520
No, I mean, I think the kinds of problems that I had in mind were sort of problems where

289
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:08,480
you know chaos sets in and so some small fluctuation can give you a completely unpredictable outcome.

290
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,920
And in such an unpredictable outcome that you don't, you are actually incapable of constructing

291
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,480
a probability distribution function of finite outcomes. You're not able to enumerate those

292
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:25,120
outcomes in some kind of distribution. So I think there are a lot of problems. Definitely

293
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,760
I gave the climate one because I knew that, you know, that's a good one because we know

294
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:34,440
there that there are, it's such a complex problem and there's so many different variables

295
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,200
that we don't understand the nonlinear coupling. What we do know about nonlinear coupling is

296
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,920
that the system can get chaotic and therefore unpredictable outcomes which cannot be enumerated.

297
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:55,720
Well, I don't want to finish my point. I'll just come in here again on the question of

298
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,960
what is it we want to know, right? What is it? There was now it admittedly it might

299
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:07,040
be practically useful to know the exact temperature in New Haven in 10 years on a certain day

300
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:13,080
if you're planning a party. But you know, you might think, you know, from another point

301
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,640
of view, again, you might treat that, something we will find out that's certainly not a limit

302
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,160
to knowledge, it's a limit to predictability maybe. But you also might say from a certain

303
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:31,680
point of view of understanding of comprehension, if you think you have the basic fundamentals

304
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,840
of the system right and you can analyze it far enough to see as you say it's chaotic system,

305
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,080
it's dynamics, and this is what people always call the butterfly effect, right? In some systems

306
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:51,160
a tiny little change in the state now will amplify out to very big changes later. Just

307
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,160
knowing that is a kind of understanding of the system. It's an understanding that makes

308
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,760
prediction very difficult. But on the other hand, if what you're after is a kind of just

309
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:09,600
general comprehension, you might say that's fine, even though it doesn't satisfy all my

310
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:18,280
practical needs. So again, what the limits are and whether they're limits, how sad should

311
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:27,920
we be about the limits, I guess we ought to be a little careful about. I'll just make

312
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:33,880
one quick comment because Dorothea started out talking about the sociological factors

313
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:45,720
and so on in. There's maybe a small danger of the term knowledge production because in

314
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:51,920
a way you would think knowledge requires two things. Knowledge requires a theory which

315
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,360
is the thing you're claiming you might know or at least have good reason to believe and

316
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:03,960
it requires evidence which is the grounds on which you accept or reject the theory.

317
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:10,400
And certainly sociological considerations can play a big role and may be different in different

318
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:19,320
fields about theory production. So you might say theories in a certain literary criticism

319
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,400
I don't know a lot about but my impression is approaches to literary criticism, the kinds

320
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:35,840
of theories people have produced have changed quite radically from decade to decade. But

321
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:41,520
the more theory production seems to depends on sociological considerations, the more worried

322
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,280
you're going to be that none of this is going to produce knowledge because the more you can

323
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,120
produce just wildly different kinds of theories the more worried you're going to be well which

324
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,840
one's right or any of them right or if the kinds of theories can be pushed around by

325
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:02,720
this by the sociological situation very easily what makes you think they're being pushed in

326
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:12,440
a direction to being being correct. So whether in certain realms you think you're even after

327
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,880
the kind of thing we would call evidentially based theory that pre is after for understanding

328
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,440
dark matter I mean maybe some disciplines aren't after that at all maybe a literary critic might

329
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,520
say look there's not going to be a correct or incorrect theory of what this text is about

330
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:38,800
we're just trying out different approaches to reading and seeing how we like them and how

331
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,240
you know satisfying we how satisfied we feel and that asking for evidence whether this is the

332
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,480
right way to do it is even the right kind of thing so there you might have a limitation of a

333
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:57,600
different kind because it's not exactly a truth directed enterprise but directed at something

334
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,600
slightly different from that I mean I'm not sure how you think about your own field in this regard.

335
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:14,600
Well my question was I didn't want to assume that knowledge is reserved to one domain say

336
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:22,240
the natural sciences or the social sciences or the humanities my assumption would be that a

337
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,360
fundamental concept of knowledge is very different in say those three domains with different

338
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:41,000
methodologies and different theories but I would still say within say science without me having

339
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:52,400
studied beyond high school science you have in the sciences just as much as in the humanities or

340
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,080
in the social sciences if you just look at the institutions of higher learning you have funding

341
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:07,480
initiatives you have priorities that are set and you have decisions sometimes at a national level

342
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:17,800
not to pursue a field to drop a field or to revive a field and you have more or less application

343
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:28,720
driven motion of certain field where you have the creation of spaces where people can do less

344
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:41,320
applied sciences I'm not telling you anything new but it seems to me whoops it seems to me that

345
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:54,120
continuously as projects grants are articulated these considerations how it will be funded whether

346
00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:01,320
it will be funded how these decisions are made play into the articulation of the question

347
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:16,880
and I'm not the one to say this is a priori bad but I think it plays into the limitations of that

348
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:26,920
kind of knowledge production as a collective and I think it has just as much in the sciences in

349
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:33,680
that sense a political dimension since it's there that the kind of knowledge whether we care about

350
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:43,280
it or not whether this rather than that also needs to be communicated to a general public so I don't

351
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:49,880
think it's an issue of say fashionable literary theories or not but I think it has to do with how

352
00:39:49,880 --> 00:40:01,040
all kind of study is part of a larger social larger society with its political implications

353
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:14,920
if I may respond here I think there's the issue of what is what is valuable to know and I think

354
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,760
that's where the points that you make are totally valid and they are just a valid in

355
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:25,560
sciences that are taken constantly I mean we all have worked long enough in major universities to

356
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:35,560
know that has a political social cultural fashion dimension but I think what the point if I'm

357
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:42,960
understanding what Tim was saying correctly is that in the humanities and for example this literary

358
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:53,680
criticism example right there isn't the same kind of scheme for evaluating many explanations or

359
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:04,600
ordering explanations privileging explanations so in science we have the sort of cycle of experimental

360
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:13,040
verification replication you know measurement I mean sort of you know empirical interventions

361
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,200
you know however you know there fuzzy in some ways etc but the point is we have a scheme of

362
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,880
ordering explanations and for privileging which one which is correct and which is wrong in which

363
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,080
you can discount whereas in the humanities you don't have the same kind of scheme absolutely not

364
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:39,400
the humanities about something totally different right so which so the question is that when you

365
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,560
don't have a scheme for privileging one explanation over another the nature of what you create as

366
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,760
knowledge so there's multiple ways of knowing there's always a multiple allowed right if knowledge

367
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:02,000
wouldn't even be the key operative term in the humanities so I mean I don't know we have a debate

368
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:12,040
about that yeah yeah I think we agree that you know yeah yeah I would like to raise a philosophy

369
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:21,120
of questions we have a philosopher here do you should want to distinguish between sort of knowledge

370
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:30,360
which is sort of restricted to some kind of consciousness or like you have these thinking about

371
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:37,640
these birds that migrate these tremendous distances and know exactly how to go there and know that

372
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:44,200
they should do it in certain things is that knowledge or is that what this is okay so yeah this is

373
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,840
what you do in introductory epistemology course right that's what I wonder if we have someone who

374
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:56,760
speaks a better language than English for this purpose so in English know is multiply ambiguous

375
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:04,280
and in German you have this in Canon and Canon and you call them different things right so a kind

376
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:11,480
of practical ability which is what the birds have is a different kind of thing I think I should

377
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:20,560
take your freshman course yeah yeah you know so so the the kind of old first shot at definition of

378
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:28,320
knowledge of the kind that philosophers are interested in goes back to a suggestion made in a

379
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:33,360
platonic dialogue of course it's shot down by Socrates as is every other suggestion but that

380
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:38,880
that knowledge is something like justified true belief right so in order to know something I have

381
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,200
to believe it to be true I have to believe it it has to be true I can't know falsehoods and I

382
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,920
have to be justified and then there's a lot of this is what I was talking about evidence what are

383
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:56,840
my grounds what are my you know what what could I say if someone challenged me to back up right give

384
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:02,000
give reasons for the belief I have that presumably they could share those reasons or criticize them

385
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,440
presumably your birds if I ask you why did you take a right rather than a lot of you know they

386
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,280
have nothing to say I can't criticize them they they have a perfectly good ability and we might be

387
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:20,760
interested in how they do it but it may very well be that a lot of what we do we can't say about

388
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:27,960
anything either absolutely I mean I mean Hume wonderfully you know Hume made a wonderful true

389
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:34,760
observation about human being so Hume was looking at the limits of reason of the human faculty of

390
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:40,320
human reason and and Hume came to the correct conclusion it's a really good thing that humans

391
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:46,200
don't try and reason their way through their everyday lives because they die what what we do is we

392
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:52,960
rely on habit mostly right we just do things unthinkingly because we're actually pretty bad

393
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,880
reasoners I mean or people would die watching Fox News right I mean they would just have

394
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,880
our you know our actual ability to lay out an argument and hear the premises and this follows

395
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:12,640
from that and this could be questioned is is is is very poor and and we usually don't rely on

396
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,280
that getting around day-to-day life good for us it would be nice to promote a little more of it

397
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:29,040
but I wasn't very clear because before you came Perry was saying about what limitations there are

398
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:38,680
at least in terms of cosmology with your comment about prediction your implication is there is

399
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:46,720
no limitation it's just that we cannot predict now so in 20 years we may be able to say yes

400
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:58,640
the temperature will be 62 Fahrenheit in September 19 whatever 2000 I firmly believe that very

401
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:06,000
strong limits extremely strong limits what we can we're just I mean just even in simple things

402
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,960
which we can enumerate they get to be so and so on so I'm very strong limits what I don't believe

403
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:22,800
is that one can a priori say what those limits are now in other words yes I agree that there are

404
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:32,280
limits and there are questions that we will not be able to do but to pin down and say and to pin

405
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:39,920
down and say exactly that in 10 years we will not be able to know this and that okay I say

406
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:47,920
tomorrow we want that I'll say you're right 10 years maybe 100 years I mean this right what

407
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,280
what the limits are on what we may be able to predict depend on the right theory now you can

408
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:57,160
show some things with some simplified model so that you know you can show something like this and

409
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,840
this is just now mathematics it's not real physics suppose I had a box of gas and I think of it just

410
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:08,040
like colliding billiard balls so they're just gonna bounce off each other in a nice elastic way and

411
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:14,760
if they collide slightly differently they'll bounce slightly differently so you can just model that

412
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:21,200
system with 10 to the 23rd billiard balls bouncing around and in a kind of Newtonian situation you

413
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:28,920
ask well suppose I wanted to predict where that particular atom is gonna be in 10 minutes and you

414
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:37,260
just move a rock on Mars right a little pebble on Mars and you sort of calculate that that little

415
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:45,040
change in the gravitational force is gonna make this guy collide slightly off and that's gonna make

416
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:50,120
him bounce off at a slightly different angle and that gets amplified in every collision and you

417
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:56,080
can sort of say in that model you can show that if you move this pebble on Mars where this atom is

418
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:01,240
gonna be in 10 minutes will be completely different and if that's correct if that's the right

419
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,240
dynamics for the system then you're gonna say you're never gonna be able to predict where that

420
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:12,240
atom's gonna go because you'd have to know the exact position of everything you know now now

421
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,680
that's something you know we could find out that some systems are like that and so specific

422
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:23,280
predictions aren't very the key word gonna come back the key word in this discussion is if yeah

423
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:31,440
yeah I mean yeah if the conditions are and chances are they are that way you'll never be able to predict but

424
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:38,960
we don't know I mean maybe there's some what they used to what's called Maxwell's devil or

425
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,800
something that's that's cooking up things so that something will happen in a certain way and some

426
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:52,000
great genius or some guy was very lucky will stumble and find this and figure out the box that

427
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,520
you presented in which looks like blah blah blah will actually be that everything will concentrate

428
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,800
in one corner and everybody will die because they can't breathe breathe anymore I mean that

429
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:16,960
right you know so I mean I think that yeah I mean I think that we can say very safely that

430
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,960
the huge amount of stuff that we don't know and we can say there's a huge amount of stuff that we

431
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:30,640
can never hope to know but we can't really pin down what that's what you know well let's give a

432
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:37,440
chance you wanted to ask something before well I was wondering whether I'm the only one who's

433
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,760
somehow hesitating as I hear you all debate the limits of knowledge exclusively in terms of

434
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:54,960
the ability to predict or not whether I mean the three that this is the only limit to knowledge or

435
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,920
the way you imagine limit because so far we've only talked about it that way or you've only talked

436
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:06,080
about it in terms of the test of the limitations of knowledge would be the incapacity to predict

437
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:17,360
and that I find I think too poor to think about the limitations of human knowledge and so I actually

438
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:26,160
I was going to to ask how else apart from the limitations of the capacity to predict does one

439
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,440
want to articulate or think about the limitations of knowledge this is what I was actually I agree

440
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,760
with you I mean I think prediction isn't such such an interesting thing in fact the interesting

441
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:42,320
thing is it's the opposite side if you're interested like I am on as it were what the fundamental

442
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:47,920
constituents of the universe are and how they work there are cases where you can have two different

443
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,680
proposals and then show they make the same predictions right so whatever those predictions are

444
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,080
they're going to be identical and then you're in a situation where you say well that means I

445
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:07,520
can't decide between these observationally right so these are kind of I just agree with that if

446
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:14,320
you have two systems that when every case will predict the same things then they're equivalent

447
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:21,760
just to just a way of saying no I say yes that's correct well how else I mean what

448
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:30,320
how can they be different if they if they how can you possibly have a difference if this if the

449
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:37,600
ideas lead exactly to the same results in every case because the results are just what happens at

450
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:43,680
large scale so oh no I can have I thought just you said every case well but what I mean what you could

451
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,680
what it predicts in terms of what's observable which is all we have right yeah right so right so I

452
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:57,200
can there are string so if it's not if it's not observable if the differences predictions are

453
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:03,760
not observable then what is what sense does it make you can't can't observe it you might like to

454
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,760
know what it is so for example there are various versions of string theories different versions

455
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:16,960
of string theories yes that will lead to the final post Big Bang universe that we do see

456
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,560
right to the same universe that we see so we don't know how to discriminate between those two

457
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:30,560
yes because we because these theories it's not clear exactly what else they predict or don't

458
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:37,520
predict their sort of ify theories but if you have an example of two theories where you can you

459
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:44,960
were where in every case what they predict the same thing that observable then I claim the theories

460
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:53,040
are equivalent no no but I'm giving the same example so the theories predict observables that

461
00:52:53,600 --> 00:53:00,480
are exactly what all we observe in the 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang the point of

462
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:12,240
discrimination between these two lies beyond right and we have no observational consequence that

463
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,920
we need to be able to discriminate between those two theories and they are fundamentally different

464
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:26,160
theories they are not the same theory so we we cannot I know this is a real conundrum that

465
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:35,600
we see but I guess we're not talking on the same I was I was assuming from his comments that we

466
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:42,000
already that we already know what all these theories predict and and everything they do is the same

467
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:47,360
but you are saying that these theories we don't really know that differently don't already know

468
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:53,600
what they will predict and all the things that we know they're the same but there may be some

469
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:59,280
place where one theory says one thing and the other says something else some you know and not all

470
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,800
of that's a different situation this is sort of the wrong way right look the theories that Priya

471
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:10,480
are talking about are different theories how do I know that well they say different things like they

472
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:17,120
say the exact structure you have all these compactified kalabaya spaces with different topologies that

473
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,920
this guy has this one and that one this is a different theory then you subject it to some

474
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,280
analysis and say wait let me finish then you subject it to an analysis and say what does this

475
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,200
theory predict now there is no logical reason why two different theories couldn't make the same

476
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:41,280
predictions well it depends what you mean by different they say different things no if they predict

477
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:47,040
exactly the same things in every series conceivable circumstance they say the same thing except maybe

478
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:54,320
in different language well this is you know as I say you you say space time has 10 dimensions

479
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,680
three of them spread out seven of them are compactified you're a mathematician I give you

480
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,360
different topologies for that compactification those are two different theories of space time

481
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,360
structure not really aren't sure they are they're not gonna be different things they're not

482
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:16,560
different topologies what is this is this a limit that no you can't have two theories no I think

483
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:22,320
no no this is I think what we're alluding to is a very interesting conundrum and limit in cosmology

484
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:33,440
again restricted to cosmology which is the fact that you we do not have a theory pre-big bang

485
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:42,640
that we can get observational evidence for so we cannot pin down which theory is right we can't

486
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:49,360
use the same methods of evaluation of the truth value of theories that we have become accustomed to

487
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:57,920
and we cannot discriminate between them so what so the so how do we determine what is more valid

488
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:05,200
than which which model is more valid than the other because the predictions that these theories

489
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:12,160
make are always late time predictions and they patch on to everything that we do see so you know

490
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:20,000
we don't have anything that's can be used as a discriminant right so it's a new kind of explanation

491
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:28,960
so you know this is an idea of a multiverse right for example these are not testable theory so

492
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:35,440
in cosmology we are at this very interesting juncture where we've reached a point where we may have to

493
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:43,360
start permitting other kinds of explanations beyond testable observability and so on so forth

494
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,720
and you know maybe he's right that maybe in 10 years someone will come up with an observable

495
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:57,120
consequence today and in the night sky you know in the cosmic microwave background or something of

496
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:05,040
two different bubble universes colliding and we will know I mean maybe no yeah I mean I'm just

497
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:11,920
saying something completely theoretical which may not actually apply that's why we have yeah

498
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:17,840
I'm saying that if by chance two theories in every case predict exactly the same thing

499
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:25,920
then I say the theories are equivalent but as it is all these theories that you mentioned

500
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:32,960
we don't really know what they predict in some we know the things that we they may agree on the

501
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,440
things that we know but it's a very limited range and lots of things that these we haven't

502
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,320
mathematically or whatever we haven't ever to use these theories to predict so they look different

503
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,960
and it may well be different because they at some point you may turn out that they do predict

504
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:52,400
different things but if you are sure that they will never predict anything different than their

505
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:58,480
equivalent in my in my interview so let me give you again go back to philosophy

506
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:06,160
the introduction to skepticism do we know here's here two theories that are different

507
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,360
one theory says this is what Priya will tell us that there was a big kind of big bangy event

508
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:17,920
that was what 13.7 are we now billion years ago and there was all of this galaxy formation and

509
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,080
then the earth formed in the solar system and there was a lot of evolution then we have another

510
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,720
theory it's really quite a different theory it says this the universe only began to exist 10

511
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,280
minutes ago none of you you none of you actually got here by subway or anything like that

512
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:41,520
it it just began right by fiat in exactly the state that we think obtained 10 10 minutes ago but

513
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,800
there was nothing before that right so you've got all these false memories it's going to be okay

514
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:51,200
when you go home everything will be right now those are just different theories right one says

515
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,560
you grew up and the other says no you didn't right you're under this kind of strange delusion of

516
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:02,480
having grown up but clearly by construction they make exactly the same predictions for everything

517
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:08,640
you could possibly observe from here until infinity because they they make the the physical state

518
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:16,000
match as of 10 minutes ago those are different theories now one is silly okay i'm not suggesting

519
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,120
you believe it but your reason for not believing it is not anything you observe it's something else

520
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:27,680
but i mean it depends what you mean by theory i mean you want a theory

521
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:35,760
if you say some if you stick on some kind of irrelevant stuff to a theory and then you say

522
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,320
that makes it different and there's nothing to do with with prediction anything else

523
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:46,480
then then you say okay that's different but actually it's the same thing if it predicts the same thing

524
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:57,440
but i think his point was i thought your point to me at least not being a mathematician or a

525
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:05,280
cosmologist or a philosopher made sense that it may be that those two theories in addition to

526
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:11,920
what they predict which is the same they could also at some point you could also find things

527
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,840
that they predict that are different no sure but the question and therefore if that then they

528
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:22,960
would be different but if for some that's what you want theoretical so i'm saying but if it was an

529
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:29,840
unknown theoretical reason you can show that two theories will predict always the same thing then

530
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,800
i claim that they're equivalent in my definition of equivalence may not be your definition you may

531
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,440
you may feel that if you add some irrelevant thing to a theory then it makes it different i say that

532
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,840
if if the theory if the theories are the same for all relevant things then then for me that's the

533
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:55,280
difference is between the theories happen in a regime where our methods of observation testing

534
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,680
blah blah blah don't apply that's the case we are talking about it's not that they you know one of

535
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,480
them is this ridiculous because it's different the thing is you could have two theories that are

536
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:14,320
very different theories who set of predictions they make a set of predictions that are identical

537
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,440
and accessible with the apparatus we have the experimental observational parties that we have

538
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:26,640
they make predictions that might be different let's say they are different they are different

539
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:34,080
but they are different in a realm in a regime that our methods of evaluating theories are not

540
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:39,440
applicable not accessible no no no argument with that yeah i think those are the kinds of theories

541
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,800
i was just picking up something that he said mr mr's understanding it that if they are exactly

542
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:50,320
the same on every conceivable experiment that you can make then i say they're equivalent that's uh

543
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:55,680
but that's not what you're saying uh i really appreciate it well i think i want to go back to

544
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:02,320
bringing darthia into the conversation about kinds of explanation that constitute knowledge

545
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:12,400
uh and so and they are fundamentally different across disciplines and i wanted you to talk a

546
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:22,560
little bit more about um you know in science it's kind of there is a mechanism of figuring out what

547
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:31,760
is a valid explanation um what is how does that map into other fields how would you think about it

548
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,320
in other fields you obviously are not ordering there's no hierarchy of explanation there isn't

549
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:46,480
one you know critical view that is better than the other there's no you don't have a mechanism

550
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:52,240
or to generate you know a hierarchy of explanation to say this is better than that that's better

551
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:59,040
than this but there is something else i mean still there is a way in which people are able to ferret

552
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:06,800
out the absurd from the profound and um and you know it would be interesting to hear a little bit more

553
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:14,560
about how the discrimination happens in other fields it's kind of easy to see how it happens

554
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:21,840
in science well i mean what you described in science works very much with a model of um

555
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:30,080
um figuring out and representing the laws of nature so within i mean in a very abstract way

556
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:38,880
within a representational paradigm and um i would say you mean beyond mathematics not yeah okay yeah

557
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:49,520
um with the empirical component and in the humanities i mean which is also historical phenomenon there

558
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:55,600
were no humanities before the renaissance but in the humanities what you study is not primarily

559
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:04,000
nature but i would say the best products of the human mind as they i mean arguably best product

560
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:15,520
mind as they emerge in the arts as they emerge in philosophy in religion and um what we study is

561
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:24,240
what allows for their emergence but also how we make them relevant to our time and what we produce

562
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:32,320
is not primarily knowledge but we accept we expect that this engagement with what i would call the

563
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:40,720
best products of the human mind which is always mediated um transforms the student and the teacher

564
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:48,640
and the teacher so it's a very different activity so of course there are hundreds of years of

565
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:56,720
procedures and ways of deciding and evaluating the validity of that kind of scholarship absolutely

566
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:06,720
but it's not within that frame of a kind of representational factual empirical set i don't know

567
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:13,440
rotation doesn't play a role at all well the limitation plays also a role but the limitation

568
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:20,880
there i think has to do primarily with historical situatedness historical cultural situatedness

569
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:29,200
which is a limitation that you know you can turn around you can make productive and in a way when

570
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:37,120
i address the situatedness of scientific knowledge i was interested in hearing you talk more and you

571
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:46,000
did talk quite a bit about making the limitations productive uh rather than seeing them as a disadvantage

572
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:53,440
and say in the humanities it's i don't think a model of a cumulative

573
01:05:53,440 --> 01:06:03,200
with uh enterprise and i i was listening to the three of you and i found it especially interesting

574
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:11,600
with some of the remarks that Tim made you also portrayed in a way scientific progress not as a

575
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:23,360
cumulative enterprise but as a synthetic enterprise or it's both right

576
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:30,800
well you address the question of the reduction of the increased complexity which then raises

577
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:38,640
the question of the reduction of complexity yeah i guess the two alternate but so i guess

578
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:46,800
there the limitations would be articulated differently with regard of to how you see your

579
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:55,760
entire field and its limitations if you say the scientific versus say the English scholarship

580
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:02,480
in the humanities i think scholarship in the humanities a very fundamental level always has to do

581
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:12,080
with different histories and the present and how you bring them together whereas in the sciences i

582
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:19,200
don't think this is the primary limitation which you can make or have to make productive but you

583
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:26,320
know you you talked about the observation and the limits to predictability and i would assume

584
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:32,000
there are others yeah i mean let me just say that i mean the sociological you mentioned before the

585
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,800
sociological aspect in terms of funding and so on i mean that that's a different kind of limit

586
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,320
to be very alive in the sciences and in some sense

587
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:49,840
what i mean this comes back to the question what are you interested in what are you trying to find

588
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:58,000
out at a certain point there was a tremendous premium on finding out a whole lot about radioactive

589
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,720
uranium and how it works during the manhattan project and a lot of resources were put into it and by

590
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:10,400
any reasonable standard of success people were quite successful in figuring out how it worked but

591
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:17,680
there was obviously a decision to focus resources on that question rather than any number of other

592
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:24,560
questions you could have focused on and and probably right now for people like uh Priya

593
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:36,800
um the biggest threat to producing more knowledge my guess is that somebody says why do we care

594
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:42,880
about dark matter rather than you know that there are limitations of the sizes and so on and

595
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:48,880
everything and you know i mean that's at least one place where part of us we're just looking at the

596
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:54,160
limitations the universe itself puts on us in terms of what we can know about it um there are

597
01:08:54,160 --> 01:09:00,000
probably much stronger limitations of the that we put on ourselves as a society in terms of what

598
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,280
we demand or or request or make sure gets funded and is allowed you know research that's allowed to

599
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:13,600
continue and that's probably a bigger worry quite honestly practical worry than any of these other

600
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:26,880
ones kind of abstract ones we've been talking about okay questions no comments if you have comments

601
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:36,800
you want to be drawn to be driven by the applicability right but you know i think that um important point

602
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:42,160
that you made is that science is invested in a notion of progress in a way that the humanities

603
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:48,160
are not because there's a provisionality in science okay couple quick uh quick observation

604
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:56,800
then uh my question um i've got i submit that there one possible reconciliation between um

605
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:07,040
Joseph and the pre- um temp camp on the uh on the matter of the theories uh as you know um

606
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,800
originally there were multiple versions of string theory uh five of them Ed Witten

607
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:17,760
rep uh you know famously resolved them in a very short period of time to surprise his fellow conferees

608
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:23,680
so i'm so you know one possible way out of that conundrum would be that on a deeper level of

609
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:30,320
mathematical structure they would found to have have more in common but it's also a question of

610
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:36,640
we can't know what we don't know it's to the point of since we can't there's some tantalizing

611
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:42,320
possibilities but we can't go back before the big bang so their axiomatics assumptions made

612
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:48,880
that those different assumptions affect the theories that come out of it and it is remarkable

613
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:57,200
they predict the same end state so i just want that to answer that um the but the the question is um

614
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:08,080
um in terms of knowledge production we focused on cognitive production of knowledge um

615
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:15,360
and mostly in the sciences we didn't really address very much in the arts and the question

616
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:24,240
my question is based on your Wilson uh biologist no uh that um science explains emotion

617
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:31,120
um and art communicates it communicates emotions so the question is since our

618
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:38,080
um cognition is primarily driven or largely driven by emotional and other cognitive biases

619
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:44,800
of which we are not necessarily aware um and that rational explanation is often an afterthought

620
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,520
i'm wondering if there's anyone who has any comment on that that whole portion of knowledge

621
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:57,600
that is partially brought to the table by uh phenotypical expression and neural tissue

622
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:02,320
a lot for example in the ascending visual pathway and the hewlin-weasels discovery

623
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:11,440
but also uh in terms of interesting experiments that show that a choice experiment uh can be

624
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:18,880
predicted by the researchers by monitoring the the limbic system with fMRI they know the decision

625
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:24,960
the subjects will make before they use cognition and language to make that decision if anyone has

626
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:32,880
a comment on that entire realm of knowledge i would welcome it i i mean i i'm not deeply

627
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,520
knowledgeable about this fMRI things but my understanding from what i've read

628
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:48,240
is that is that it's a bit overblown when people say oh uh you know we evil scientists looking at

629
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,920
our screens and monitoring your brain know what you're going to do before you do it

630
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:59,600
in that those are typically choices which are literally random i mean what you think of as

631
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:05,200
random choices right push the button on the right or the button on the left with no particular reason

632
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:12,640
to care or be able to consider which is the better choice right and that of course

633
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,080
something's going to happen in your brain that's going to make that as it were decide which way you

634
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:23,520
go and maybe they can pick it up but but the kind of choices we care about are ones that we

635
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:32,960
consider right ones that we reflect on and the liberate about and you know that that's not even

636
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:38,640
what they're looking at so if you were to if you were to if you were to ask me a question about

637
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,440
that required a lot of the liberation where where i thought a lot hung on what i did and it was hard

638
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:48,960
and i had to evaluate and make guesses and so on i don't think anybody looking at an fMRI is going

639
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,360
to tell me ten minutes beforehand or five minutes beforehand how that's going to come out

640
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,360
the

641
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,240
decision

642
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:22,400
right but how that decision making is done chemical molecule by molecule by molecule is not known

643
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:29,600
right so i just want to come back to you Wilson right i think he is overly optimistic so i think

644
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,600
his point of view is that you know the things that are currently unnoble are things that are in the

645
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:43,600
things in the gaps are between disciplines and he's very optimistic that we will know in x number

646
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:51,440
of years we will know what is the molecular composition of anger like what will you know what are the

647
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:56,560
things that need to line up that will make you angry wait wait wait he believes in that

648
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,480
have you finished

649
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:15,200
and that we are in mind and brain has evolved over the years and that we realize monkeys can't

650
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:21,280
understand the world why don't why is it obvious that some species will come after us with bigger

651
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,600
brains that we're not the end of evolution and they'll look back at us and say obviously those

652
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,280
species couldn't understand what was going on

653
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:39,840
but yep there's nothing i can respond other than i think as a species we seem to be so stupid that

654
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:43,600
we'll destroy the planet before there's room for you know the next set of emerging

655
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:49,600
i mean let me just say say what i mean people often say that look we evolved to survive on the

656
01:15:49,600 --> 01:16:00,080
savannah that's you know the context now humans as you know unlike every other species that's ever

657
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:09,120
existed the premium for intelligence in humans became critical that's why our brains got so big

658
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:13,680
right they got so big they got as big as they could get until it would kill you to give birth

659
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:18,080
this a thing with such a big brain and that's why we have such a long latency period is infants

660
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:21,520
that we can't take care of ourselves because basically we're still essentially growing

661
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:26,960
outside the womb to get our brains even bigger so we're pretty much at the biological brain limit

662
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:32,480
but the interesting thing is that that pressure for higher intelligence does not occur in any

663
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:37,600
other species right cockroaches have been around a really long time they don't need to get smarter

664
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,720
they're doing perfectly well they're gonna outlive us okay so there's the whether that whether there

665
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:47,680
will ever be a more intelligent species is one question the other question is are we really that

666
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:54,640
dumb i mean the argument that says we grew up and we we were selected to survive in the savannah

667
01:16:54,640 --> 01:17:01,360
would predict that why should we ever understand the microscopics of a table right just the microscopic

668
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:06,400
just the the chemical structure the double helix structure of dna why should we ever understand

669
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:12,240
a supernova why should we ever understand how galaxies form i mean all of things that are vastly

670
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:17,280
outside the scale or a lot of mathematics right why should we understand complex numbers

671
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:24,640
you know so the range of things that humans have been able to understand that have no basis

672
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:30,160
obvious basis at all in evolutionary history is really quite astonishing yeah but there are

673
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:35,680
other things like understanding beginnings and ends that sort of built into our basic we can't

674
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,640
we can't conceive of things without beginnings around what comes before the beginning comes

675
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:46,080
after the end there are certain concepts like that seem to me i don't think we're ever gonna

676
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:54,800
just tell me um yeah i would like to comment on something uh dim said um yeah it's uh well i

677
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:02,720
agree with everything there's one thing is that we have had this tremendous evolution in

678
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:09,600
in being able to understand more and more is taking place maybe in the past 50,000 years

679
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:15,920
before that things were going well slowly so it's a very speculative thing if there's a

680
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:22,720
if there were similar conditions as we had experience and similar humans exist somewhere else

681
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:32,560
but if they had a one million year advantage over us what sort of things there i mean if

682
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:39,600
their the rate of development shoots up at the same rate as ours and continues they may be so

683
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:47,840
far ahead of us that we look pretty it's pretty primitive well i'm in the arts i'm a painter

684
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:53,920
and art historian and so i'm going to speak up a little for the other side um what interests me

685
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:59,200
in the in the arts is there is a difference in science between knowing and in the arts between

686
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:05,040
creating and the conceptual creating gherson by the way speaks very well about a fluid universe

687
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:09,200
where one thing happens after another and you have no idea what's going to happen because

688
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:14,880
each thing accumulates after another thing and in the process of creating whether it's in writing

689
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,880
or in painting it's a process the exciting process is you do not know what is going to happen after

690
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,760
you make one stroke and another stroke what the nature of that procedure is going to be

691
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,640
and that doesn't just limit itself though i think to the world of the art i think it limits itself

692
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:36,960
i mean it expands itself to the freedom and elasticity of the mind and artists are very often

693
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:43,360
interested in the interior and exterior world but maybe even more so now in the interior world

694
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:49,120
what do we know before we look at the world what's already inside us do we already understand

695
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:55,200
structures without without looking at the external world so there's a conflict between what do we

696
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:01,680
know internally in our very brain structure what exists in the outside world how do we mingle the

697
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:10,000
two and how can we the great excitement in the arts is creativity is the unknowing and finding

698
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:16,240
out where you are finding a position where you are so instead of looking for certainty there's a search

699
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:23,520
for where will i go will i will it lead somewhere i've never been before and i think these are very

700
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:30,160
important questions maybe in the larger sphere too about the excitement of unknowability rather than

701
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:39,840
certainty very nice um very nice i just wanted to quickly add that you know even in science that is

702
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:48,000
you know there is provisionality it's a different kind of provisionality where you you know what

703
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,720
you know now that is subject you know a current best understanding of something could change

704
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:58,240
dramatically the means by which it changes is very prescribed its experiment its evidence

705
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:05,040
and it's different for the arts it's provision the way in which the provisionality shifts is

706
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:10,320
different and it's part of a what you call the creative process right and i should leave you

707
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:20,560
to comment more this is beautifully said here doesn't need any help okay first the observation

708
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:27,280
and then the question the observation is this gentleman third challenge the butterfly effect

709
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:36,960
is that a true aspect of chaotic systems and in any think of something recent discovery of

710
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:44,880
a holographic universe that this 3d the information contained in the 3d universe

711
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:51,280
which we think is 3d can actually be mapped into two dimensions so physical phenomena may be

712
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:57,920
slightly more ordered than we think i don't know if that's relevant but that's an observation that

713
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:08,240
maybe you're on to something there uh and then the question is about a world of policy and

714
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:16,240
decision-making that we make as individuals and we make as a society before the economic collapse

715
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:25,520
of 2008 uh no one quite saw that coming was that a lack of knowledge was that a butterfly effect or

716
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:31,840
was that truly we were blind to something that we should have known and it affects today i mean

717
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:39,920
what's our policy with respect to ISIS and Ebola and all these other threats how real is the

718
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:50,480
ISIS threat how committed are our allies and enemies how do we know these things so is that

719
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:56,960
part of this discussion or are we just concerned about art and science as far as knowledge goes

720
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:08,240
i think what you address is a very interesting question in terms of how far does the scientific

721
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:19,520
paradigm of knowledge get expanded uh when we go into the realm of politics is uh i don't know

722
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:26,800
whether i can say the slout here but is economics a science yeah oh that's another one for you

723
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:35,360
you're concerned love yeah no but when does it and how does it pose as a science and when is it a

724
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:47,280
form of politics and so i think that's that's the question about the limits of the scientific

725
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:53,120
paradigm which is i think a very relevant political question that brings up again the question of

726
01:23:53,120 --> 01:24:00,720
about the interests the way relevance gets articulated and debated in a democratic society

727
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:07,360
if the resources are limited right i mean i would say in the in the particular case of the financial

728
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:16,240
crisis uh it's not so much the limitations of economics as a science it's just the imposition

729
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:23,920
of unbelievable amounts of self-interest into the system i mean you know ponzi schemes

730
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:31,200
it's economically well understood that ponzi schemes will collapse it's also perfectly well

731
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:35,920
understood that they make a heck of a lot of money for certain people over a certain period of time

732
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:42,800
okay so a self-organizing ponzi scheme in which a bank can sell somebody a mortgage and then

733
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:47,920
immediately throw it off on some other bank so that if the thing goes bust there that you know

734
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:53,760
that they're secure i mean this is just an opportunity for people to make tons and tons and tons of

735
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:59,600
money in a way that is forcibly not sustainable and will eventually yes is it for sea

736
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:07,600
or sea or was in 2006 people before sea some people i think yes i think it was perfectly for

737
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:13,280
sea or sea and for scene and still people were making tons and tons of money off it i mean

738
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:20,320
you know the question is not g could you not see it coming the point is even if you see it coming

739
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:24,000
lots of people are going to say yeah and somebody else is going to get stuck with the bag and i'm

740
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,760
going to make a ton of money off it okay and you you can't know no amount of economic you know

741
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,480
economics will tell you that's actually what's going to happen i was just add that the in fact

742
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:40,320
that people were after the money were right and in the end when everything collapsed they didn't

743
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:47,120
lose the money the the banks were bailed out they got every and everything went uh so from their

744
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:51,600
point of view if they're interested in making the money they were completely right and economics

745
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:58,320
was a very sound science given the fact for they understood it and they wanted to get their money

746
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:04,160
and they didn't care about anything else so um so they work very well and it shows that it is a

747
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:11,520
viable science i just wanted to sorry would you want to say something well i i keep that for

748
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:17,440
another point the um i wanted to quickly respond to your question about you know the relevance

749
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:24,240
for argument to threats and risk and managing risk isis ebola and so on and i think there is

750
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:32,960
relevance because you know what we're talking about um is extrapolation from what we know however

751
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:39,120
little it might be and what those extrapolations are and the degree of confidence we have in those

752
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:46,320
extrapolations so you know there are models that predict now how ebola will spread with a certain

753
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:53,840
degree of confidence for example so indeed the ways in which we are thinking about this that has

754
01:26:53,840 --> 01:27:01,920
to do with extrapolations of current knowledge and the limitations that it imposes in terms of how

755
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:07,520
reliable those extrapolations are is very relevant and it's very policy relevant

756
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:13,440
but i think you know my former advisor is now started in with a bunch of people in Cambridge

757
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:23,120
and institute for the evaluation of existential risks it's um martin reese um so you know they

758
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:30,240
really work within you know trying to estimate the probabilities for it right i mean i i do think

759
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:38,080
the tactical situation their cases like you say so take ebola could it become airborne if it became

760
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:44,320
airborne you're in an entirely different epidemiological situation very dangerous extremely dangerous

761
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:49,840
their limits to what we know and what the mutation rates are and what the probabilities are but

762
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:56,000
on the other hand if like climate change it's not that we're in that situation we're in a situation

763
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,680
we have tremendously good i mean there's you know always issues around the edge um there are

764
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:07,120
systematic attempts by people with a lot of money and a lot of power to avoid doing certain things

765
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:12,080
because it'll hurt their bottom line in the case of isis i mean my god one of the suggestions

766
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,680
what's the first thing we have to do about isis secure the border with mexico

767
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:20,160
i mean this is not you know you shouldn't be having a discussion about the limits of

768
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:25,040
knowledge here you should i mean this is just you know fear-mongering nonsense right that a bunch

769
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:31,280
of guys with you know rifles are going to be coming across the mexican border i mean i just want to

770
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:37,680
give up not for a new film that's coming out called merchants of doubt and it's about this

771
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:46,480
historian at carver Naomi or sicky uh talk about climate change and she's done a study showing that

772
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:54,720
more than 97 percent of scientists actually agree on climate change and we know how in popular

773
01:28:54,720 --> 01:29:05,440
culture it's presented as an ongoing controversy right so okay this question is directed towards

774
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:12,000
the scientists possibly the class of scientists a little louder can you hear me yeah yeah i made

775
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:21,040
the difference uh so uh earlier dr natar natarajan pointed out that there seems to be an agreed-upon

776
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:32,240
limit uh pretty big bang uh my question is given that you're all curious um empirical reasoning

777
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:41,280
often atheistic people i'm talking about scientists uh how do you deal with just that

778
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:49,200
stoppage that that just oh let's forget about it let's just not talk about it and maybe you have

779
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:54,160
some insight on personally or with your colleagues you can talk about someone else

780
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:05,600
well it is problematic right and i think that so for example let me give uh an example of um

781
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:13,920
because pretty big we don't have information and we have these theoretical ideas floating around

782
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:18,080
and then post big bang we have this additional conundrum that you know there's

783
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,000
depending on who you are there about six numbers that will describe the fate of the universe the

784
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,520
future present on the past and they are measurable and they have particular values the question is

785
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:33,520
why do they have those values and so this is whole sort of there was a whole argument of why does our

786
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:40,320
universe seem to be so tailor-made why it's so finely tuned right and so one way out of this

787
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:44,960
finely tuned situation was to say well let's say there are six numbers that determine the fate

788
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,800
of the universe and let's just say that there's some probability distribution function for

789
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:54,720
what values all possible values of those six numbers there are many draws from those the numbers

790
01:30:54,720 --> 01:31:00,560
six six draws infinite number of six draws and each of them gives you a universe so to someone

791
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:06,160
like me that's a very acceptable so that's a multiverse so that's a very comfortable explanation

792
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:13,360
and an explanation um which is not going to be empirically testable and as i said and the

793
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:20,480
discomfort there is do we then have to start thinking about new ways of evaluating excellent

794
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:26,640
competing explanations right and i think it's something that's scientifically quite actively

795
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:31,600
debated wouldn't you say to them on both on philosophical grounds and empirical grounds

796
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:37,680
in terms of like and is this what's the out right i mean that's what you're asking like what's the

797
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:42,560
out right you know yeah i mean the only thing i would add is there's a kind of presupposition

798
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:50,400
behind your question i don't know what atheism has to do with anything that well what can we do

799
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:56,160
if we want to know something but the evidence isn't available to answer the question we're

800
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:01,200
interested in how do we deal with that and of course that happens all the time in life and

801
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:05,040
lots of things i mean there are people who debate who wrote Shakespeare's plays and they have these

802
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:10,080
different you know possible people will there ever be evidence i mean there's been all this dispute

803
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:14,320
who was Jack the Ripper i just was reading recently they think oh gosh there was a piece of evidence

804
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:20,080
that was overlooked some shawl and it had this DNA on it now we know it was so and so maybe that's

805
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:24,000
right maybe that's wrong maybe that shawl would never show up i mean there are lots of questions

806
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:30,320
out there that you might have intense interest in if it turns out the evidence isn't there to

807
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:35,840
to answer the question you're interested in you know look at your disappointment okay suck it up

808
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:41,840
that's life i mean you know you do your best right you try and look you try and look at all the

809
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:46,880
possible avenues for acquiring evidence and if you run into a roadblock and it could be a roadblock

810
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:52,000
of deep physical principle or it could be a very trivial one right that just that shawl got burned

811
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,640
up and it's gone um if you run into a roadblock you run into a roadblock and you just

812
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:08,640
get on with life i don't know because i don't think there's anything right to say about that

813
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:17,600
in the beginning you said that you didn't have a reason to believe that the human mind is limitless

814
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:23,760
and that got me thinking um do we have reasons to believe that our mind are rational so my question

815
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:30,320
kind of flows out of that like a foundational question what is the philosophical foundation

816
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:35,840
for one human beings humans being able to understand the universe mathematically

817
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:42,640
and then two the universe in actuality being mathematically intelligible it's kind of like the

818
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:48,240
evolution question before zero foundation for us trusting our rationality and then

819
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:54,480
how is it that the universe is intelligible i think that is what is truly amazing

820
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:04,480
that a that mathematics is such a potent and fundamental language that enables you

821
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:09,920
or a system of thinking that enables you to understand so much of the universe and why it's

822
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:18,000
intelligible at all i think is um i i think it's that's a wonderful mystery it's a source of

823
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:23,840
wonder and awe and i i don't think that we have a deep understanding at the moment

824
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:32,000
one of my colleagues does have a book that he wrote max techmark um recently um and he attempts

825
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:42,320
um he makes a claim that mathematics is much more fundamental in a way to it underlies everything

826
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:47,200
in the universe and that's why everything in his opinion is intelligible with mathematics i'm not

827
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:55,280
sure i'd go as far as him but that's one place to see what what do you think what does the mathematician

828
01:34:55,280 --> 01:35:08,000
think well i think i think somehow that mathematics is the right way of understanding a lot of things

829
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:17,840
that happen in the world and it's you know just like uh just like if you try to use ordinary

830
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:26,560
language to explain things uh things will be things in ordinary life are not so uh don't don't have

831
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:31,840
connections uh which can be expressed so so well in ordinary language so if you try to

832
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:39,120
uh for example describe some fairly simple things in in some subject like differential geometry

833
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:45,760
which comes in and in string theory and so on if you try to describe that in language it becomes

834
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:55,040
so convoluted that you can't even even start so i think mathematics uh is the sort of the natural

835
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:04,000
way to try and think about a lot of phenomena why i don't know i mean it's a mystery but but it

836
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:15,360
seems to be um i mean what how do people how do people communicate how do people uh write down facts

837
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:22,800
of things the facts so so what we know is we know how to uh writing started by writing down

838
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:30,480
by uh speech first and then you try to reproduce speech and the language and so on and um

839
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:38,160
uh mathematics uh is uh is that process which where you are trying to describe certain phenomena

840
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:45,360
and these phenomena are even even in things that may not consider science like economics uh it

841
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:53,920
becomes uh very hard to express certain concepts without using uh mathematical and mathematical

842
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:59,600
yeah can i just make a short comment here because i think um the Greeks divided mathematics we

843
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:04,000
talk about mathematics the Greeks divided mathematics into geometry and arithmetic arithmetic was the

844
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:11,040
theory of number and geometry was the theory of magnitude um over the course of time in mathematical

845
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:16,800
physics the number part the algebraic part has gotten bigger and bigger and bigger and in a way

846
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,520
the geometrical part kind of smaller and smaller and smaller and more and more and more and more

847
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:27,280
it's contested okay but but certainly most of most of physics books you're going to have a lot of

848
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:31,760
algebra in it okay and you're using complex numbers and people ask why complex numbers and things

849
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:37,680
like that but if you were to ask why is geometry if you go back to you clinton geometry why might

850
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:42,800
that be a good way to represent the world the answer was because it's has a geometrical structure

851
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:48,160
it just straightforwardly has a geometrical structure Galileo said you know the the language of geometry

852
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:52,720
with circles and triangles and so on because he thought there were such things i'm not an expert

853
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:58,160
on greek but i have a feeling the geometry meant something else and what you mean by geometry

854
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:04,000
i think it included algebra what they were doing no it didn't it that's part of arithmetic that's

855
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:11,600
okay kamakas i do know okay what do you think eucalyt elements is what geometry it's geometry

856
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:16,160
it's geometry with with one book on the theory of proportion which was held in common between

857
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:22,400
arithmetic and geometry sorry this is getting technical um so anyway if you think this way you

858
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:26,720
might say i'm all of this is a plug okay that's coming up if you think this way you might say what

859
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:34,240
i'd really like to do is get numbers out of my mathematics and and they mentioned my book new

860
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:39,840
new foundations for physical geometry that's just what that is it's an attempt to get numbers out and

861
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:47,120
then you understand more clearly by the mathematics of the physical world i i i think that uh in my

862
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:56,320
my estimation these divisions uh that exist you know there's a geometry and algebra and analysis

863
01:38:56,320 --> 01:39:05,040
and so on those are topology i don't know what uh those are artificial divisions in in my view and

864
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:12,240
i think that all these things are very much intertwined i don't think you know for example i don't think

865
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:18,560
you can separate number theory from analysis or from geometry of geometry or for differential

866
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:27,840
geometry and one flows right into into each other and uh you know i i see that happening all over i

867
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:34,000
mean and uh you know people who are really mathematical minded like like witten is just as

868
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:40,400
interested in in number theory is in geometry is in as an analysis and it all sort of flows together

869
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:46,320
and in fact uh some of the some of the great discoveries that come out of string theory were

870
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:50,960
discus mathematics which were not i i don't know i have not

871
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:57,200
so completely convinced about or don't understand what what the discoveries are in physics but

872
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:03,520
the ones in mathematics are spectacular and they were discoveries in number theory

873
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:08,880
discoveries in geometry and it was all intertwined and it was all intertwined with analysis and

874
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:18,720
and the uh whole development of complex numbers comes from geometry or you could say in many

875
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:24,640
developments in geometry from complex numbers and etc etc i don't think you can you can uh

876
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:31,600
artificially say this is numbers this is just and it just doesn't work that way in my in my

877
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:38,960
estimation okay so i have two questions one for Priya what do you think about the um

878
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,560
believability of the recent evidence on gravitational waves

879
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:51,840
according to multiverse theory and um not secure enough to be considered even a detection

880
01:40:53,280 --> 01:41:01,120
so there was a claim that gravitational waves the detection of

881
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:07,040
gravitational waves would support the multiverse theory not talking about the detection of gravitational

882
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:12,160
waves supporting inflation theory which is correct and what is disputing the

883
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:17,520
set measurements was disputed is how significant that result is and that will get settled

884
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:23,120
in a couple of months when many other experiments will be able independent experiments

885
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:30,240
should see or not see it because that's an issue of uh the model as well as how it's tested to

886
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:38,240
both of those yeah no i think the there isn't uh enough scientific consensus on what the

887
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:42,080
potential observational signatures might be of the multiverse

888
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:49,840
my second question is to all of you regarding the politics of the peer review process in

889
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:53,520
production of knowledge

890
01:41:53,520 --> 01:42:03,920
the politics of it politics of purely well i'll just make a real quick

891
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:08,320
it's interesting because i work in different fields in philosophy everything's double blind

892
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:14,320
in everything's double blinded yeah it's incredible right so you don't know as a referee you don't

893
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:19,680
know who wrote the paper uh it's curious because in physics it isn't yeah because people have to

894
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:24,400
refer to their own work i guess so often it's not really practical but there you know you you can

895
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:31,520
try and limit uh peer review i mean bias is coming into a peer review through certain

896
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:35,760
mechanisms like blinding and uh you know it is done and it has made some difference

897
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:53,760
so whenever it is an explosive idea that it it is lot much harder and people who are

898
01:42:54,400 --> 01:43:02,320
you know already in the field will resist it yeah to become a part of the existing body of knowledge

899
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:08,240
so that's a great it's a that's a great aspect of it and i think that's um it's a very

900
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:14,400
pertinent question because you know it some of it has to do with the practice of science and how

901
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:20,320
science is now being practiced it's no longer the sort of lone individual green thinking great

902
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:25,520
brilliant thoughts and writing these papers right it's a group enterprise and then there's a turf

903
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:30,000
there's a definition of turf now because there are groups and because it's funding it's all the

904
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:36,240
things are it's the situatedness of how it is created which is very very important and the way

905
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:41,200
that impacts in my opinion it's not good for science to all become big group science big

906
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:47,120
science as it's called and i think we need different models of doing science that need to work at

907
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:53,200
the same time and i totally agree that one of the one of the sort of casualties of big science is

908
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:59,120
that it's science by consensus so there's not as many creative risks taken and therefore if someone

909
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:05,040
takes a creative risk it's harder um to actually make an impact

910
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:17,200
my question is directed at dorothea earlier you seemed a bit saddened at um when prion was

911
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:21,760
talking about scientific knowledge and and it made it seem as if that was the only knowledge

912
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:26,640
we cared about and you you you implied that there's other knowledge other types of knowledge which

913
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:34,000
are important to you understanding that there's more to just the humanities than just knowledge

914
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:42,240
what other types of knowledge are relevant to you I linguistic knowledge like what does it mean

915
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:47,600
to understand a sentence came to mind but but is that the sort of thing you're talking about um

916
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,880
i think i should clarify something i wasn't saddened

917
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,880
and

918
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,920
i i have no science envy

919
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:08,320
and uh nor science suspicion or problems with science um that's why i try to

920
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:16,400
let's not disclaimer yeah that's why i try to delineate how i understand that's the sciences

921
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:25,600
um do something very different from what people like i do in the humanities say i articulated it by

922
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:37,360
divisions uh sciences social sciences humanities and um what what you picked up as maybe a frown on

923
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:46,960
my side was not against science or against prayer but uh more a doubt and the direction in which i

924
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:54,640
kind of at some times try to steer our discussion was when the scientific model of

925
01:45:55,600 --> 01:46:03,200
knowledge production and also authority becomes the dominant one in political discussions that's

926
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:12,720
not the fault of scientists but when um what i would think need to be deliberated in terms of

927
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:23,200
procedures values etc get articulated as if it were an issue of more or less clear scientific

928
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:32,640
facts that i think is uh the problematic area and that's where i would criticize um it's not the

929
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:41,840
fault of the scientists but the uses of an often rather reductive model of scientific knowledge

930
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:48,560
in the public domain as the exclusive model of knowledge thank you that question

931
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:56,560
it's kind of related and um along how to control that then what you just expanded on

932
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:03,280
the misuse of uh science or social science and also the uh the other part i was trying to get it to

933
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:09,520
was expanding more on uh what kind of schemes you can place in there so you can differentiate the

934
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:20,560
hierarchy of explanations well i mean then i guess the question is in what domain i i found

935
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:27,680
it important but pre-asset the issue say if we look at just research institutions already

936
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:36,560
there the question of um individual structures and how much do you have actually

937
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:46,720
the huge conglomerates of collective research and individual institutions dictate priorities

938
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:54,320
define relevance that i think can have a very negative impact on science but also on

939
01:47:55,200 --> 01:48:04,720
other areas of learning and inquiry um yeah i think if i may comment briefly on um you're talking

940
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:16,320
about sort of the policy makers adaptation of and um of science i think part of the problem i think

941
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:24,400
arises it's my personal opinion i mean arises from the fact of a misperception of what science is

942
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:30,480
in the public domain i mean and i think scientists are partly to blame for this uh but not entirely

943
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:36,800
there's this notion that science offers this sort of way to derive fixed truths from nature

944
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:43,600
it says machine you're you're churning out these fixed truths um and i think that is not in the

945
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:51,760
service of uh public good and in good policies etc etc mainly because that is not what science

946
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:59,920
is science is messy the process is messy and that are the way our understanding proceeds is you know

947
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:04,880
there it's provisional but it's supported by data and evidence and yet it's provisional so when

948
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:11,920
there's more data better data more accurate data possibly helped along by new technologies etc etc

949
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:19,440
new instruments you know um there is i mean there is a shift in the best current understanding

950
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:25,920
so science is very dynamic there's a way it's proven dynamic it has uncertainty somehow

951
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:33,360
that needs to be understood by the public better because otherwise policy makers are taking a very

952
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:38,080
simplified view of science which has an incorrect view of science and co-opting it

953
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:44,160
um for other reasons for you know that the extraneous reasons that have nothing to do with science

954
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:50,000
itself but but have to do with the reality of politics and interest self-interest and and so on

955
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:57,360
so forth so i think part of the where the solution lies in sort of mitigating these sort of policy

956
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:04,480
difficulties is really i think it behooves us scientists to kind of explain better

957
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:11,520
how science actually works the practice of science and between the social science and physical

958
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:15,200
science is a what kind of scheme can you make the social science in more robust

959
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:23,920
well i think that um you know we can get into a whole debate and i've gotten a lot of debates

960
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:33,920
with my economist friends and sociology friends about um how evidence could be used to make

961
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:41,440
arguments in their fields and and i think that there are limitations because of the kinds of

962
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:46,800
complexity in the systems that they study i.e human beings and the fact that we are not rational

963
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:52,160
actors i mean a behavioral economics is cottling onto it finally and so i think that you know a lot

964
01:50:52,160 --> 01:51:00,080
of areas of social science you know there will be a shift where there'll be kinds of certain kinds

965
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:06,800
of questions would fall within the purview of the methods of science and they would be useful

966
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:11,120
but they wouldn't be ultimately useful necessarily they may not be fully illuminating and the kinds

967
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:17,920
of things as Dorothea talked about which is you know the situation the context um politics self-interest

968
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:25,360
all of that is much more important can be much more important and many of those questions so

969
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:31,840
okay

970
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:45,200
you know why because there's a whole thing at the park

971
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:55,200
we got a look at that

972
01:51:55,200 --> 01:52:05,200
does

973
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:05,820
I can do it.

974
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:09,020
Yo?

975
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:10,020
That thing can give me money.

976
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:12,780
Grind the amplifier was a charges.

977
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:16,300
They can still be interested.

978
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:17,500
It's not his hurt to him.

979
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:18,060
What?

980
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:20,420
He'd give us kinda schmmm wandless

981
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:26,240
Hey, see, this guy can hold,

982
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:23,440
Oh op

983
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:34,140
Is that Hold?

984
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:11,140
I'm not going to say that.

985
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:16,140
Mostly data is fine.

986
01:53:16,140 --> 01:53:23,140
You know, research.

987
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:26,140
You know, trying to get very consistent again

988
01:53:26,140 --> 01:53:31,140
to very specific questions.

989
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:36,140
You know, the living conditions.

990
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:41,140
How do you make a decision?

991
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:46,140
How do you know that's important?

992
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:49,140
How do you know the decision?

993
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:52,140
Obviously, I don't know what it's like in the rainforest,

994
01:53:52,140 --> 01:53:57,140
but I don't know what it's like to know what it's like to know.

995
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:02,140
I hear a lot of them.

996
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:07,140
What do you think through our movement?

997
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:12,140
I still don't know what's fine.

998
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:18,140
The whole country has to bring it to open.

999
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:32,140
I know it's fine.

1000
01:54:32,140 --> 01:54:39,140
I know it's fine.

1001
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:46,140
I know it's fine.
