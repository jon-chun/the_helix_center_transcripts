1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What was your work before you entered our recovery?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay, we're going to get started.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome everybody.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm Rob Penzer.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm the associate director of the Helix Center.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Before I introduce today's participants, I'd like to give you some

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
heads up on upcoming events here.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Next month, February 11th, we'll be talking about pain with

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Apgar, Opcarian, Ina Belfer, Anis Dijdaveric, and Rebecca

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Seal, and Maureen Stratford.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Then on February 25th, we have a program on the displaced

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and the other.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Later this year, in March, we'll be talking about music and

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
healing.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In April, we have two programs, one on nanotechnology and one on

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
design and nature.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Then in May, our final program for the season will be on

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
mathematics and the National Institute of Mental Health.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
For further details, visit us at our website, helixcenter.org

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
on Facebook and Twitter.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If you're not on our email list, please sign up on our website

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
for timely announcements.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now today's program, the Library is Reality and Metaphor.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
To my right is Anthony Grafton, the Henry Putnam University

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Professor of History at Princeton University.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
To his right, Carol Mandel, Dean of the NYU Division of

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Libraries.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
To her right, Alberto Mangoyle, writer, translator, editor,

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
critic, and director of the National Library of Argentina.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Next to him is Daniel Goroff, Vice President and Program

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Director at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And next to him is Ken Sonar, Arthur K. Watson, Chief Librarian

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
at the Thomas J. Watson Library of the Metropolitan Museum of

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Art.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I've asked our participants to just start wherever you think

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
you'd like to.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, I'm happy to start as a practitioner.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And one aspect of this exercise that I've found striking

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
particularly is how unsettling it has been.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Thinking about the wide variety of metaphors for libraries, not

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
to mention librarians, which inevitably I can't help but

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
take personally.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And the fact that it's such a multi-valent, evanescent,

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
complex variety of metaphors that are used for libraries that

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
are invoked for libraries, it even calls a static just to talk

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
about that.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I think my point is electronically made.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But all kidding aside, perhaps in the situation we find ourselves

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
in or I find myself in, we're looking for somewhat more

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
fixed points.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But even putting that aside, the complexity involved in

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
considering the multi-valent nature of libraries metaphor has

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
been a little bit more unsettling than liberating in terms of

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
imaginative thinking goes.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I guess I know the topic is libraries metaphor, but the other

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
powerful aspect to me is library is icon in the iconography of

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
libraries, which is closely related.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And for me, it's just been a privilege to live at the turn

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
of the century because we've been forced to get at the heart of

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the meaning of library in order to make the transformation.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And that's been so exciting.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And what's been amazing to me is that while a lot of the

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
literary work about libraries metaphor actually conflates

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
library and book, the public image of library is much more

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
generous and broader, which is why public libraries are jam-packed

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
with people engaging in different ways, why thousands and

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
thousands and thousands of students are in my library every

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
day, even though circulation of books is tanking quite a bit.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And so I think that there's something very powerful about

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
connecting to knowledge and connecting to community and

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
intellectual connection that's quite deep in what people think

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
about with libraries.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
When you said making the transformation, can you say more

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
about which transformation?

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, I guess it's the fact that the book has been the

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
predominant knowledge container for so long that many people

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
have the image of libraries as containers of books because

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
books are where the knowledge is and then you come to use the

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
book and that's, but now that we see how many containers of

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
knowledge there are, and it's almost opened up older forms

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
as well.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
People are more generous in their ideas about the knowledge

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and images and the knowledge and the proprietary and the

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
knowledge and archives and the knowledge on the Internet and

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
that suddenly expecting it all to come together, giving

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
libraries a much bigger preservation and connection role.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Did that make sense?

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Did that answer your question?

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I think that the idea of libraries, I can,

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
libraries, metaphors, is all contained in an essential

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
definition of library of which I think the symbol is

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Alexandria, of which we know so little.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But in the universal imagination, Alexandria contains all the

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
libraries to come and every society picks the image of the

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
library that better suits either its real identity or its

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
imaginary identity.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And so in our century, we like to think that the library has

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
been transformed into this generous place which, as you

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
said, realizes that information is contained in so many

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
containers.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But that was true in Alexandria where there were no only,

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
not only scrows, but tablets and maps and drawings and

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
objects and all these things that contain our memory.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:26,000
If I can be personal for a moment, I suddenly found myself

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
less than a year ago at the head of a national library.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And I thought I had an idea of what the library was and what

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
a national library was and how a national library should

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
reflect the identity of its society in full.

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
However, I hadn't paid much attention to the particular

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
situation of this country, of Argentina.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
To be the head of, say, the Library of Congress, which is

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
the equivalent of the national library of the states,

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Carla Hayden has a wonderful, I think, very powerful vision

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
of what the library could be.

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But she has an idea of the situation in which she finds

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
herself.

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And I won't define it for you.

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You know it well enough.

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But in Argentina, it is a very different situation.

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a political situation that is not interested in culture.

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So you have the library, the national library, as an

123
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
important symbol of the identity of a society that doesn't care

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
about the library.

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It still cares about the symbol but doesn't care about the

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
library.

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let me give you an example and then I'll let you talk.

128
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The other day I met Richard Ovenenden, the head of the

129
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
board, and he was telling me in passing that they got a

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
grant of 25 million pounds.

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Our annual acquisition budget is $50,000.

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That tells you a lot about the importance of the library as an

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
intellectual place in Argentina.

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The library has been entirely detached in a metaphorical sense.

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes.

136
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The metaphor has taken off in the practical application.

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Nothing entirely because the idea stands that the library is

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
important as a symbol.

139
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But when you ask a politician to put their money where their

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
money is then they turn their heads and talk about something

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
else.

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Essentially I think that if we look at the positive side, it

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
shows how flexible the image of a library can be in so many

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
different contexts.

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I would love to have a discussion around how the way in

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
which we look at the library defines us rather than we

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
defining the library.

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I think that's an interesting place to take the discussion.

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
One way in which we used to define ourselves is we were all

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
library people in the 60s and 70s which might have been the

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
height of the old technology.

152
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The library was the Willie Sutton principle.

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Knowledge was in the books.

154
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You went to get winchles guide to reference books which got

155
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
you to bibliographies and it was all very kind of 19th century

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and stable.

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It had certain advantages which the current economy of

158
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
knowledge really lacks.

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Not only were students in the library but professors were in

160
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
the library.

161
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The academic work was modeled by professors for students who

162
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
were at the next desk in a way which is almost inconceivably

163
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
rare now.

164
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There are ways in which we need to think about whether that old

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
image had its values that now need to be resurrected in different

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
forms for a different way of housing and spreading knowledge.

167
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You can't bring back the library of the 60s.

168
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Bringing back a model where people of different ages work

169
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
together would have a lot to be said for it.

170
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I think trying to identify those missing pieces is really

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
helpful because so much of what we do is new models of what we

172
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
need.

173
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That certainly is one example that has to happen in different ways.

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It has to happen in the nature of instruction, the kinds of

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
things that are given and the way those are discussed, bringing

176
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
research into the curriculum and then working through it.

177
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It doesn't happen by the side by side.

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Although sometimes it does too because the research is such a

179
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
different activity and research team.

180
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We try to provide spaces where research teams can work in

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
that way.

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We go into classrooms and bring that together.

183
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's helpful actually to hear people talk about, well, even so,

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
here are some of the things that are missing because we do have

185
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
to try to get at those.

186
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
One of my colleagues at NYU, a historian at NYU, brings

187
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
her students, makes them come into the library just to smell

188
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
the books.

189
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's a connection.

190
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We've lost forms of knowledge that she feels that you need to do.

191
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The data, as you say, is the lost connection because they are

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
there, the books and the virtual library and the objects.

193
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's a question of reminding ourselves that they are there.

194
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The National Library of Copenhagen is a beautiful building

195
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
that's divided into the lower part is computers and students

196
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and readers and professors use that virtual library.

197
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The second part is called the dead books because they are all

198
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
the books up to the mid-20th century and most of them haven't

199
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
been catalogued so they can't be used.

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They're called dead books.

201
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So the readers work under the shadow of these ghosts that are

202
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
not conjured up.

203
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
They are there to be conjured but the librarians don't make

204
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
the effort under the misapprehension which is a very

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
common misapprehension today that the Internet has everything

206
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and the virtual library has everything.

207
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And of course it doesn't.

208
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We all know that.

209
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And I think that Grafton is right in the sense that we have to

210
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
reclaim the virtues of a library that was used at a certain

211
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
time and perhaps at other times.

212
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And that doesn't mean leaving aside the new technology on the

213
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
country.

214
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's joining everything together.

215
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We don't have to be monogamous in the library.

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Your comment about the person who brought people to smell the

217
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
books, I mean, all faction is so strongly tied to memory.

218
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And what about the idea of the engagement of the senses that

219
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
a library provides that someone sitting at their computer

220
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
terminal accessing the Internet doesn't quite bring about

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
all the experience and the sensory modalities that are

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
engaged have a role to play in what the meaning of the

223
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
library experiences.

224
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
There's some interesting disagreement about that.

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
On the one hand, I mean, such research as I've read

226
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
suggests that you don't read on screen the way you read on

227
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
paper and that what you read on screen doesn't stick to your

228
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
long-term memory in the same way.

229
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You're actually using a different bit of your brain.

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And that's why it doesn't stick, seem to stick in the same way.

231
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're using the bit of your brain that does computation rather

232
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
than the bit that you use for an elaborating.

233
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's at least what they find when they see what lights up.

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
On the other hand, I have friends among the science graduate

235
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
students at Princeton who are obviously star young

236
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
scientists and a couple of them come from my Alma mater,

237
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
the University of Chicago.

238
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So they're also great readers.

239
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And they have told me quite insistently that they don't

240
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
buy this for a moment, that they never read anything except on

241
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
a screen and their command of what they read, which is highly

242
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
technical and demanding, is extremely tight and precise.

243
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And they've given me some demonstration.

244
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So their view is their minds have been rewired to work in a

245
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
way that fits contemporary media.

246
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Speaking to researchers at the University of London,

247
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Ontario, who are mapping the brain, they told me that

248
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
physiologically the reading on a printed page and the reading

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
on screen functions differently because the eye doesn't read

250
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
continuously, but in jumping movements called saccade.

251
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So on a printed page, it always lands on something that's

252
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
there, while on the screen it can land at a moment where the

253
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
screen flickers and unconsciously we see an app that

254
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
we see an absence.

255
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So it's a different form of reading.

256
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But that the brain becomes rewired.

257
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The brain can do extraordinary things when one door closes,

258
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
the brain opens a window.

259
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And for instance, my son does everything on his little gadget,

260
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
send letters, listen to music, watch films, make coffee,

261
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm not sure.

262
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But yes, and everything happens in a way that for me is

263
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
impossible and too old.

264
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
My son being trained as a pilot was able to read Moby Dick and

265
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
a palm instrument in all of the waste time between possible

266
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
sessions.

267
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But as to this physicality, I was thinking about your question

268
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
about what the library says about us.

269
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And it made me think of our rootlessness and our even

270
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
homelessness sometimes.

271
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And then I was thinking about the thousands of students that

272
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
turn up in the library on college campuses.

273
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And having been involved peripherally in the design of several

274
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
libraries recently on college campuses, I've come to find

275
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
that they're not used the same way that they were in the past.

276
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And I've heard story after story of students, especially during

277
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
exam periods when the library might be open even 24 hours, who

278
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
turn up in the afternoon with a bag.

279
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And they pick out a comfortable chair and a corner and they

280
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
set themselves there and take out their drinks and their

281
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
supplies and so on.

282
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And study the way we always studied for a few hours.

283
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And at some point they disappear and come back in their

284
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
pajamas and spend the night.

285
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Either studying some of the time, sleeping some of the time,

286
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
but staking out that home in a way in the library has become

287
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
part of the culture, perhaps because they have no place else

288
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
to go.

289
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's amazing to me.

290
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I've been astonished at, and I think it is the power of what

291
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
library means as a place to work.

292
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And as we were going through our turn of the century transition

293
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and planning our renovations, and we did a lot of study of who

294
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
was the library for.

295
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We interviewed just hundreds of people and distinguished

296
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
faculty and they all said physically, physically, the

297
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
library is for students, not resource wise, but physically.

298
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We have library for students, we are in our office, we can get

299
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
everything electronically, make sure you page stuff so people

300
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
can get it to me.

301
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm not leaving my office, I have everything set up.

302
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But the students, what we have actually specialized in, and

303
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
this goes back to your question, I don't know whether it's smell

304
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
or companionship or what it is, it's definitely electric

305
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
outlets, but they are definitely, you find them, you know.

306
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Just like in airports, wherever the outlet is, the person is,

307
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and no matter how uncomfortable the spot.

308
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But we actually realized that one of our services was space as a

309
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
service, and that one of the things we had to design was space

310
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
for intellectual productivity.

311
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And we actually have principles, we devised, we've, you know,

312
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
observed and we've changed things, and we've got sizes of work

313
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
stations and distances from people and all kinds of things and

314
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
different configurations, because you don't want just want, and

315
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
actually one of the things that we've done is promulgate this

316
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
across campus, because there's no room in the library for everybody

317
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
who wants to be in the library.

318
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Just try coming in, you're walking over bodies, and you know,

319
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and this is the library where the circulation, as I said, and so

320
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
what are they doing there, why are they there?

321
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And, but as we design new campus buildings or convert spaces

322
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
in certain areas, they're trying to create some of the same kind

323
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
of spaces for inspiration, spaces for intellectual productivity.

324
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Whether that really will work, or whether it has to have the name

325
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
library on it, that remains to be seen.

326
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I think this is a very positive trend, and increase in gate

327
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
out is perhaps almost always a good idea, but I think it's

328
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
to a point, but I think it's also symptomatic of the change in

329
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
metaphor, and the fact that the metaphor has been desacralized,

330
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and it's no longer the common, almost cliche metaphor of library

331
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
as temple, as holy place, with its appropriate architecture,

332
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
with the point that Professor Grafton was making a minute ago,

333
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
with the professor, priest, and the student,

334
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
the acolyte, and all the metaphors line up perfectly.

335
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Now we've shifted to a desacralized situation where the most

336
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
appropriate metaphor, perhaps, and not in all in a disparaging

337
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
or negative term, is library as office space.

338
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And that's a shift in metaphor.

339
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I would say there's, I would argue a little bit to qualify that,

340
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
but there is a way in which the library is a particular form

341
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
of temple. It's the temple of Iskulepius where you went to

342
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
incubate to spend the night in the hope that something would appear

343
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
to you, ideally Iskulepius himself, who would say your throat

344
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
hurts gargle, as he actually did.

345
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And I think that that is also what they're doing, and I think to that extent,

346
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the books retain some kind of air of sacrality, and you

347
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
spend the night there because the books are there, even if you're not

348
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
consulting them.

349
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And I think picking up on your metaphor of the office and the idea

350
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
that the space still remains in some sense sacred,

351
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I would say that while now one certain use of a library

352
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
is coming to the surface, the workspace, not necessarily

353
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
the taking of books and reading books, part of the mission of the library,

354
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
perhaps has to be bringing the faithful to the temple,

355
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
as to say, educating new readers.

356
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,000
One of the huge challenges the National Library has is

357
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:07,000
procuring more readers. We have, I'm afraid to say too many readers,

358
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
because we have had to extend the reading hours to midnight.

359
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's always full, but as you have pointed out, the borrowing of books

360
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
declines in number. So how do we make that those who come to the library

361
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,000
borrow books, and how do we create new readers in the outside world,

362
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
people who are not readers? My son again, I'm sorry to quote him,

363
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:44,000
so many times. When he was about 14, he was a great video game player.

364
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And I've never played a video game in my life.

365
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So he asked me to accompany him once to a video game arcade.

366
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So I said, well, sure, do we buy a ticket to go in?

367
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
He said, no, we can go in and, and all these machines,

368
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
well, do we, do we queue? Do we get a token to play the game?

369
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Do we put our name? I realized I didn't know the ritual of the place.

370
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And most people have never been in a library, and certainly don't know

371
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:28,000
the ritual of the place. How to bring people to the library to read

372
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
is the big question. Of course, I don't have an answer.

373
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'll be glad for any advice you can give me.

374
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Even getting the elite students at a great university or users of some place

375
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
like the Met who are pretty much all very highly trained to use books when they

376
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
should is non-trivial. Cambridge has a routine in the history

377
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
faculty for MA students. They're given on Friday what are called research challenges.

378
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And they're problems that cannot be solved with any resources on the Internet.

379
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
The only way you can solve them is by going to every library in Cambridge.

380
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And it strikes me that, you know, even at the elite level, most of us aren't doing that,

381
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and most of our students aren't, in fact, getting that kind of training.

382
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But when you go to the vast, hungry public, that's a huge problem as well.

383
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,000
We are going to start a program next year, and I will let you know in a couple of years if it works.

384
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
A teacher came to me with a suggestion.

385
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:46,000
She had been a teacher for 30 years and realized that the children coming out of school

386
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
couldn't read or didn't want to read.

387
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And very few had reading passion had become readers.

388
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And she realized also that it was less the fault of the students' intelligence certainly,

389
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
or having books at that disposal or coming from homes that didn't have books.

390
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Rather, the problem was that the teachers weren't readers.

391
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And so they were asked to teach reading when they didn't care about reading.

392
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
They weren't passionate about reading.

393
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And she created a program to teach teachers how to become readers.

394
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And she's doing this in a small area of the province of Buenos Aires, and it's working marvelously.

395
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So I'm going to try that the National Library extend the program to the country.

396
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And I hope we will be able to bring some more readers to the library that way.

397
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But I'll tell you in a couple of years if it works.

398
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I guess we don't see our mission as creating readers.

399
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:07,000
We see our mission as creating knowledge seekers and helping them seek knowledge in whatever way they need to.

400
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I mean, our clientele are engineers and scientists and artists.

401
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And reading is wonderful, but reading is not everything.

402
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I would use sacrilege words.

403
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I can't believe I said that.

404
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But also, we do see a difference in international students from American students in terms of being acclimated to libraries.

405
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You know, there is a wonderful history of public libraries in towns across the United States and children being read to and going to libraries.

406
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Of course, there are many.

407
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
We wish there were more.

408
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And we find a difference in the comfort levels that American students come into the library with.

409
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Still, they need to be taught research.

410
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
They need to be taught that the Internet isn't everything.

411
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But there's a level of comfort in the nature of books, libraries, information that sometimes even at the graduate student level, we have to acclimate students too.

412
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You're separating the seeking of knowledge from reading.

413
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
No, I'm just saying the bra.

414
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm not saying one is a kind of broader umbrella.

415
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And that I see reading as a subset of that.

416
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And how so?

417
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Because when you say reading, I assume you mean reading a whole book.

418
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
If you don't mean that, then I don't mean that.

419
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So I'm not worried because those people seek knowledge and reading the briefer sense all over the place.

420
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Well, exactly.

421
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And reading has always been that.

422
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You never, in few cases, only concentrate on books.

423
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You become a castle-born.

424
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But in that case, yes.

425
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But most people have a vaster area of exploration, which includes, of course, books.

426
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But then the books serve to find a guide in your life experience.

427
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And you get knowledge from other sources that you read as well.

428
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
We read the world.

429
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
We read the gestures of people.

430
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
We read in a much larger sense.

431
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So I take objection about this division between seeking knowledge and reading.

432
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Even in oral societies, there is a form of reading without which the society cannot survive because it cannot communicate.

433
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I want to come to the defense of this group that we disparaged a little who used the internet and feel that everything is there.

434
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And all of the world's information is there because all we're doing is applying the same metaphor that a previous generation applied from the started when you wish.

435
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And Alex Andrey started with Bibliotheque and Universales started with the ideals of what a Harvard Library should be, et cetera, what the New York Public Library should be.

436
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So it's the same metaphor that's applied to a different format.

437
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Misguided then and misguided now.

438
00:31:40,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But there's a consistency in the metaphor which I find fascinating because there's an impulse to want it all there to have your Bibliotheque and Universales in between boards, that your keyboard, enwitener, just as long as someplace.

439
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:12,000
The Library of Babel which is completely useless because it contains everything. So it contains text that cannot be read.

440
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It contains misinformation. It contains, for instance, the true catalog of the library and millions and millions of false catalogues.

441
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So it's completely useless. But in spite of that, I think we have an impulse to face the chaos, the absurdity, the meaningless of the universe with a hope that this institution can lend it order, can give us a map for this thing that is mapless.

442
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And I think that metaphor can be very useful.

443
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:06,000
The difficulty with this, I mean, I'm very sympathetic to this notion. It goes back to Erasmus saying that old dysmonetius is building a library without walls.

444
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yes.

445
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And that's perhaps the closest thing to what the internet seems to provide.

446
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The difficulty is the radical lack of curation of so much that's on the internet.

447
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The reason the thing the library offered was not just knowledge, but curated knowledge.

448
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And you can never curate everything.

449
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Princeton's copy of Norman Cone's book, Warrent for Genocide, has marginal notes by someone who took it as proving that the protocols of Elders of Zion were genuine, which is the reverse of the argument of the book.

450
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
So it doesn't matter what you do. You can't keep readers safe.

451
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Nonetheless, anyone who just works as much as I do with Google Books knows what it's like to work with a magnificent, endless, and totally uncurrated body of material.

452
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And it's not like going to what's on the shelf in the library.

453
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Not too similar of the work that the librarians at Alexandria did.

454
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:25,000
They had 20 or 100 versions of Homer, and they had to edit one that was more or less coherent and more or less factual.

455
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
What metaphor of the library do you think your students would choose?

456
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That's a really good question.

457
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I think it means community and knowledge sharing to them.

458
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Like Erasmus.

459
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yeah, I think that's what I think that is the undergraduates.

460
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The graduate students would have a much more knowledge-based metaphor, much more of what we think.

461
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But I think the undergraduates, it's a different kind of place.

462
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And the place and engagement metaphors and the inspiration metaphors would be stronger than the knowledge and organization of knowledge metaphor.

463
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
My own sense, for example, is that browsing doesn't go on a lot.

464
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And since every library is now read...

465
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But the history stacks, the literature stacks don't get much browsing.

466
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
You never see people there with a heap of books.

467
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And one reason for that is the library is so incomplete.

468
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Even a very big one.

469
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Our graduate students see it as a transfer center where they're mostly going in and getting books from other libraries ordered electronically rather than depending on what's there.

470
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And the place that supplies them to various indices and the transfer center is a great...

471
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And the transfer center to all of the really powerful digital databases that we're paying for in which the graduate students use very skillfully.

472
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Exactly.

473
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You're right about browsing. I, oddly enough, have the privilege of granting stack privileges because we're a closed stack library.

474
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And when I grant these stack privileges, it presses up against the notion of metaphor because the recipient doesn't think they've reached paradise.

475
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
They're convinced they've reached paradise.

476
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's no longer metaphor.

477
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It's actuality.

478
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And that is the elimination of borders.

479
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's the elimination of borders giving access to the stacks, which is so important nowadays because picking up on what you were mentioning about whether the fact that we are nomadic makes the...

480
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It gives the library a certain sense.

481
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm puzzled by a paradox that the Hebrews who are nomadic people hold the book.

482
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:21,000
The book is a library as the monument of their society, the identity, the place to which you go, in which you always are.

483
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:43,000
While the Greeks who wrote all their stuff, their letters, their documents, their literature, they wrote it down, they didn't care for the library as much as a center of the identity of their society.

484
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
For Athens it was the temple.

485
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It was the agora.

486
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I don't know how to explain that, but just to point out the paradox, and that in our time where we are a world of refugees and immigrants and transients, maybe the library can give people with changing nationalities a sense of place.

487
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Well, that's been true for the public library in America for many deaths.

488
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The library did in the most glorious way.

489
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
In Queens, right? In Queens? In the early generation?

490
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
In 42nd Street.

491
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Absolutely.

492
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Perhaps there's something to the ark, as the holder of this girl that goes with all of our church metaphors and the sacredness of all of this that goes way back.

493
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Yes, perhaps it's that.

494
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But there is something about the publicness of a public library, and it's very existence that regardless of what else goes on inside and how that's transforming, that the fact that we are a society that values that, that put resources into the building

495
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:21,000
of public spaces like this, I think says something very important to this day.

496
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And of course, we have to think about Andrew Carnegie and the role of philanthropy in all of this.

497
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But still, the political economy of all of it is, I think, quite important.

498
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I think about public goods, not in the sense of the public good as a kind of aspiration, but as a kind of commodity.

499
00:39:48,000 --> 00:40:01,000
A public good in the sense of a bridge or a lighthouse or a vaccine discovery or, you know, other things like that that have two qualities.

500
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
One is in the technical sense that economists use the term public good.

501
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:15,000
One is that it's non-rival, which is to say that if one person uses it, there's still just as much left for everybody else.

502
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So a lighthouse is a good example of that.

503
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And that it's non-exclusive.

504
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
That once it's there, you can't really easily keep people out of it.

505
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So you can keep people out of the stacks.

506
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But I'm talking about public libraries here.

507
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And those are, that inclusivity is a marvelous symbol.

508
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But because of those two characteristics, public goods are notoriously hard to finance.

509
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Everybody wants to free ride.

510
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And we have to turn either to the government or to philanthropy in order to produce these kinds of public goods.

511
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And sometimes I worry that as a society we've forgotten how to do that.

512
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And when I walk past the library, I say maybe we once knew, maybe we'll remember again,

513
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:18,000
and maybe keeping up these kinds of benefits to society is something that we can all be reminded of.

514
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:28,000
What's been impressive to me is that it could change any day, of course, but the remarkable health of public libraries.

515
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
There was a moment of despair.

516
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And really quite a resurgence, town after town after town supporting it.

517
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Because it's been so important to community.

518
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And it's to make almost counterintuitive in this day and age, but deeply heartening.

519
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And it seems to be so deeply connected to the American ideal of self-improvement.

520
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And the library is the place where you can do that.

521
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So I hope that persists.

522
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's a refuge from the market system.

523
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And you can put it there.

524
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:16,000
A good example of the use of a library as a metaphor for the American society, because elsewhere in the world is completely different.

525
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:28,000
In Colombia, which has the best library network in Latin America, and perhaps one of the best in the world,

526
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:38,000
they have developed with very few resources a library network that has gone into the Sierra and into dangerous places.

527
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And where they have gone, violence has dropped by 70, 80%.

528
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:54,000
With the Carnegie idea that the government puts half and the community puts half, whether it's in services or money or anything.

529
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So these libraries become symbols embraced by the little villages or the native groups.

530
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And the change is extraordinary.

531
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So the libraries are seen, perhaps as light houses, but also as sanctuaries, places of sanity.

532
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Now, of course, in other places, if something different in France, censorship started entering the libraries,

533
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
not in the sense that Darnton gives it in the 18th century, but in Sarkozy's France.

534
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So a mayor of France, for instance, decided that the public library would not have works by North African writers,

535
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and eliminated those from the library.

536
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So that is another metaphor for the library.

537
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
The library has an exclusive identity.

538
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It's my identity, and I don't want any of your stuff in it.

539
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:09,000
But it also implies a question about what is the role of private libraries, especially when you have government interfering with...

540
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yes.

541
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And the history of private libraries and preserving knowledge, and any thoughts about that?

542
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Well, most public libraries begin as private as it is.

543
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:30,000
There's often a correlation, isn't there, with countries that have great book shops and private libraries and don't have necessarily great public libraries?

544
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Italy, when I first lived there, had incredible book shops now mostly gone, and incredible private collections.

545
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But there were individual research libraries, which were fantastic, but just finding a general collection where you could work was extremely difficult.

546
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Exactly.

547
00:44:48,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Well, but it makes me think of Robert Putnam's work about civic organizations, and how countries, as a whole, even politically seem to be able to function better,

548
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
where there are more of these working civic organizations.

549
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And that may be theater groups.

550
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It might be red cross groups.

551
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It could be all kinds of things.

552
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:18,000
But perhaps libraries belong in that category as well, as in a sense, engines of social capital.

553
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:26,000
There are places where we learn how to communicate with one another, we learn about how to relate to one another, we learn about other cultures,

554
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
ideally, if you're not in France, in that particular city.

555
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
But you learn about how to do things as a group.

556
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And even literally how to build an institution that doesn't rely on the normal sorts of market forces, the normal sorts of financing.

557
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And that to me is really quite important, as I was starting to say before, it's almost a refuge from the usual market system that so pervades what we do these days,

558
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:07,000
that you can go and read a book about Paris and not be immediately bombarded by advertisements for flights to Europe.

559
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Right?

560
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'll see cases.

561
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah.

562
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah, and we've recently witnessed the defeat of a real experiment in America to build a commercial market based third space in the vast mega bookstore,

563
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:33,000
which rose and for some time appeared to be out doing public libraries, especially for the middle and upper middle classes.

564
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
It's the copy.

565
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yeah, but also more amenities and a richer selection of new books.

566
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And that experiment has clearly failed and is clearly basically dying, which once again just emphasizes the deep importance of what you're saying.

567
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:58,000
There's another element that I want to bring in that I'm realizing is culturally different.

568
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So American librarians, and to some extent British, and there are in a few other places, but not universally, are not just keepers and preservers of things,

569
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,000
but are passionate about the sanctuary concept, are past, shown about the inclusivity.

570
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
They're passionate about open access and when you were talking about restricted books.

571
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So, you know, the American Library Association's freedom to read foundation would be all over that public library.

572
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I mean, you sort of can't really do that.

573
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I mean, you can try that in this country and librarians will be lobbying all over the place as they are on, you know,

574
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
with issues related to privacy and access to library records and things like that.

575
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And I've been told, you know, by folks about how amazed people are at the effectiveness of librarian lobbies because, you know, librarians, how can you say bad things about them?

576
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah.

577
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:08,000
So, and I think that that is also part of the culture that is not probably true internationally.

578
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Because you have to have a strong economy to have power with an intellectual group.

579
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
It's a luxury.

580
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Nevertheless, Columbia has it.

581
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Yeah, it does happen.

582
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
They're brave too.

583
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
They are very brave.

584
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Can I share with you a metaphor, if that's what it is, that I heard fairly recently from a friend who's a colleague of Carols,

585
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
named Michael Stuller, who's the Dean for Collections there.

586
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And I see him a few times a year as my conduit into academic library world and because of his very good humor.

587
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And he came up with a, back from a meeting and he came up with a phrase that knew would shock me.

588
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And there are many librarians of research institutions these days, actively having conversations about what shall we do with all of our books.

589
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It's his market driven.

590
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
It's fundamentally about real estate.

591
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
They're trying to grapple with questions and I'm with the momentous.

592
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
How many copies do we need of various books, journals, titles?

593
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Can we have regional centers?

594
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And the term that he knew would make me spill my soup was.

595
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Librarian referred to their collection as underperforming assets.

596
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:45,000
A sure way to get the attention of the faculty on our campus is to tell them that you're moving books to a storage warehouse.

597
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And believe me, you hear from everyone about how impossible that is and how ridiculous and, but I think the experience of the

598
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:35,000
institution is a very important thing.

599
00:49:35,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And most of the libraries is that when everyone goes ahead and does it with some of the books, as long as there are provisions for recovering them quickly.

600
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
That is wildly successful.

601
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And people are glad to have the space for other things.

602
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:24,000
But there is this holding on tight to the physical presence of it that I certainly understand, but it's different from throwing them away.

603
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
You're accessible with a click of a computer key.

604
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So that's different.

605
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But it's not easy to get books away.

606
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
No, it's not.

607
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Actually, I had a huge mathematics library that I wanted to give.

608
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And even the university libraries wouldn't take it.

609
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I'll take it in Shanghai.

610
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That's tough.

611
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
We will take it too.

612
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
No, I actually sent some of them to a different place.

613
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Because in that sense, I love an anecdote of Nicholson Barker.

614
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:11,000
He was looking for a book, and he discovered that the only copy was at the Boston Athenaeum, published in the mid-19th century.

615
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So he went to the Boston Athenaeum, also the book.

616
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It was there.

617
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
They gave it to him.

618
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And he noticed that he was the first person to take it out for 100 years.

619
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And he said to the librarian, you know, I'm the first borrower.

620
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And the librarian said, of course, sir, we bought it for you.

621
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Books are very patient.

622
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Absolutely.

623
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I always feel I'm liberating them when I take a book out for Princeton for the first time.

624
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And it gets its stamp and it leaves the library.

625
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Yes.

626
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So, I mean, there are some difficulties.

627
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I mean, here's one that I haven't seen written about.

628
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:05,000
But when we began at Firestone to have real space troubles in the 70s, naturally, one of the things we did was to get rid of big multi-volume things.

629
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And big multi-volume things are not, in fact, they need to be browsed.

630
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Digital browsing is not very effective with that kind of thing, and you often get the wrong volume when you order one to be brought back.

631
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:27,000
For example, we had the whole Algama in Alito-Autut's item, which was the TLS of 18th and 19th century Germany, right in the stacks.

632
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And in fact, nothing has replaced having the whole thing as an asset.

633
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
We had to do it, but that's a real loss.

634
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You zapped another paradox of the library under the shadow of Alexandria as well.

635
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:50,000
You have to have everything, and the definition of the library is a collection that always exceeds its base.

636
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
No matter if you have a hundred books, you find that the shelf is too small.

637
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Do we think that, and you started to allude to what I think,

638
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:14,000
that the library metaphor can be so powerful that it's too often applied to the Internet.

639
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And you talked about the difference in curation and the difference in gaps,

640
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,000
and that in a way it's been a somewhat destructive metaphor because of that.

641
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I don't know how to get around that or out of that, but it's, you know, it's...

642
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It shouldn't? Yeah. Yeah. What would you call it?

643
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I mean, it's a kind of library.

644
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
The blank?

645
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So it does seem to me that the way we do Internet research is the way we manufacture things.

646
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
That is, you go when you need something. It's on time.

647
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You don't stockpile anymore.

648
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Whereas classical library research was much more a matter of systematic stockpiling,

649
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
but there wasn't really another way of going at it.

650
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
But you wouldn't have kept absolutely everything.

651
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Perhaps a comparison, it's not necessarily a metaphor for the Internet.

652
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It would be something like the Genetas.

653
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah. Yeah.

654
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:37,800
The room in the

655
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,800
room.

656
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,800
So it's really good.

657
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,800
There's a lot of rubbish in there, of course.

658
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,800
But you can do new kinds of research.

659
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,800
Absolutely.

660
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,800
And perhaps the Internet is something like that.

661
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,800
That's beautiful, yes.

662
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,800
I think Carol does have a good point.

663
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:58,800
There are finding another metaphor and not imposing an older metaphor on the information

664
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,800
that the Internet provides because it's misleading.

665
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:10,800
And even the digital public library is a classic case of a well-intentioned effort

666
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:21,800
that was so confined by the traditional notion of librarian metaphor that perhaps the result

667
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,800
or the product they were after wasn't as successful as it might have been

668
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:31,800
if they could have taken a fresher look and not have been so constrained by the traditional metaphor.

669
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,800
But also like any metaphor, there are parts of it that hold and parts of it that don't.

670
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:43,800
And we tend to take for granted since it's relatively new that what we put into the Internet

671
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,800
is archived and will be there forever.

672
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,800
Yeah, absolutely.

673
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,800
And it's not.

674
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:54,800
And I need only to remind you of the scientists who have been over the last few months,

675
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:04,800
desperately and quickly trying to retrieve data from government websites that they fear will soon disappear.

676
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,800
We have this problem in another area.

677
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:14,800
I've been collecting for the library writers' archives.

678
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:23,800
And we're young countries, so we have 150, maybe 200 years of written material.

679
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:32,800
But the last two generations, all their correspondence, all their manuscripts are electronic.

680
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:42,800
We have some success bringing to the library the electronic material manuscripts.

681
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,800
Well, that's not called the manuscripts, drafts of books.

682
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:55,800
But the correspondence is very difficult to collect and choose from.

683
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:02,800
We can't ask the writers to spend an enormous amount of time filtering their correspondence.

684
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,800
We can't do it because we're going to very private things.

685
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,800
And we haven't found a system.

686
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,800
But we know that we have to collect it.

687
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:20,800
And I was speaking to somebody at the Library of Congress about this because they have obviously the same problems.

688
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,800
Google's already doing that for you.

689
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,800
They're reading everything.

690
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,800
They're reading everything.

691
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,800
But are they preserving it?

692
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,800
And I think...

693
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,800
Well, you say can make money on it.

694
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,800
Exactly.

695
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:41,800
I think, and that's a place where we don't have the commercial resources.

696
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:50,800
And it is an area where libraries are under-resourced and even the Library of Congress because we do have to preserve the Internet.

697
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,800
We do have to preserve email.

698
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,800
And then we need electronic technological tools to mine it.

699
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:02,800
Because as you say, we can't curate it in advance. We have to be able to save it on moss.

700
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,800
And then we have to be able to thread through it electronically.

701
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:22,800
And I am encouraged every day at developments and new professions that we hired a digital archivist about four years ago for just exactly the kinds of material that you are.

702
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:28,800
Well, there is a method, as you say, for people's manuscripts and records.

703
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,800
Email.

704
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:34,800
There's a group convening now that's working on email very strongly.

705
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,800
Right.

706
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,800
You let me know where that is.

707
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,800
I'm kind of obsessed.

708
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:42,800
This is my new cause about Internet preservation and digital preservation.

709
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,800
And it's a huge challenge.

710
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:55,800
There was a conference recently of kind of very techie types talking about reconfiguring the Internet into something that would self-preserve.

711
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,800
But we are a long ways, I think, from doing that.

712
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:05,800
But there will have to be technological solutions, but they need to be pressed by archivists and curators.

713
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,800
And so we need to work together in this.

714
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:14,800
And where the clock is ticking as with all those government sites, everybody is madly downloading.

715
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:33,800
And then once we find a method to do that, we will have to go to the bureaucratic aspect of this and have, for instance, a legal deposit include things like blogs and certain correspondence and so on.

716
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,800
But we are far from that.

717
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,800
And we've lost an enormous amount.

718
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,800
Oh, yes.

719
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,800
Yes.

720
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,800
Yes.

721
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,800
We won't get back.

722
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:52,800
So I should have said at the beginning that although I work at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, that nothing I say is necessarily the opinions of that foundation, although it should be.

723
00:59:52,800 --> 01:00:06,800
But one of the projects that the Sloan Foundation helped with, in addition to, of course, the Digital Public Library of America and many others, is the Internet Archive.

724
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,800
And that was before I joined the foundation, but I think it's something to be proud of.

725
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,800
And I believe that we had some hand in it.

726
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:26,800
And the best part of it, and one of the favorite names of any foundation project that I know, is that they have something called the Wayback Machine.

727
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:35,800
And for those of us who grew up watching Peabody and Sherman, right, the Wayback Machine is just what it sounds like.

728
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:51,800
And just the same as in the cartoon, where you're able to, not with everything completely, but that's certainly the aspiration, that you're able to look at what a given website was on a given date in the past.

729
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:57,800
And the thing about IA though is, it, you know, really, it's one guy's vision.

730
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,800
It's Bruce Smith.

731
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,800
Yes, it is.

732
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,800
And thank God.

733
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,800
You know, we're with the little help from his foundation.

734
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,800
Yeah, right.

735
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:14,800
It wasn't all his dollars, but, and we start cultural institutions still have a caught up with that.

736
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:25,800
You know, I mean, we're working with him all the time, but that was, that was just the luck of one visionary individual.

737
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:33,800
Well, no, it's the luck of our culture that we've been able to start doing that, and we need to think about how to do it more.

738
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:43,800
And I would just mention that the foundation is also quite interested, not just in saving books and websites and all the rest, but also research data.

739
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:52,800
And research data can be enormously taxing to sort through to make it useful to preserve it.

740
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,800
So these are all questions of the provision of public goods.

741
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,800
Do you have an office, a group of people working on this?

742
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,800
Where does this happen?

743
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:09,800
Well, there's the Alpha Pissant Foundation is a small office, not far from here.

744
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:15,800
And there are a handful of us who think about, well, as I put it, we're in the public goods business.

745
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:24,800
And I have a colleague, Josh Greenberg, who's very, very much involved with all of these things and knows much more about libraries than I do.

746
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:36,800
And we try to very strategically do some of the things that a private foundation can do that neither the government nor the market system will take care of.

747
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,800
The Mellon Foundation did.

748
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,800
And of course, we're not the only one. We work with other foundations.

749
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:47,800
But it's one of the reasons why these things have happened in America.

750
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:57,800
It's really an accident of our tax laws that there have been these foundations and that Carnegie saw to spend some of his fortunes on libraries and so on.

751
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,800
So it is something not to be taken for granted, certainly that I appreciate.

752
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,800
And are you sharing this with other countries?

753
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:15,800
Yes, there are conferences on, and actually the European Union has done a certain amount of work in this arena research as well.

754
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:27,800
And on the, your library is probably not a member, but could join the international Internet Preservation Consortium, which is.

755
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,800
So, and I'll send you a few weeks.

756
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,800
Yes, I will send you a few weeks.

757
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,800
But there's, there's, as a historian, I mean, I do see some wider problems.

758
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:40,800
One is that more of the net is, of the web is closed and open.

759
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:46,800
And nobody, no public agency is tasked with preserving that.

760
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:53,800
And if you want to know, I mean, most of the data moving digitally, electronically, are not publicly accessible.

761
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,800
Right.

762
01:03:54,800 --> 01:04:06,800
And that's a big part of the history we're living. That's where all of those credit card purchases that you make, which allow corporations to know where you are and what you do.

763
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,800
And, you know, all of that is also part of the history of the moment.

764
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,800
And I don't know how it will ever be as visible.

765
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:18,800
I'm in the preservation business, so please don't misunderstand me.

766
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:31,800
But is it, is it perhaps because we're looking at the Internet as a library that we're expecting the same conservation and preservation issues as a library?

767
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:38,800
If we saw this as something else, and I don't have a good suggestion, what could we...

768
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:48,800
I'm thinking of it more as documentary archival resources.

769
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:58,800
But documentary archival resources that you talked about not being able to pre-select, but having to vacuum in somehow and then process somehow.

770
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,800
So I don't think it's the library part, but that's a good question.

771
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:15,800
And I think the struggle about Internet is what... If we could say... We do need a metaphor for the Internet because we can understand better what the IT is, we might be able to grapple with it better.

772
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:23,800
And of course, as you all know better than I do, we've always lost a significant or majority of what was created.

773
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:28,800
So losing things is something that we've been used to for the past time.

774
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:38,800
But the difference is you can't find it in an attic later. I mean, this is the thorny part is the absoluteness of it.

775
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:43,800
But maybe I don't want to give up the metaphor of the library entirely.

776
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:55,800
Because, again, Alexandria, we think that Alexandria was lodged in a corridor of the museum,

777
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:01,800
which was the house of the Muses and the Muses' mother was never seen in memory.

778
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:18,800
So it has that connection to memory. And so perhaps what we want to preserve is an effort of not allowing ourselves to forget more that we need to forget.

779
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:25,800
I agree. The impulse is powerful. Just like the impulse for the universal library is very powerful.

780
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:30,800
Absolutely. So it comes back to the word curation, which I think is very, very important in all of this.

781
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:37,800
But it also comes back to this false impression that we have that it's all free.

782
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:47,800
So I'm going to contradict a little of what I said before about the financial considerations being something that we don't have to worry about.

783
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:58,800
The library is, again, an example of something with very, very large fixed costs to get a library going and very small marginal costs.

784
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:05,800
To have one more person read another book is really essentially costless.

785
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:11,800
Or to have one more person walk into the library at NYU is virtually costless.

786
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:17,800
And so you begin to post one more thing on the internet and so on.

787
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,800
So you begin to think of this as really being costless, but it's not.

788
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:28,800
It's really very, very expensive. And those fixed costs have to be somehow dealt with.

789
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,800
And this is one of the great problems of our time.

790
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,800
Because if you think about it, many, many public goods have that character.

791
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:41,800
And it's one of the things which we previously thought of as commercial goods.

792
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:47,800
So, for example, the very first copy of a newspaper is hugely expensive.

793
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,800
All of the time and effort that went into that.

794
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,800
The next few copies, almost truly.

795
01:07:53,800 --> 01:08:04,800
The first working pill that comes out of a big pharma is fabulously expensive.

796
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:11,800
And so when you think about the economy like this, and it's part of the technological transformation

797
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:17,800
that we've been through, is that we get fooled into thinking that another piece of writing,

798
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:23,800
another piece of data, another piece of almost anything that we do that's

799
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:28,800
technologically and electronically like this, we don't have to worry about the cost.

800
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:34,800
And we don't have to make the hard decisions about what to keep and what not to keep,

801
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,800
and what's worthwhile and what isn't worthwhile.

802
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:44,800
And so that's a real danger in all of this, both from a financial point of view,

803
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:53,800
and how we're going to do important things to society when the technology has turned around so much of this.

804
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:59,800
But it's also just the way that we think about things and the way that we don't value

805
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:04,800
some of the things that really are valuable, like a writer's letter to someone.

806
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,800
It just seems like another...

807
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:15,800
Except, as we all know, we don't know what is valuable until we know that we have lost it.

808
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:23,800
Someday in the future, the recording of this conversation will be absolutely essential

809
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:28,800
because Ken will have the made president of the United States,

810
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,800
and this is the place where he took that decision.

811
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,800
We don't know if that is going to happen.

812
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,800
I hope for your sake that it won't.

813
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:41,800
But that's actually part of the economics of information altogether.

814
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:49,800
One I mentioned before is that makes it so peculiar as a commodity.

815
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,800
One is that you don't use it up.

816
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,800
One is that it's hard to keep people from getting on it.

817
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,800
But another is that you have no idea what it's worth until you've already consumed it.

818
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:07,800
Which is the reason why if you just go at these things with commercial sensibilities, you are in trouble.

819
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,800
We do have some paradoxes.

820
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:17,800
One of which is in some ways the Google library is the...

821
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:21,800
Until the power goes off, it's the safest library there's ever been.

822
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:27,800
It's multiplied back up, it's constantly refreshed, it's in these enormous server banks all over the world.

823
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,800
There's actually never been as safe a library.

824
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,800
Until Google gets bored?

825
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,800
Yes, until the power goes off.

826
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,800
But also it's in the hands of a commercial act.

827
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,800
Absolutely.

828
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:46,800
But in addition to that, it's also the worst curated such collection.

829
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,800
So it's safer than Widener.

830
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,800
One really bad explosion in the boiler system and Widener is a thing of the past.

831
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:02,800
And yet Widener is the greatest curated collection of information there is anywhere.

832
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,800
I think this is very little understood in the world that we...

833
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,800
Google is spending an enormous amount of money to keep this sort of cod thing,

834
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,800
which they're obviously not going to complete as they had planned.

835
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:28,800
At this point they must just be trying to decide what's the least embarrassing way to give it to HathiTrust or something like that and stop.

836
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
But yeah, I think it would be really...

837
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:37,800
It's one of these things that would be so wonderful if you could get some of this information into the public realm.

838
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:44,800
Because I think it's very little known and understood in even the wider sort of thinking, reading public.

839
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:51,800
And that's another aspect of the internet that makes it not a library.

840
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,800
It's so predominantly commercial.

841
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,800
Yes.

842
01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:01,800
And we think of Google as the air we breathe that we can't live without.

843
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:09,800
And you know, it's got a board and income and it could just go like that and change everything if it shows.

844
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:19,800
Another difference is that there is a hierarchy of truth in a library that doesn't exist on the internet or barely.

845
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:24,800
So all these alternative facts that we are seeing now.

846
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:36,800
In a conversation the other day, a phrase stuck with me that the library is the place of evidence.

847
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:45,800
And it seems so important to remember that a library is a place where you have a collection of facts.

848
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,800
Some facts contradict each other.

849
01:12:49,800 --> 01:13:00,800
You have lies of course, but there is a system of curating that filters most of it, not everything.

850
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:12,800
While on the internet I can find proof that the earth is flat and know nothing to contradict it unless I look for it.

851
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:19,800
So perhaps the idea of the hierarchy of truth is part of the difference.

852
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:25,800
The library also places unequivocal demands which the internet doesn't.

853
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:34,800
When I was learning my field my supervisor was the great Hannah Holborn Gray who later became president of the University of Chicago.

854
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,800
And we had a very good library at the University of Chicago and the new area bit down the road.

855
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:46,800
And every week Mrs. Gray would give me readings and I would read primary sources in Latin and then there would be the secondary sources.

856
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,800
There was a book in English, it wasn't very good.

857
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,800
It was a book in French, a little better but not really good.

858
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,800
It was a book in Italian, that was okay, but the book in German.

859
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,800
That was always the right book.

860
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,800
And that's how libraries work.

861
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:04,800
They challenge you with this polyglot varied, tiered world of very edition.

862
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:10,800
And the internet again doesn't really work that way. You can make it work that way if you want.

863
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,800
But it's not designed to do that to you in quite the same way.

864
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:26,800
Perhaps going back to the idea of metaphor, the internet has not yet found excellent librarians.

865
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:39,800
Because I'm far from being an expert. I don't know what the country of expert is because I am the country of expert as far as the internet is concerned.

866
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:44,800
And I use it very rarely and it frustrates me enormously.

867
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:54,800
But maybe my son tells me that it's because I haven't found the right search tool if I'm using the right term.

868
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,800
I haven't found the right librarian.

869
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:04,800
It's as if I went into a library and I'm looking for something and the catalogue is not enough.

870
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,800
I need a reference librarian.

871
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,800
And that is what I don't find on the internet.

872
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,800
The internet is dynamic and constantly changing.

873
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:28,800
So that's what makes it totally uncontrollable in the way that reference books and refereed articles which went by a much slower rhythm were.

874
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:38,800
A stable text is not the right way to try to control what's coming out and becoming accessible on the internet.

875
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,800
You have, we don't have a librarian. We all understand that.

876
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:49,800
What you have are very, very clever advertisers who know every click that you're making.

877
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:56,800
So they'll know as much about what you're doing as your librarians have printed and know what you're doing.

878
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,800
But they won't advise me a librarian.

879
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:04,800
They'll direct you but they will not advise you with any sense of benevolence.

880
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:11,800
You'll have to explain to me how that happens because I haven't found it in a way that's satisfying.

881
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,800
Because no one can make money on that.

882
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,800
Right.

883
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:16,800
There we are.

884
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:22,800
To the extent that the internet is able to make money, they're very good at doing that.

885
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:31,800
Because they follow your clicks. They read not literally but they browse your email and they know about what sorts of things you like.

886
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:43,800
And there are these very fast auctions to decide exactly what advertisement to show to you, given your past and given all the records of what you've done on the internet.

887
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:48,800
And indeed all the records of things that you haven't done on the internet that are also taken into account.

888
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:54,800
So there is a very, very finely developed system of making recommendations.

889
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:02,800
Not just for what the next video is that you should order but for everything that you want to do commercial that someone can make money on.

890
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:14,800
The issue is that the kind of scholarship, the kind of curation, the kind of work that libraries do, the kind of thing that we value because that's who we are, you can't make money on that.

891
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:20,800
It's the antithesis of the library because it's not the information and the content that's curated.

892
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,800
It's you, you're rated.

893
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,800
That is very good. That is excellent. That explains it.

894
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,800
And much of the best material on the internet.

895
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:39,800
In the first years of printing, one of the ways that quality was maintained, the printers could not afford to hire characters of the quality that they needed.

896
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:45,800
One of the best ways that you did that was by getting a Franciscan to be your corrector.

897
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,800
Because proofreading is an ascetic task and the Franciscan would just be doing his job.

898
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,800
And you really couldn't give him any money because he was a Franciscan.

899
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:12,800
And many of the websites that I use, if you're interested in Latin texts written in the Renaissance, you go to White Trash Scriptorium, which is a text entirely made and curated by one noble person who likes to put up texts of Latin authors.

900
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:24,800
You go to the Shakespeare Institute in Birmingham, which happens why the Shakespeare Institute in Birmingham to have an updated, dynamic list of Latin texts available on the web.

901
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,800
And these things, it really is the equivalent of those Franciscans.

902
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:34,800
These things are done by people who sacrifice themselves because they somehow enjoy or feel virtue is doing it.

903
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:53,800
But I've thought about this for scholarly work in the context of mathematics because Google will probably not, in any time soon, develop, find search tools for looking for formulas or theorems or any of the rest of it because they really can't make money.

904
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,800
But isn't this actually work?

905
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,800
This is really essential.

906
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,800
So that's a kind of an extreme case.

907
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,800
The dual infomititions use the internet to call it out.

908
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:11,800
They certainly use the internet and it's certainly fantastically useful to be able to pull up papers and from scattered journals here and there and all of the rest of it.

909
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,800
But it's not so easy to find what you want.

910
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:28,800
And so there have been a number of grants, maybe the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, to try to fill in this gap in, say, mathematical search because the commercial interests and others won't do it otherwise.

911
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:37,800
Isn't Wikipedia the mathematical definitions there are maintained as accurately and updated by mathematicians?

912
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,800
Yes.

913
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:43,800
So Wikipedia for math is a reliable reference in a way that it isn't for history.

914
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,800
It is not for literature.

915
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,800
No, or history, or classics, or most other things.

916
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,800
No, it's rather well curated.

917
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,800
And there's a lot of mathematics that you can learn there.

918
01:19:52,800 --> 01:20:02,800
And duty requires me to mention that the funding and shaping of Wikipedia was another thing that the Sloan Foundation was very much involved with.

919
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:08,800
And if you think about public goods, and I'm not sure how to mention this, I just did mention it.

920
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,800
That was when I'm not sure how to measure this.

921
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:17,800
But there are people who say that Wikipedia is the largest public good in the history of mankind.

922
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,800
I don't know how you measure it.

923
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:30,800
But it certainly is some kind of public good that's rather significant and perhaps overused or misused, but still really pretty terrific in many ways.

924
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:37,800
How much there's no objection, I think, you have some nodding heads on that, I agree.

925
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:44,800
Oh, I think we're all totally dependent on Wikipedia even when we're infuriated by some of its rules.

926
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:56,800
I'm struck by how much we're talking about the Internet, and you were asking before for metaphors for the Internet.

927
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,800
And I'd like to say the opposite.

928
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,800
I don't want any more metaphors for the Internet.

929
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:09,800
I'm afraid that the Internet is becoming a metaphor to us for everything else, in the same way that perhaps in an earlier age that the Internet is becoming a metaphor to us for everything else,

930
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:22,800
in the same way that perhaps in an earlier age that the assembly line became a metaphor, consciously or not so consciously, for many, many things,

931
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:27,800
and the educational system was arguably put together with that kind of metaphor in mind.

932
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:38,800
I want metaphors for other things, because it's so taken over the way that we think about the world that I'm not worried about getting a metaphor for the Internet.

933
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:51,800
And metaphors for other sorts of things that are also compelling, that are also capture people's imaginations, and that make sure that they know that there are other ways of thinking about the world besides clicking on something.

934
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:56,800
But that's because you're a mathematician, and you use an exact language.

935
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:07,800
We who have to use the language of words, because it's so unreliable, we have to go to metaphors to have that.

936
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,800
No, I wasn't saying anything about the power and importance of metaphors. I believe in that deep.

937
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:19,800
I was saying that I would rather spend my time looking for metaphors for other things besides the Internet.

938
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:20,800
But I was like...

939
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:27,800
Because the Internet itself is already becoming such a powerful archetype, such a powerful metaphor, and everyone's thinking.

940
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,800
I was trying to find a metaphor for the Internet that would put it in its place.

941
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,800
Well, I would settle for that. That's fine.

942
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,800
But I don't know what that is.

943
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,800
I'm talking, as you say, so much about the Internet.

944
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:51,800
But I suspect that the next generation, or the generation after that, will look at the Internet and look at it in the same way that we look at the typewriter now.

945
01:22:51,800 --> 01:23:05,800
I don't know... I'm told that there are new technologies that are being developed that won't use the Internet, will use something like the cloud to communicate with the chip in our brain.

946
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:11,800
I don't know if this is science fiction or wishful thinking.

947
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,800
Or the opposite of wishful thinking.

948
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:25,800
Well, on that unsettling note, I'm going to open things up to the audience here.

949
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:26,800
I'm checking our brain.

950
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:33,800
You'd like to ask a question, but please line up the microphone.

951
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,800
Please keep it in the form of a question.

952
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:58,800
I would like to find out if anyone here thinks there might be a way to establish a library for artwork.

953
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:04,800
I live in a community where a lot of artists continue to make art.

954
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:15,800
And I have seen a lot of the art that they produce go into dumpsters when they die.

955
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:22,800
And I realize you talked about curating.

956
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:41,800
And I'm really not talking about making a museum. I'm talking about making a place that has a curated, but much larger and much more inclusive selection of the works, visual knowledge.

957
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,800
It's not only words. It can be visual.

958
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,800
And that's what visual artists do.

959
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:54,800
I would anyone like to talk about A.B. Warburg.

960
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,800
You mentioned Warburg.

961
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,800
It was a way of...

962
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,800
Why don't you answer the question?

963
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:20,800
Warburg's library was organized first via the associations of visual images that were meant to lead you into language.

964
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,800
It's an interesting question.

965
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:28,800
Earlier we were talking about how people like to browse images.

966
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:39,800
And is that another way to organize a library in terms of not just through initially language, but images as Warburg?

967
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:49,800
And the real thing, not reproductions, not books about art, but the art itself.

968
01:25:49,800 --> 01:26:06,800
I think your concept of art as physical visual document, as opposed to art as revered object in a museum, is a very interesting one.

969
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:12,800
And we seem to have this kind of extreme of...

970
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:26,800
Libraries and museums have these different traditions of the way they catalog, make things available, hoard and bring out for exhibits versus begging people to use all the time.

971
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:33,800
And so that is actually the first time I've heard somebody interested in the arts.

972
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:44,800
How can I say willing to talk about art objects as documents and not quite as sacred?

973
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:58,800
So the question then is, they're still extremely cumbersome, expensive documents to store, maintain, index catalog, provide access to.

974
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:12,800
So if you think that digitized images of them would not be a substitute, because there are great image libraries, then back to the public good issue.

975
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:19,800
Is there a compelling enough argument that would gain sufficient philanthropy to do that?

976
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:20,800
I think it's a great concept.

977
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:37,800
I've really never heard it. I think we make art objects overly special in that sense, and we don't have enough museums and historical societies set up with study centers where you can really learn from them.

978
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:51,800
There's a model in your historical societies used in their loose center and a few others are adopting it, but that was still expensive to create and produce.

979
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,800
So I think it's back to the... what is the inspiration to get that paid for?

980
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:01,800
That's a very challenging question. What do we retain? What photographs do we retain? What paintings do we retain?

981
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:06,800
We'll retain your maybe pictures, but we wouldn't necessarily retain money.

982
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,800
I tell you you're elected president.

983
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,800
We do not have an exchange.

984
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:20,800
You did emphasize that libraries do curate. So you do make decisions.

985
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:40,800
It seems to me there could be decisions, restrictions, a structure for creating a place that does represent in a much larger scope the visual production of what we do.

986
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:45,800
So it seems like it could be done.

987
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:52,800
Can I make a tangential remark about visual items?

988
01:28:52,800 --> 01:29:06,800
So we've been a little bit critical of the way the technology is working and not working for us, but the fact that you can do visual search on the Internet is extraordinary.

989
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:20,800
That is just unbelievable. And the idea that photographs or pieces of art can be readily identified as a kitten with a sunset behind it.

990
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:35,800
Right. This is... when it comes to cataloging and you think of the kind of work that's traditionally been done to assign a few words that you could use to search into a physical card catalog.

991
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:40,800
Or in others kinds of search engines and key wording and things like this.

992
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:59,800
The idea that artificial intelligence by training it on millions of examples is then able to identify these visual physical other kinds of images is really something very different in the management of information than what we've seen before.

993
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:13,800
And to me, it's like magic. There are dangers in there, things get wrong, and when you start to classify other than photographs, if you start classifying people and their creditworthiness and everything else like that, I get a little bit worried.

994
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:28,800
But it's simply in terms of the kind of function that we thought about doing for books, for literature, for that we can now do something like that and have that kind of search for images is, as I say, like magic.

995
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,800
It's akin to the magic of the unconscious.

996
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:41,800
I mean, when Freud talked about primary process for a second area, and the thing presentations, as opposed to word presentations, is very resonant with that.

997
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:46,800
Quite literally, this is not formalizable. There are no rules.

998
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:52,800
No one sat down and wrote down kittens look like this, sunsets look like this, and so on.

999
01:30:52,800 --> 01:31:01,800
It's just that the machines have learned how to do this much the way that a child might learn how to do it.

1000
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:19,800
I wonder whether one way to think about these similar differences and different roles, the libraries and the internet plays today is to consider the difference between knowledge and information, where there's a level in the library of curation.

1001
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:33,800
So, in a sense, you can say that information has been distilled into knowledge, and some God has created and curated and selected particular pieces to be deposited.

1002
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:44,800
And the question is that clearly in the internet, that is not the case, and that's why we have a whole collection of information, whether it's reality or alternative realities.

1003
01:31:44,800 --> 01:32:02,800
And the question is whether there is a way to curate the internet or at least exist a certain aspect in which it could play the role that libraries have played up traditionally until not too long ago.

1004
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:09,800
Thank you.

1005
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,800
Any takers?

1006
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:19,800
Well, we might not be able to find a metaphor for the internet, but we have to break it down.

1007
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:35,800
And of course, many libraries, organizations, institutions are using the internet in a very effective way that evolves from the processes and the ideals of library work.

1008
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:57,800
So it very much is happening, but there's the commercial dimension that you've spoken about so clearly, and the not-for-profit motivated dimension in which a much of what you describe, I believe, is happening very effectively.

1009
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:07,800
I think the internet is trying to cultivate citizen curation quite a bit, which seems the only way to tackle it.

1010
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,800
But as we see, that's a mixed bag.

1011
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,800
That's the good and the bad of Wikipedia.

1012
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:19,800
It's so vast that seems the only way to tackle it.

1013
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:25,800
So there's some citizens, and then there's other citizens as they engage in that citizen curation.

1014
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,800
And there's certainly subsets of curated things on the internet.

1015
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:49,800
One of the things we try to do in working with students is help them recognize the sources of content on the internet and which of it has had some kind of authoritative or curatorial hand and which has not.

1016
01:33:49,800 --> 01:34:02,800
The curation of Wikipedia is really something quite marvelous and really not perfect, as we said before, but really quite marvelous and the social engineering of that has been thought through very carefully.

1017
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:17,800
And I would just, since we've been drawing these distinctions between commercial considerations and more public interest ones, if it got out that a single curator for Wikipedia was being paid,

1018
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:21,800
I think the model would be over the next day.

1019
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:28,800
People are doing it because they're not being paid, because they feel this kind of calling.

1020
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,800
And that's one of the reasons why you can trust it.

1021
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,800
Because it's not commercial.

1022
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:36,800
Exactly so.

1023
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:48,800
So they're asking you for a donation.

1024
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:54,800
Right, they're asking you for a donation, but it's not a commercial endeavor.

1025
01:34:54,800 --> 01:35:00,800
I mean, they do, as I said before, there are large costs to these things, and it has to be born somehow.

1026
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:17,800
And so coming up with sustainable business models for the provision of public goods is something that any one of us who cares about these things, and particularly those of us who are reading grant applications all the time, have to worry about.

1027
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:25,800
And so the fact that there is this roundswell of people who are willing not to be free riders, right?

1028
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:42,800
I mean, that's the issue with all of this, that if you free ride and take advantage of all these sorts of resources without anyone ever wanting to pay for them, then we're in big trouble.

1029
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,800
Yes, please.

1030
01:35:44,800 --> 01:36:08,800
So to pull together a number of other questions that have been asked or answered or discussed, there's a concept of archives as resistance, and particularly in contemporary archives that are being collected almost as we speak in every country of the world where wars are going on,

1031
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:19,800
people are photographing, people are taking notes, and people are giving oral histories as events are occurring.

1032
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:37,800
And the way history and the way we think of historic libraries, for the most part, is history gives historically the view of the, not of the vanquished, but of the victor.

1033
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:59,800
And so these enormous collections that are being curated, many of which are being put on the internet, but others of which are being given to foundations often, and sometimes foundations work with universities which then digitize the collections,

1034
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:11,800
and so that they're available in multiple formats, seems to be, in a sense, another metaphor being created of archives as resistance.

1035
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:27,800
And historically, in order to find these hidden works, let's say, it could take, you know, going to 50 libraries around the world and then trying to put things together.

1036
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:44,800
You said something which I found fascinating early on, I mean I missed the first part of this discussion, but you seem to make a distinction between knowledge-based archives and reading,

1037
01:37:44,800 --> 01:38:04,800
which I found so startling, because the hints that are given sociologically in terms of political science, any other method, or in terms of postmodern readings of literature, of poetry,

1038
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:21,800
of all kinds of things for new clues to things that had just been considered anecdotal, for instance, or even new clues, you know, when Homer wrote about the origin of the Etruscans,

1039
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:40,800
he said they were starving Turks from Lydia, and that part of his historical writing was simply denied, and then, you know, a couple of thousand years later, the evidence is there, from DNA, from different readings of archaeology,

1040
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:54,800
so they're, you know, from textiles, you can find bits and pieces of information from, I mean, from multiple resources, and even in terms of talking about contemporary art,

1041
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:11,800
this discussion has been going on for 30 or 40 years, every art meeting talks about what to do with contemporary people's art, so now there are ways to break down that art into,

1042
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:27,800
in the conservation field, this has been a big issue in terms of funding archival sources, funding libraries versus funding museums versus funding historical venues,

1043
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:38,800
and sometimes there are things written, let's say, on paintings, so you could say this is a historical resource that should be put in a library,

1044
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:52,800
or in other venues, you know, you can't really break down, there are multiple ways to look at all these things, anyhow, I would like to hear, you know, some comments on all these things, but I would like you also, in particular,

1045
01:39:52,800 --> 01:40:11,800
to expand on what you said, because I found that terribly distressing to hear someone so central to these discussions saying, oh, there's reading, and then there's knowledge-based material.

1046
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:31,800
Well, the reading part is because I felt we were being too focused on books, that's all, and that defining, that defining, you know, reading, and that a culture of reading is only if you read a book, I felt was too narrow,

1047
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:41,800
and that it denied all the other collecting, and the importance of all the other collecting that you are, in fact, describing.

1048
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,800
But is that true? I mean, there's so much-

1049
01:40:43,800 --> 01:41:00,800
Well, we were, so then we had a discussion about whether how we were using the word reading, that's all. Yeah, so, I mean, that's, it was in the context of this conversation about how we were using the word reading.

1050
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:11,800
Well, in terms of archiving as resistance, there's a certain sense in which it certainly is. It's resistance against the ravages of time.

1051
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:16,800
But I think you were also talking about the political sense, perhaps. Yes.

1052
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:23,800
And I was in an interesting conversation just yesterday, when somebody said, well, who's archiving the women's march?

1053
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:32,800
And I thought, oh, my goodness, that's a really good question. And so there are attempts already to begin doing that.

1054
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:40,800
But I would add that the Digital Public Library of America, and once again I would say that my colleague, Dorne Weber, is the expert about that.

1055
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:52,800
But I know that one of the original ideas of that was to be able to collect some of the artifacts of small libraries that are scattered through the library.

1056
01:41:52,800 --> 01:42:10,800
That are scattered through the United States, the sorts of not history written by the victors. But the rest of it, this, and to digitize that and to make it centrally available catalogued in a way that people who are interested in what goes on historically,

1057
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,800
other than in the Great Halls of Power would have access to it.

1058
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:27,800
So most research libraries at this point have, not most, but a good number, very active web archiving, curatorial programs.

1059
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:42,800
And definitely human rights is a big huge one. There's a whole set of libraries working in human rights arena in particular, and trying to divvy up the territory of different kinds of political sites, etc.

1060
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:47,800
So there are things being missed all the time, and then things being very consciously grabbed.

1061
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:54,800
I can't tell you who went right for all the women's movement sites, but there's quite an effort in that.

1062
01:42:54,800 --> 01:43:01,800
And this stuff is really hard to manage. We have the Archives of Occupy Wall Street.

1063
01:43:01,800 --> 01:42:46,800
That's probably the most difficult collection that we have to deal with, because also of the artifactual elements of that as well as the

1064
01:42:46,800 --> 01:43:07,800
archive.

1065
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:12,800
And collecting it was really quite an interesting process.

1066
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:16,800
So libraries are being faced with very new kinds of collecting.

1067
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:25,800
But I think most, at least, academic librarians would be right up there talking about the importance of this kind of content.

1068
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:31,800
It's interesting you mentioned that you have every, correct me if I'm wrong, but you have everything on Occupy Wall Street.

1069
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:36,800
But we have their archives.

1070
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:50,800
Except for the library, because the library had such metaphorical potency that it was discarded by the New York City Police Department, which is another illustration of the power of these metaphors.

1071
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:54,800
Absolutely ritualistic act.

1072
01:43:54,800 --> 01:44:01,800
There's a double problem, because the Archives of Power can't be dismissed either.

1073
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:05,800
They have to be read against their grain as well as with it.

1074
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,800
And that is, I think, a huge worry.

1075
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:17,800
As in the current political climate, it's not at all clear that national archives will retain the kind of political independence that they have, in many cases, been able to assert.

1076
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:21,800
I think they're going to be under tremendous pressure.

1077
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:24,800
Well, that's where your librarians will march in the streets.

1078
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,800
I hope so.

1079
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:28,800
Another question?

1080
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,800
Yes, I have a question.

1081
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:35,800
I assume you're sort of microcosm of librarians across the country.

1082
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:38,800
And I would wonder if circulation is down.

1083
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,800
I don't know if Ken and I want that responsibility.

1084
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:50,800
If circulation is down, how has that affected your work vis-a-vis publishing houses and all kinds of things that have a direct impact?

1085
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:58,800
Do you order less books and do you get better quotes from the publishing houses?

1086
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,800
It's a big business and I worry about it.

1087
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,800
So that's a very huge question.

1088
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:07,800
It's very huge redundant, but it's a huge question.

1089
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:16,800
And I'm also the NYU Press reports to me, so I'm a publisher too, so I have to think about that quite a bit.

1090
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,800
And publishing is certainly changing.

1091
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:28,800
It's able to make its way by selling fewer books, by selling electronic books, by having print-on-demand.

1092
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:34,800
The whole economy of publishing is quite different because of the ability to do print-on-demand.

1093
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,800
So publishing is adapting.

1094
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:41,800
I think the independent bookstore was something we're speaking of, curation.

1095
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:47,800
It's something to worry more about, although that's seeing a tiny resurgence, I hope that stays.

1096
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:57,800
But publishers themselves fortunately, there have been a lot of changes in the costs of the business and the models for the business.

1097
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:08,800
And some of the things we don't like, the conglomerations and things like that, that publishers have been very at, well, are being agile in managing that.

1098
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,800
Libraries absolutely do buy fewer books.

1099
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:18,800
It's also subject specific because there are more art books published than ever before internationally.

1100
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:30,800
Our circulation has tripled in the past five years and so has the number of outside researchers, and we added 23,000 books to the library last year, plus digital collections, etc.

1101
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:38,800
So each subject area has its different trends, ours is the idiosyncratic trend.

1102
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:40,800
Because of the image.

1103
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,800
Yeah.

1104
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:54,800
I think most of us in humanities are being affected by the multiplication of journals, which are very expensive and which drive books out of the budget between the databases and the journals.

1105
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,800
Those are growing exponentially and there just isn't much left.

1106
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:08,800
So, we still buy books, but we don't have the kind of representative collection that we would have had 50 years ago, and nobody does.

1107
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,800
But you can get your hands on what you need.

1108
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:20,800
You can get your hands on what you need, but it's soon we're going to be at a moment where Cambridge University press produces one copy of the book, which Harvard buys, because only Harvard can afford it.

1109
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,800
I mean, there's a spiral going on, and it's not going to end well.

1110
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:35,800
I mean, we're down to, you know, the library sales of a typical university press book are down to two or three hundred copies.

1111
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:44,800
But most university presses have adapted to the kind of mixed books and the costs of what they're doing.

1112
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,800
Most of them are still open.

1113
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,800
They have, and they haven't.

1114
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:51,800
I mean, one of the things they don't do is the kind of curation they used to do.

1115
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:52,800
They don't.

1116
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:56,800
They don't have a free, and that they've maintained, but nobody copy edits anymore.

1117
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,800
Not quite.

1118
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:58,800
Yes.

1119
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:03,800
We, at the National Library of Argentina, we've gone in the different direction.

1120
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:13,800
I've increased the number of characters and editors, but I have dwindled to almost nothing, the printed books.

1121
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,800
We're doing everything digital.

1122
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:16,800
We're saying this.

1123
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,800
I feel like the Pope defending Islam.

1124
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:23,800
But we have to do it.

1125
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:28,800
But on the question of journals, there's also the word bundling that comes up.

1126
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:40,800
And there used to be many, many cross-subsidies, which were ways of providing public goods that happen because of bundling of one sort or another.

1127
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:48,800
And the drive towards the commercial, the drive towards doing everything digitally has made people,

1128
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,800
I mean, if you think about your cable substitution, right?

1129
01:48:51,800 --> 01:49:00,800
The cost of adding another channel is virtually zero, but the cost of getting all of that to you, the fixed cost of doing that is very high.

1130
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:07,800
And again, we're at a loss as to how to price these things in a way that does what society needs.

1131
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:16,800
And once you start unbundling all the cross-subsidies in a research hospital, or all the cross-subsidies in a research university,

1132
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:20,800
then you may be left with only the things that make money.

1133
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,800
And that's scarce.

1134
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:23,800
Yes.

1135
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:24,800
Yes.

1136
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,800
We'll have to end it.

1137
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:28,800
One more?

1138
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:29,800
Yes, quickly.

1139
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,800
Yes, your question, please.

1140
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:36,800
The need of the library is that we store everything.

1141
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,800
What about the possibility of ephemera?

1142
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:42,800
Is there a line we ever draw?

1143
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:47,800
The obvious example is what happens to a Bernini fireworks show.

1144
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:50,800
If it happened today, we can photograph it.

1145
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:56,800
But perhaps it was intended to ephemera and legitimately remains ephemera.

1146
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:59,800
And this might put a limit on what we're talking about.

1147
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:00,800
Thank you.

1148
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:04,800
Well, it depends on which ephemera.

1149
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:11,800
We have lots of 17th century fireworks shows because the prints, which record them, are extremely valuable.

1150
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:17,800
They're curated and kept, probably more than 21st century fireworks shows.

1151
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:25,800
But I think ephemera goes back to the whole world of ephemera on the web, some of which are of great value and interest,

1152
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:34,800
and which are certainly not being preserved at the level that would make everybody feel happy and confident about them.

1153
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:43,800
As time goes by, the notion of what has to be preserved of ephemera changes.

1154
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:49,800
I'm sorry to keep talking about the National Library, which we're doing many things.

1155
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:59,800
I've assigned a group of photographers to go out into the cities and photograph graffiti,

1156
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:07,800
because we had no records of the graffiti, because of course, up to a few years, it was considered just vandalism.

1157
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:14,800
So this is an example of what we can do.

1158
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:18,800
But we now have a metaphor for the Internet fireworks show.

1159
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,800
I don't know if that's practical.

1160
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,800
That's a good one.

1161
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:35,800
Please join me in thanking our discussions today for the professor.

1162
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:55,800
That was fun.
