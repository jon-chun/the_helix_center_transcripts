1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
I want to welcome you to this roundtable at the Helix Center.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,080
I'm Ed Nursecien, the Director of the Center.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:16,960
Today's roundtable and tomorrow's on men men competition was proposed and organized by

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,920
Maxinshes Johnson, who is here.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,000
Just one announcement is that the program we have with the program tomorrow, we end the

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:38,800
October month and then in November we have a roundtable on animal language.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,960
So I will introduce Maxin and then she will introduce the other participants.

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,160
Maxinshes Johnson is a philosopher whose first life was a dancer, choreographer, professor

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,920
of dance and a dance scholar.

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,720
She has an ongoing courtesy professor appointment in the Department of Philosophy at the University

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,720
of Oregon and she has published numerous articles and a number of books.

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:13,120
Her books are The Roots of Thinking, The Roots of Power, Animate Form and Gendered Bodies,

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,560
The Roots of Morality, The Primacy of Movement and the Corporal Turn and Interdisciplinary

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,240
Readers.

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,600
She received an MA in dance and a PhD in dance and philosophy from the University of Wisconsin

16
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,480
where she also studied evolutionary biology.

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,200
She was awarded a distinguished fellowship for her studies of xenophobia by the Institute

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,120
of Advanced Study, Durham University, the United Kingdom in its inaugural years, the

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,400
team of which was the legacy of Charles Darwin.

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Maxin.

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:02:00,880
Thank you and I'm going to just stand up for this part because I want to introduce all

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
of you to everyone here.

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:12,320
But first I would like first to thank Ed Narsesian and Mary for their wonderful hospitality.

24
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,360
It's been quite extraordinary.

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,360
I want also to thank Robert Pinser for all of his work on the website.

26
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,720
I don't know who Robert Pinser is but.

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
Couldn't be anything.

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Ah.

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Pardon?

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
Could I?

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Could I?

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Sit through.

33
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
Thank you.

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Ah.

35
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Thank you.

36
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
Yes.

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:44,320
For anyway, the website and all of the emails that were sent out in terms of the website.

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,000
In terms of this roundtable discussion.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,320
I also wanted to mention that I was delighted that the Helix Center had started again.

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,600
I think it's just a wonderful institution and I hope it thrives and continues because

41
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:09,200
I think it's a great wonderful thing to do for the community and for being open to the

42
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,760
public as it is.

43
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,800
I think it's really quite a unique institution.

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,000
So I would like to just say yay for the Helix Center.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,120
I also want to say that one of the participants cannot be here tonight.

46
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:35,280
Linda Kapourial, she has a very highly seriously injured hamstring and she could not make it

47
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,560
from Renslauer Institute.

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,800
So she will not be joining us.

49
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,000
Jesus Yalundein.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:01,080
We have a somewhat, actually I guess, an international duo of participants.

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,560
Jesus is from Spain and from the Basque country.

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Is that all right?

53
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Yeah.

54
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,000
It's really strange to know that doesn't it?

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,240
He is an associate professor of philosophy.

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:21,120
He teaches very widely in the area of philosophy, everything in epistemology to the kind of

57
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,600
lowly subject of aesthetics in philosophy.

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:38,240
And he was awarded various distinctions awarded to him from the university, one of which I

59
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,440
can't remember the name.

60
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,520
It's the Samuel Ege Graf Faculty Achievement Award in 2008 and 2009 and the Allen and Pat

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,800
Kelly Faculty Scholar Award.

62
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,800
So he has been very active in promoting philosophy.

63
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:04,320
His main area of interest in terms of his life as well as his, both academically and real

64
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,320
life, is sports.

65
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,920
And as he put down in his self description, it's his main interests are in pedaling and

66
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,960
swimming.

67
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:26,200
I want also to introduce Scott Kelso, who was founder and director for 20 years of the

68
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,560
Center for Behavioral and Brain Sciences at Florida Atlantic University.

69
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,840
He has had a highly distinguished career.

70
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:48,680
This serves both in Dublin in a newly...

71
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,760
Derry.

72
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:59,160
In Ulster, he has a visiting professorship there as well as his continuing studies and

73
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,840
work and supervisions at Florida Atlantic University.

74
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,360
He's well known for his book on dynamic patterns and his more recent book that he co-edited

75
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:17,600
with somebody from Denmark on complementarity.

76
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,720
So I also want to introduce...

77
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,400
I have never had this pleasure before, but I want to introduce my husband, Albert A.

78
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:33,280
Johnstone, who is going to fill in as needed for Linda.

79
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm sorry, really, that all of you weren't present at the very lively discussion that

80
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,280
we had over dinner because I thought that we should all meet beforehand and have some

81
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,520
kind of interchanges because no one knew each other, really.

82
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,720
I knew them, but they didn't know each other at all.

83
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,240
And we had a very wonderful, lively conversation at dinner time thinking about what we would

84
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,560
talk about here.

85
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,560
So that said, I hope I didn't leave anything out.

86
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,880
So we were going to talk about life and movement.

87
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,200
And there are a few remarks that I just want to make just generally before we start.

88
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,560
And that is that to begin with, we are all movement-born.

89
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,240
We are precisely not stillborn.

90
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,600
The second thing that I would like to say is that movement forms the eye that moves before

91
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,600
the eye that moves forms movement.

92
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,360
The third thing I'd like to say is that infants aren't pre-linguistic.

93
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,720
Language is post-kinetic.

94
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:52,880
I think those are major insights that can be empirically demonstrated and empirically

95
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,720
investigated for the benefit of all.

96
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:07,120
Oh, I should also mention that just by way of, in case I have any lapses or stumblings,

97
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,480
we are from the central Oregon coast in a little village called Yahats, which is called

98
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,160
the gem of the Oregon coast.

99
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,120
And it took us 21 hours to get to New York.

100
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,120
And we arrived at six o'clock this morning, and we had four hours sleep.

101
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,400
So if I have lapses, I hope you will please forgive me because it's just a matter of lack

102
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,640
of fortitude and 82 that can be quite telling.

103
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,440
But anyway, I wanted to mention too that the last chapter of the primacy of movement in

104
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,120
this expanded edition that came out in 2011, that the last chapter, which is part of the

105
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:59,560
expanded edition, starts out with a sentence that movement is coming to the fore, though

106
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,480
it's not yet called by its real name.

107
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:12,280
It's very often talked about in terms of embodiment, embodied subjectivity, embodied self, embodied

108
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,000
experience, and lo and behold, even embodied movement.

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,480
And that really you can find in the notable neuroscientist Francisco Varela in an article

110
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,440
he co-wrote with Natalie Depros, who's a well-known French philosopher.

111
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,160
And you can find it as well in a book called Embodied Cognition, which is written by a

112
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,280
psychologist by the name of Raymond Gibbs.

113
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,000
So the term embodiment is bandied around a lot.

114
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,600
I call it a lexical band aid because what it does is just, you put it in front of something

115
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,640
and it's supposed to make everything okay because it comes from the body.

116
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,760
So you can talk about embodied language, you can talk about embodied anything, and it doesn't

117
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,600
really elucidate what it is that you're focusing on in the way that, with the amplitude that

118
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
it can or should be.

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,200
Something similar can be said in terms, from my way of thinking, in terms of an inactive

120
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:26,920
approach, which also slides by the realities of movement because it ends up being not only

121
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,000
an active approach but in terms of inaction, but then you have to embed the body and you

122
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:42,920
have to extend the mind and you have to, what is the other thing that they talk about?

123
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,840
Well just embodied minds, they talk about embodied minds which are embedded and then extended.

124
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,440
So anyway, they're not really, to my mind, getting at the heart of movement, which is

125
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,720
dynamics.

126
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,480
And until you realize that movement is about dynamics, it seems to me that you don't really

127
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,840
get to understanding movement at all.

128
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,800
And in terms of the life and movement, Roundtable itself here tonight, it's interesting that

129
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,720
someone when it was mentioned that it was going to be about life and movement, that that

130
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,080
was the title, someone said, oh you're going to talk about animal communication.

131
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,520
Life and movement has, pardon?

132
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:37,520
That has to do with, life and movement has to do with us as living, moving beings.

133
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:45,840
So I think it's really important that we bring this topic up for discussion.

134
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,440
Then I just wanted to mention a few quotations.

135
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,680
One is from Aristotle.

136
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,440
Aristotle wrote that nature is a principle of motion and change.

137
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:04,240
We should therefore understand what we mean by motion because otherwise nature would not

138
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,160
be understood at all.

139
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,400
The second person that I'd like to just refer to is a philosopher by the name of Edmund

140
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:22,040
Husserl, who is the founder of phenomenology, who said and wrote about the fact that I move

141
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,600
precedes I do or I can do.

142
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,120
But what he meant by I can do is not simply I can run and I can jump and I can do these

143
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
things.

144
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
But I can calculate.

145
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,880
I can judge.

146
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:42,200
I can do all these things, but in the beginning everything precedes from I move.

147
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:48,480
All of our repertoire of I cans is generated on the principle of I move.

148
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:57,040
And finally I would like to cite Darwin, who wrote that experience shows that the mind

149
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,400
cannot be understood by attacking the citadel itself.

150
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,080
And is a function of body.

151
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:14,760
We must therefore understand, no, we must therefore find and argue from some stable

152
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:25,680
foundation from which, I got that mixed up, we must bring some stable foundation from

153
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,680
which to argue.

154
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,840
We must bring and he underscored stable.

155
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,400
So that was, experience shows the problem of the mind cannot be solved by attacking the

156
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,120
citadel itself.

157
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,400
The mind is function of body.

158
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,640
We must bring some stable foundation to argue from.

159
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,600
Now I wouldn't say that we need to argue from that, but we need to show it.

160
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,440
And the problem is that what, I mean if you say to somebody what study movement, how can

161
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,480
you study movement, it won't stay still.

162
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,520
So with that, we will start our discussion.

163
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,960
And hope we can pin it down.

164
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:16,160
So I thought that we might start out with this question of life and movement with respect

165
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,440
to, I didn't finish introducing Bert.

166
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,920
Is it fine?

167
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:29,800
I'm having one of my lapses from, Bert is a philosopher, also a courtesy professor at

168
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,080
the University of Oregon.

169
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:41,000
He's currently writing a book called the Pan-Culturality of, on the Pan-Culturalt Human.

170
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,320
And he's just published an article having to do with emotions, which ties emotions to

171
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,280
basic somatic responses, which is a very interesting article and it's published in a journal called

172
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,960
Whoser All Studies.

173
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,440
Sorry.

174
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,360
So we're starting our session then on life and movement.

175
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,000
And the first question that was generated was what is the nature of life and movement?

176
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,240
And as I said, I think that our clue comes in dynamic.

177
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,760
So do you want to start in, Scott?

178
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:26,400
But just to follow up with Maxine, it's a pleasure being here this evening.

179
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,560
It's very courageous that people want to Friday evening to come and talk about this

180
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,120
topic and discuss it.

181
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:44,760
Just to grind what Maxine has been saying, I am an experimentalist in a way of matters

182
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,320
of movement.

183
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:56,520
And I want to tell you about a little study that was done, I think, by...

184
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,320
Okay.

185
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,560
Caroline Rové-Kagier.

186
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:12,240
And just to make it clear what we're talking about here in terms of dynamics and coordination,

187
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,640
little babies, two months old, spontaneously kick.

188
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,880
And when they're comfortable and fed, they kick quite a lot.

189
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,280
Well what Caroline did was very clever.

190
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:36,880
She tied a string to the toe of the baby and connected it to a mobile.

191
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,320
And so when the baby kicked, the mobile moved.

192
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:52,080
And at a certain point in time, about 13 or 14 weeks of age, the baby realized this is

193
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,840
me doing that.

194
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,800
Right?

195
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:06,520
So now the baby sees what psychologists might say a connection between what they're doing

196
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,840
and what they're seeing.

197
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,560
And in fact it's a very lawful relationship.

198
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,360
You move, the mobile moves, the mobile moves, you move.

199
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,120
It's a coupled dynamical system.

200
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,600
So when you hear about motion and dynamics, you often think about physics.

201
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,640
But actually that's only part of the story.

202
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,640
The part of the story has to do with the dynamics of the coordination.

203
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,760
And in this case, as a scientist you ask, what are the relevant quantities that describe

204
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,960
this coordination between the organism, in this case the baby, and the lawful effects

205
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,400
that the organism has on his or her world and vice versa.

206
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,720
So when we talk about dynamics, or at least when I talk about dynamics, I'm often talking

207
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:09,120
about coupled dynamical systems and the scientific questions are, in terms of understanding,

208
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,680
what are the relevant quantities that wrap up or capture the coordination, and then what

209
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,080
form did the dynamics take?

210
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:25,200
And that means that actually you would want to, if you could, formally write equations

211
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,040
of motion for the relevant quantities.

212
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,000
Let me just say a few further words about this.

213
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,440
I often tell my students, because when people think about motion, they think about physics

214
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,000
typically.

215
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,480
But that's not what we're talking here about tonight.

216
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:55,200
We're talking as Maxine has written beautifully about, we're talking about animated motion.

217
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,680
We're talking about agency here.

218
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,880
We're not just talking about movement as some disembodied state of affairs, but rather we're

219
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,080
talking about voluntary, purposeful activity.

220
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,000
And often that's spontaneous and we can go on and talk about that.

221
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:24,680
So the key point then is how do we understand purposeful animated movement?

222
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,480
You might say, well, we have the physics of the inanimate, actually we've got very beautiful

223
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,560
descriptions of that.

224
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:39,160
But isn't it strange that we don't have a science of the animated movement?

225
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:46,640
And could it be actually that this is something we just take for granted so much.

226
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,040
It's so much a part of us that we take it for granted.

227
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,280
And so we don't see the mystery in it somehow.

228
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:02,600
We've lost the ability to look at something and see that this is a mysterious process.

229
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,440
How does it really work?

230
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,680
And this little example of the baby suddenly realize movement forms the eye that moves

231
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:18,000
before the eye that moves forms movement in sheets, Johnson terms, is exactly like that.

232
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,960
This is the origins of agency here.

233
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,800
And the origins of agency in this case comes by virtue of a coupling between the organism

234
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,480
and the environment.

235
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,440
And the quantities that capture that are what science wants to go after, actually, in well-defined

236
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,040
experimental conditions and so on.

237
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:44,560
So you might just say one or two further words about this because there is an issue here

238
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,120
because movement is so much a part of all of us.

239
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,600
There are facial gestures, the way you speak, the way you sit, you're shifting pastures,

240
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
all of this.

241
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,360
It's part of this.

242
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:03,280
You might say, well, you know, I want to study the real thing.

243
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,400
You know, I want to study it in the wild, as it were.

244
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,440
And of course, that's interesting to do that.

245
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,320
And people are doing that.

246
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,480
And there are fields, for example, in sports.

247
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:26,160
There may be a segue into Hissus, but they're studying that in real world settings.

248
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,560
But in science, the progress has always been that there has to be an abstraction somehow.

249
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,920
You see, going back to Newton didn't give you the laws of motion for a falling leaf.

250
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,840
The reason is that the falling leaf, if you look around you today in New York City, how

251
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,000
do leaves fall?

252
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,920
Well, they tumble and they rotate and sometimes they go straight down.

253
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:53,320
Depending on many, many factors, and the leaves are different, and so on.

254
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:00,880
So the point is that the apocryphal story of the apple falling on Newton's head was the

255
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
abstraction.

256
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,840
That's the key thing.

257
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,280
He abstracted out of that the notion of a point mass.

258
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,560
He ignored friction, for goodness sake, which is something that we would find very difficult

259
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,400
to ignore, a natural property like that.

260
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,840
And that's how he got to the essence of the problem.

261
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,720
Or Galileo rolling a ball down an inclined plane.

262
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,760
Somehow now from there you go to the motions of the planets.

263
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,320
This is what one would say a science of movement could be about.

264
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:46,040
Just to say we need to see what the abstractions are so that we can do the dynamics on those

265
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,360
relevant variables.

266
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,880
In my own case, the inspiration for that came from a very, very strange place because when

267
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:06,000
I was a graduate student in Wisconsin, people were talking about movements as strings of

268
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,080
reflexes or as a consequence of cybernetic devices that have reference mechanisms and

269
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,600
comparators, and you compare feedback to those reference mechanisms, and you adjust the program

270
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,440
of movement and so on.

271
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:32,160
But none of this actually gives you much insight into the nature of spontaneous movement behavior.

272
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:39,600
And actually for that one had to go to other places I think and ask in general, how do

273
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,000
patterns in nature form spontaneously in the first place?

274
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,040
And there you have to broaden the entire issue.

275
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,920
So perhaps that is enough.

276
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:58,520
I think the key point here is that agency arises out of a coupling with the world, and

277
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:05,400
that to do a science on that you have to find out what the relevant quantities are and their

278
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
dynamics.

279
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,080
You cannot say this is a force, this is an amplitude.

280
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:16,360
We don't know often what the relevant quantities are to proceed and do scientific research.

281
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:22,000
And the third thing would be that let's not take the whole thing for granted because that's

282
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,680
what we've done, and the whole issue of agency is tied up with movement and we have to make

283
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,880
the appropriate abstractions.

284
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,480
Do you want to respond to that, Jesus?

285
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,480
Well, I know someone said response and they elaborate.

286
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,200
I'll take that maybe, compliments what you're saying.

287
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,120
As Kat is talking about the abstractions and the calculations, right, that you go into

288
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,480
movement and you abstract what's common to it and how things coordinate and systems and

289
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
so on.

290
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
Can you hear back there?

291
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Can you hear me there?

292
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Oh.

293
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
Okay.

294
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,120
Adolphly louder.

295
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,200
But I guess we're on coming from somebody who looks at philosophy and sport together.

296
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,680
I want to bring more of a qualitative aspect of things.

297
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,480
Instead of so much the quantity and look at in terms of formula which are very needed

298
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,200
to understand things on one level.

299
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,680
I want to maybe capture what does it feel like to do something and what does it call

300
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,120
it to come from.

301
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,400
And maybe to bring it back to the issue of coordination just today or I was waiting for

302
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
dinner.

303
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,600
I went for a little walk.

304
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,640
And I saw this young lady with a little puppy.

305
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,960
She wasn't walking the dog.

306
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,520
She was running the little dog.

307
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,040
They're right down the street.

308
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,280
She's laughing and they're both kind of doing like little tag team.

309
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,280
She runs ahead.

310
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,080
She keeps, you know, and just looking at her and the puppy running in many things.

311
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,680
What is this about life and movement in this image right here?

312
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,320
And the way I look at it, it would be in terms of, and maybe you can tell me what are

313
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,600
the underpinnings and how this works at a deeper level.

314
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:00,080
But the way I look at it was in terms of, well, there's a certain exuberance to life.

315
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,280
An exploration of possibilities, if you will, of what's possible, the puppy is trying to

316
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,600
see how to move in the world.

317
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,880
It's running around and doing different explanatory movements.

318
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,720
There is also an expansion of the possibilities of those movements that comes with that as

319
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
well.

320
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,320
And as well, there was a coordination.

321
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,840
They had to coordinate two of them so they couldn't hang up with each other.

322
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,200
So if I look at coordination at a higher level, it's a way they are collaborating.

323
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,800
And the way, for example, the philosophy of sport, we look at this, it's quite a long

324
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
time.

325
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,920
People looked at movement in sports or in other aspects of life in terms of competition,

326
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,400
in kind of zero-sum game.

327
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,480
Some have to prevail here and so on.

328
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,120
And there are new models that are coming out to try to explain more in terms of collaboration

329
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
or cooperation.

330
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,720
They're trying to say, well, the fact that there may be two athletes or two beings trying

331
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,440
to be in the lead, like the puppy and the young lady, doesn't mean that they have to

332
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,200
be a winner and a loser.

333
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,280
There could be a way of cooperating such that both of us win, but we have to come out with

334
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
different frameworks.

335
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,080
And here's the quality, right?

336
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,880
To some extent, in you pushing me and me pushing you, we bring the best out of ourselves

337
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,320
in whatever activity we care about, for example.

338
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,440
And I think something important about movement, the way we experience it as human beings, is

339
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,760
the fact that it's meaningful to us in a very, very concrete manner.

340
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,320
When we're moving about, there are some movements that speak to us.

341
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,400
If we walk in, it could be a skating dancing, swimming, or something else.

342
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,880
There is a way to explore the richness of life in this way, I think.

343
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,160
And it seems to me that by looking at this in different levels, whether we're looking

344
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:48,440
at it with mathematical equations or trying to look at it from a choreography perspective,

345
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,600
as a choreographer, as an athlete, there are ways to try to understand movement that pay

346
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,440
attention to what it is like as a lead experience.

347
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,880
And to do that, I would like to say that we also have to, in addition to doing laboratory

348
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,640
experiments, which I think are very needed to understand what happens really at the inner

349
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,720
working, so to speak.

350
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,160
I think it's also important to look at practices that show us maybe movement in different gradations.

351
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,360
And that's why I'm just going to give you a sports, for example.

352
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,600
You have the level from an office to an expert.

353
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,840
I'm very interested in extra movement, people who do things to an extremely good level of

354
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
things.

355
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,760
Could be a dance writer, an Olympic athlete, a choreographer, or could be maybe someone

356
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,840
who maybe makes a source for cabinets.

357
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,320
But they have particular movements, home to perfection.

358
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,360
What does it tell us about what's possible for us to move like?

359
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,960
I think in a way they are also inspiring to us.

360
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,880
So the way I look at it also is not so much in terms of dynamics, but also in terms of

361
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,040
high matters for our existence.

362
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,080
I find that it's coming very inspirational.

363
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,160
They show us different ways to move that we didn't think of otherwise.

364
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,760
Well, I never thought of moving that way, maybe.

365
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,520
So the way that I'm interested in looking at movement, and I think that it's important,

366
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:07,200
and I may come to respond to it later, and so on, is how certain activities, what I like

367
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:14,080
to call active pursuits that happen through movement, help us to nurture a way to excel

368
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,920
as beings that, you know, in a way we're put together to move in the world.

369
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,840
I think life and movement, they are in a way to sass with the same coin.

370
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Life expresses self-removement.

371
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
It can be otherwise.

372
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,680
The moment you have passivity, you have death.

373
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Okay?

374
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:34,440
So I think by trying to explore these possibilities, and exploring life also in rich and sour

375
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:41,600
lives at different levels, both as a scientist or a philosopher or a historian or so, one

376
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,960
of the different ways to look into this.

377
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,720
Something we cannot help do is move, and I think trying to explore it and understand

378
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,920
is very important.

379
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:54,240
To me, I'm very interested in exploring possibilities, because like Ortega said, who was a Spanish

380
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,000
philosopher, he used to say, we come to life full of possibilities, but life itself proves

381
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,560
them very quickly.

382
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,200
So the more you explore, the more that's possible, the more directly you go to the rich and enjoy

383
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
life, to some extent.

384
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,480
And I think part of that involves, and I'm not going to close with this, is being able

385
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,200
to be creative and spontaneous.

386
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Okay?

387
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,760
It supports what I find interesting is they give you clear constraints.

388
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,160
They have rules you have to serve.

389
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,120
So in basketball, you cannot kick the ball into the hoop.

390
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,160
Of course, very difficult, not that you want to do it that way, but, or in soccer, you

391
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,560
cannot use your hands, right?

392
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:34,000
So they give you constraints within which to be very creative, if you will.

393
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,280
Through these constraints, we learned to use our imagination to solve practical, artificial

394
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,280
problems.

395
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,000
We can also learn about movement in those constraints as to how we are creative and how

396
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
to actually be spontaneous.

397
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,640
What is the spontaneous movement or creative?

398
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,440
Are they the same or different?

399
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,160
So these are some of the questions that I can ask myself about the movement.

400
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,320
I think maybe that's a bramble for myself.

401
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,320
Thanks.

402
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:05,000
I'd like to follow up on one thing, but let me ask Bert if he has any questions or comments.

403
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,280
If you're going to talk about movement, it seems to me there are three other things you

404
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,800
have to bring in automatically.

405
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:20,360
I mean, if you're talking about human movement and not the movement of a robot, for example,

406
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,120
you have to bring in consciousness.

407
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,960
When I'm unconscious, I don't do anything very interesting.

408
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,160
I don't think I'm exceptional in that regard.

409
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:39,040
You have to be conscious and your awareness, what you know, comes into play and so forth.

410
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,480
Or acquired skills or quiet knowledge.

411
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,760
But your deep consciousness, you also need feeling.

412
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,720
If a human doesn't feel, it's not going to move.

413
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,680
If an form of animate life doesn't feel, it's not going to move.

414
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:09,600
Well, that gives you some kind of motive among other things for the movement.

415
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,560
And then thirdly, you have to have spontaneity.

416
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,200
I mean, you find that in your own movement.

417
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,040
That's the only sense in which I'm saying you have to have that.

418
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:26,280
That is, if you look at human experience, you will find that every time you move, you're

419
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:33,720
conscious, you have some motivation and you're spontaneous.

420
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:42,880
And spontaneity is a little bit puzzling as a phenomenon because you know what it is

421
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,400
because you're there, you exist, you exist.

422
00:32:48,400 --> 00:33:00,320
But when you're doing science to cover that, I find it very puzzling how to do it.

423
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:09,280
And it's an essential ingredient.

424
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:17,120
When you have a feeling of some kind, suppose you feel cold, well, you find that you react

425
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:24,680
automatically, you do something, you start closing off to keep warm presumably.

426
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:32,160
Now that's automatic and that can very well be explained through science.

427
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,200
But then you get a further element that comes in.

428
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:47,560
I can, realizing that I'm cold, I can act appropriately, I mean huddle more or do whatever

429
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,480
I feel is appropriate here.

430
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:59,320
But there I'm acting spontaneously if you're like voluntarily.

431
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:08,440
Being that, can be a scientific account, it's a bit difficult.

432
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,160
The same thing is true with any emotion.

433
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:17,800
Emotion always starts involuntarily.

434
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,960
Something rather moves you.

435
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,320
You don't command your own feelings, not directly.

436
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,080
You can do various things to get a feeling going and whatnot, but in general you don't

437
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,200
start the feeling.

438
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,360
You get on a train that's already moving.

439
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,400
Something is going on already.

440
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,640
And what you generally do, because it's the easiest thing to do, is you go along with

441
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,280
it and then you try to direct it here or there and so forth.

442
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,840
You can also not go along with it at all.

443
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:56,280
But it takes a certain amount of training to do that.

444
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:06,080
If you're feeling angry at somebody, well, just to get involved and start pushing your

445
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:16,000
anger, helping it out and so forth, well, it's not that easy at times.

446
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:24,880
But the spontaneity or the voluntary effort that you add to your feelings is an essential

447
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,240
part of emotion.

448
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:38,600
And just as an essential part of any kind of action you undertake, movement you do.

449
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:46,000
The baby you were mentioning was a sheer heat.

450
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It kicks its foot.

451
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,400
It notices things moving up here.

452
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,280
It kicks the thing moves.

453
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,000
It doesn't kick.

454
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,160
It doesn't move.

455
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,960
It kicks twice.

456
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,800
The thing moves twice.

457
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:11,760
It makes a correlation between what it does spontaneously and what that thing is doing.

458
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,160
And if it doesn't do it, it doesn't do it.

459
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:25,160
The two go together.

460
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,760
Well, how do things go together?

461
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,920
Yes.

462
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:43,440
The way you said it, are you saying feeling comes first, movement comes later or it can

463
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,760
be either way?

464
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,560
And the same about consciousness.

465
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:54,360
Is it that that kind of recognized, the kind of consciousness you are talking about which

466
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:02,160
is recognizing you said the me rather than just being conscious.

467
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,600
In your description of the baby with the kicking, you said the baby says this is me.

468
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:14,040
So this is a recognition that goes beyond regular consciousness.

469
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,280
And so which comes first?

470
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,720
Are you saying the kicking then makes the baby recognize his consciousness, his conscious

471
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,760
of himself or the other way around?

472
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,720
And that also about the emotion.

473
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:41,080
You know, it's always, it's somehow interesting the way we always like to see which comes first,

474
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,440
the card or the horse.

475
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,280
You see, in this case, that was at least the point I was trying to make that this is a

476
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,440
coupled system.

477
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,880
So and Bert is amplifying that I think very nicely that this, the baby realizes that this

478
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
is me.

479
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,680
I mean, we don't know what the baby is experiencing.

480
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,720
This is an inference, but nevertheless the fact that the baby then voluntarily kicks its

481
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:12,240
leg from first of all spontaneously kicking the leg to then voluntarily because actually

482
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:19,080
the baby then increases its kicking and producing the nice effect in the world, you see.

483
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:27,920
So I'm not convinced that the either or which comes first is the way to see things.

484
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:36,040
I would like to make a comment here or two about what Jesus said.

485
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,960
It's actually, we can use this sort of basic example.

486
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:49,040
You see, we're really asking the question, what are the, as it were, what is the significant

487
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,280
aspect of movement?

488
00:38:51,280 --> 00:39:01,360
And this person sitting beside me has said the significant aspect of movement are meaningful

489
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,560
animated synergies.

490
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:11,640
And the synergy is a checkered concept, but I think it's very, very important in the

491
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:18,160
following sense that a synergy actually is a working together.

492
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:25,840
And in fact, this coupling of the baby and the mobile is a synergy spanning the environment

493
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,880
and the organism.

494
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,080
There are other kinds of synergies that people in evolutionary biology have talked about where

495
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:41,880
they would have two oarsmen, one each with an oar, and they want to cross the river.

496
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:48,720
Well, unless they cooperate with an effect here, so the synergy always has an effect.

497
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,080
It's not just a working together, but it's working together with a functional effect.

498
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:01,040
If one defects there, I mean, we've got game theory and all these things, repeated games

499
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,080
and so on, but the defection is a one-off.

500
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,000
It matters, right?

501
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But if one defects, they'll go in a circle.

502
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,960
Okay, everybody, get that.

503
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,280
So they have to cooperate for an effect.

504
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,680
That is a synergy with a real effect.

505
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,560
Now there are other synergies that we discovered, for example, when you speak just to pull out

506
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:28,440
the properties here, imagine you have to say the word baz as in the first syllable of a

507
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,040
bad word, baz.

508
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:38,440
And suddenly some experimental arrangement, normally when you say the word baz, just try

509
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:44,680
it yourself, you're not really aware of it, but your jaw raises with your tongue, because

510
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,320
the tongue has to go to the roof of the mouth to produce a frickative sign, zaz.

511
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:59,240
Now imagine somebody who never experienced this before suddenly gets a tug to the jaw.

512
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,640
Then how does the system compensate?

513
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:13,280
Well, the fact is that 30 milliseconds later, the tongue is increasing its activity because

514
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,440
you measure the genial glasses, muscles of the tongue, which raise the tongue.

515
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:25,920
The tongue is already moving to get to the roof of the mouth in 30 thousands of a second.

516
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:33,640
Now to get the synergy idea here, the jaw and the tongue are not mechanically linked.

517
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,400
They are not mechanically linked, no more mechanically linked than the two people with

518
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,200
the oars, but they are, if you like, informationally linked, they're coupled.

519
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:53,080
And in fact, the synergy here is spanning the entire collection of elements that are

520
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:58,400
necessary for the achievement of the goal, the purpose.

521
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,440
You can easily change the context.

522
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,800
Synergies are context, beautifully, exquisitely context-dependent.

523
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,360
So just change the context and say, bab instead of baz, well, the tongue doesn't do a darn

524
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,360
thing then.

525
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,760
That's the upper lip.

526
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,920
And the upper lip is not mechanically coupled to the jaw.

527
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:24,720
So these are remote compensatory effects happening in, you know, a physiologist might say reflexively,

528
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:31,480
but they have the creativity and the generativity required to produce an outcome.

529
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,900
And that is the functional synergy.

530
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:40,960
That is the combination, bird, I would say, of spontaneity and agency together.

531
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,880
You have a goal you want to produce, some little piece of environmental perturbation

532
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:55,360
hits one of the members of this putative assembly, and other remote members will immediately

533
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,920
compensate.

534
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:08,160
So this, I think, turns out to be quite important because you can then ask, well, how are synergies

535
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,560
formed and how do they change?

536
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:19,640
And then you're really asking questions about how any pattern or any collective pattern

537
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,440
of behavior changes under what conditions and so on.

538
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:30,320
So spontaneity and intentionality are intimately linked in this way.

539
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:38,120
If I may, I'm going to interject two things, and it's backtracking a little bit.

540
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:44,760
I want to go back to Ed's question about emotion with respect to movement.

541
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:50,680
And that is that it seems to me that there's an overlooked dimension of movement, of emotions

542
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,880
and movement in our everyday lives.

543
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:02,600
And that is that emotions move through the body and move us to move in particular ways.

544
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,360
Emotions move through the body.

545
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:10,600
We don't trust moves through the body in ways different from fear.

546
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,800
Joy moves through the body in ways different from sadness.

547
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,520
There are differences in the way emotions move through the body and the way in which

548
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,000
they move through the body moves us to move in certain ways.

549
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,720
And it seems to me that that relationship substantiates a dynamic congruency in form

550
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:40,360
between emotions and movement, which is why it's a formal congruency, which is why we

551
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,400
can both feign an emotion.

552
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,400
We can pretend, oh, how nice it is to meet you when we're really thinking, oh, God.

553
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:55,560
And we can also restrain an emotion instead of doing such and such instead of slapping

554
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,680
somebody in the face, we restrain ourselves.

555
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:05,840
There is a dynamic congruency between emotions and movement, which allows us to a formal dynamic

556
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:12,640
congruency, which allows us, in fact, to feign or restrain ourselves.

557
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,240
The other thing that I just want to mention is-

558
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,080
I'd say these synergies are different in those cases if you actually look at that carefully.

559
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,160
Yes, I'm sure that they are.

560
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,160
Yeah.

561
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:28,560
Because the synergies of meaningful movement that have to do with deeper aspects as well

562
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,440
as the what's out there overtly.

563
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:47,080
The other thing, going back to Jesus's point about excelling and also in relation to spontaneity,

564
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:53,840
it seems to me that one of the problems that we have in terms of taking movement for granted

565
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:03,720
is precisely in terms of falling into habitual ways of doing things and overlooking the realities

566
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,560
of the experience itself.

567
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,240
If when we are in tune with the realities of the experience itself, we can wash dishes

568
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,480
like this, or we can wash them and just kind of think around.

569
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,520
There are all kinds of ways in which the qualitative dynamics of what we are doing can come to

570
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,840
the fore to us.

571
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:33,680
When we pay attention in that way, we can indeed enlarge on the possibilities.

572
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,200
It seems to me that people who study- there's nothing wrong with studying abnormal behavior,

573
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:48,400
but it seems to me that those who excel in behavior, not behavior, excel in movement,

574
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,960
that was a great lapse.

575
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,360
Sorry.

576
00:46:54,360 --> 00:47:01,200
We also need to study on the other end, those who excel not just the abnormal, but those

577
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,080
who are at the extreme end on the other side.

578
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:14,360
What comes to me as a kind of insight in relation to this is when I was in my first life as

579
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:21,120
dance, I realized that there's a great difference between moving through a form and having the

580
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,760
form move through you.

581
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,080
When the form moves through you, you are actually experiencing the movement.

582
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,200
When you're moving through a form, you're doing something habitual.

583
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,200
The spontaneity, it doesn't seem to me as there precisely because it goes unrecognized

584
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,120
as an experience.

585
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,560
It doesn't come forth in a real genuine way.

586
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:54,360
I don't know if that makes sense to any of you, but those are two comments I would make.

587
00:47:54,360 --> 00:48:07,120
If we could maybe pause and ask how we understand spontaneity, how we understand the emergence

588
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:14,480
of anything, it's spontaneity.

589
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:22,280
It's a question of how you would actually study that because, again, it's rather difficult.

590
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:31,360
One way would be, for example, that you could think of an animal, a quadrupedal creature,

591
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,360
walking.

592
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:37,800
That's actually a good trick how creatures walk and locomote.

593
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:44,360
Every creature does, but the laws of locomotion are not really that well understood.

594
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:50,320
But where the spontaneity comes in is that animals change gate.

595
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,760
That is, they switch from walking to trotting.

596
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,120
And they switch from trotting to galloping.

597
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:02,480
It turns out that there's a lot of different gates that quadrupedal creatures have.

598
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:11,280
And so you could start to think about, well, what analogies might you make between an animal

599
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,840
changing gate as a spontaneous event?

600
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,680
It's a spontaneous event.

601
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,680
And other examples of spontaneous pattern formation and nature.

602
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:27,080
Well it turns out, by that I mean that under certain conditions you can take a system with

603
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:35,040
very, very many microscopic components, like you, like all of us, at a great detailed

604
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:41,360
level, at a molecular level, millions and millions and billions and all of that stuff.

605
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:47,480
But somehow under certain conditions they form structures and patterns.

606
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,800
And the physics of that is very interesting.

607
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,600
It's called the physics of non-equilibrium phase transitions.

608
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:59,280
So from a methodological point of view, how you go after spontaneity in this case is you

609
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:06,400
say, could there be an analogy between an animal changing gate, which means it's changing

610
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:14,600
the ordering among its limbs and other phenomena in nature where you see the spontaneous emergence

611
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:21,840
of pattern, like in fluids or in clogged patterns or in material in different forms of matter,

612
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,640
magnetism and so on.

613
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:34,000
And the very interesting aspect is that all the features of the gate change, the spontaneous

614
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:43,600
change in coordination, all the signatures of that are seen in that kind of a system,

615
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:48,920
just as the same signatures are seen in other physical systems that are open to exchanges

616
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:55,240
with energy and matter with their surrounds are non-equilibrium or non-linear because this

617
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,720
is a non-linear abrupt change.

618
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:03,200
So the origins of spontaneity here come through these non-linear changes.

619
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:09,120
And once you know that, then you can say, well, how do I modify that?

620
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:13,800
And that means you have to bring in intentionality and learning and so on.

621
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,800
But without knowing this, here is the key point.

622
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:23,360
Without knowing how spontaneous patterns arise under certain conditions, you don't really

623
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,000
know what to modify.

624
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,920
I call that intrinsic dynamics.

625
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:33,560
You need to know the intrinsic spontaneous dynamics so that you can know what to modify.

626
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:38,480
It's kind of akin in general, if you think of it in general.

627
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:44,960
You don't go in and try to modify a system without knowing a lot about its spontaneous

628
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,360
activities, its intrinsic dynamics.

629
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:55,320
If you get what I mean, you can take that to a lot of aspects of life actually in society.

630
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,520
You start interfering because you don't know what you're doing.

631
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:04,720
It's only when you understand the spontaneous patterns that you can now say, this is the

632
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,440
space that I want to change things and modify.

633
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,440
Modification happens in that space.

634
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,560
You had a comment, go ahead.

635
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:21,280
Well, I guess I was wondering, it seems to me that once you're playing in this way where

636
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:27,200
you say, well, eventually you have to bring it into a scenario, but you have these non-linear

637
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,200
changes.

638
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:33,000
But what makes the difference at our level is that we have to reflect which changes to

639
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
accommodate.

640
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,080
And it's to be there is something deliberate about it that's not accidental, to some extent.

641
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:44,280
So I'm wondering, is that part of the spontaneity then our deliberation about how to work with

642
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:49,760
these possibility repertoire of movements or that we have available so that we seem to

643
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,760
pick the better ones.

644
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,800
I don't see, for example, a paramecium which is exploring with a little cilia, trying

645
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,840
to see what kind of movements are possible for me to get food.

646
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:08,400
But I don't know to what extent it's able to conceptualize, if you were through movements,

647
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,960
you know, well, these are the movements that work for me and not those.

648
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:17,720
At what level do we bring maybe this ability to work with this or does it happen automatically?

649
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:25,200
Yes, so this gets technical fact because actually in the case of the bacterium or the

650
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,560
paramecium, your point is that they have multiple possibilities.

651
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:35,640
And so in fact that's the essential aspect of spontaneity.

652
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:42,120
So that you can choose as it were which one suits the current conditions.

653
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:50,120
And that's again a quite general property and it's also a feature of the kinds of order

654
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:55,200
transitions that occur in quadrupedal locomotion, you see.

655
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:02,520
So that's a key point, having many possibilities because often in science people like to study

656
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,520
one thing.

657
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,200
So you study a monkey doing one thing.

658
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,800
But the monkey has a whole range of possibilities that are never explored.

659
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,000
And you don't know actually then what the neural underpinnings of that are.

660
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,560
The system is highly, what we say, highly degenerate.

661
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:23,080
There are many ways to accomplish the same function at every known level, molecular all

662
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,360
the way up to social signaling.

663
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,760
That's a key feature again.

664
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:33,000
Yeah, this reminds me of something that we discussed for a very little bit, but to some

665
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,320
degree at dinner.

666
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:41,040
And that is wouldn't you say that this is at a living level connected with kinetic intelligence?

667
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:48,720
In other words, with the knowledge that an animal, human or non-human brings to life

668
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:55,520
itself on the basis of the bodies they are to go back to what Darwin said about mine

669
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,040
being a function of body to draw on that.

670
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:06,920
We all have a basic kinetic intelligence with respect to our icons to draw also on

671
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:15,960
Husserl what we can do and how we can possibly enlarge our repertoire of icons.

672
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:22,280
Yes, I think you see we are very used to thinking of this word intelligence in terms, for example,

673
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:27,200
of computation and kind of symbolic intelligence.

674
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:33,120
Going back to Darwin, of course, Darwin's worms proved to be enlightening and terribly

675
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,960
intelligence and ants too.

676
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:43,440
Ants as we know, termites, for example, build beautiful structures under certain conditions.

677
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,920
Put in some fear among gradients, put in a little positive feedback or to catalysis,

678
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,720
and they start to create structures and pillars and arches.

679
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,240
So the ant, you can say the ant is an architect.

680
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:01,040
Well, it doesn't make any sense, you ask, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions

681
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:08,040
for this kind of architecture to emerge and it looks intelligent and we say it's intelligent.

682
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:16,160
But in fact, as you say, it's a natural intelligence in contrast perhaps to an artificial intelligence,

683
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,960
the way we think about intelligence.

684
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,600
And it can lie dormant in many…

685
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,600
Underappreciated.

686
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:29,840
Underappreciated in humans, I think, because in part because many times when people think

687
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:38,440
of movement and they think in terms of exercising and if you go through these exercises and

688
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,280
you're going to be fit, et cetera, but that's really a matter of going through the motions

689
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:49,720
rather than being attuned and listening to the actual experience of movement and listening

690
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:58,680
to what's there dynamically, qualitatively in the movement that you're involved in,

691
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,080
that is moving through you.

692
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,880
Yes, it's highly creative and generative.

693
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,880
I mean, there are beautiful examples and sports of that as well.

694
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,880
I think there was just a…

695
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:18,360
I don't know if anybody knows soccer, but there was a great example of this where

696
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:25,840
in the… before the last World Cup, a very famous soccer player called Thierryon Rie was

697
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,520
playing for France and they happened to be playing against Ireland, so I had invested

698
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,560
interest in this.

699
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:46,440
But the ball came to him at somewhere between his knees and his shoulders and he couldn't

700
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:52,000
control the ball with his knee and he couldn't get his head down to it, so he just used his

701
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,320
hand and it was called the hand of God.

702
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:03,360
You see, no, the referee didn't see it, but it was… it was almost reflexive.

703
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,360
It's exactly like this very generative.

704
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,920
It never done it before.

705
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,920
It's against the rules, but it accomplished the goal.

706
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,920
You see?

707
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:23,280
What we're dealing with here is… and it was so reflexive, but then it's not reflexive

708
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,880
in the case of some stimulus response kind of thing.

709
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,280
It's never been done before.

710
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,280
I wasn't just in that example.

711
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,160
The thing about it too is that there has to be a way in which… I mean, he used the

712
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,560
hand because he knew his goal was to manipulate the ball to go to a particular place.

713
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,360
He was a modern choice in a way.

714
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:46,320
But he still… and they sort of speak pretty flexibly perhaps, but he knows the goal is

715
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,520
to move the ball to a particular place.

716
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:53,360
So he has trained himself to act with a particular object in a particular way.

717
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,400
So he's certain rules in mind.

718
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,440
And he comes… like you say, he's supposed to use his hand.

719
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,840
That's what comes out spontaneously.

720
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,400
While he's trained, he's still trying to play soccer.

721
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,520
Even when he knows that the hand's not allowed to be used, it was the only thing that he

722
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,200
could given the goal because he…

723
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,200
Because he…

724
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:16,000
And there the goal is primary too, that means to how to achieve it.

725
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,320
But it shows you, I think, beautifully the context and specificity, the generativity,

726
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,920
the creative aspect of skilled behavior.

727
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,920
And that was the question I guess I had going back to…

728
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,680
I was just going to say that I do want to leave time to have questions and comments

729
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,600
from all of you out there.

730
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,000
So we'll make this the last comment.

731
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
That's fine.

732
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Very quick.

733
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
That's fine.

734
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,240
I guess I was just wondering, going back to Sondad Berg's way to go to spontaneity.

735
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:52,560
And it's the role of maybe not simply bottom-up, let's try to explain the generations'

736
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,360
spontaneity from neurons and so on.

737
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,760
But maybe from the top-down in terms of how maybe different cultures might also help us

738
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:07,000
to use this formal way of dealing with emotions through these formalized movements, right?

739
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,280
And it seems like at some level we do bring a way to be deliberate.

740
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:16,160
That is qualified in a very strong way by a cultural way.

741
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,520
It could be a practice like soccer, what's not allowed, it could be a way to behave in

742
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,040
a personal distance or how to express emotions.

743
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:28,280
I mean, to what level does those affect perhaps spontaneity or emotions or does it trickle

744
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,280
down as well?

745
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,280
I don't know, I'm just wondering.

746
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,280
Do you want to…

747
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,080
No, I'll let you put your hands.

748
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,720
That you get a lot…

749
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,400
You get a lot going on.

750
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,920
You get a kind of automatic response.

751
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:47,080
You get things you're used to doing, you could call them habits, I suppose.

752
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:53,440
But there was their voluntary in the sense that you could stop them if you wanted.

753
01:00:53,440 --> 01:01:00,120
And even there, their degrees are being able to stop.

754
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:09,240
And then there's a kind of voluntary adding on without it being very reflective.

755
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,640
You can also reflect on the whole situation, side you want to do, you want to go ahead

756
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,000
with this and so forth.

757
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,680
It's horribly complicated.

758
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:26,760
I mean, the degrees you get of these various factors coming in here.

759
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:32,240
I like this word amass.

760
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:39,640
I think Freeman Dyson wrote a little bit about, you know, when we're talking about life,

761
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,120
life is DNA, you see.

762
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:46,760
Well, it's not just DNA, it's metabolism as well.

763
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:53,160
You have to have renewal processes, not just, I say, the two-ars, reproduction and renewal.

764
01:01:53,160 --> 01:02:01,320
You need both of those, you need both metabolism and as it wears some kind of informational basis.

765
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,400
It's actually the same with coordination.

766
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,600
People like coordination, they like to see the ordered coordination.

767
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,080
And it looks like synchrony and so on.

768
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,960
And there's an awful lot of work going on.

769
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,880
For example, last week I was at the Society for Neuroscience.

770
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:21,640
And there were many symposia on synchronization in the brain and oscillations in the brain

771
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:27,320
that are cognitively relevant, and behaviorally relevant, and even emotionally relevant actually,

772
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:32,360
that seem to have some correlation to the states of creatures.

773
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:39,240
But actually it turns out that synchronicity and oscillation is just one the ordered part.

774
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:46,280
And when you look more closely, it's a much more subtle tendency to synchronize and also

775
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:52,040
a tendency for the parts to behave autonomously, to do their own thing.

776
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:58,680
So you have this kind of duality of a tendency to cooperate and a tendency for the parts to

777
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,480
do their own thing, almost compete.

778
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:06,880
So you have this subtle cooperation, competition, integration, segregation.

779
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:12,560
This is a key characteristic of dynamics and coordination.

780
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:18,120
So that's the beast, that's the mess that we have to recognize.

781
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:24,800
That DNA metabolism, how that's worked out, is really not still understood, even though

782
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,400
we've got the genome and all that stuff.

783
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:34,400
But now we come to coordination in the brain that is underlying everything that's going

784
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,000
on here in a way.

785
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,000
And that turns out again to be messier than the way we as scientists tend to think about

786
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
it.

787
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,360
But mess in this sense that it's not as simple as you'd like.

788
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,360
Exactly.

789
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,680
It's not too simple, but it's not too complicated.

790
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,880
It's sort of in this nice place in between.

791
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,720
And that's where we have to look at things closely, I think.

792
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:04,920
But I think dynamics are challenging precisely because they're messier to understand and

793
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:13,000
investigate than something solid and in place that has spatial clarity and exists here.

794
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,440
And you can really look at it and dynamics is fluctuating and changing.

795
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,440
Yes.

796
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,000
So, I mean, the dynamics literally is spatial temporal.

797
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,840
It's in space and in time.

798
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,840
And in force.

799
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,840
And as a flow.

800
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,760
Well, there are underlying forces perhaps, yes.

801
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:34,600
But in terms of at least of the pattern dynamics, it's more...

802
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,480
Like this.

803
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:42,440
It's more spatial temporal.

804
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,440
Yeah.

805
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,880
So, any questions or comments?

806
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,880
Yes.

807
01:04:50,880 --> 01:05:03,880
I'd like to throw a couple of things out and then you can deal with them.

808
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:11,120
You speak of importance almost the necessity of movement for life.

809
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:15,880
At one point saying life and movement are one, I think I heard specifically what's

810
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,080
said.

811
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:23,640
What about a quadrupolegic or someone in an iron lung?

812
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,040
That's the first thing.

813
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:32,880
As to emotional response, whether or not you're responsible for it, something inside

814
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:42,120
you unconsciously reacts to something you hear and you respond consciously.

815
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:50,080
It reminds me a little bit of Sam Harris' explanation of free will.

816
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,320
If in fact, there is free will.

817
01:05:53,320 --> 01:06:01,600
Your example of the baby and synergy doesn't have to include consciousness.

818
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:07,840
The synergy existed even as the baby was not conscious before the baby became conscious

819
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:15,320
of the connection between his foot and the moving mobile.

820
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:19,560
And the last thing is deliberate against spontaneous.

821
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,560
Deliberate...

822
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:25,160
I don't have a dictionary, but deliberate, I think, is conscious.

823
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:30,760
Spontaneous is not unconscious.

824
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:41,840
So rehorses changing their gates, I believe, correct me if I'm mistaken, that horses,

825
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:51,080
gates, stored as deliberate because they're learned and they become spontaneous.

826
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,480
So I leave you with that.

827
01:06:53,480 --> 01:07:00,120
Let me suggest that you take or that we all take one because I would like to have other

828
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:15,280
questions besides which one would you like to focus on?

829
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,840
The questions are all a little bit connected, I think, in a way.

830
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:26,360
But I think this important question you raised, but the synergy is there before it's manifest.

831
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,360
Is it really?

832
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,360
How do you know that?

833
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,720
I don't know that.

834
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:39,680
But it occurs to me that there's something I like about that idea in the sense that we

835
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:46,040
study, for example, the synergies between people in interpersonal coordination.

836
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:52,160
We study actually interbrain coordination as it turns out.

837
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:58,720
And I think there's a very interesting question there about the relation between self and

838
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:04,840
other in the case of the baby between the baby and the organism and the environment.

839
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,800
Is this energy there beforehand?

840
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,280
Does it pre-exist?

841
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:14,640
The possibility, I think, coming to Jesus's point exists, but it doesn't exist until

842
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,120
it's manifest, in my opinion.

843
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:28,560
So in the case of the self and the other, I think this may be taken as often different

844
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:34,800
directions, but I think, for example, the field of neuroscience has stressed the individual

845
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:41,840
brain, you know, Je pons d'hon je jous sous, I think, therefore I am.

846
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,040
But another way would be to say I am because you are.

847
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:50,560
So there's a self-other, but the self-other doesn't pre-exist.

848
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,280
It only exists in the relation of the two.

849
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,960
And I think that's the same case of the baby.

850
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:03,000
The synergy doesn't really exist until the conditions are set up, that it can be manifest.

851
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:12,240
That would be, does that sound odd?

852
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:21,320
I think in some cases, you see, again, again, again, again, again, you, what?

853
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,360
I thought I was on a scientific level.

854
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,520
I'm an average person.

855
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,520
But that's a synergy.

856
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,760
It exists in some kind of experience.

857
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:39,160
A synergy is a functional grouping of elements that are temporarily constrained to act as a

858
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,520
single unit.

859
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,520
That's more with feeling.

860
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:49,600
A synergy is an assembly of elements temporarily constrained to function as a single unit.

861
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,880
The question of how it arises, I mean, we could talk about that.

862
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:01,320
But that would be the definition in all the cases that we've been discussing.

863
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:08,520
Now, whether that's conscious or unconscious, again, is the brain synchronized?

864
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,520
Is it desynchrony?

865
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,320
We love to have this either or logic.

866
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:20,080
And I think where we're going to actually is more of a both and logic than an either

867
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:25,160
or the synergy could be both conscious and unconscious quite easily.

868
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,720
Yeah, that's a good complementarity point.

869
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,880
That's actually the kind of thing.

870
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:30,880
Bring up.

871
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,880
It doesn't have to be either or.

872
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,920
Maybe it's complementary or cubios of by degrees, maybe.

873
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,320
So there are different levels of achievement, synergy.

874
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:42,840
Things have to be full on synergy or completely lacking that or full on conscious or unconscious.

875
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,360
It may also be swapping up around.

876
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:48,080
For example, I feel that let's speak about being in the zone, something like that, flow

877
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,840
or mushy in martial arts, right?

878
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,920
And they say, well, that's when you're not thinking about it.

879
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,200
But I think that's really what's really happening.

880
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,200
You really pay attention.

881
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,200
What's going on?

882
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,200
There are both conscious and unconscious.

883
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:03,960
There are some things that you kind of put in the background, if you will.

884
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,440
But there are some other things you are hyper alert.

885
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,160
So maybe there are degrees and ways of being synergic or conscious of something.

886
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:14,680
And you use them depending on what the goal is and the needs of the moment.

887
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:19,000
There's maybe a possibility to open up so it's not simply to have one or not and what

888
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
are the conditions.

889
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,680
And it could be a scientific level.

890
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,320
It could be an experiential level.

891
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,480
And the one that maybe matters to you when you're trying to solve a problem that you

892
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,480
have in your face.

893
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,880
It could be very practical, so that I won't want to sleep on the ice, maybe.

894
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,520
And the more attention I paid to, maybe the more tricky it's all around.

895
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:40,480
So I think it could be a combination, maybe, or this is a suggestion.

896
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,480
Another question, Ed?

897
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:53,520
I'd like to hear a little more thought about agency, which came up very early on.

898
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,040
But we didn't really return to it.

899
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:59,600
I think we've got elements of agency here, spontaneity, consciousness.

900
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,880
One thing was left out.

901
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:08,880
It seems like agency would require a sense that movement produces an effect in the environment

902
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:17,320
that I, although not yet an ego in any formal or strict sense, can make a difference by

903
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:22,520
my movement to the configuration of a given environment.

904
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:28,000
That seems different from modes of movement that really may make no difference.

905
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:35,440
Idle movement, we could call them, just moving, so to speak, producing no effect and not actually,

906
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:40,720
therefore, tempting us to ascribe the movement to an agent.

907
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,040
I don't mean a full-blown agent.

908
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,320
I don't mean a rational agent.

909
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,040
I don't even mean a conscious agent.

910
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:53,000
But I mean some kind of being who by moving actually insinuates itself into the world in

911
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:01,120
such a way that the world comes out a little bit different, if only the mobile moving slightly.

912
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:09,080
So somehow in this series of terms that you've all been developing richly and I think paying

913
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:14,080
a due attention, respecting their deep ambiguity, that's one thing I really enjoy.

914
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:18,280
No one's coming across definitions that we need to adhere to.

915
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,240
You're actually exploring, I think, the penumbra of all these terms.

916
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:25,640
But agency is, I think, still suspended in the air.

917
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:32,080
And I wonder if we could return to it briefly and now say where is agency?

918
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:37,800
Who is the agent and how is agency related to motion, to movement?

919
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:48,360
Could you give an example of what you mean by a less definitive agency when you said that

920
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,840
there's no impact on the world?

921
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:55,520
Well I don't want to have a Cartesian agency or I don't want to have a mind.

922
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,920
I mean if I go like that.

923
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:04,280
Yeah if I just go like that, you know, and I'm really doing it, I would say like flapping

924
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:09,040
my wings to no effect as we say in English, right?

925
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,960
Then I'm not sure that's agency.

926
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,960
It's movement.

927
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,720
Is that what you mean?

928
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,360
Well that's sort of what I'm getting at.

929
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,840
Yeah how do we deal with that?

930
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:25,760
Is that a lower level, you see, do we reach a level of non-agentive movement here?

931
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,640
Maybe we call that involuntary.

932
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:33,120
Although I actually suspect that the class, that that class of non-agent driven movement

933
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:37,920
is sometimes voluntary and sometimes heads toward the barely voluntary.

934
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:42,040
But it's not really a matter of agency.

935
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:46,360
So I wondered if you folks could comment on that puzzle.

936
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:55,320
The way to say it all different levels.

937
01:14:55,320 --> 01:15:03,080
Unless you want to define agent to rule out some of the levels, if I'm doing it, if I'm

938
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:11,600
shaking my foot like that and if I'm aware of the thing just vaguely aware, it's there

939
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,320
in the background, I'm still the agent.

940
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:20,400
I'm not the agent in the way in which I scratch my head, for example.

941
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:26,080
There I have an itch and I know what I'm doing and I direct my fingers accordingly.

942
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:33,160
I don't know a little bit over here, but so forth.

943
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,120
That's an essential part of this thing going on.

944
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,040
I'm not unconscious and this is not a twitch.

945
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,600
This is something I'm doing.

946
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:48,840
But my participation is minimal.

947
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,640
So you have agents if you like it at a lot of different levels.

948
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,280
I don't know what to do with that.

949
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,840
It just seems to me that's the way the world is.

950
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,640
There's a comment from, yes.

951
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:11,280
I have the advantage of having a stroke, by the way, in my movement center.

952
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,840
So my right side is different from my left.

953
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:21,240
I'm also the president of La Bon Institute of Movement Studies.

954
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,680
So irony of all ironies.

955
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,080
Now also a radio show.

956
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:31,080
I'm very interested in the movements of the sound of things.

957
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:36,320
So I've had a very interesting journey from no control of my trunk or my head to finally

958
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,120
being able to move.

959
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,120
Amazing.

960
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:45,360
And in the process, I've had a lot of interaction, say, with honey, my dear friend, who both

961
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,520
drives and does her thing.

962
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,360
And she also walks me.

963
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,360
What is the gate?

964
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:54,600
I was famous, Pardot, poor, poor.

965
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,920
The fact that I could look at the gate and say there is no gate.

966
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,160
Everyone moves differently.

967
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:09,080
So La Bon was probably the first person to look at movement and say there is a language

968
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,080
here.

969
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,520
There are symbols to be used.

970
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,680
There is continuity.

971
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,680
There are sphere.

972
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:19,840
There are movements that are not linear and very circular in nature.

973
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:28,080
And as you said, Maxine, the qualitative aspects interest me very, very much, both recuperating

974
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:34,160
from my stroke, which I'm going to talk about in my new later in April, but still fascinating

975
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:39,600
to me was that there is no gate in my language.

976
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:45,560
There is no linear, non-agent involved in movement.

977
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:52,400
There is only movement and its qualitative differences in all aspects of movement.

978
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:59,000
So when you have a sperm who cannot move like other spurs, it moves differently.

979
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,760
It meets an egg that moves differently.

980
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:11,120
And a zygote occurs that suddenly moves differently from all other zygotes.

981
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,120
It's cute.

982
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:19,520
So what you phrase is instantaneously beyond that, believe me, there are even impetus who

983
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:25,480
say, well, we actually know consciously there is an agent before we are, quote, born and

984
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,720
conceived that we listened to what was said.

985
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,480
There are people that have many different opinions.

986
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,480
And yes, we are in a mess in terms of movement.

987
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,560
But where are you interested?

988
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:40,880
What is your particular take?

989
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:46,680
It's wonderful to hear everyone's different takes and my different take because of what

990
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:50,840
I have experienced both socially and individually, et cetera.

991
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:54,920
I'm very, very interested in all of what you say.

992
01:18:54,920 --> 01:19:01,800
And I'm most interested in hearing the qualitative differences, as I said, in movement.

993
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:07,520
And I will once again say, Erm got by Chin F was my mentor, but La Bonn really gave me

994
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:14,240
the opportunity, crudely caveman level that La Bonn was at, the opportunity to look at

995
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:19,240
movement as something other than English words.

996
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:24,240
Very important.

997
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,680
And English word like gait, et cetera.

998
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,880
And it's very helpful.

999
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,040
I just to make a side comment.

1000
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:37,800
I've been told many times by many people who do La Bonn analysis that the phenomenology

1001
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:43,160
of movement that I gave in the phenomenology of dance coincides very, in very complementary

1002
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:47,880
ways with La Bonn analysis.

1003
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:53,880
Thank you.

1004
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,360
Have a question back there, yes?

1005
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:03,400
Yeah, I just make a comment just before you start.

1006
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,880
I like the idea of qualitative differences, of course.

1007
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:13,560
I had early experiences with La Bonn notation as well.

1008
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:21,520
The, actually, I think this, I mean, one needs to be careful about using words.

1009
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:27,720
When I used the word gait, I meant a pattern of coordination between the legs.

1010
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:33,120
If I was looking at a person who had a stroke, I would be looking at the pattern of connectivity

1011
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,120
in their brain.

1012
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,360
I've done that as well.

1013
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:44,720
So the qualitative effects come when the patterns change, right?

1014
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:50,720
Not just smoothly and linearly, as you elegantly say, but qualitatively.

1015
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:57,200
And in fact, the example of an animal changing gait, if you pardon, you know, changing the

1016
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:08,200
ordering among its components, is a qualitative change in the same sense as a physical system,

1017
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:14,040
like water changes from ice to liquid.

1018
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,880
It's a qualitative change.

1019
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,440
There's nothing wrong with the word qualitative.

1020
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:25,320
And it turns out it has many quantitative consequences, important quantitative consequences

1021
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:29,000
for these kinds of changes.

1022
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:37,520
So that's really, you know, let's talk about qualitative effects.

1023
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:43,240
The key thing from a scientific point of view would be the differences on what dimensions.

1024
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:49,760
Let's see.

1025
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,440
Yeah.

1026
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:59,680
But that's precisely, again, here's another dichotomy, qualitative versus quantitative.

1027
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,240
Please don't see those as a dichotomy.

1028
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:08,040
See them as actually complementary and mutually related.

1029
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:13,840
They are indeed, actually, it's quite beautiful.

1030
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:19,680
There are quantitative consequences of qualitative change that can be picked up and used as signatures

1031
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:23,720
for predicting the upcoming change and so on.

1032
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:31,280
And it is our duty, I was going to say, to really try to fathom the way in which they

1033
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,400
are related.

1034
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:38,680
To find the complement, this is a term of Scott's, to find the complementarity between

1035
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:43,120
the two, rather than to keep perseverating on these dual paths.

1036
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:47,320
If I can just very briefly, one very quick thing, and we got to do it, right?

1037
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,280
You are just going to connect to issues you raised.

1038
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:54,880
You raised a one point of paraplegic or people who are not able to move in an able way if

1039
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:55,880
you will, right?

1040
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:00,040
And somebody who has maybe a stroke, right, who finds not able to move the way you would

1041
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,480
like to or like most people, right?

1042
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,800
And I think, in a way, to explore the qualitative aspect of movement or quantitative as well,

1043
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:10,080
is when we look at, for example, we like to think of disabled people.

1044
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,840
And I think to some extent, they move in different ways quite differently.

1045
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:13,840
They experience it differently.

1046
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,960
But yet, I think there are patterns of excellence as well among them.

1047
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:21,040
I have in mind, for example, somebody called Kevin Nichols, who is a skier who doesn't

1048
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,560
have any lower body, no legs, nothing.

1049
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:28,680
But he's got an advantage in the skier's lobes because his liberal gravity is lower,

1050
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,440
he can do things, nobody can do so, nobody can follow him.

1051
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,440
Right?

1052
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,640
So in a way, I think this is a way we might discount.

1053
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:39,160
Well, you look at him and people in the street, he walks in a skateboard where he just goes

1054
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:42,080
like this really fast and people do double takes, right?

1055
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:45,560
He actually takes pictures of people looking at him because they are surprised.

1056
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,160
So he's making the most of it.

1057
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:51,880
But going back to the two of you, I think there are ways to look at deficient movement,

1058
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:52,880
if you will.

1059
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:53,880
That's how we like to qualify it, right?

1060
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:54,880
And we don't really give a negative label.

1061
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:00,360
But I think there are ways to think of it in different categories, which is an alternative

1062
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,520
way to move, that has his own qualities.

1063
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,760
And actually, sometimes you can explain it through advantage.

1064
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:05,760
Okay?

1065
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,560
So I think there are ways or rooms or spaces to open up in terms of exploration that I

1066
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,880
think would enrich how we look at movement in meaningful ways.

1067
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,400
It's very interesting.

1068
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,200
It's very, very interesting.

1069
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:24,280
A concept that hasn't come up here has to do with stability.

1070
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:29,680
And so again, we want to know the stability of what and so on.

1071
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:34,960
But the very interesting thing about qualitative change is that qualitative changes are associated

1072
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,760
with what engineers don't like, which is instabilities.

1073
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,760
Instabilities create new possibilities.

1074
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,280
They create new patterns.

1075
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,600
And that's a key dynamic.

1076
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,560
That's a key part of the dynamics.

1077
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,560
Yes, thank you.

1078
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,800
That was very elegant and interesting.

1079
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,200
Discussion, and this is rather much more mundane.

1080
01:24:55,200 --> 01:25:00,440
But I'm curious to ask, going back to the baby, about infant reflexes, which have an

1081
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:06,200
agency that is deeply buried in the organism for survival, but is certainly not conscious

1082
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,200
because they're reflexes.

1083
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:14,600
And in fact, when they become conscious, we have control over them and basically extinguish

1084
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,600
them.

1085
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:20,800
So I'm wondering if you can talk about infant reflexes, which are movements, which have

1086
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:27,200
an, as I said, a deep intentionality that is not conscious for the survival of the creature.

1087
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,200
And when they become conscious, they actually become extinguished.

1088
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:35,200
Maybe you want to address that.

1089
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,760
More reflex, talking reflex.

1090
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:44,040
Some reflexes, I guess we retain flight flight, but the basic infant reflexes, when they become

1091
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:54,040
mischievous, they become

1092
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,680
conscious, and when they become conscious, we stop them.

1093
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:59,920
That's when they become integrated.

1094
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,920
So I'm wondering if you guys can talk about that.

1095
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:08,720
Do you have any examples of the moral reflex?

1096
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:18,720
I can tell it doesn't make them extinct, it changes its solicitor, if you like.

1097
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:26,880
It's a way of responding, and a baby responds, if you take away support, it responds like

1098
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,360
that.

1099
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:33,960
But then I respond like that, if somebody makes a big, a loud noise behind me, you know, I

1100
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:34,960
go like that.

1101
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:42,560
Well, the integration of the reflexes is when they become conscious and we can control them

1102
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,560
consciously.

1103
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,000
They're reflexes because we have no control over them when we're infants, because they

1104
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,680
help us survive.

1105
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:55,760
But then once they become integrated, we do have the conscious control over them.

1106
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,200
And we essentially then can stop them from being reflexes.

1107
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:06,440
So the idea of agent there is slightly different, and I was wondering if you could talk about

1108
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:08,400
it, because it's not conscious.

1109
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:14,160
The agent of the body to survive is huge when you're in the state of the baby.

1110
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:20,200
But it's not a conscious, conscious agent because it's the reflex.

1111
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:26,040
I would simply say that there's a, it's a bit anecdotal, but there's a beautiful study

1112
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:33,880
by Japanese investigator Kofu Kuda where he shows all these sports examples where the

1113
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:40,160
primitive reflex, the crossed extensor reflexes, all these reflexes are in highly skilled sports

1114
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:44,680
like a baseball player going up for a fly ball.

1115
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:51,200
So it looks as if these quotes reflexes, these basic patterns, these primitive patterns are

1116
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:55,480
actually exploited for in highly skilled behavior.

1117
01:27:55,480 --> 01:28:01,320
The question of consciousness and so on, I can't really speak to, but nevertheless,

1118
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:08,920
I think there's a point with respect to what you say that these basic patterns are a foundation

1119
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:14,600
for all volitional movement and skilled behavior.

1120
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,640
And that's been ignored, I agree.

1121
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:23,120
As a postscript, small postscript, I would just say that neurologically, the first systems

1122
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:31,560
to develop are the, are kinesthesia, which is a totally overlooked sense modality for,

1123
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:38,280
for centuries and tactility, tactility and kinesthesia.

1124
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:43,840
And it seems to me since those are the very first neurological systems to develop that

1125
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:52,440
there has to be some kind of initial consciousness developing with respect to them because fetuses

1126
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:58,320
both have a lot of different movements that they, that they generate by themselves and

1127
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:03,960
there must be some, if their neurological system is developing normally, they have a

1128
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:07,800
sense of their own movement in touch.

1129
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:16,760
So consciousness is, has its, has its origin in tactile kinesthetic, in what I call the

1130
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,560
tactile kinesthetic body.

1131
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,600
I just quick follow up to that, tonight with the issue of agency, very quickly, the example

1132
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,960
you gave of a striker who is with the hand.

1133
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,720
That was the reflex for him.

1134
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:29,560
He knows he's not supposed to be with the hand, but he wants to bail it to score.

1135
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:30,560
The hand goes there, right?

1136
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,160
Or was he knows it's not going to count?

1137
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,200
I mean, he gets away with it, it's like him.

1138
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:38,800
But one thing is just of who is responsible, well, to some extent you could say he's to

1139
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,880
be blamed, he goes by the referee, he doesn't count because you were the agent.

1140
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:46,560
At the same time, we say, well, the arm, he could say, yes, did it, yes, went, I didn't

1141
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:47,720
meant to do it, right?

1142
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:52,320
So there is maybe in the same system, the same agent, there could be maybe a sub-level

1143
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:55,760
or a subconscious run conscious, and I think they tend to flip back and forth or compliment

1144
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,600
sometimes on what's required.

1145
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,320
So I think there is a connection there.

1146
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:04,440
I have a slightly different response to Ed's question, and that is that I would call a

1147
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:11,120
cooperativity that is, you know, obviously it involves coordination and cooperation among

1148
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:21,720
the muscles and the kinesthetic support and so on, but a cooperativity with an effect,

1149
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:28,760
like the evolutionary stable strategy of the two men each with an oar, and which, you

1150
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:34,320
know, the defection scenario, that's cooperation with an effect, and that's where I think the

1151
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:38,160
agency aspect is part of a functional synergy.

1152
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:41,680
It's not a functional synergy if you just have a cooperativity.

1153
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:46,280
It's only a functional synergy if you produce a consequence that is going to have evolutionary

1154
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,280
outcomes.

1155
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,280
Right.

1156
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,280
Yeah.

1157
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,800
First of all, thank you.

1158
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:57,800
I'm completely fascinated and really enjoying all of you.

1159
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:03,760
I'm wondering when you talk about consciousness and the degrees of consciousness, I'm thinking

1160
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:07,320
about agency, excuse me, awareness.

1161
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:13,080
And awareness as the relationship of organism and environment, and then consciousness as

1162
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,160
person-world.

1163
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:22,600
I wonder if you can say something about that, the developing of consciousness from, am

1164
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,600
I clear?

1165
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:31,040
Well, I would say to begin with, and I hope that the others bolster me in this, what I

1166
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:38,040
said, to begin with, this seems to me that the tactile kinesthetic body is basic to the

1167
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,120
beings we are.

1168
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:48,400
In other words, kinesthesia and tactility are basic senses, and we recognize commonly

1169
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:54,960
five senses and disregard our own sense of movement, which is kinesthesia.

1170
01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:00,400
A long time ago, Aristotle looked upon movement as a sense of komunis.

1171
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:06,120
In other words, it was a sense that is common to all the senses, and he elaborated on this

1172
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:13,120
in very fine ways, but he didn't ever speak of our sense of movement, which has to do

1173
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,960
with precisely with the qualitative dynamics.

1174
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:22,440
We know if we're going like this, or if we're going like this, or if we're going in it,

1175
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:27,440
we have a sense of the dynamics, the qualitative dynamics of our own movement.

1176
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:35,200
And when Gibson went on to talk about affordances and about a sense of komunis in terms of vision

1177
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:43,800
and movement, he completely obliterated, to my mind, any real adequate, just minimally

1178
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,760
adequate sense of kinesthesia.

1179
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:53,760
It was all about getting, navigating in the environment, but not really delving into the

1180
01:32:53,760 --> 01:33:00,960
basic kinesthetic awareness we have of our own bodies in movement.

1181
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:07,240
So anything that anyone wants to add to that tear-aid?

1182
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,000
I guess I have a quick follow-up question.

1183
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,480
What you mean by the world, what do you have in mind?

1184
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:14,640
You have in mind the environment, or asking anything with the world?

1185
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,640
Yeah, the environment.

1186
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:19,040
Okay, I guess what I was thinking is just kind of work.

1187
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:24,720
What is biological and what is interpersonal?

1188
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:28,720
And do you think it is in that way?

1189
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,240
Organism and environment sounds biological.

1190
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,240
And organism organism isn't?

1191
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,240
What would be the risk of biology?

1192
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,240
What would be the risk of biology?

1193
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,240
And then there's something else.

1194
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,240
What?

1195
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:47,480
We've been talking about conscious and unconscious and levels of consciousness and reflexes.

1196
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:52,440
But I wanted to share a personal experience I had when I was 13.

1197
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,280
I had an accident.

1198
01:33:54,280 --> 01:34:01,480
I was playing football and I was paralyzed in my right leg for three years.

1199
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,480
And I was in a back brace.

1200
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,480
And I did...

1201
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,480
What?

1202
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:10,280
I was in a back brace for three years as my spine and tailbone had been pulled apart

1203
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:14,960
and a lot of ligaments were torn out and this leg didn't work.

1204
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:19,640
So I remember when the doctor tapped me and there was no reflex response.

1205
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,320
We knew we had a problem.

1206
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:26,640
But I recovered and years later, about 20 years later, I was in a hypnosis class and

1207
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:34,480
we did some age regression and we went back into my trinies and into my teens.

1208
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:39,280
And I talked about experiences from each of those periods.

1209
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:45,320
And then when I hit 15, all of a sudden, my leg was paralyzed again.

1210
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:49,640
It went totally numb and I couldn't move it.

1211
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:55,800
Even though I was in my 30s and the accident that happened in my teens, I re-experienced

1212
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,280
that in a very compelling way.

1213
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:03,040
And then they moved me and I was able to talk about it.

1214
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,960
And part of my mind was able to track it.

1215
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:10,000
My response to this new relationship I was having to this previous injury.

1216
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:16,440
But then they moved me into my, when I was 12, before the accident happened and my leg

1217
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,080
could move again.

1218
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:24,200
So I'm just throwing this out there because it was a fascinating experience for me to

1219
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:26,760
be able to re-live this experience.

1220
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:31,800
Before the accident, my reflexes were working, then the accident happened and there was this

1221
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:36,400
disconnect and the reflexes weren't there.

1222
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:40,560
Then I was healed because I was young enough.

1223
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,680
It was corrected by the back brace.

1224
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:45,880
So the reflexes were there again.

1225
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:52,840
But then as an adult, I could revisit, imaginatively, in a trance state, not having that reflex

1226
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:53,840
response again.

1227
01:35:53,840 --> 01:36:00,240
And I'm wondering how fluid and malleable and dynamic the brain mind world is.

1228
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:06,920
And another question I have, this is just off the top of my head, how can my mind be

1229
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,880
separate from anyone's body, anyone else's body?

1230
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:16,880
I think this is, how could my mind be separate from your body?

1231
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:22,640
I'm curious about that because it seems to me, we talk about brain a lot as something

1232
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:27,960
separate from other brains, brain mind, body, world.

1233
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:30,440
So I hope there's a question there.

1234
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:32,240
I'm just throwing this out there.

1235
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:35,680
So thank you very much for allowing me to share this experience.

1236
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:40,440
Let me walk backwards from when that deal was in how we connect with the world, maybe,

1237
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:41,640
on our minds or our bodies.

1238
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:46,840
I think maybe trying to raise people's mind and body, separate our brain is part of the

1239
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:47,840
problem.

1240
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,160
I think to some extent, we're the each other's language through our bodies, right?

1241
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:58,240
And we respond to each other's behavior, movements, actions in particular ways.

1242
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:02,000
So I think it doesn't extend where you neither come on in future we share a way of moving

1243
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,960
the world and a kind of a spiritual space if you're a human space or with other creatures

1244
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:08,960
that move us well.

1245
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:09,960
And I think it doesn't extend.

1246
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:13,880
We connect with that in a very unconscious way, in a very primeval way of view, until

1247
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,360
we start exploring.

1248
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,680
And I think part of exploring this, one question we came up with over dinner about, we have

1249
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:23,120
to bring up, is different methodologies, disciplines to study movement.

1250
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:28,600
And I think, for example, the episode you relate, I can think from a scientific explanation,

1251
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:32,720
we can have philosophical ones and phenomenology, but I can think also, for example, like analysis

1252
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:38,360
playing a role or even literature to explore different ways of how that's felt.

1253
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:41,880
And I think, you know, when we try to go through those experiences, sometimes most of us are

1254
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:47,160
lacking in what character articulate exactly what does it mean to me or what's the quality

1255
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,160
of it.

1256
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:52,840
And it's developing those tools, those linguistic ability to speak about it and understand it

1257
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,280
after the fact if you will.

1258
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,600
On the one side, see there is movement and it's richness.

1259
01:37:56,600 --> 01:38:01,800
At the same time, I want to understand it, not simply as I move, although I enjoy doing

1260
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,920
that, but also articulate it in different ways.

1261
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:08,720
And I think different methodologies and patterns are needed to, especially with complex things

1262
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:10,280
like your experience.

1263
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,280
Yes, chill.

1264
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:30,960
Very minimal notion of what dance is, but I've been involved in music since I was about

1265
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,560
nine playing the cello.

1266
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:41,760
And I started taking lessons again recently with a 30-something expert and I never liked

1267
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:49,240
to play scales, but now I'm in control of the situation and he teaches what I ask him

1268
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:52,240
about.

1269
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:58,360
And so he said, okay, let's do it.

1270
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:03,680
I mean, he thought I did it, but I avoided it my whole life.

1271
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:09,960
So he said, all right, start on D major, so the first finger on the cello.

1272
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:18,800
And then before you play the next note, hear it and go up the scale.

1273
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:25,200
And no open strings that is, play only notes that require pressure from a digit because

1274
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:29,960
open strings don't train the left hand at all, there's no left hand.

1275
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:34,000
So I did it, I was surprised how in tune, it was in tune.

1276
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,560
And I didn't practice D major scale.

1277
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:44,200
And he says, when the top basketball player shoots for the three pointer, he visualizes

1278
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:49,040
the ball going through the net.

1279
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:56,120
And similar to the tennis player or the golf or the sink, but visualizes the ball rolling

1280
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:58,400
into the hole.

1281
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:03,880
What you're doing, he says, is you're suspending your mental interference.

1282
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:08,480
And your body knows very well, your body's done it a thousand a million times.

1283
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,080
Let your body do it.

1284
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,320
So I assume there's some overlap here.

1285
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:20,320
Very interesting comment, very, yeah, go ahead.

1286
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:34,600
Yeah, well, there's a lot of wisdom in your remarks about how you come back to something

1287
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,840
that you haven't done in the past.

1288
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:43,000
And I think, you know, when we all leave this place, I hope you don't think we're talking

1289
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,320
only about reflexes and stuff.

1290
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:51,600
I mean, we're really talking about generative, creative movement.

1291
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,800
And I think that's really important.

1292
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:58,680
You see what you're talking about in the case of producing an effect in the world in terms

1293
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:05,960
of sound, actually, infants, when they develop to speak, they are doing the same.

1294
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,680
You're producing sounds.

1295
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:12,960
And that is lawfully produced by the way your articulators move.

1296
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:16,800
The way you sense your articulators, where your tongue is, and so on.

1297
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,480
So there's an intimate connection.

1298
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:24,880
And you would, you see, you never really forget how to speak unless you've had some severe

1299
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,640
insult and so on.

1300
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:31,480
So I think it's like that, that these become stabilized.

1301
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:39,720
And how they destabilize then can be part of, you know, producing new sounds as if you would

1302
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:41,720
want to learn a new language, for instance.

1303
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:46,880
There's quite a lot of work again on that, that you're actually building on what you

1304
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:52,560
have and adjusting the dynamics of what you have and the acoustic consequence that those

1305
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:53,560
dynamics produce.

1306
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:57,200
And that's the key aspect, I think.

1307
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:08,120
I would add to that that I think that there is a lot to be said for the imaginative consciousness.

1308
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:12,720
I can describe that in terms of the imaginative consciousness of movement.

1309
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:16,440
But what you're talking about, it seems to me, is on the imaginative consciousness of

1310
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:27,280
sound where what used to be called mental practice actually enhances your performance.

1311
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:32,800
Because the body really does take over and you can, this is an example from movement,

1312
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:37,000
I can remember it from movement classes.

1313
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,200
I would imagine myself going through some kind of movement and I knew that this was wrong

1314
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:45,400
imaginatively, you know I had to do it this way.

1315
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:52,240
I could actually correct myself imaginatively and improve whatever I was doing.

1316
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:59,560
But I think what you're saying is that hearing the sound, letting yourself hear the sound

1317
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:08,960
is really going on your bodily felt sense of the sound, just like the bodily felt sense

1318
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:16,280
of the movement and how it, I don't know whether to use the term dynamics there, but it has

1319
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:21,240
a certain kind of quality, the sound has a certain kind of quality and your body knows

1320
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:27,600
that sound already and how to make it come to the fore, how to create it.

1321
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:31,400
I was speaking of visualizing in Seligulum's leading because we tend to think we simply

1322
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:35,960
matching with our mind side, but when I try to visualize different moves in my sports,

1323
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,000
I actually feel it through my body.

1324
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,120
Yeah, so visualizing in a way throws us off a little bit and trying to think that I can

1325
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:43,600
image and that's what suffices.

1326
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:47,720
So it could be oral, it could be tactile and aesthetic, you know, when I'm trying to think

1327
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:52,520
in the pool how to do certain moves and I visualize it, I do feel this thing in my arms

1328
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:53,800
or the spirit of rivalry, the attention.

1329
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:58,680
So I think there is a richness of interconnection of our senses that we have to pay attention

1330
01:43:58,680 --> 01:43:59,680
to.

1331
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:07,760
It's actually very interesting that if you do have a stroke, for instance, and the person

1332
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:12,360
can only move the left hand, say it's a right hemisphere stroke, something like that, and

1333
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:18,800
you say imagine moving your hands together the way we normally do, and if you really

1334
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:25,680
work at that, actually you can show that there's a degree of recovery of function and there's

1335
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:27,040
published research on that.

1336
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:31,480
And there's also a lot of published research that when you imagine to move, many of the

1337
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:37,440
same neural structures are activated and coordinated.

1338
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,920
So this is not magic.

1339
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:40,920
Oh.

1340
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:47,240
This is clearly articulated.

1341
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:51,160
My question is actually about what you had mentioned about emotions moving through the

1342
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,320
body.

1343
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:58,480
So the movement of a feeling, no, perhaps emotion and feeling are not the same there.

1344
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:09,280
I'm wondering if that's true, then what is the feeling of the movement of a mixed feeling,

1345
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:15,600
like ambivalence or some other sort of maybe that's an emotion?

1346
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:20,000
I was thinking a lot about those sorts of situations because I can envision what you

1347
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,480
talk about and I think I've experienced that as well.

1348
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:26,720
I know what it feels like for joy to move through my body or one of the ways, and I

1349
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:31,920
know what it feels like for sadness to move through my body, but I'm not quite sure how

1350
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:39,680
it feels for bitter sweetness or ambivalence or anything like that.

1351
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,720
I don't know if that makes sense.

1352
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:50,720
Well, you have to maybe engage in some phenomenological methodology and really not on a lazy Sunday

1353
01:45:50,720 --> 01:46:02,600
afternoon, but really this goes into phenomenological analysis, but at least begin by introspecting

1354
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:05,120
as to what your experience actually is.

1355
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:11,080
I mean, when you feel ambivalent about something, what are the tensions that run through your

1356
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:19,040
body, what are the spatial inclinations that you feel to do or not to do?

1357
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:29,400
What is the kind of maybe incipient movements and pauses that you feel inclined toward?

1358
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:35,440
Like there are some kind of temporal aspects to it too.

1359
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:44,360
So if you feel ambivalent, there's a certain kind of ambivalence in terms of changing in

1360
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:51,760
terms of the, that was more or less mentioned in terms of tension, but also in terms of

1361
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:59,200
the way in which you feel impaled toward moving in a certain way spatially or feel more hesitant

1362
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:02,880
or in a slower kind of way.

1363
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:09,640
So in other words, just begin at least by introspecting and seeing.

1364
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:16,760
And actually in a union sense actually too, you went in, I'm not a union analyst at all,

1365
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:23,240
but the whole idea of exploring something through artistic manifestations, you could

1366
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:27,800
even begin by just finding out, just starting moving.

1367
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:29,280
I'm feeling ambivalent.

1368
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:33,320
Do I feel like?

1369
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:37,680
Just to give you something concrete, I'm somebody who is very indecisive.

1370
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:41,320
So Bruce Hehrweiser, Bruce Hehrweiser, I don't know, and I keep going back and forth.

1371
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:44,920
I want to buy, I have money for it in one book and there are two books I really want.

1372
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:48,800
And I'm in the computer screen, I can go back and forth and it's just my body and I feel

1373
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:54,760
this inside of me, physically, this is comfort that pulls me in different ways, that's why

1374
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:55,760
we're speaking that way.

1375
01:47:55,760 --> 01:48:00,720
So pay attention to those feelings, the next time you have to choose maybe a shirt to wear

1376
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:01,720
something like that.

1377
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:02,720
Or something else, right?

1378
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:05,880
You chose to go on for tonight.

1379
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:09,280
So try to think, what was happening, how do I feel right now in introspect?

1380
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:12,200
And there are different methodologies that they take you further, you mentioned phenomenology,

1381
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:15,960
they're more complicated, but by paying attention to that or first trying to see, well, what

1382
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:18,280
is it unique about this experience?

1383
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:21,120
That's also common to somebody else who speaks of the same experience as a beyond decisive.

1384
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,920
This is what I'm feeling, do you feel this way?

1385
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,240
What do you have in common?

1386
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:27,200
It's tried to extrapolate from there as you explore this.

1387
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:30,360
Because I think there's this kind of either our state, which sometimes is great when they

1388
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:33,520
coincide with synergy, sometimes it pulls you apart.

1389
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,760
There's two goals, which one do I want, right?

1390
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,280
It's like, boy, dance donkey, there is hay on both sides and he does restoration.

1391
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:42,920
We have to know which one to eat.

1392
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:44,960
Anyway, I'll eat with that thought.

1393
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:54,200
There is something I think very nice about being in this, in between place that we use

1394
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:57,520
to see it as negative in a way.

1395
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,880
But I think there's also something very enlightened about being in the in between place so that

1396
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:08,320
you can see dispositions, multiple dispositions at the same time.

1397
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,960
And those are synergies in themselves.

1398
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:10,960
Those are synergies.

1399
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:11,960
Those are synergies.

1400
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:13,520
I was just going to say.

1401
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:21,400
I mean, Maxine, one of the first times that we interacted was going back to these gates

1402
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:26,200
and actually I was at Yale at the time we could only study finger movements.

1403
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:32,440
And I discovered a kind of transition between anti-phase and then phase switching one night,

1404
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:37,320
thinking about how can my fingers do the walking, you see?

1405
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:39,080
And analogy again.

1406
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:42,800
And then turning that into a real experiment.

1407
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:50,000
But Maxine wrote once that that kind of gate transition, that kind of phase, it turned out

1408
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,880
that that was a phase transition, a qualitative change.

1409
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:59,320
And you analogized it with the idea itself.

1410
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:02,000
Ideation is a phase transition.

1411
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,240
So you have new things come up.

1412
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:09,360
And that can be actually taken advantage.

1413
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:14,480
You've got co-existing states and then you can create a new thing.

1414
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,080
So it can be positive.

1415
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:23,080
Thank you all very much.

1416
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:28,720
Thank you.

1417
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:43,020
You know,
