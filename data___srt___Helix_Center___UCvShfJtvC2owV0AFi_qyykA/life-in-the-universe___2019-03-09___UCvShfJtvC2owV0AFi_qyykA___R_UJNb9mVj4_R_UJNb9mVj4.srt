1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Which also didn't help.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I didn't realise any of these things.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The wood, right.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Oh, okay.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You're gonna keep us in line.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, what's your...

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Sorry, I'm covering this because it's all...

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's your...

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm gonna say...

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
No problem.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We've heard of the very single response that's said in the moment.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So do you go under my office?

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Very

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm getting more

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and I haven't quite really came yet to go back and forth.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So I'm kind of...

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not formally involved in the online.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's quite a track back and forth between New End.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And so you live in?

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm Ed Nurse-Secian, the Director of the Centre.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Thank you for being here this afternoon.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Before I present the participants in the RAM table,

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'd like to say a couple of words about the upcoming programs.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Our next program is going to be in April.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I think it's April 27th.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's on the Anthropocene about climate change.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
After that, we have a round table in May on shame.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And then in June, early June, I think it's the 7th of June,

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
we have a round table on status.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And we are now working on the round tables for the fall.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We have narrowed down to about five or six objects,

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and they'll be on our website shortly.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I would present the participants alphabetically

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and they can raise their hand, so you know who they are.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And I'm going to be very brief in their bios,

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
as you all have, I think, the printouts.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Kenneth Deal is Professor of Physics and Chemistry

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
at Stony Brook University and Director of the Laufer Centre

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
for Physical Biology.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He helps solve the protein folding problem

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and is interested in the principles of proteins, cell evolution,

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and the early molecular origins of life.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Pre-annataraean, pre-annataraean, I should say, more formally.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He's Professor of Astronomy and Physics at Yale University.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
His research is focused on exotica in the Universe Dark Matter,

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Dark Energy and Black Holes.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
She's noted for her key contributions to two of the most challenging problems

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
in cosmology, mapping the distribution of dark matter

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and tracing the growth history of black holes.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Some of you have maybe gotten hold of what we printed out

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
about a prediction she made that has finally been proven correct.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
She made the prediction 20 years ago when she was a graduate student

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
at Cambridge University.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
She predicted that cosmic winds driven by black hole could potentially

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
carry gas and other star-making materials thousands of years away

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
from their host galaxy.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And apparently now that has been proven correct.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There was some controversy around it, but it has been proven correct.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Dennis Overby, sitting there, is the cosmic of Flair's correspondent

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
for the New York Times.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
His reporting can range from the mating habits of black holes

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and zero-gravity fashion shows to science in the movies,

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
the status of Pluto and the fate of the Universe.

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He's the author of two books, Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos,

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the Story of the Scientific Quest for the Secret of the Universe,

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Award for Nonfiction,

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and Einstein in Love a Scientific Romance.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Caleb Scharff,

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
he's a director of Astrobiology at Columbia University.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
His research career spans cosmology, exoplanetary science,

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and Astrobiology.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He currently leads efforts at Columbia University in New York

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
to understand the nature of exoplanets and living environments in the Universe.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He's also a global science coordinator of the Earth Life Sciences Institute's

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Origins Network at the Tokyo Institute for Technology

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and the co-founder of Y House Inc.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's Y House Inc.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The rent table today was initiated by

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
a communications editor and I had together,

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and he has helped me in the planning of this rent table.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He's professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and an affiliate scientist at the University of Tokyo,

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Tokyo's Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He has carried out extensive astronomical observations

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
at numerous U.S. and international observatories.

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Working in both theoretical and observational astrophysics,

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
he has published more than 250 research papers

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
with concentration on the broad range of topics.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So with that, we can start.

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's what we're talking about.

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Should I start?

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I thought I'd start by talking about

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
the theme of this afternoon is life in the Universe.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I want to mention two aspects that particularly fascinate me.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
First is a recent development,

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
which is the expansion of the code of life as it were,

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
the sort of development of the synthesis of new eight additional four letters

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
in the genetic code synthetically done.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Just reported very recently, just about a month ago,

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and I think Kent can probably elaborate a little bit more on

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
what the implications are, but the implications are just astounding

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
because these additional four constituents,

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
in our DNA we have GCA and T,

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and these expansion of those four to eight,

108
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
just combinatorially sort of increases the number of ways

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
in which you could possibly create life

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and broaden the definition of what life really is.

111
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So I found that very, very new development, very exciting to read.

112
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So I don't actually work on astrobiology myself,

113
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
but I regard myself as someone who takes a lot of intellectual risks

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and is sort of bold.

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So I thought a lot about the ways in which our conceptions of what life is,

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and therefore its probability of occurring as we know it,

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
similar to us, I think we've limited our possibilities.

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And I think we should open up our imaginations

119
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
to really speculate about sort of wild other forms of life.

120
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And I think in the past, historically people have been bolder

121
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
than we have been,

122
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and I sort of invite us to think more broadly about what could be life.

123
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And the second point I sort of wanted to make was about a new way

124
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
to think about what really life is,

125
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and thinking about life and intelligent life.

126
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So these have been debates in the field across disciplines.

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Maybe think about life not just as the possibility for self-replication

128
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and so on, but also think about it more broadly

129
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
so that we can bring in the concept of intelligent life

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
as the ability to produce information

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and the period for which that information could last.

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So we could think about how advanced a civilization is, for example,

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
because these are going to come up when we talk about how we assess

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
whether we can have intelligent life elsewhere.

135
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And I think there's a way, you know, if you look at the amount of information

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
that's...

137
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Whoops.

138
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's just you in the past.

139
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I can hear the past!

140
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, we'll see you in the past.

141
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So I think if we, you know, I'd like to think about,

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
so if you look at DNA and how much information there is, right,

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and we look at all the information in the books

144
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and the knowledge that we've created, we actually quantify that,

145
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I think this capacity to generate

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
information that is multifold, so in our case

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
it's about, you know, 500,000 to a million times, more than the material,

148
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the information that constitutes us. That could be a new way of thinking about

149
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
intelligence.

150
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll just stop that.

151
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm going to take a look at my book.

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm going to say about it.

153
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I actually wanted to jump in.

154
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So you brought it up and I think it's really interesting and I'm curious to get

155
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
people's reactions. This new piece of work, I think it was Steve Benner and his group,

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
who constructed essentially DNA

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
with eight letters, if you will, eight base pairs

158
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
rather than in the alphabet rather than four.

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You know, I think it's clearly a

160
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
wonderful technical piece of work, but I have some questions about it

161
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
and I'm wondering if anyone else has some thoughts on this.

162
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So it seems to me it's a proof of possibility, but it's not a proof of existence.

163
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And part of the reason I think it's not proof of existence

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
by any stretch of imagination is it's one thing to manufacture

165
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
a set of molecules that do something

166
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
seemingly more than the naturally evolved set of molecules,

167
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
the DNA, but that doesn't tell you that

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
an organism could have evolved somewhere that utilizes

169
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
eight base pairs because of the burden that comes with that.

170
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I assume I'm looking at you because you may have a

171
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
response to this. You know, to make use

172
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
of eight letters in your code

173
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
means you have to have a set of machinery,

174
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
a molecular machinery that isn't overly

175
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
burdened by the energetic demands of suddenly having to

176
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
do what is that, how do you feel about that? I agree. I think where

177
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
these new bases are going to be of value as drug discovery

178
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
is they're going to give us better handles on being able to go after DNA

179
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and go after the proteins that they make. I don't think it's going to tell us very much

180
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
about what life could have done for the following reason

181
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
that what living systems now use is 20 amino acids

182
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and so there's this 64 option code

183
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
at the moment genetic code and as you say there's costs

184
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
too. On the one hand there's combinatorics and that's an advantage because it gives you a new space

185
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
of what options could I have and yet biology

186
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
settled on essentially 20, a few others, but essentially

187
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
20 amino acids and as you say there are costs, there are fitness costs to everything

188
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and one of the things that you see, especially in bacteria, over time

189
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
is they really strip down their genomes and they strip down

190
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
their machinery to be just as efficient as they possibly can

191
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and so if a 40 letter, if 40 amino acids were a good idea

192
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I think we would see it and we don't and I think the reason

193
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
for that is because diversity, chemical diversity, is the thing

194
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
that's so powerful in proteins that you don't have in nucleic acids

195
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
chemical diversity right now with the 20 amino acids

196
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
we have plus charge, minus charge, hydrophobic interactions, salt

197
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
bridges, hydrogen bonding, we cover the whole spectrum of

198
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
the kinds of things you want to do as a chemist. It covers all the

199
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
kinds of little pieces of molecule that you want to

200
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
catalyst chemical. With this contingent on the environment and what

201
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
is available, so we're talking about earth like conditions right so

202
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I was just arguing for the possibility of imagination

203
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
with these right now I'm not necessarily

204
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
a realistic rubric for how you would make life but isn't everything

205
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
contingent, the ways in which things have evolved are contingent on

206
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
the base conditions that were available on earth.

207
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So you could imagine, you can argue yes or no, I mean there's a lot

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
of things that you can do but there's this classic comment

209
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
that nothing in biology can be understood except in the light of evolution

210
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and that's sort of the point of view of I need to know the history of

211
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
something in order to know how it works. On the other hand, it's much more like

212
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
a sort of thermodynamics problem. Once you know the environment, you can

213
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
specify what the thing is, what the biological thing is, think about an eyeball

214
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't need to know where it came from but it's really really optimized

215
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
to do the job that it does. It sees very well, you can see over nine orders of magnitude

216
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
of light intensity between night and day and so forth, really really

217
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
optimized and they don't have to know a lot about the history to know about this.

218
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
One point coming back to your point though also about polymers is

219
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
that not only the DNA but also in proteins now, there's new diversity

220
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and a colleague in California

221
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
has developed these molecules called peptoids

222
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
it's a different kind of molecule than a peptide, different kind of molecule than a protein

223
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and so it has different kinds of monomer units but they're kind of similar

224
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
in certain ways and it turns out they do a lot of the same

225
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
kinds of things that real proteins do so in principle,

226
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
life could have gone that way too, it could have gone a lot of ways

227
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and why it ended up where it did, I don't know.

228
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
If I could say I think that your first point about the

229
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
new letters in the column sort of highlights one of

230
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
the trade-offs or horns of a dilemma that

231
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
our basic genetic code already presents this with

232
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
one of the most amazing things about biology is the

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
incredible diversity of life forms we have

234
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
on our, well we say from giants, the koi is to

235
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
single-celled organisms

236
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
of a huge variety of sorts, the complicated organism, mammals

237
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and things like us, you know, you name it, it's hard to even think about

238
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
the huge diversity of things yet they all have the same

239
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
genetic code in operation, well why is that possible?

240
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's like, it's the same reason you can write a huge variety of books or novels

241
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
using the letters of the alphabet, you've bought into this

242
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
combinatoric world where a finite number of

243
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
things let you do a huge variety of things, so you can

244
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
write a novel that makes you a giant sequoia tree or you can write a novel that

245
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
makes you a fungus and you can do it all with the same

246
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
alphabets and you're adding a few letters to the alphabet as it were,

247
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
but the other side of that, you know, and when we first

248
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
discovered, when it was first discovered that these monomers

249
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
make up the polymers, the letters of the alphabet can be synthesized

250
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
in natural environments fairly readily and probably

251
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
occur, we know it, in fact, occur in many places in nature,

252
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
made everyone feel very optimistic about the topic

253
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
today, life in the universe, there would be life elsewhere, where we could easily

254
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
imagine they have the same alphabet in many places in the universe,

255
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
but then the other horn of that dilemma is it becomes like

256
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
monkeys typing Shakespearean sonnets, you have, you know, there's so many ways of putting these letters to

257
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
gather, the chance that blind

258
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
processes, before you get evolution started,

259
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
which selects certain things, that blind

260
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
processes will write you a experience on it or a

261
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
novel or something, starts getting smaller and smaller, and

262
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
personally, if, you know, it was somehow revealed to us

263
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
that there was no non-terrestrial life anywhere in the observable universe,

264
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
if it was just dead, dead, dead out there everywhere, and then

265
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I had to make a guess at why, my guess would be that this is

266
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
the only place where the monkeys managed to put together a sonnet, and everywhere else

267
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
they wrote nonsense, and life never got started,

268
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm not saying that the case, I'm just saying that

269
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
would be my best guess as a possibility, adding some letters to the alphabet

270
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
doesn't help that problem, in fact it makes it worse, that's

271
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
extra keys the monkeys could hit on the keyboard,

272
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and, you know, change a word into some... Well, this nonsense and what a Shakespeare

273
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
is defined by us and our culture, you could have a culture

274
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
that defines what we call nonsense, is valuable.

275
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Well, it could be that there, in fact I think it's more likely, in fact, that if there's

276
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
something else out there, it's quite different from us. Exactly. But

277
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
it still has to be something that works, you know,

278
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
that reproduces itself, or that at least persists, even if it doesn't reproduce.

279
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So I think that's these new codes sort of

280
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
add to that, that, uh,

281
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
trade-off that we face. I like the idea of

282
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
nonsense being valued, or sort of, I mean, but then of course, you know, how do you

283
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
define nonsense? Is it just randomness? It's seen as...

284
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This is drifting into the question about intelligence and other things, but

285
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I really like that. I really like that. How do you...

286
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
How do we generate systems as

287
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
a people's of what is considered valuable?

288
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So it goes into other... But I sort of close out with the eyeballs.

289
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I mean, do you think that, do you not reckon that our eyeballs,

290
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
like a set of eyeballs, let's forget about ours, could have evolved

291
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
very differently in a methane-rich atmosphere?

292
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And if our atmosphere did not have the diffractive properties that it did,

293
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
that provided the basis for

294
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
our eyeballs to have the range, and they optimized for that, right?

295
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So could you contemplate that you could have

296
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
eyeballs that are optimized for methane-rich?

297
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Absolutely. What I would say is, the argument I meant to make before

298
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
is that I don't need to know the history, but I certainly need to know the environment.

299
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And that's really what Darwin's all about. It's a matching to an environment.

300
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And so if you... Environment is totally different. Let's say it's black and dark

301
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
like at the bottom of the ocean, then eyeballs wouldn't make any sense at all. I would spend a lot

302
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
of energy on stuff that wouldn't be relevant. But if you...

303
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The history... So this issue of eyeballs versus not eyeballs has

304
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
also come up a lot in sort of evolution and intelligent design

305
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
debates of, it's a complex system, and how could you get a

306
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
complex system unless there were some hand in the making of it all and so forth?

307
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But if you look at the history of the

308
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
sort of early organisms like snails and mollusks and so on,

309
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
what you see is a pretty nice story, whether it's true or not, we never know.

310
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But it's a nice story, and that is that in the earliest mollusks,

311
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
what you see is a flat row of cells where some of them

312
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
are a little bit more light sensitive. And that gives you some

313
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
value. Then if you go further down the evolutionary

314
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
tree, what you see is it's curved a little bit. That row of cells is now not flat anymore,

315
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
it's curved, and in that way it turns out you can collect light.

316
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Then you get a pinhole, you keep going further down the tree, you get a pinhole, then you get a

317
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
lens, then you get a complicated eye. So you can sort of see what's going on here.

318
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's detecting light, and it's trying to get finer and finer resolution in that

319
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
way. But I totally agree with you. I think

320
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
biologists often speak of genotype to phenotype,

321
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
which means our DNA tells everything, but it's missing

322
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
one major thing, and that is what's the environment that we're optimized for.

323
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Just to not to, I mean, because it's such a specific example, but

324
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I think this is true that the camera eye that we share with

325
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Saffler Pods, it's actually evolved in marine environments.

326
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So it's kind of like your methane environment, it already evolved

327
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
in a different environment, and now actually with the adaptation

328
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
of that, because we're walking around on the cinephus.

329
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Right.

330
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
At one point coming back to your point, Ed, about the combinatorics.

331
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
There's been a lot of interest in these combinatorics

332
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
arguments. Some having to do with my direct

333
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
area, which is protein-fed, and they also have many degrees of freedom,

334
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
how does the protein find the right structure in a reasonable time?

335
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It does so. When proteins fold up in microseconds in your body,

336
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
it's clearly the protein has no sense to do all this stuff.

337
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But the question you raise a sequence based, very interesting one, I think,

338
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
because the arguments are, if I have 20 different amino acids

339
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
that are making an HV on an necklace of a protein

340
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
molecule, what is the likelihood that I would

341
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
be able to get exactly the right string of beads that would code for one of your

342
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
favorite proteins, let's say, lysosine. Typical protein is 100

343
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
or 1000 amino acids long, and if I have 20 possible

344
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
options in each position, I have 20 to the 100

345
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
is the size of the space that I would have to explore in order

346
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
to find that one protein. And so the issue

347
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
is, gee, that's essentially impossible. Probabilities 0, 1 over

348
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
20 to the 100 is 10 to the minus 130. That would never

349
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
happen. And over the years what we've found though

350
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
is that what matters is mechanism. And so it's very much

351
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
in the monkey on a typewriter analogy. It's very much

352
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
the monkey's hitting each key independently as random, but if the monkey was

353
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
hitting keys in some poorly the way, it turns out you could do very

354
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
very much better very quickly. And in the protein case, looking at protein

355
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
sequences, how do I get lysosine? The critical question

356
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
between those who think probability is 0 and people who say

357
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
no, it could happen. The critical issue is

358
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
how do we ask the probability question? What is the probability

359
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
of getting the sequence of lysosine? That's one question? Or

360
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
what is the probability of getting any sequence that folds to the structure

361
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
of lysosine? They seem very similar, but they're 100 orders

362
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
of magnitude different in the answer that you get. And so

363
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
mechanism-wise, what's been found is that yes

364
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
we have a 20-letter code today. We have 20 amino acids that could go here or here

365
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
or here. But what's relevant for figuring out

366
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
how the protein folds and then how it functions is just a binary

367
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
code. It's some amino acids, half the amino acids are oily

368
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and they don't like water so they belong together and the other half are not so

369
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
oily. So you have blue and red beads instead of 20 different types of

370
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
beads. So if I have 2 to the 100 and 20 to the 100,

371
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
already I've just disappeared 100 orders of magnitude

372
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
of the problem right there. And there's now some experience that indicate

373
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
that something like that is roughly right. I mean it seems to me

374
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
again on our question of life at the universe that there's

375
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
sort of two basic possibilities and

376
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
places in between them. But at the extreme it's that the monkeys

377
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
are completely random. And at the other extreme there's some

378
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
deterministic sequence of chemical reactions

379
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
that puts together just the molecules that

380
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
we need to get life started, which sort of sounds

381
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
scary in a way because it means life scary and

382
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
from a sort of scientist point of view and that it somehow would imply that the

383
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
existence of life was built into the basic laws of chemistry

384
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
and physics. If that were the case though

385
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
then we would very likely I think have tons of life out there in the universe

386
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
because it looks like there we have tons of environments.

387
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I mean 20, 25 years ago we couldn't have, but we didn't know

388
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
anything much about exoplanets. It could have done there was no life because there was

389
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
no one suitable environment but we're pretty sure there are plenty of suitable

390
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
environments. So if it's a deterministic process you know we're off to

391
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
a Star Wars universe so to speak. Where every planet has

392
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
something interesting going on from biology point to many planets.

393
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Of course it could also be somewhere in between where there's

394
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
many you know it's just like the monkeys don't have to type exactly

395
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
that song that there are many song that's that could have been written and maybe there's enough of them

396
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
that it's fairly common. But you know between those

397
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
two extremes you get an empty universe or a full universe

398
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
and I think based on what we know now and I'm no biologist

399
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm sure you know better but it's at least conceivable that it's sort of

400
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
anywhere in between life could be quite common

401
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
you know slightly common quite rare. It's

402
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
very important in science to keep track of what you don't know and I think

403
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
despite the fact that I think popular belief is that there's probably quite a bit of life

404
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
in the universe and there's certainly a lot of popular

405
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
interest in that Dennis may be able to say more about that than the rest of us

406
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
but you know it's we really don't know the answer

407
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I would say at this point. Right there's a lot of room between the impossible and the inevitable

408
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
and I think if you're setting that simply better than that.

409
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And I think in in chemistry and biology for example

410
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
a lot of the issue is how long does it take

411
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
so things that can be pretty close to the impossible

412
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and can still happen if you have enough little agents

413
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and this is one of the great things about biology is you have cells everywhere and bacteria everywhere

414
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
organisms everywhere and so in Darwinian

415
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
processes it also matters just how many attempts you're making and if you just

416
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
got a huge population and you've got a long enough time

417
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
you can sooner or later get there and I mean like

418
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I don't think it was supposed to inevitable because it certainly took a

419
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
long time to develop it here on earth as far as anybody can tell

420
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I guess you all mean no better than I do but it seems like it was about four billion years ago.

421
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It depends on what your clock is with much shorter and much longer.

422
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
If you start with Earth being about four billion years old

423
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
we have like five three point five billion

424
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
single cells and then another billion later we had multi cells

425
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and so on. He takes that half a billion years is not

426
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
quick I think so it's clearly not something that just happens

427
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
like instantly I think. Especially since there's a selection effect

428
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
we had to be on one of the planets where it happened otherwise we wouldn't be here

429
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
right.

430
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I think we've said that half a billion years doesn't sound like such a short

431
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,000
time. Think about cosmology.

432
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Well one question I have is what would it take

433
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
anybody here to convince anybody here that they had

434
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
found life someplace else. I mean how hostage

435
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
are we to the our conceptions of it

436
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
that we have? I mean how would you know what signal from

437
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
another actual planet would actually convince you they were generally there.

438
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I mean this is something that a lot of discussion has taken place

439
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
in recent years and it's interesting just you're looking at

440
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
how different scientific disciplines approach this. So for example

441
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
astronomers who are looking at exoplanets and hoping in the near

442
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
future to be able to get slightly more sophisticated data about planets

443
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
that may or may not resemble the Earth tend to talk about bio signatures

444
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
but often just yeah so

445
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
bio signatures covers a number of things so one potential bio signature is

446
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
what life might do to the chemistry of a planet in particular

447
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
the atmosphere.

448
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And so the idea is with future telescopes we may be able to

449
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
probe using light filtered through the atmospheres of those planets we may

450
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
be able to see whether there are things like oxygen or water, CO2,

451
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
or the conceivable even methane and so on all of which we

452
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
think may have an association with biosphere based largely on what's happening

453
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
here on Earth. So that's a very simplistic

454
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
approach though and already even before we've done it

455
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
we're sort of running into problems with it. So for example

456
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
in the last couple of years a planetary scientist

457
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and astronomers who are interested in this question have begun to recognize

458
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
that you could actually have in a number of circumstances a rocky planet

459
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
that has an oxygenated atmosphere but no life. The oxygen

460
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
comes from combination of chemistry that happens in

461
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
the atmosphere itself the breakdown of molecules like water or CO2

462
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
by ultraviolet photons and depending on the kind of surface chemistry

463
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
you have that may or may not get mocked up by the surface of the planet

464
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
so you can actually produce a planet with an oxygen rich atmosphere

465
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
with no biosphere whatsoever. So then of course you say well

466
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
you've got to look for the other signature molecules and build up a story

467
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and so that's a, you know, I think that's a very

468
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
sound terrible because I'm an astronomer it's a naive way of doing things

469
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I think part of what you're asking is a much deeper question

470
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
which is perhaps more relevant to looking for life on Mars for example

471
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,840
and that's been a topic of discussion. You know the ideal thing would be something

472
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,840
to crawl past your microscope and wave at you and

473
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,840
look familiar. Oh, Shakespeare. That would be

474
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,840
quite a thing if it was dragging a

475
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,840
typewriter and I'm going to give it a...

476
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,840
and then yeah so then there's all this discussion, you know, it comes back to

477
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,840
actually something you raise which is what is life and

478
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,840
maybe you disagree with this but my impression after talking to lots of people over the last

479
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,840
few years about this is within science there's a hundred different

480
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,840
definitions that people point to as their sort of favorite

481
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,840
way of encapsulating the idea of this thing we call living system

482
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,840
some people point to reproduction or you know imperfect

483
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,840
reproduction right in order to have Darwinian selection or

484
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,840
metabolism or entropy as some gauge of what's going

485
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,840
on and it's... I mean actually I'd be interested

486
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,840
to hear people's thoughts on why it's difficult to

487
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,840
come up with that answer you know because it speaks

488
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,840
directly to recognizing life. Yeah. We think that we're alive

489
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,840
I mean I think I know that. I could be wrong.

490
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Well people sometimes say you know the huge fundamental human question

491
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,840
that astrobiology abresses is are we alone

492
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,840
but I think the number two question almost is important

493
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,840
is how different or alike if we're not alone

494
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,840
how you know are we unusual or not

495
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,840
and I think that question

496
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,840
the first question I would say is even easier because we could search

497
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,840
but until we find something the second question is really impossible it's as though you wanted to

498
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,840
study I don't know dogs and you've only ever seen one dog

499
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,840
and so then you don't know

500
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,840
what properties this dog has

501
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,840
or specific to that individual dog or to that breed of dogs

502
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,840
or to dogs in general and you know you're just lost

503
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,840
Yeah it's hard to extract dogmas

504
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,840
especially without a fundamental

505
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,840
first principles understanding you know like biology is like

506
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,840
that's a dog and modern biology is like that's a dog's genome

507
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,840
but we're not you know at the level of being able to answer

508
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,840
questions of like defining life at a fundamental level

509
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:38,320
it's a little like my colleagues Chris Trig

510
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,320
natural philosophers as they were called in those days are alchemist

511
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,320
argued about what water is what makes something water

512
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,320
is it that you can drink it is it that does all things is that it can

513
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:55,320
freeze and boil and to steam and there were even Leonardo argued about what makes something

514
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,320
water or not water and there were arguments that

515
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:05,320
then you had to make sulfuric acid some thought that was a pure reform of water than seawater

516
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,320
because it dissolves things much better than seawater seawater is almost saturated already

517
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,320
with dissolved minerals so it's hard to dissolve things and

518
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,320
you know when the atomic theory of matter came along we have H2O the

519
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,320
discussion was over and new water was

520
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,320
so if we could ever have a discussion of I mean an understanding of life

521
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,320
at that sort of first principles level then we would be in a lot

522
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,320
better position to talk about how to look for it and what

523
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,320
would demonstrate it's there but I very much agree with Caleb that

524
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,320
discussions of detecting life on exoplanet these days

525
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,320
are well whistling in the dark hopeful let's say

526
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,320
but you know it's it looks like it will be really

527
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,320
hard I think it's very would be very difficult to do it with spectroscopy

528
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,320
I think chemical definitions and even basic biochemical

529
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,320
definitions are very tricky one of the classic

530
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,320
sort of disproves of simple arguments about what is life is

531
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,320
metabolizes uses oxygen reproduces and it turns out a candle flame

532
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,320
does that and then we're going to run into problems now with

533
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,320
artificial intelligence what's real and what's alive and what's not alive

534
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,320
I think you know if you think about people there's something

535
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,320
in cells for that matter there's something about purposeful behaviors but I don't

536
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,320
know any spectroscopic way you're ever going to see something like that

537
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,320
well people have talked about looking for pollution industrial pollution

538
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,320
quite quite seriously compounds that we cannot think

539
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,320
of any non-biologic that sorry we cannot think of any

540
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,320
non-biological way to produce it however intelligence

541
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,320
unfortunately even that turns out nature is really good at making things

542
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,320
that are unexpected so I recently heard a discussion so

543
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,320
chlorofluorocarbons have been held up as one example of

544
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,320
a technologically produced compound that has a definite

545
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,320
impact on a planetary environment by removing ozone in the atmosphere

546
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,320
but I recently heard work done people actually studying Earth's

547
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,320
deep past there's this giant volcanic

548
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,320
lava system called the deck and traps and realizing

549
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,320
that there's a geophysical geochemical root by which

550
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,320
could have produced chlorofluorocarbons all by itself you know 200 million years ago

551
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,320
without well without yeah without the intervention of intelligent

552
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,320
life so maybe pollutants aren't even a particularly

553
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,320
mature of any kind of life planets are quite good at polluting themselves

554
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,320
so I feel that we're not ever going to converge on one I think it's

555
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,320
all going to be as simple as H2O I think it's

556
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,320
well probably there'll probably be many different definitions of life

557
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,320
and maybe what we'll be looking for is some kind of Venn diagram

558
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,320
to kind of make the decision of okay is this

559
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,320
actually life but kind of as I started out in the beginning

560
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,320
you're sort of your thread of trying to define

561
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,320
intelligent life in terms of

562
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,320
information production and the

563
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,320
persistence of...

564
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,320
yeah and it also I mean it does relate to this question of looking for life

565
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,320
in the universe I mean rather ironically right if you found a planet that was

566
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,320
beaming out radio structured radio signatures on a TV show

567
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,320
you definitely know there's life there right we wouldn't we wouldn't be in the show

568
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,320
it would depend on the show and the channel

569
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,320
so I mean then for that reason just to mention

570
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,320
within my field there has been a growing interest in

571
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,320
resuscitation of this field of SETI of search extraterrestrial

572
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,320
intelligence although now we call it techno signatures because that's less of a trigger word for

573
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:58,840
the you know people's memories of what were thought to be failures in the past but actually

574
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,840
part of the issue with the search extraterrestrial intelligence is

575
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,840
we've looked so little we really have looked so little but you know that's the remarkable thing is if you got that

576
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,840
you would definitely unambiguously I think be able to say

577
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:18,840
that there was recognizable life on a planet and that fits into this question of yes you know the nature of

578
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,840
intelligent life and the information that we carry

579
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,840
around externally to it I mean humans are pretty peculiar

580
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,840
in that respect you know we carry around and propagate into

581
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:36,840
the future throughout human history back to the first you know the first exchange of a story around a campfire

582
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:44,840
Torquevard, where the cave art, Dawkins would call it you know memes, the generation of memes and those

583
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,840
their propagation but I think it's even more diverse than that

584
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,840
that is an interesting quality that we have

585
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:58,840
and of course it also but it's conferred great evolutionary advantages to us

586
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:04,840
you can write a book about you know don't eat this plant because it will kill you

587
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,840
and a hundred years later someone will read that book and it will save their life

588
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,840
so there's a certain advantage to be able to store this information

589
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,840
but it comes at a cost there's an energetic burden to it

590
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:24,840
so what is the current status of the SETI like funding and programs

591
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,840
I mean I know that in the 1980s it was federally funded

592
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
it died in the 1990s

593
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,840
what is the status?

594
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,840
Dennis do you want to say something?

595
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:40,840
I don't think there's ever since I think 1992 when

596
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,840
they pulled the plug on SETI but there's been any federal funding

597
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
for actual radio searches

598
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,840
but there was private funding?

599
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,840
there's private funding, there's this SETI Institute which was

600
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,840
do all the SETI scientists said okay we're going to raise our own money

601
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,840
and they're quite successful and they you know Paul Allen built this

602
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,840
big array of radio tales for them in Northern California

603
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,840
and now they have Yuri Milner who's like spending

604
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:14,840
$2 leasing telescopes and wants to send an iPhone to Alpha Centauri

605
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,840
which is an amazing idea but

606
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,840
8 is involved in that.

607
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
Yeah, big idea lies in the morning of the Breakthrough Initiative

608
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,840
such as the iPhone to the Stars Project I should say

609
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,840
the Breakthrough Foundation which is Yuri Milner's Foundation funding of SETI

610
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:36,840
is a separate initiative of both the connection to some of the people in life

611
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,840
and is spending $100 million over 10 years

612
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,840
which I think is the current rate of spending on SETI

613
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,840
and it's basically a classical radio SETI looking for

614
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,840
signals from radio signals that I'll

615
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,840
buy Q2 to extraterrestrial civilization is probably the highest rate of

616
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,840
spending on SETI that we have ever had in history

617
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,840
and is in the design of that experiment is to

618
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,840
what Kayla mentioned that we hadn't looked very much.

619
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,840
The goal of that is called Breakthrough Listen

620
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,840
everything is called Breakthrough Something in that world.

621
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:20,840
So Breakthrough Listen's goal is to expand the volume of face-space frequencies

622
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,840
and sensitivities and so on by about a factor of a thousand over what's been done before

623
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:30,840
so however little we have looked so far the goal is to look a thousand times more

624
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,840
by the time this is done it started a few years ago so

625
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,840
I don't remember exactly when we probably have another six or seven years before

626
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,840
the project.

627
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,840
And a lot of people were...

628
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,840
But that's still a tiny fraction of the galaxy even when they've...

629
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,840
Right.

630
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,840
You can look on that housing amplification.

631
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,840
Yeah that's certainly true. It is very hard to prove something isn't there.

632
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,840
Almost no matter how much you've looked you could

633
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:04,840
always look much more because you can look for arbitrarily small

634
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,840
signals you can look at different wavelengths.

635
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,840
I don't think I'll be talking too much out of school to say that you really ask me for advice

636
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:15,840
on how to spend money on a steady search

637
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,840
and I should imagine that he took none of my advice

638
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,840
which is probably why he has so much advice.

639
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:28,840
But there's a lot of possible ways of looking that are not just searching for radio signals.

640
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,840
Right it's still very anthropocentric right I want to come back to that so

641
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,840
I remember mentioning to Keilemun Mime last time that there's a book

642
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,840
written in 1864 by Camille Flamiro.

643
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,840
It's called Lumen and it's imaginative.

644
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,840
It's about a planet where you have sentient plants

645
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,840
that digest and eat and breathe and speak to each other

646
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,840
in a tongue that we wouldn't understand.

647
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:58,840
So I mean all these ideas were looking for radio signals

648
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,840
very tied to very anthropomorphic view of life.

649
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,840
So how do we expand?

650
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,840
Well I think, yeah no so you're absolutely right and it's also extremely skewed

651
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,840
in terms of you think about the history of life on earth.

652
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:19,840
For most of the history of life on earth there would be no techno signatures whatsoever.

653
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,840
It would all be chemistry or colours or other variations on the planet.

654
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:30,840
So in that sense it's already almost stacking the odds against it.

655
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:37,840
If our planet is in some way representative of how evolution plays out

656
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,840
we obviously don't know that.

657
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,840
The fact that technological beings have only existed for maybe the last 100,000 years

658
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,840
we have really no idea whether that's the norm

659
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,840
or whether that's some extreme.

660
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,840
So I think you're absolutely right and this is one of the

661
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,840
in that whole field.

662
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,840
It's very very challenging as well.

663
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:10,840
People always I think fall into the trap of the well a species would do this wouldn't it?

664
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:16,840
Which is completely skewed towards our own and it's usually skewed to

665
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,840
you know Western European ways of thinking about the world anyway.

666
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,840
And that is problematic and I'm not sure we...

667
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,840
Well it's limiting, it's severely limiting.

668
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,840
Incredibly limiting.

669
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:35,840
But the problem with not doing that, you know it's like the old things looking for your keys

670
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,840
under the light post.

671
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,840
If you don't look for something that's like us, you don't know, you know,

672
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,840
Yogi Berra said if you don't know where you're going you may not get there.

673
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,840
You may not find it.

674
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:52,840
And I think we've seen a recent example of that in discussions of the interstellar small body

675
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:58,840
that passed through the solar system back in late 2017.

676
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Um, the name was given.

677
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:10,840
It has a number of puzzling properties and the idea has been put forward that it was some piece of alien

678
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:18,840
artifact, you know, some sort of spacecraft or space debris of some interstellar

679
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,840
traveling culture.

680
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,840
And I mean it couldn't be but the problem with the hypothesis like that,

681
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,840
the problem of just looking for a civilization that's not like us,

682
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,840
is that it has too much explanatory and not excessive explanatory and insufficient

683
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,840
predictive power.

684
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,840
You can explain anything and predict nothing.

685
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,840
Because we know nothing about their capabilities or motives and, you know,

686
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,840
no matter what happens you could always say, well that's because the aliens wanted to do this

687
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,840
or wanted to fool us or do something.

688
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:57,840
And, you know, it could be but it's very hard to engage that hypothesis in a scientific way.

689
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,840
It doesn't mean it isn't true but it's just hard to do anything with it.

690
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:06,840
I mean I think the one positive thing about, for example, the Umu Amua work and particularly

691
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,840
some of these interpretations or analyses that suggest,

692
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,840
maybe it was a, you know, a solar sail or a light sail or something like that.

693
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:21,840
The one positive element of all of that discussion I think is that, you know,

694
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:27,840
sort of in Bayesian terms, instead of setting the prior to zero possibility that something

695
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:33,840
unusual might have a relationship to intelligence or others be, to give it a little leeway.

696
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:39,840
You know, it's not zero. It's not one. It's some tiny, tiny number.

697
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,840
And that to me is very interesting because we haven't really done that before, right?

698
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,840
We've tended to say, well, that's such, we just don't think that's going to be a good

699
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,840
possibility, which it comes means, again, if you never look, if you never allow it to be one

700
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,840
of the possibilities you'll never see it if it actually shows up.

701
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,840
So that's the one positive I think came out of that.

702
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,840
I'm very sinned and fledding.

703
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,840
I mean, one for all for speculation and, you know, playing with one's imagination

704
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,840
and expanding the possibilities, right?

705
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:18,840
So one other thing that's always kind of puzzled me is, you know,

706
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,840
Stephen G. Gould has famously said that, you know, if we rewind the tape of evolution on Earth,

707
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,840
you might not end up with us, right?

708
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:35,840
So this, the role of randomness in evolution, is there anything more?

709
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,840
We can milk, I'm just saying, well, those random sort of circumstances.

710
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:48,840
Is there, are there people doing experiments like if one, something along the sequence

711
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,840
that we now understand quite well was different, what could we end up with?

712
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,840
Are there simulations curious of...

713
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:03,840
So I think one thing that is becoming clear now, especially in cell experiments,

714
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,840
where you can replay the tape, you can keep running it, take the same set of cells,

715
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,840
you can do all this in the laboratory.

716
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,840
It's not like watching zebras over, you know, thousands of years and so on.

717
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:19,840
And that's a very big focus these days of evolutionary studies as well,

718
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,840
because you can work so quickly and see so much.

719
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,840
And the answer there seems to be, replaying the tape,

720
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:31,840
gives you whatever answer you should get based on the environment you end up in.

721
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:37,840
So as opposed to saying, I can tell you exactly the root this took, usually you can't do that,

722
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,840
but you can say, if you're ending up in an environment that has the following,

723
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:48,840
then it's going to succeed in the same ways it does now, more or less,

724
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,840
with some variation.

725
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:57,840
And so largely it seems to be, if you replay the tape, until to the same endpoint,

726
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,840
then you're going to get the same result.

727
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,840
But it's like knowing...

728
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:06,840
So coming back to my methane atmosphere, so if you run your simulation and say,

729
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:12,840
well, you're stuck in a habitat that is going to be methane rich,

730
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,840
then what happens?

731
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,840
We can play that game now, right, with the cells.

732
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,840
Here's what I want to do if I live in methane.

733
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,840
But if you said, so here's the sort of root issue.

734
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,840
Suppose I said, I'm going to live in methane for a little while,

735
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,840
and then I'm going to live in an oxygen and nitrogen atmosphere like we do.

736
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,840
And then you said, okay, I'm going to play the tape differently though.

737
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,840
I'm going to swap it, and I'm going to do just the opposite.

738
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,840
First, I'm going to live in this one, then this one,

739
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,840
but then I'm going to come back to this one so that my endpoint is exactly the same,

740
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,840
but now I went through a totally different root.

741
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,840
Then the answer at the moment seems to be it only matters what the endpoint is,

742
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,840
not how you got there.

743
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,840
And often evolution does seem to take all the roots it can.

744
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,840
One thing that the modelers, you mentioned modeling,

745
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:05,840
one of the things that modelers have often found is if you work in very high-dimensional spaces,

746
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,840
and these are all high-dimensional spaces, because there's spaces of,

747
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,840
I could make this mutation at this time, then this mutation, at that time,

748
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,840
I have a whole lot of different mutations, a lot of different times.

749
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,840
I could take all kinds of different roots.

750
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,840
It's like traveling from San Francisco to New York.

751
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,840
I got all kinds of ways I go through Dallas, or I go through Chicago,

752
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,840
I go this way, or I go whatever.

753
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,840
I got all these different roots.

754
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,840
And the thing is, I can't tell.

755
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,840
I can't tell anything.

756
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,840
When I see the car in New York City, I don't have any idea where it came from.

757
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,840
So I think that the rule of thumb seems to be

758
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:48,840
in these high-dimensional spaces, it turns out pretty much always easy to get from some point

759
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,840
to some other point, but you can't tell what that root was.

760
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:59,840
Presumably, as well, thinking in sort of practical, tangible terms,

761
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,840
when we say, oh, the environment is methane environment or toxin rich,

762
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,840
there are many other aspects to any given natural environment

763
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,840
that may have a subtle or not subtle influence on what's been going on.

764
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:20,840
In a laboratory condition, maybe you do have that case of,

765
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:27,840
you always end up kind of looking the same, but in a more realistic environment,

766
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:33,840
there will be differences at some level because of the complexity of the environment itself,

767
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,840
I would imagine.

768
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,840
Absolutely, and this is really interesting,

769
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,840
because this has been a huge puzzle.

770
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,840
One of the grand puzzles really of Darwinian evolution is

771
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,840
the idea of normal evolution is winner takes all.

772
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:53,840
If I have an environment and this beast can take better advantage of living in that environment

773
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,840
than this one can, this beast wins and that beast loses and you never see this beast again

774
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,840
and you only see this beast, winner take all.

775
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,840
But if that's true, how do you explain all the diversity of life?

776
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,840
That we see today.

777
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,840
This is very difficult to explain, and so this comes down, I think,

778
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,840
the answer sort of is shaping up to be something along the lines of exactly what you just said,

779
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:21,840
and that is sure, if I am a cell, I care about sugar, I want my glucose or something,

780
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,840
I need my food, but I also care about other stuff in the environment,

781
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,840
and all of those things can be coming in at all kinds of different levels,

782
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:36,840
and so ninjas are sort of everywhere, and you could think about this in a sort of a corporate world too.

783
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,840
You know, it's amazing how many different kinds of Kleenexes there are toothpaste or something like that.

784
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:46,840
You know, somehow there's a niche for everybody, they seem to be able to survive.

785
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:54,840
I've thought about that, and it always seemed to me that this idea of survival of the fittest isn't quite right,

786
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,840
it's more like survival of the fit enough.

787
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,840
I mean, it's good for all of us.

788
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:09,840
So it's evolution is sort of a tautology, it says what persists.

789
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:22,840
So any species or creature, well, not a single creature, but any sequence of ancestry that does well enough not to be extinguished is still here.

790
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:29,840
I mean, it's again sort of circular, tautological, and certainly niches help with that,

791
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,840
but even in the absence of niches, even in exactly the same environment,

792
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,840
you can have quite a bit of diversity of things flourishing, you know, to the rainforest,

793
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:45,840
and there's not one kind of tree or one kind of beetle, there's an insane number.

794
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,840
But let me inject slightly to your point about survival of the survivors.

795
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:58,840
This has certainly been an objection to evolution of, well, how would I define fitness in the first place if it's anything different than just surviving?

796
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,840
You know, is there anything there besides just being a tautology?

797
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,840
You know, you survive if you survive.

798
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:14,840
But the classic case that argues that there really is something more to it than that was in early 1800s England,

799
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:22,840
because there was a moth called the peppered moth, and in the old days in England, the trees were fairly white with speckles,

800
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:28,840
and the moths ended up, they were fairly white with speckles, and so the birds didn't see them, they'd land on the trees, and the birds didn't see them.

801
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:36,840
But then from the early 1800s, so the middle 1800s, the industrial revolution happened in England, and there was soot everywhere,

802
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:42,840
and the trees turned black from soot, and what happened was the moths that evolved were black,

803
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:49,840
so the peppered moths were still around, the black moths were there, but the peppered moths were the ones that all got picked off by the birds then.

804
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:55,840
So the argument about survival to fit is what it comes down to in a case like this is survival.

805
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:02,840
I think the wording is not great, because it really does sort of point you in that direction, point all of us in that direction.

806
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:10,840
But survival is a property of the whole population, and I want my lineage to survive.

807
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:18,840
But fitness is a property of the individual, and so here's a case where the population ultimately survives,

808
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:24,840
you know, various moths are going to get picked off and not picked off, black ones and peppered ones and so on by the birds.

809
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:31,840
But on average, the individuals that survive more are going to be the black ones, and so you can say,

810
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:36,840
well, blackness is what fitness is all about in this case, I have a mechanism that's the individual thing,

811
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,840
and then the individual thing propagates to the population.

812
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:46,840
So I think probably if Darwin recognized that this was going to be a problem, he could have,

813
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,840
or somebody could have figured out a different way of saying it that doesn't make it sound too tautological.

814
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,840
Otherwise it's too convergent.

815
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,840
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

816
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,840
I'm not contingent enough, right? Yeah.

817
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:02,840
Yeah, and it doesn't give you a sense of sort of what models, you know, what's the mechanism underlying any of these things.

818
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:09,840
So that's, I mean, coming back to, I guess we're supposed to be talking about life in the universe, that suggests then, right?

819
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:20,840
But one thing we could say about life elsewhere is there will not be a planet of all where only life is a single type of organism with identical structure,

820
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:26,840
because that is not how any of this works, and that's going to be a universal truth.

821
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,840
Yes.

822
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:32,840
But there should be diversity anywhere. Yes. It would be comforting exactly what kind of diversity.

823
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:37,840
Yes, and it makes us worry a lot as we lose diversity these days.

824
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:45,840
Another related to that is the point about diversity in early origins, and there's a sense that, in the old days,

825
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:52,840
there was sort of the sense that, well, somehow or another, some cells arose and they got competitive with some other cells,

826
00:58:52,840 --> 00:59:02,840
and the cell lineages were already competing with each other because that's sort of the fundamental feature of biology is the Darwinian thing about competing and so forth.

827
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:10,840
But there's this view now, this guy Nigel Gold, of Illinois, and this view, very interesting, and I think it's very sensible,

828
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:21,840
and that is that the way life emerged was not, you know, your family competing against my family and so on, among all the animals and species and so on.

829
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:36,840
It was this big soup of proteins and nucleic acids, and it was sort of like one organism, and the separation out into individual lineages didn't happen too much later.

830
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:44,840
And it's interesting because you see this reflected in bacteria, there's a thing called horizontal gene transfer, and bacteria,

831
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:53,840
so Darwin's tree of evolution says, you know, I came from my parents and my parents came from their parents and all this stuff, and so it's like a tree all the way down.

832
00:59:53,840 --> 01:00:02,840
But the thing that bacteria do is they violate this tree in a big time way because they just cross over here, they just pass their genes over to anybody who wants them,

833
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,840
and the genes get passed around, that's called horizontal gene transfer.

834
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:19,840
That stuff happens all the time, it happens in us too, we got cells, most of ten times more cells are bacteria in us than are us cells, and they're not good.

835
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,840
It's in a microbiome.

836
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,840
Yeah, so it's a microbiome.

837
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,840
And those cells are doing this kind of swapping all the time.

838
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,840
It was modern technology pushing medicine towards that direction.

839
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,840
Very much, yeah.

840
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,840
Yeah, yeah.

841
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:36,840
Direct transfer again, yeah.

842
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:44,840
There's a lot of activity going on right now in the microbiology world to try to figure out the microbiome, and how much does your gut have to do with your health?

843
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:50,840
And, gee, could I reconfigure your gut if you're not healthy and things of that type?

844
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:59,840
The difficulty with it is it's way harder than studying a single kind of cell because you're studying an entire ecosystem, and everybody in there is sort of

845
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:04,840
they've got their neighborhoods and their communities, and it's like New York City when it's in your gut.

846
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,840
You know, it's complicated.

847
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:18,840
There's also been a lot of debate about the microbiome and humans or any organism that has a microbiome, and, you know, Darwinian selection in terms of this idea of the hollow-biant.

848
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:29,840
So, you know, the microbes in you, what their interests are, what they want or need may be different at some level than what you need.

849
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,840
And so when you look at a human being, what...

850
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,840
This is a big philosophical question.

851
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,840
I mean, so when a micro-biome is not you, I mean, I would think it would be you.

852
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:43,840
No, no, this is purely from a sort of Darwinian fitness point of view, right?

853
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:57,840
When you look at a human, when I look at Dennis, I evaluate your evolutionary fitness in terms of your cells and what you're doing, or your microbiome, or the combination of that.

854
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:12,840
And I know some people have been saying that the selectable quantity is actually the interaction of all these things in some sort of abstract sense, which is very, very fascinating to me.

855
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:20,840
Because that's sort of moving away to a different sort of definition of complex life that's not...

856
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,840
Selectability can be really complicated.

857
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:30,840
And one of the things that's of great interest right now is that we make these things...

858
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:36,840
They're mathematical things, and they're called fitness landscapes, and they look like hills.

859
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:45,840
And what they're supposed to represent is that organisms that are more fit are higher up the hill, and organisms that are less fit are lower down the hill.

860
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:50,840
And so these are just sort of simple mathematical cartoony kind of representations of that idea.

861
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:58,840
So the idea is, okay, let's see if I weaken figure out what kind of organism is more fit than what other organisms are.

862
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,840
Here's the problem with that, and this is what's kind of new and really interesting.

863
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,840
That's not the whole story.

864
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:08,840
There's another thing that people are calling the Red Queen hypothesis.

865
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:13,840
What that amounts to is, also you have predator prey relations.

866
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:23,840
It's not just about me fitting my environment, just an individual, and that individual's personal fitness or the lineage for that environment.

867
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,840
It's the environment.

868
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,840
It's the environment interacting with everybody.

869
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:36,840
And so the predator prey thing is, let's say I'm the prey, and you're the predator, and we're both sitting at some level on this fitness landscape.

870
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,840
You're equally fit, and I'm equally fit, or whatever.

871
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:51,840
And now you start chasing me, but you're chasing me around certain changes that can be made biochemically in me that have nothing to do with changing my fitness, improving it or making it worse.

872
01:03:51,840 --> 01:04:03,840
Or you either. It's just you're chasing me, and so you get better at capturing me, and then my genome evolves, and I get better at avoiding you, and then you get better at catching me again, and I get better at avoiding you.

873
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:09,840
And it turns out we're running around this hillside, never making it any further up.

874
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,840
But we have to do this, because this is part of evolution, too.

875
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,840
And it makes everything even more complicated than it was.

876
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:25,840
We've talked a lot about evolution, and I want to suggest some of it via a value just to be imaginative.

877
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:36,840
So let's try to imagine a life form or a life on the planet, where evolution isn't really a major factor, it doesn't work very well.

878
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:45,840
And let me motivate this by saying, I think people are kind of a little hand-wavy and vague about what evolution requires, because they are well.

879
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:50,840
And we just have to have self-replication going, and then we'll get selection, and we'll have evolution.

880
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:56,840
But really there's a lot of factors. You have to have a flexible way of storing information.

881
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:03,840
It has to express that information, it has to be expressed some way, otherwise there's no selection on it.

882
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:09,840
It has to make accurate copies, but not too accurate, otherwise there won't be any mutations or changes.

883
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:17,840
But it has to be accurate enough that you're not forgetting information faster than you're generating it.

884
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:23,840
And the errors that you make have to be non-deterministic, otherwise you'll always go in the same direction.

885
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:32,840
So they have to, in some sense, be stochastic or random, so you can explore this whole landscape of different fitnesses.

886
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:36,840
And there was one other. Oh, yeah, and you have to have all this text energy.

887
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,840
You have to have a stable metabolism to drive it.

888
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:50,840
So all of this fooling around with the information content has to go on without destroying your ability to make copies,

889
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,840
either through metabolism or destroying the copy mechanism.

890
01:05:54,840 --> 01:06:02,840
So there's quite a set of fairly complicated requirements for evolution to occur the way it does on Earth.

891
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:13,840
And obviously, we do have those mechanisms here, and it's played as our discussion has illustrated a dominant role in determining what life is like on the Earth.

892
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:25,840
But there might be systems made even out of the same beads on the basic biochemistry, which don't satisfy all of those things.

893
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:32,840
And so you can have life and some of the things, some of those factors, but it just doesn't evolve very well.

894
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,840
I can think of that might lead to just the confidence.

895
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,840
So those kinds of simulations would be just fantastic.

896
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,840
So there you might find a planet which only has one type of life or something.

897
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:47,840
Well, what it made me think of, and it's sort of jumping forward a bit, it's almost a very science fictiony idea.

898
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:51,840
It was an outrageous idea, so I'll say that.

899
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:56,840
And it's not a reason, but it's still in principle something that would happen, sort of naturally.

900
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:02,840
Imagine a species, a sophisticated species, a sort of technological species,

901
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,840
decides it does not want to evolve anymore.

902
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,840
Right?

903
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:12,840
Just says no, because I mean, this is always comes up when we talk about interstellar travel and moving around the galaxy.

904
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:19,840
The truth is, by the time you end up on the other side of the galaxy, you're going to be a different biological entity because of evolution.

905
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,840
But suppose some species decides it doesn't want to do that.

906
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,840
So what it does is it says, okay, there's no more biological reproduction.

907
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:31,840
We're going to build a machine and it's just going to pop out clones on demand.

908
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:36,840
Then you'll have a lifetime and you'll die and then you'll be buried, but you're not reproducing biologically.

909
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:43,840
And now so the question is, assuming the environment is stable, I mean, that could conceivably exist.

910
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,840
Right?

911
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,840
And it's a sort of rational decision.

912
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,840
Right? I kind of like us to all stay the same way.

913
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:55,840
I don't want to end up with tentacles or whatever a billion years time.

914
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,840
So that could, I know that sounds like it's an artificial thing, but it's not, right?

915
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,840
It's an evolution to the point where you make that decision.

916
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,840
Sounds going to be boring.

917
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,840
I'm sorry?

918
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,840
It sounds kind of boring.

919
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,840
Yeah, I mean, sure.

920
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,840
Maybe it's an unimaginable species.

921
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,840
You don't want to get it checked from their line.

922
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:18,840
It's sex with reproduction, so you could still, you know.

923
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:24,840
So there's a, you know, it would require an arrogant and narcissist species.

924
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,840
I wonder where we could find one.

925
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,840
Yeah.

926
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,840
How far we have to look to find one.

927
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,840
So there are examples of exactly what you're talking about.

928
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,840
Andrew Murray at Harvard has done a really interesting experiment.

929
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:41,840
And it turns out if his cells live in a very fixed environment and they never change,

930
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,840
they just start jettying all kinds of stuff that has to do with evolution.

931
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:49,840
So there's this notion of the evolution of evolvability.

932
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:55,840
And so the sense is that certain organisms, if you're in a very fluctuating environment,

933
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,840
you have a lot of machinery to be able to sort of handle all of those fluctuations.

934
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:04,840
But if you're in an environment that's very fixed, then you can throw a lot of that stuff away

935
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,840
and you don't need to evolve.

936
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,840
But then, of course, the problem is you're really brittle.

937
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:12,840
If all of a sudden, someday, global warming or something comes along and just changes slightly,

938
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,840
what your environment looks like?

939
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,840
Bang, you're kind of all, your whole population's dead.

940
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:31,840
I also want us to think a little bit about, it's quite possible that a species might actually not have the curiosity

941
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,840
to go seek out other species, right?

942
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:40,840
That's another part of the answer of a more perfect view that we carry around.

943
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:47,840
There could be sort of a more content species that has somehow learned to live better with his environment than we have.

944
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:53,840
Well, there are humans that people now, humans, who said don't go looking for aliens.

945
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,840
They're going to come and eat us or some kind of slave us.

946
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:00,840
That's a view that people vow hold.

947
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:08,840
Or that's one view, but there are also people who think we shouldn't be spending all this money on space travel

948
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,840
or space rides or colonizing Mars or whatever else.

949
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:22,840
And that maybe we should save our planet, we should eradicate diseases here, and learn to live better in a better harmony.

950
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,840
Or we're hardly spending any money on those things.

951
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:30,840
It doesn't even make a mark in the federal budget really.

952
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,840
We're not spending money on either of those things.

953
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:41,840
It feels like it's people object to the attention being given to these things.

954
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,840
I mean, as you say, they matter to actual money.

955
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,840
It's not so much the money, it's about the sentiment.

956
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,840
Yeah, they're very interesting.

957
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:55,840
So I'm just to be devil's advocate, because I basically agree with you, but in the big picture, the earth will not stay.

958
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,840
In a condition that is good for us.

959
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,840
And that could happen on timescale.

960
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,840
A hundred thousand years, it could happen on timescale.

961
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,840
A million years, whatever.

962
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,840
Irrespective of how green we become and careful we become.

963
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:18,840
So there is this bigger level question of, you know, and this is one of the excuses someone like,

964
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:26,840
our Musk uses for going to Mars, well, you know, it's a backup plan.

965
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,840
It's a really long-term picture.

966
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,840
The earth like any planet.

967
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,840
It's good for us now.

968
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,840
In fact, it's been in a period that has enabled humans to emerge.

969
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,840
And it hasn't always been like that at all.

970
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,840
And it won't be like that again, the future, no matter what we do.

971
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,840
So I just wonder, I mean, the difficulty with that, it's really long-term planning.

972
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,840
It's interesting from an evolution.

973
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:55,840
From an evolutionary point of view because there is fundamental mismatch in the kinds of timescales

974
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,840
on which we have evolved and the timescales.

975
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:03,840
Perhaps it's the contrast between evolutionary timescales and our lifespan.

976
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:11,840
Maybe that's what it is, that is making us such short-termy folks.

977
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,840
Well, I mean, once you start thinking down those sorts of avenues,

978
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:24,840
and maybe this is relevant to one of your future roundtables about the Anthropocene planet.

979
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:35,840
Because we've paid or disliked or tried to avoid death and, you know, at an individual lifetime level,

980
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:42,840
we sort of conceive that wise behavior for our species, for public policy,

981
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,840
would be to resist changes in the environment.

982
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:52,840
You know, there's even this idea called, what's it called, Gaia,

983
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,840
that the biosphere in general tries to stabilize the environment.

984
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:00,840
I don't actually see any evidence at all for that in my opinion.

985
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,840
But would that even be a good thing?

986
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,840
And, you know, there's this view that, you know, what do they call them?

987
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,840
Would most of the species die out? I've lost the phrase.

988
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,840
Mass extinction?

989
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,840
Mass extinction, right.

990
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,840
There's the idea that mass extinctions are, you know, that there might be one coming

991
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,840
from either human causes or other causes, and we'd better do something about it.

992
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,840
But we wouldn't be here where they're not mass extinctions in the past,

993
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:34,840
and indeed, you know, the whole history of life, which we're so fond of,

994
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:38,840
not only because it led to us, but because it led to them.

995
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:43,840
The difference is that the difference compared to previous mass extinctions

996
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:50,840
and are being here is the accelerating lever arm that human activity has provided, right?

997
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,840
And so this might be a mass extinction from which we may not recover at all.

998
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,840
Right, and we may not. Something probably will help.

999
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,840
And it does seem to be going fast, but I'm not sure it's faster than, you know,

1000
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,840
the asteroid that crashed down.

1001
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,840
Who says that humans have to survive anyway?

1002
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:08,840
Exactly.

1003
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,840
Anyway, I mean, we're going to have our turn and we're going to be gone.

1004
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:18,840
I mean, a far more wonderful species could go along in the space less by us

1005
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:25,840
that has these traits of, you know, deep thought and tranquility and we have to get out of the way.

1006
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,840
I mean, we just don't know.

1007
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:31,840
Or maybe not, or just our iPhones floating through the gallantry.

1008
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,840
There's an experiment in cells that proves your point and it has to do with time constants.

1009
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:43,840
You know, what's my lifetime span versus when am I likely to see my next mass extinction

1010
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,840
or big devastating event or something?

1011
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:52,840
You can do this in cells and it turns out what you do is you put drugs in and cells don't like drugs.

1012
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,840
These are ones that knock the cells out.

1013
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,840
So you put drugs in and you do it sort of periodically.

1014
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:04,840
And if you do it sort of on a time scale where the cell says, okay, now time is fine.

1015
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,840
Okay, now I'm getting hit by drug and back and forth and so forth.

1016
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,840
Then the cell develops these resistance mechanisms.

1017
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,840
On the other hand, if the time constant is pretty slow over the population time,

1018
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,840
they just jettison that stuff.

1019
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,840
They don't need it anymore.

1020
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,840
And I suspect maybe we're a product of that too.

1021
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,840
The difference, of course, it's argued to answer my own question is

1022
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:30,840
we have four sides about the future that presumably cells don't have.

1023
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,840
Yeah, imprintable.

1024
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:38,840
So if we cause a mass extinction, it may be feeble compared to the one that was caused by the great ox,

1025
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:44,840
you know, when the photosynthesis changed the atmosphere to an oxygen one,

1026
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:52,840
but presumably the organisms that gave off all that oxygen didn't have any way of evaluating what its impact would be

1027
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:57,840
in the future.

1028
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,840
I don't know, responsibility or...

1029
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:01,840
That's a great question for me.

1030
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,840
So where is this foresight?

1031
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,840
Because we're all made of cells.

1032
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,840
The great question for me.

1033
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,840
The cell in my body knows the future.

1034
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:14,840
And you have somehow, I think I know the future.

1035
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,840
Where is that?

1036
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,840
This collective intelligence somehow, right?

1037
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:26,840
Does it just mean, or do I know in your relationship that everybody wrote on this table?

1038
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:32,840
Well, actually I do know a lot of it in relation to the people around this table, because they're my sources.

1039
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,840
But...

1040
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,840
Is that me?

1041
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,840
No, no.

1042
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,840
Maybe it was the aliens.

1043
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,840
Heaves dropping.

1044
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,840
Come and say that.

1045
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:54,840
Pretty asked a question earlier, or made a comment earlier about maybe these other life forms nonsense to us as important to them.

1046
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,840
So quick.

1047
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,840
So that would raise the challenge.

1048
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:04,840
How would we ever find such life forms if they were interested in what we would call nonsense?

1049
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,840
Would they be discoverable even to us?

1050
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:20,840
Yeah, I mean that relates to also, there's a thing in the discussion of SETI and the efficiency of transmitting information between stars and also keeping it secure.

1051
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:28,840
And so, I think actually this bizarrely enough came up in some conversation somebody had with Edward Snowden.

1052
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,840
I was going to say, or a calendar, for example, I can imagine.

1053
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:39,840
So this idea that perfectly encrypted high efficiency data is indistinguishable from noise.

1054
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,840
So the aliens talking to each other across the cosmos, we might not...

1055
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,840
Even pick it up.

1056
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:50,840
Is there any sort of structured information? It's just more cosmic hiss.

1057
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:55,840
I know that's not quite what you were talking about, but it triggered that thought in my head.

1058
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,840
Okay.

1059
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,840
I'll open it up for questions from the audience.

1060
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,840
I don't think you were on.

1061
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,840
Okay.

1062
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,840
And yeah, we're open for questions from the audience.

1063
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:32,840
Please ask questions and note on guns.

1064
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:49,840
Okay, this is not a question, but a few observations directed primarily to Dr. Dhill.

1065
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,840
And then anyone else if you allow the time, which is unlikely.

1066
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,840
So, one...

1067
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,840
No, that I reject.

1068
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:57,840
One minute.

1069
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,840
That's a good question.

1070
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:07,840
All right, so in terms of the two factors that I've really noticed are, of course, that of anthropomorphism and that of imagination.

1071
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:15,840
So I'm going to give examples of why this is more important than it may not be apparent to some.

1072
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:24,840
A few years ago, a couple of scientists took a mathematical model of Darwinism in order to try to answer the question,

1073
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,840
what is the benefit that death gives?

1074
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:33,840
And long story short, it was discovered that for a particular group, not a whole species, but for a group,

1075
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:38,840
the food resources that are available on a generation by generation basis,

1076
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,840
extends or diminishes life expectancy.

1077
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:48,840
So that is the value is not for the current generation, but for the next.

1078
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,840
So that's one thing.

1079
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:56,840
In terms of SETI and radio communications, we're a very young species.

1080
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,840
Radio waves are the beginning.

1081
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:10,840
Again, relatively recently, counterfactual entanglement allows entanglement between particles that never have to interact.

1082
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:18,840
And it's also secure without using a non-quantum key, which means that if there are anything like us,

1083
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,840
except hopefully they've been around longer, a billion years, a hundred thousand years,

1084
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:31,840
they may be using counterfactual communications, which in fact has been already demonstrated in the laboratory.

1085
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:37,840
And if they're a little bit like us and didn't destroy their own planet and they're there,

1086
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:45,840
it may well be the case that they are making assumptions that we also are using quantum communications of that nature,

1087
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,840
which is why we're not hearing a damn thing.

1088
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,840
We're not there yet. It's still in the lens.

1089
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:57,840
So I'll just finish with why I'm motivated by it as Einstein.

1090
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:03,840
Imagination is important in knowledge because knowledge is limited, but imagination encompasses the entire universe.

1091
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,840
And that also engages not just space, but time.

1092
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:17,840
In other words, the use of imagination to look at potential futures is not only wonderful, but necessary.

1093
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:23,840
Maybe I would just say the beginning that it was shut up.

1094
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,840
I already said it wasn't a question.

1095
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:28,840
So I just wanted our response from yourself.

1096
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,840
I think I wanted to say something.

1097
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:39,840
Just very, very briefly, I would say that many of the more thoughtful people in the SETI community have long

1098
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:46,840
admitted that our best chance of hearing from classical radio SETI would be if our punitive,

1099
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:54,840
expectarrestrial civilization was sending signals intended to be easy for us to pick up and understand.

1100
01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:00,840
One thing is wanting to make contact. That's why I married that point earlier.

1101
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,840
Rather than us eavesdropping on something they intended for each other or whatever.

1102
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:11,840
And I can comment on your first point, which has to do with longevity and energy investment.

1103
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:18,840
If you look across species, you see exactly that, that some species live quite a long time and others live

1104
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,840
in much shorter time. A lot of this has to do with when do you have babies?

1105
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:29,840
And so if your physiology is such that you have babies early and your life span, you will die early.

1106
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,840
So you're just needed long enough to have babies and then after that you're not anymore.

1107
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:39,840
And so for example, we can compare us to species like one that's called the naked mole rat,

1108
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,840
which turns out to just live a very long time, for example.

1109
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:50,840
And what you discover is that evolution could have, if we look at them, these other species.

1110
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:54,840
Evolution could have designed us differently. We could have lived a lot longer.

1111
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,840
But we didn't because this is how long it takes for us to have kids.

1112
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,840
Thank you.

1113
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:10,840
Before I ask my question, I'll just comment on the SETI project.

1114
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,840
I have a background in electrical engineering.

1115
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:21,840
Electromagnetic waves are a very inefficient form of communication. They do not penetrate solid objects

1116
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:29,840
or electromagnetic objects like stars. So more likely means that communication would be either what the gentleman mentioned,

1117
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:40,840
quantum communications, entanglement, or neutrino communications, which, you know, we have no technology that I'm aware of

1118
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,840
to use neutrino communications.

1119
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:56,840
But my point, you know, the entire supposition that there is extraterrestrial life of any form,

1120
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:02,840
let alone technological life like us, is based on probabilities.

1121
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:12,840
And the probability of our having evolved on this planet with perfect conditions for us to have evolved

1122
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:22,840
is still practically zero. And it took us one third of the life of the universe for us to evolve, to be technological beings.

1123
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:31,840
If you change one single factor in our evolutionary course, if, you know, if the asteroid had not hit the Yucatan 65 million years ago,

1124
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:38,840
the dinosaurs would certainly, mammals would not be ruling the planet. Reptiles probably would be.

1125
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:45,840
And I don't think they would be broadcasting sitcoms to cosmic evil.

1126
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:52,840
They would be broadcasting the equivalent of dinosaurs' sitcoms, dinosaur communications.

1127
01:24:52,840 --> 01:25:00,840
But again, another technological civilization if it existed probably wouldn't know where to look, which is what

1128
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:05,840
we discussed before. But let me see if I remember my question.

1129
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:12,840
My question is, since it took us one third of the life of the known universe for us to evolve,

1130
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:27,840
an extremely unlikely evolution, does anybody believe that in the short 14 billion years that our visible universe has existed,

1131
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:33,840
that there would be a replication of that evolution or anything comparable to it?

1132
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,840
Well, there's an interesting story.

1133
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,840
Probability is probably just too low.

1134
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,840
But we have no idea.

1135
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:46,840
Can I just say you're making an awful lot of assumptions, including that we have any idea what the probability is that we're here.

1136
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:52,840
I mean, Ed might want to comment on that. Ed has written beautiful papers about this.

1137
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,840
The level of ignorance is extreme.

1138
01:25:54,840 --> 01:26:00,840
We know somewhat the probability of our own evolution, because we know what the steps were.

1139
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:01,840
I wouldn't.

1140
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:07,840
And they were trillions and trillions and trillions of improbable steps.

1141
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,840
But this is a change of single one.

1142
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:16,840
Yeah, I see your point, but it's all about interpreting things after the fact.

1143
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:27,840
I would say our probability of a replication of evolution to a technological civilization within the short 14 billion years.

1144
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:38,840
I would disagree, because I think that given that unless you think we started on Mars, the probability that we evolved on Earth is one.

1145
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:39,840
We're here.

1146
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,840
Right?

1147
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:41,840
That's one data.

1148
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:46,840
Yeah, that's there's no evidence that anybody else is here.

1149
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:47,840
So I can tell you an interesting story.

1150
01:26:47,840 --> 01:27:00,840
This is back in 1972-73, Francis Crick, the famous guy who discovered the double helix, worked with a guy named Leslie Orgel, and they put out this idea called directed panspermia.

1151
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,840
The idea of panspermia had existed a long time before.

1152
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:14,840
Panspermia means that life has existed in the universe before, and somehow it ended up here, but panspermia, the old idea itself, was just, hey, it's everywhere, and it landed here.

1153
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:21,840
And that's why we have only one genetic code, because there was this one bottleneck, and it sort of was the thing that landed on Earth and so on.

1154
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:29,840
Anyway, what Crick and Orgel did was they gave these talks, I heard one as a graduate student, and then they wrote this as a paper called directed panspermia.

1155
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:41,840
And directed panspermia, the idea is, no, it's not that there's just life everywhere in the universe, it's that somebody out there is sending something straight to Earth for some purpose, and they're trying to get us going.

1156
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:50,840
And those of us who were in the audience couldn't tell if these guys were, I mean, they were super first-rate scientists, both of them.

1157
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:51,840
Whether this was-

1158
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:59,840
Whether this was a scientific hypothesis, or whether this was a British sense of humor.

1159
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:07,840
And at the end of the day, so it turns out this became quite a well-known idea, this directed panspermia thing.

1160
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:13,840
In the meantime, I think now the whole scientific community has kind of dismissed it, including Crick.

1161
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:17,840
Before Crick died, he then became sort of an RNA world guy.

1162
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:23,840
Well, just a footnote to your comment, a footnote to history was not correctly discovered DNA.

1163
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:29,840
In honor of International Women's Month, it was a Rosalind Frank.

1164
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,840
Turn it up.

1165
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:31,840
Turn it up.

1166
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,840
One, go ahead.

1167
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:37,840
Good afternoon, ma'am.

1168
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,840
Extraordinary debate.

1169
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,840
My name's Anthony Fimbo, by the way.

1170
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:49,840
I run a company called Eagle Genomics, and we're building technology to explore the microbiome, not just the human microbiome, but the microbiome of the earth.

1171
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:53,840
And I've got so many ideas, I want to try and string together in a very simplistic way.

1172
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:58,840
I'm not a scientist, I'm not a astrophysicist, I'm not a biologist.

1173
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:05,840
But I am a cybernetesis, and I just want to talk about the Gaia thesis, first of all, in a quasi-scientific way.

1174
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,840
Starting by just making a bit of a contrast.

1175
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:12,840
So we have most of the debate today focused on the happy accident.

1176
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:18,840
Francis Crick's happy accident, never to be repeated, versus some conversation about determinism.

1177
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:28,840
I don't know if anyone is familiar with Eric Smith's work, the idea that the earth is a giant battery, and that the

1178
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:37,840
the citric cycle as the basis for this chemical breakdown means that life is in inevitability on this planet.

1179
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,840
It's one idea, the second idea is to talk about the microbiome.

1180
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:47,840
And that's really an anthropomorphic, anthropocentric view of the holobiant, because the soil is a microbiome fundamentally.

1181
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:53,840
Plants interact with the soil, we interact with plants, etc, etc, etc.

1182
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,840
So, I wanted to close.

1183
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:08,840
So I just wanted to try and expand on the ideas of determinism, Gaia, and on the idea of the holobiant, to ask the question about whether that might get us a bit closer to understanding what life actually is.

1184
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:14,840
One word answer, sure.

1185
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:19,840
I think it's a good question.

1186
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:25,840
So we have this tendency to think about things in isolation.

1187
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:33,840
We put it in a test tube and study it, we'll understand it, but of course nothing actually lives in a test tube in the real world.

1188
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:44,840
I think I see this coming up also slightly different, but in field of AI research, people talk about, oh, how do we make a general AI that is like us?

1189
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:54,840
But you're doing it in a test tube, and I don't think that's ever going to work. It has to somehow be out in the complexity of the universe in order to develop more skills.

1190
01:30:54,840 --> 01:31:00,840
So I think, yeah, I don't really have a good answer. I'm making a comment to your question.

1191
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:10,840
Yeah, absolutely. But I'm not sure how we're going to fully incorporate the enormous complexity of the entire biological system of the Earth.

1192
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:23,840
Maybe one comment. There's a lot of complex systems that share a lot of features, and I think we could learn from looking at each complex system and the other.

1193
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:38,840
One example of this is that Sergey Masloff some years ago was at LBL, sorry, we're having looked at software usage.

1194
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:52,840
How many software packages call other software packages? And what it was a story about is that some stuff is really useful, writing a little code that adds to and to, and everybody uses that, and then there's other codes that are more complicated and so on.

1195
01:31:52,840 --> 01:32:02,840
Looked at the complexity of software codes. And he then, he also looked at the complexity of biochemistry, and he discovered the distribution functions of these things are identical.

1196
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:15,840
And as if what we learned from the software, looking at the software, was that there's sort of swapability and there's usability and stuff that's really good and useful, you just use it as much as you can.

1197
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:31,840
And there's a broader field too of what some people call explore and exploit computational modeling, where the idea is you have complexity and you're trying to search a landscape, maybe some complicated mathematical function, and you're trying to look for the,

1198
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:36,840
say the mountain peak or something, and how do you find it in the most efficient possible way?

1199
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:45,840
Well, what you do is you do, you have sort of two modes. One is when you think you're headed up a mountain, you just go for it, and that's the exploit part.

1200
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:57,840
And when you don't quite know where you are, you're going up a little and you're going down a little, what you do is you just keep doing random things, it sort of splits into an entropy like thing and an energy like thing, but it's how Monte Carlo people

1201
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:04,840
and how people who do super computing protein folding in our kind of world, for example, all kinds of things,

1202
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:15,840
function in some what similar ways, they find answers in these sort of with the swapping off randomness and optimization.

1203
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:26,840
And I think another example of this is industrial innovation. If you ask, so one of the examples that comes up often in origins, questions,

1204
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:32,840
it comes up in origins, is chicken and egg problem, what came first, the chicken or the egg?

1205
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:45,840
Well, that's a badly posed problem because chickens and eggs come up together, and so it's not, you don't get one or the other, and then boom, the egg pops open and now comes to chicken for the first time.

1206
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:53,840
And if you, there's, and so this has to do with sort of the sequence of events that things can happen.

1207
01:33:53,840 --> 01:34:01,840
If you look at industrial innovations, very similar to this, and also the origin of evolution of the eye, for example, what's the evolution of the iPhone?

1208
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:13,840
Well, you can say, well, okay, let's see, is half an iPhone, this is the argument about an eye, half an eye would be useless, therefore, there's no fitness value, therefore, it couldn't have evolved and it had to have come from some other thing.

1209
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:22,840
What about half an iPhone? Well, half an iPhone, there was half an iPhone, but it's not sewing it in half, that obviously would be a useless thing.

1210
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:35,840
Half an iPhone was, what happened if we, when we started back in the 1940s, we invented computers, we invented transistors, we invented GPS, we invented Internet, those were all the threads.

1211
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:51,840
So half an iPhone was sort of between 1947 and now, what would it have been? It was probably, half an iPhone was probably an Apple II, and it was large-scale integrated circuits, and it was some clumsy version of an Internet, and it wasn't anything that looked like an iPhone, and it was not gold-directed.

1212
01:34:51,840 --> 01:35:02,840
It was not gold-directed in any way, and so I think that all of these complex systems, there are commonalities that we should be exploiting somehow or another.

1213
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:05,840
I don't know how to do it, and I think your points won't very well taken though.

1214
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:19,840
Yeah, I mean, I think the only sort of brief comment I have is that you're absolutely right, that probably what we need to consider are networks that facilitate life, so connections between conditions.

1215
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:25,840
So it's a much more complex problem than saying whether you need oxygen or water.

1216
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:39,840
I sort of would go back and thinking about the issues you raised and the issues of previous question raised, is we're a little bit back to trying to study dogs with just one example of a dog to look at.

1217
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:50,840
I think Eric Spitz works on these cycles, a brilliant description of what happened on Earth. Are they relevant for what's happening on other planets?

1218
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,840
We just don't know, I would say.

1219
01:35:53,840 --> 01:36:03,840
And again, we have to keep track of what we know, and we don't know, and that question number two is how different or similar are we if there is other life out there?

1220
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:09,840
Is I think something that we fundamentally don't know. What are the ways we might find out?

1221
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:21,840
One, which I think Ken has been talking about, is we may understand biology and what's happened on Earth, and a deeper and deeper and more systems levels so we can see the patterns that might be the same.

1222
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:32,840
And of course the other is to search for life elsewhere, and if we find it, we'll learn some of my undergraduate mentor Philip Morrison, who was one of the pioneers of SETI actually,

1223
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:43,840
what said finding a single example of life anywhere. I think he said finding life on Mars would change life from a miracle to a statistic.

1224
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:57,840
So we have to probably try both of those. I mean, we are trying, and I think should continue to try to advance in both of those ways towards answering those sort of questions.

1225
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:10,840
What's contingent, what's convergent, but we shouldn't pretend, and it's fun to talk about this, but we just don't know until one of those programs of research succeeds are hopefully both of them.

1226
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:15,840
Thank you very much.

1227
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:35,840
I don't know if you discussed this before I got here, but my question is about the extremophiles and the types of life you find in sulfuric lakes and in thermal vents and something like the tardigrade where, you know, what's going on with these creatures and do they share DNA with us?

1228
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:52,840
Yeah, good question. Yes, they do. They share DNA with us. It's interesting. There are studies now where you can take a given organism that's a mesophile that grows at our temperature, let's say, and the same organism that's the thermophile equivalent.

1229
01:37:52,840 --> 01:38:08,840
So it does the same things, and it has DNA that's pretty similar, except it just happens to live at the higher temperatures. And you can ask what are the differences, and now there's something like 50 different thermophiles for which a lot of proteins are known and understood clearly and so forth.

1230
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:23,840
It's an interesting process. You can rationalize to some extent how the proteins changed and how they became better at folding up and doing their enzyme activities at the other temperatures.

1231
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:46,840
But they otherwise, their organisms just like us, the DNA, you know, across species, the DNA is very similar. The difference between everybody in this room is about 0.1% in your DNA. The difference between all of us and chimpanzees is about 1% and between us and the great apes is something like 4%.

1232
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:51,840
And it's the same thing with thermophiles and mesophiles. The differences are really small and subtle.

1233
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:56,840
So we can't really talk about the absolute requirement for life, though, in terms of...

1234
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,840
No, exactly. It depends on the environment.

1235
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:12,840
And also, just to add, I mean, those extremophiles, we call them extremophiles. Many of them do not do well in our environment, our preferred environmental conditions. So to them, we are the extremophiles.

1236
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:23,840
Okay. Thank you very much.

1237
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,840
Thank you.

1238
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,840
Thank you.

1239
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:52,840
Thank you.
