1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
Today's round table would be moderated by Dr. Fred Sander.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,680
Fred Sander is an old friend, a member of this institute,

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,440
and who has been involved a great deal in teaching,

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,340
on teaching both here and at various universities,

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,640
Cornell and not Sinai, also Sinai.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,240
Yeah.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,520
He is a psychoanalyst, but also specializes in family therapy

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,320
and some of his books are up front there,

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,520
and apparently one of his books can be accessed for free

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,920
on the web.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,040
So that's it, Fred.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,120
Thank you.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,000
Check to see if this is working.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,440
It's not working.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,600
I'll try to speak louder until it works.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm really delighted to have an opportunity

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to participate in the Helix program.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,320
I have on a number of occasions said to Ed,

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,160
we're having these interesting meetings.

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,840
And how come we never have a psychoanalyst as part

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,480
of a round table?

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,960
So I think this is his way of either getting back at me

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,840
or taking me seriously.

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,640
The psychoanalyst in this building

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,840
might have something to say about the subjects that we cover

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,760
here, including the subject of love.

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,480
We'd find out.

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,920
So I did want to make a few opening remarks.

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,720
What is it, especially exciting today,

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,920
is the wide number of disciplines that are represented here.

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,560
The side psychoanalysis, we have a poet.

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,360
And we have a curator of the European collection

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,320
of the Metropolitan Museum.

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,480
I'll let them each introduce themselves

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,400
when after I say these opening remarks.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,080
And we have a neuroscientist, which

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,640
is the latest angle on love.

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,080
I don't think 10 years ago there

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,920
would have been a neuroscientist yet on the,

40
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,160
I may have the time wrong.

41
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,720
Your research is, I think, about five years ago

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,920
that it's published.

43
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,600
Well, whatever.

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,160
It's a new field.

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,960
A new field of love in the mind.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,920
The question that we might raise in this discussion

47
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,920
is, is love in the harder is it in the brain,

48
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,680
or some other organ that we don't know.

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,880
So and when I first learned that I

50
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,680
would be doing this moderating, it just

51
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,160
happened that that day in the New York Times,

52
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,360
there was an obituary about a man named Mr. Pugash.

53
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,560
And I must say, I do remember the name from when he first

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,960
was a notarized.

55
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,160
So so blatantly in the news when he threw some head,

56
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,200
some lie thrown into the eyes of his beloved.

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,560
And he went to jail for that maybe 10 years or so.

58
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,000
He gets out of jail.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,840
And the next thing we know is he marries the woman whom he

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,480
virtually blinded.

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,040
And so I thought, my goodness, love

62
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,680
goes in all kinds of ways.

63
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,400
I trust it's not the form of love we're

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
going to spend too much time on today.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,520
But it's true that love takes many, many forms and shapes.

66
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,480
And there's probably no limit to how far love can go.

67
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,800
And we'll see some of that one in our discussion.

68
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,240
I went to the internet and I checked the subject of love.

69
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,800
And there were a number of categories of love.

70
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,560
One was called quotes on love.

71
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,960
And there were 16,000 quotes on love.

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,640
I didn't go through them all.

73
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,520
But I thought two weeks later when

74
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,160
we were going to have this meeting,

75
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,320
I looked it up again.

76
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,720
And there were 16,500.

77
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,480
So just in the two weeks that I was checking,

78
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,520
the number of wherever these quotes are coming from,

79
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,440
they just keep arriving and adding to the information

80
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,000
explosion.

81
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Now, I was concerned in this discussion today

82
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,680
that the topic is so something everybody

83
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
has some strong feelings about.

84
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,640
And the field is already the 16,000 quotes

85
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,080
tells you already how far and wide the subject goes.

86
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,200
And I was hoping that in this discussion,

87
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,560
we would have some degree of focusing

88
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,360
on the subject of love so that we're not completely

89
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,640
all over the place.

90
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,520
Even though the discussion and conversation we have

91
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,280
will take us not far afield, but hopefully

92
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,680
there'll be overlap among the five of us.

93
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,400
And there'll be time for discussion at the end.

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,920
There's a possibility we might have one or two questions

95
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,560
before the end so that you have a chance to be heard.

96
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,440
So I'll just start with Steve Klein to introduce yourself

97
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,680
and tell us a little bit about the heart and poetry.

98
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,600
Oh, why?

99
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
My Michael.

100
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,880
I still love you.

101
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,560
And I don't know if love is the heart of poetry.

102
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:49,520
I think that I think it's the way that one might access love.

103
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,960
But I think that poetry goes on.

104
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,920
I mean, the wonderful thing about if you

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,640
take on poetry as a vocation is that you

106
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,480
get to address a lot of different kinds of things.

107
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,080
But I think that it's certainly not out of fear

108
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,040
that one writes poetry, which I think

109
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,000
is I'm haunted by this sort of definition I heard many,

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,280
many years ago by Emmett Fox, which

111
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,160
talks about if you're not feeling love, you're feeling fear.

112
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,680
And that basically we in one way or another

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,280
we're feeling one of those emotions all the time.

114
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,280
So I always think of poetry as the way

115
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,600
to keep the aperture open toward the love direction and not.

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,760
It's a place to let everything happen and not a place to.

117
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,680
It's not a place for self-censorship.

118
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,160
And I think any place that is not about self-censorship

119
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,080
is about love.

120
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,080
I don't really want any to say a word or two about yourself.

121
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Oh, I'm Michael Klein.

122
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm a poet and a writer.

123
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,200
I teach writing in the graduate program at Goddard College

124
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,440
in Vermont.

125
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,200
I've written three books of poems.

126
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
I wrote a book of essays called The End

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,640
of Being Known, which is about sex and friendship.

128
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,680
And I wrote a memoir called Track Conditions, which

129
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,320
is about my experience.

130
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,200
Grooming a Kentucky Derby Horse in 1984, who died.

131
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,360
And I'm explain for his death.

132
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,000
So I write about it a lot of things.

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,200
And I have a certain book of poems that just came out

134
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,800
in January called The Talking Day.

135
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,880
I'm Andrea Beyer.

136
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm the curator of Italian Renaissance paintings

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,680
at the Metropolitan Museum.

138
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,480
And I'm here because I was the curator of this exhibition,

139
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,800
art and love in Renaissance Italy.

140
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,720
And actually, I did think of an anecdote

141
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,000
that I wanted to begin this discussion with,

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,760
because the point of this exhibition

143
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,400
was to bring together as wide a variety of objects

144
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,120
and paintings that had been made during the Renaissance

145
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,960
that celebrated those great ritual moments in people's

146
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,560
lives, betrothal marriage, the beginning of a family.

147
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,880
And in fact, we wanted to call the exhibition something

148
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,920
about marriage, marriage in the family, et cetera.

149
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,680
And the powers that be at the Met made us do a survey.

150
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,240
And they found out that the word marriage was such a turn-off

151
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,520
that they would not allow us to proceed with that in our title.

152
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,440
And so they encouraged us instead to use the word love.

153
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,520
And my colleagues, some of whom were much more academic

154
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,200
than I am, were appalled by this because there

155
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,680
was so little love in Renaissance marriage arrangements

156
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,520
that they felt that we were, in some ways,

157
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,800
distorting the conversation.

158
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,120
However, I ended up seriously disagreeing

159
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,640
with that point of view, and I was very happy that love was

160
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,200
in the title.

161
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,600
And if I have another two minutes,

162
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,240
I'll just tell you a great Renaissance anecdote.

163
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,120
You can probably all bring to mind

164
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,640
the beautiful Titian Venus of Ourobino in the Uffizi.

165
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,480
That painting was done for the Duquito Baldo della

166
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,160
Rovare in 1538.

167
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,120
And he wrote a very famous letter to Titian

168
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,400
in which he says, don't sell that nude lady to anyone else.

169
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,800
And that's the way he describes it.

170
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,160
But to me, the thing that was so touching

171
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,200
and interesting about that story,

172
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Guido Baldo della Rovare at that moment

173
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,920
is married in a dynastic marriage with someone

174
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,160
he had had no interest in, and in fact,

175
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,320
who was prepubescent when they got married.

176
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,720
But he had been in love, deeply in love, the year before.

177
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,880
He was forced to marry that lady.

178
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,640
And I just wanted to read to you his letter to his father

179
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,720
briefly, briefly.

180
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,840
For two years now, I've spoken at length,

181
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,920
begging you that in giving me a wife,

182
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,840
it would seem that in this act, the principal matter

183
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,400
is to satisfy me, given that I carried and still

184
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,000
carried such a love for the Lady Clédice.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,120
This is Clédice Oceini, due to her qualities and her manners.

186
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,720
To let me have her would give me such extreme happiness

187
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,520
and not to have her would cause me such infinite sadness.

188
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,440
So I beg you with all my heart, if you have any regard

189
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,200
for my sanity and health, satisfy and concede me this favor,

190
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,960
knowing that in her is my all.

191
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,880
Well, her father said no.

192
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,400
Her mother said no.

193
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,320
She was married the next year to an 11-year-old,

194
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,840
and then bought the Venus of Urbino

195
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,000
to put in his nuptial chamber.

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,280
So love is a complicated story in the Renaissance, too.

197
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,360
Under Andrea, it was modest in not telling us

198
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,880
that the show she curated can be found on the web

199
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,800
for giving a lecture on just looking up

200
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,200
to the title of Love and Art in Renaissance Italy.

201
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,040
And you'll be had a chance to hear her entire lecture

202
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,000
on the show, which is now five, perhaps five years old.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Listen.

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,400
And so I'm going to give you a quick place to start, actually.

206
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
But I'm Lucy Brown.

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm an neuroscientist.

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,600
I've worked for about 40 years at Einstein College of Medicine.

209
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,400
My most recent work has been human-like knowledge

210
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,800
of early stage, intense knowledge.

211
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,920
So we have to understand that the scientists have really

212
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,000
had to focus in on a particular kind of love.

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,840
There's the passionate love.

214
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,200
There's the passionate love.

215
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,400
There's love that can develop after a bunch of parties.

216
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,880
There's the parental love, which

217
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,800
shows to look at early stage, intense romantic love.

218
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,600
So who would like to see any effects in the brain with this new

219
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,800
methodology we've had on children or not?

220
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Lucy, any?

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But we knew that romance, that early stage

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,600
romantic love, that kind of romance that Andrea just read

223
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,400
about can affect people's lives tremendously effectively

224
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,000
and tremendously.

225
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,800
After all, Edward, the seven stepped down

226
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,920
from the throne of England in order to marry, well, a Simpson.

227
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,720
So romance can affect our lives tremendously.

228
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,920
And it's a big force, even though some people,

229
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,000
it can be a big disruptive force, especially

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
in the Renaissance, and especially in Asian societies,

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,480
they don't trust it because it can be so disruptive.

232
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,040
But bottom line is, on your scientists' study,

233
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,000
first romance, that intense failure,

234
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,920
because part of the reason I did that first,

235
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,120
because I was pretty sure I could measure something

236
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,480
in the brain that is not the methodology.

237
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,320
Also, because I knew, affected life was so frustrating.

238
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,120
You would think about it.

239
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,280
It changes us.

240
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,560
Marriage, it's the way we pass on our genes.

241
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,720
So much of our life actually revolves around falling in love.

242
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,280
And I also have the eye of the anthropologist

243
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,320
who one of my collaborators is Helen Fisher,

244
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,080
an anthropologist.

245
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:51,920
And the idea that romance is a developed form

246
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,880
of a mammalian behavior to pursue preferred mates.

247
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,080
But romance isn't just a human thing.

248
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,000
Anyway, so I'll stop there.

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,040
I don't think you need it.

250
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,160
I think that one wasn't funny.

251
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,600
Testing, testing.

252
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,760
Thank you for having me.

253
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,040
My name is Dan Slater.

254
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,440
I am a writer and a reporter.

255
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,600
And I am a writer.

256
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,560
I'm a writer.

257
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,440
Yeah?

258
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,600
So it's sort of a funny story about why I'm here.

259
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,440
I was a lawyer before I became a writer,

260
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,760
and I was the legal affairs reporter at the Wall Street

261
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,440
Journal up until about four years ago when I was laid off.

262
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,880
And the layoff happened to coincide

263
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,200
with the end of a relationship.

264
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,120
So it was a lot to handle at one time,

265
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,480
and I was seen a therapist.

266
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,240
And she said to me, well, some of my patients

267
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,560
fed luck with online dating.

268
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,120
So me should give that a shot.

269
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,440
And after several sessions, I finally, I took her advice,

270
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,880
and I got on to match.com.

271
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,280
And I started doing online dating,

272
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,920
and that began to become a focus of the sessions.

273
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,200
And she was asking me, well, what are the sites?

274
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,720
I'm almost like she was using the sessions

275
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,720
to get information out of me to pass on to her.

276
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,960
And to her patients, because she'd

277
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,280
get asked about online dating.

278
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,760
And she said to me, she said, well, maybe one day

279
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,600
you will write a book about this.

280
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,720
And as I was saying downstairs, I said,

281
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,640
there was no way I would write a book about this.

282
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,400
But after a few more things happened,

283
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
one of which was finding out that my mom and dad

284
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,160
met through a computer dating service in 1965,

285
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,280
I started to get serious as a researcher and a journalist

286
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,160
looking into the online dating business

287
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,760
and how it was affecting modern relationships.

288
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,720
So the product was out as a book that I published last month.

289
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,840
It's called Love and the Time of Algorithms.

290
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,480
It was excerpted in the Atlantic magazine this last month.

291
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,680
And so I've been out speaking about the book.

292
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,480
So I come at this, I guess, from a slightly different angle.

293
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,520
There's a lot of psychology in the book.

294
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,880
There's a lot of business reporting.

295
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,320
There's a lot of narrative.

296
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,240
But really, it's a book about how this technology has come

297
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,640
to mediate the way that we meet and discover mates now.

298
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,000
And so that's the reason I'm here.

299
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,160
Can I answer that?

300
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,720
I met my boyfriend.

301
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,120
We've run it permission.

302
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,920
Thank you.

303
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,800
No, it's an interesting story because I'm not

304
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,200
my boyfriend online.

305
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,880
And we've been together for 10 years.

306
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,560
And what's interesting is that when I first

307
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,200
asked the site, what was the website?

308
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,440
It was part of law of a light or lava.

309
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,840
It was a bubble for men.

310
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,880
I mean, for gay men, it was for a man line.

311
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,520
I gave them.

312
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,040
And there was a sex part, and there was a relationship part.

313
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,080
And I put my profile on all of them

314
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,560
because I didn't really know what.

315
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,240
I didn't know that you could actually have a relationship,

316
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,320
but didn't necessarily have to do with all those things.

317
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,960
I had been out of a relationship for 15 years.

318
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,240
And the only reason I went online was because I was convinced

319
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,840
by an ex-student that I had been offered for a year

320
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,760
and she said, try to get you.

321
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,200
He said, play dirt.

322
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,160
And I did it the next day.

323
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,000
I met this guy.

324
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,040
So what happened was that we were going back and forth

325
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,880
for about three months.

326
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,800
And I sat down with Marie Howe, who I'm actually here

327
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,080
replacing today.

328
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,840
And she said, you have to leave him immediately.

329
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,560
I said, why?

330
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:34,400
She said, you're making somebody up.

331
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,440
Even though they are, for all intents and purposes,

332
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,960
proving their existence by these amazing emails,

333
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,160
I mean, I really fell in love with both writers.

334
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,840
And that was really what was interesting is sure enough.

335
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,240
As soon as we met, it actually, I

336
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,840
had to force it to work in this very strange way.

337
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,440
I had to give it a chance because I

338
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,960
knew that I was up against my imagination.

339
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,440
And when it was physically presented to me,

340
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,920
it was like, nothing like I thought he would look.

341
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,120
He actually didn't even exchange pictures.

342
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Because of that, because I didn't think it mattered.

343
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,320
That it's of matters.

344
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,960
That it matters a lot.

345
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,120
So I just say, it's such a way to still be there

346
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,240
after 10 years.

347
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,600
I have to say, it's a different kind of work.

348
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,120
And in this day and age, I think that we've become,

349
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,680
it's interesting, I think we've become

350
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,000
people who are willing to do the kind of work

351
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,680
that we would never, my parents would never have done.

352
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,000
I mean, when you told me, when you said your parents met,

353
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,480
and that's like, who does that?

354
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,760
Like 20 years ago.

355
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,000
I mean, it was a very different way of courting.

356
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,640
And what's also fascinating is, how do we,

357
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,440
and this might be a question to, I mean,

358
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:54,200
how do we acclimate to using different phenomenology

359
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:00,600
around instinct, which meaning somebody online is not,

360
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,240
it's very different than having an instinct for somebody

361
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,760
that you've met at a party, for instance.

362
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,160
So I think one of the ways that online dating makes a difference

363
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,440
is that you are sort of meeting an avatar in a person

364
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,920
before you meet a person themselves.

365
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,440
And one of the many results of that

366
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,280
is that you invent an idea in your head of what he or she

367
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,720
is like.

368
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,040
And then, of course, at some point,

369
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,200
you have to actually go meet them,

370
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,800
and you have to sort of align those two things.

371
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,400
And for some people, that can be a lot of disappointment.

372
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,840
Because if the fantasy becomes very intense,

373
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,040
then you ultimately have to reconcile the person with the fantasy,

374
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,600
and that can be a disappointing process.

375
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,520
But I think that's part of a learning curve thing.

376
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,200
I think the people who do online dating for a while,

377
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,840
they learn hopefully to get past that.

378
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,440
I was saying to Lucy before we started

379
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,520
that I think one of the great things that online dating is

380
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,760
doing is that it is presenting people with some opportunities

381
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,440
to fail.

382
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,800
At least they're getting out there and meeting people

383
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,280
and having relationships and having failed relationships

384
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,040
and hopefully learning from them and hopefully making

385
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,160
a better selection down the road as a result.

386
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
So I don't know if I've answered anything that you.

387
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,760
Nobody's interested in what they do.

388
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,560
But then again, what is the authentic self that

389
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,200
meets the avatar?

390
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,680
Who is this?

391
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,800
Well, forget the avatar.

392
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,480
The avatar is just a way of meeting.

393
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,000
OK.

394
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,480
The avatar, I mean, unless for you,

395
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,360
romance, love, and companionship means sitting in a room

396
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,240
and imagining people, which I think for 99 to 100% of people,

397
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,480
that's not the case.

398
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,760
Ultimately, it's about meeting someone.

399
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,160
So the way I think of it is that in a way,

400
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,880
the technology is just a discovery tool.

401
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,840
And I think the goal for most people

402
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,600
should be to get offline as soon as possible.

403
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,200
No, you're not spotting them across the room,

404
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,960
or you're not spotting them in a class,

405
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,000
or on the subway, or in a bar, or whatever.

406
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,360
I think for some people that feels very strange,

407
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,400
because we've become so used to that way of meeting.

408
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,280
But it's really, it's just a discovery tool.

409
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,480
And so I don't think the profile matters as much.

410
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,120
I think the profile is one of those things of an online dating

411
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,160
that is sort of a superficial difference.

412
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,880
It's a fun thing to focus on because it can be funny.

413
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,720
And it can be the source of sort of a lot of fibbing

414
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,560
about yourself.

415
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,520
But ultimately, you're going to put that aside,

416
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,600
and you've got to go out.

417
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,200
I think it's interesting that if you way, way before any

418
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,040
of this could have taken place, one of the things

419
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,360
that both of you are describing as sort of the idealization,

420
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,160
that you idealize yourself, and you

421
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,760
idealize the person with whom you're communicating

422
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,640
on with online dating until you can no longer do that,

423
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,280
because you're confronted with the actual person

424
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,880
and have to relate to them.

425
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,960
But this actually, at a completely different scale,

426
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,040
is of course the basis of much of Renaissance ideas

427
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,280
about love and embedded in poetry and so on,

428
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,440
that in fact it's best not to meet that ideal love.

429
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,360
And many of the poets never did meet that ideal love.

430
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,520
They saw them in church and invented an entire thing

431
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,240
about who they were and how great they

432
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,240
and how they epitomized all of these ideals.

433
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,600
But when they met them, it would be a completely different thing.

434
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,120
And in fact, when they met them, they usually were very happy

435
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,440
that those great ideals were married to someone completely

436
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,040
different, and they didn't have to deal with them

437
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,640
on a day-to-day basis.

438
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,920
But it is, in a way, it's the same kind of thing

439
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,520
that you overlay on somebody.

440
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,200
It seems to me what you said that you studied romantic love.

441
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,840
But from what I hear, first there seems to be the issue

442
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,320
of interest, whether it's on the internet or in person

443
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,600
or whatever there has to be interest.

444
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,560
Then there is a term you didn't use,

445
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,800
and I wonder why you chose not to use it,

446
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,720
which is infatuation.

447
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,040
And then you came to romantic love,

448
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,720
which different people have different definitions of.

449
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,840
So I thought maybe.

450
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,360
So for my definition I like comes from Lane Hatfield

451
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,640
for romantic love, and it's the intense desire

452
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,840
for emotional union with another person.

453
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,880
Unity, did you say?

454
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,480
Emotional union.

455
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
Union.

456
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,440
With another person.

457
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,480
That intense desire for emotional union.

458
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,560
That is how romance can begin.

459
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,520
And certainly what I'm talking about,

460
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,240
you could use the word infatuation.

461
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,040
It can start out that way.

462
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,560
Where one of the things that we asked people

463
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,320
who we were interviewing to become subjects

464
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,920
in the experiment, the most important question,

465
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,800
was what percentage of the day do you think about this person?

466
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,120
Now most of the people who were part of this study

467
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,360
said, you're kidding?

468
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,880
I can't stop thinking about them.

469
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,920
I can't sleep.

470
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,280
They're totally obsessed with the other person.

471
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,760
That doesn't last all that long, usually.

472
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,440
I mean, you can't not sleep.

473
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,160
People who are in love in the early stages often lose weight.

474
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,960
That's one of the symptoms too for being in love.

475
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,720
You have to moderate a little bit,

476
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,920
and a little bit of attachment sets in,

477
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,360
because you have to go to work and do other things

478
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,160
and build a home, actually.

479
00:24:52,160 --> 00:25:01,600
So this intensity, you can call infatuation, I guess.

480
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,360
But what's interesting to me, one of the interesting things

481
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:12,440
we found, I'll just tell you, is that for people in that stage,

482
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,560
when they looked at a picture of their beloved,

483
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,400
their sweetheart, their romantic partner,

484
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,480
I thought maybe it would activate parts of the brain

485
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,320
that have to do mainly with cognition,

486
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,400
recognizing something attractive about the other person.

487
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,600
So remember, they've already fallen in love with the person.

488
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,360
What was fantastic was the area of the brain that was active

489
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,160
was deep in a reflex level part of the brain.

490
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,800
It's called the brainstem.

491
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,440
It's a reward system that neuroscientists had identified.

492
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,680
But at a very primitive level of the brain,

493
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,920
totally, dare I say, the unconscious level,

494
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,040
but I'll say non-verbal level, maybe.

495
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,520
Anyway, a part of the brain that is not just human at all,

496
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,360
part of the brain we share with other mammals.

497
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:11,840
And it's this primitive system.

498
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,080
Our sense that water tastes good when we're thirsty.

499
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,240
It's like thirst.

500
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,000
And if you remember being in love,

501
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,600
as a matter of fact, poetry, I think,

502
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,400
uses the word thirsty when I hunger after my beloved.

503
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,880
I'm thirsty for you.

504
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,400
That is a poetry and literature often describes very well

505
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:43,120
what kind of findings that we saw in the brain as we look back.

506
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,720
But there was so what we say is that it activated part

507
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,320
of the reward system that mediates basic drives

508
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,560
like hunger and thirst.

509
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,560
But right next to that area, actually,

510
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,400
is another area that we found was activated

511
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,560
just by the attractiveness of the face.

512
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,840
So you can maybe sit down at a coffee shop

513
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,480
with someone, see them the first time,

514
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,320
and you have a reaction to them.

515
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,480
And you know the face is attractive.

516
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,560
In a general sense, there's a beauty that we all see in art.

517
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,000
You know, there's a.

518
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,240
And psychologists call this the difference

519
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,760
wanting and liking so you can want someone.

520
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,280
And that can be, goodness knows,

521
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,120
that the face has to be somewhat attractive to you,

522
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,520
but there are other things.

523
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,360
And maybe it does have to do with your experiences

524
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,000
with a primary caregiver.

525
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,320
And there's something about that person that reminds you of them.

526
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,640
But you focus on that person.

527
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:58,080
You want that person versus liking them to start with.

528
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,160
And liking can turn into wanting, actually.

529
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,600
But that the brain studies identified very nicely

530
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,040
these two different systems is interesting to me.

531
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:16,800
I'd be very interested to know how much of that liking side

532
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,240
is inherent to one person or is really

533
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,960
conditioned by cultural norms.

534
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,640
So that, again, to come back to the kind of descriptions

535
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,560
of beauty in the Renaissance, the same kind of beauty

536
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,880
is described over and over again.

537
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,120
So you can imagine that, first of all, people

538
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,520
tried to look like that by plucking their hair

539
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,520
and dying at blonde and plucking their eyebrows and so on.

540
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,720
Women tried to resemble that.

541
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,280
But men seemed, in poetry at least,

542
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,760
to respond mostly to that.

543
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,560
Are they responding to something that's

544
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,600
inherent to themselves?

545
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,480
Or have they somehow been trained over time

546
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,800
to like a certain kind of face, a certain kind of body?

547
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,920
What responses are you going to like ourselves?

548
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,920
And so we like to, I mean, we are at the Psycho analytic

549
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,240
Institute here soon.

550
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,680
Can you talk a little bit about the arts?

551
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,520
Is that a cue for me to say something?

552
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,840
One of the things I found when I

553
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,800
interviewed over 100 online daters for this.

554
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,520
And one of the things that I would hear over and over again

555
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,520
would be the tales of sort of, as we were saying earlier,

556
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,160
the ideal and sort of inventing the ideal early on.

557
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,240
And then having to kind of reconcile the reality

558
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,600
with the ideal that certainly, at the beginning of love,

559
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,760
when you're feeling a tense romantic love,

560
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,840
one at least in my own experiences and the experiences

561
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,440
that a lot of people I interviewed for the book

562
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,960
was that you'd meet someone who you liked.

563
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,000
And part of that intensity was sort of inventing an ideal,

564
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,480
oh my god, this person's amazing.

565
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,520
This is the, they do this and that.

566
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,600
And she's funny and all this.

567
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,560
And then over time, of course, that starts to dissipate.

568
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,880
And then you say, well, you know what?

569
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,280
She actually, she leaves a lot of dishes in the sink.

570
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,160
And gosh, and I really wish that she would take her shoes off

571
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,800
in the house when she comes in.

572
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,160
You know, whatever your thing is, whatever your little,

573
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:32,000
and so the ideal starts to, the ideal no longer exists.

574
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,280
The ideal is kind of shattered.

575
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,200
And I think that with online dating,

576
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
one of the things online dating allows you to do

577
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,040
is become addicted to that ideal over and over again

578
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,280
because just because you can meet more people.

579
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,200
It's got to, you know, I want to feel that again.

580
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,640
I want to feel that infatuation.

581
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,000
So I met a lot of people who would kind of, you know,

582
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,160
the serial online data that the person who always

583
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,080
was looking for that kind of next early fix.

584
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,160
You know, I don't, first of all, I don't think there is an ideal.

585
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,400
I think that's the problem to begin with.

586
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,960
And I fall in love with people that I'm not supposed to fall

587
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,280
in love with, but by, in terms of what I think I like

588
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,160
or I desire and much of it has to do with desire.

589
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,880
I also think that if it's real love,

590
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,720
there has to be a spiritual element to it.

591
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,840
In other words, one of the best, but believe it or not,

592
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,960
the best definition I've ever heard for this is by Scott Peck,

593
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,840
who's not my favorite writer.

594
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,320
But he said this great thing that love was being engaged

595
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,760
in the spiritual progress of somebody else

596
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,320
without insisting that they satisfy you.

597
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,520
And I think, and that definition, it seems to me,

598
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,480
could be carried over in a wide array of many different things

599
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,320
that happen in a way.

600
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,840
It could be physical or emotional or, I mean,

601
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,800
I think that covers a lot of ground, even sexually.

602
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,440
I think it could cover ground.

603
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,440
But sat the idea of getting something back in a relation,

604
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,000
in a love relationship, I think is where it gets screwy.

605
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,880
I really do.

606
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,880
I mean, and particularly when you have love

607
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,560
for something that is not a person.

608
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,520
I mean, I love many, many things in the world

609
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,360
that have nothing.

610
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,040
And the other thing I was thinking of was I got a letter

611
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,000
from a wonderful writer named William Maxwell.

612
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,080
You were talking about animals.

613
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,160
I mean, there's nothing greater on this planet than that love.

614
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,120
I mean, we all agree right there.

615
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,440
I mean, that this should be an animal planet.

616
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,000
And we should be the guardians of the animals.

617
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,120
I really believe that.

618
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,200
And there's this wonderful letter from William Maxwell

619
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,320
who said that he'd read my book.

620
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,120
And he said, we were going back and forth about horses.

621
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,920
And he had this horse story that he wanted to tell me.

622
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,520
And he said, when I was 17, I fell in love

623
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,600
with a mayor named Diana.

624
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,120
And because this is a true love story, never saw a hurricane.

625
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:46,720
Well, I just wanted to, I noticed that I've been relatively

626
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,480
quiet as a moderator.

627
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,120
And there are a number of reasons for that.

628
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,120
One is that I was aware that if I didn't say anything,

629
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,640
a little bit like an analyst in the quiet phase,

630
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,200
the conversation seemed to be moving in the direction

631
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,680
of sort of, I think, deeper issues and themes

632
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,360
that involve the human being.

633
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,680
And I thought, well, I could let this go on

634
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,880
and before long we'll have the id will be on the table.

635
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,040
But I do want to, first of all, say that Lucy, when you said,

636
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,840
you know, you apologize for using the word unconscious,

637
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,800
you don't have to apologize for bringing the unconscious

638
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,480
into our conversation.

639
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,320
The aspect of falling in love and being in love

640
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,120
and relating in general has, to my way of seeing it,

641
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,280
always involves images that people have of the other.

642
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,720
And they either want to find that image out there somewhere,

643
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,040
or if they don't find it, they will try to create that image,

644
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,280
some image they have within themselves

645
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,920
of what they would feel most comfortable with.

646
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:59,360
And then they will try to induce the image of the other

647
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,280
in images that they have of that person.

648
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,240
Of course, it gets further complicated

649
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,120
by the other person that similarly has images.

650
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,440
And that's where my profession comes in,

651
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,160
because when I, there's a couple of therapists,

652
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,680
almost always the problem, presenting problem,

653
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,200
is the image that people have of one another

654
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,840
doesn't fit the person who they're with.

655
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,600
And that seems to me the human condition.

656
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,840
There's nobody who's going to be a symbiotic twin,

657
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,960
or be exactly the way you want them to be,

658
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,760
or to be the same as you.

659
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,320
And so I did want to bring that up as a...

660
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,920
So, first, how do you avoid that trap?

661
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,880
Which trap?

662
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,720
Well, I mean...

663
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,080
Looking for your twin.

664
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,640
Well, there are a number of ways to do that.

665
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,120
In the therapeutic world, there are two ways

666
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,840
that that can happen in the traditional psychoanalytic framework.

667
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,240
A patient comes in and begins to transfer feelings

668
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,920
onto the analysts that are totally sort of in their head.

669
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,600
And the analyst then tries to interpret what image

670
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,040
are they trying to create in the analyst

671
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,880
is it some version of a sibling,

672
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,200
or a parent, a father, or a mother.

673
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,960
And by gaining some insight into that,

674
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,720
they can say, well, this is something I have to keep my eye on,

675
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,760
that I don't fall into that trap

676
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,440
that you sort of suggest that we all fall into.

677
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,200
Now, when I see a couple, in some ways,

678
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,280
it's somewhat easier to me because each party

679
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,920
is projecting onto the other person

680
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,680
some irrational parts of themselves.

681
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,920
And one can do two for the press of one, so to speak.

682
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,120
The transparencies are going on both ways.

683
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,360
And so you can then begin to examine that

684
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,200
and help them also get greater insight

685
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:00,000
into who they are, what they're about, and who they want to be.

686
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,120
Before, when you were telling me about your analyst

687
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,320
said to you, there's a book in there.

688
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,160
I thought to myself, my analyst never told me

689
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,120
there was a book in the middle of me.

690
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,520
I didn't have an analyst who told me

691
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,640
that I wrote a book anyway.

692
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,280
But I wasn't told that I had a book that might come out.

693
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,960
Now, that's a different intervention

694
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,040
that your analyst got.

695
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,640
I was like, I'm a career coach.

696
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,640
Huh?

697
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
Yeah, I would.

698
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,880
So, but this goes on in the analytic and in the therapeutic

699
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,800
room as well, that is there are transparencies

700
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,560
and counter-transparencies between the patient

701
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,560
and their therapist.

702
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,440
And hopefully, the therapist is not overly filling the room

703
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,000
with his or her transparencies.

704
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,600
But anyway, I was just struck by how almost everything we say

705
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,160
ultimately brings up our own way of being in the world.

706
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,680
Not Stephen, but Michael.

707
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,320
Michael.

708
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,080
Well, Stephen is my son.

709
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,840
I knew somebody.

710
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,880
I knew somebody.

711
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,560
Lots of transparencies.

712
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,400
Well, you asked me.

713
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
I told you.

714
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,560
I'm not asked.

715
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,320
So Michael, you had a lot of affect

716
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,360
when you were talking.

717
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,440
That comes from who you are and what you think

718
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,520
is a normal or regular way of being in the world.

719
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,440
It's not the same as the other people in the room.

720
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,960
It's who you are.

721
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,840
So that's what I think a second analysis

722
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,920
has to offer people.

723
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,280
That is to examine themselves at the same time

724
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,000
that they are examining the world and who they're with

725
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,080
and what they're doing.

726
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,040
And it's all in the way around the team.

727
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,320
I think it's on that ground when people are most themselves

728
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,920
that you fall in love.

729
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,240
But what I'm having a problem with

730
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,080
is that everybody's talking about something else.

731
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,760
I'm not so sure.

732
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,520
You're all talking about love.

733
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,160
To begin with, I'm not understanding from your definitions

734
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,760
what is love.

735
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,760
He's talking about dating and thoughts

736
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,760
you have about the person before you have met them.

737
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,640
You are talking about meeting the person

738
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,920
and maybe losing all those thoughts that you had or not

739
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,840
losing.

740
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,640
You are talking and saying it was a good thing

741
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,080
that some of these people, in fact, didn't meet the women

742
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,200
because if they had met, it wouldn't have worked out

743
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,440
and would have been back.

744
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,360
And when you talk about it, you talk about reward centers

745
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,560
and that is present in animals.

746
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,360
And so I'm not so sure.

747
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,360
And you talk about varieties of love.

748
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,080
You mentioned a number of them.

749
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,080
So what is it you people think love is?

750
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,000
Is it sex?

751
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,840
Is it love?

752
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,760
Is it love and sex?

753
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,880
Is no sex at all?

754
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,720
What is it?

755
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,520
It's the opposite of everyone.

756
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,040
I'm not being so close.

757
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,480
Like I really, I didn't say what it was.

758
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,760
I think a number of things.

759
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,720
It's the opposite of fear.

760
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,760
And it's not demanding that somebody

761
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,400
is satisfied if you are in the relationship.

762
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
I think those two things.

763
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,200
It has been the opposite because there are a lot of people

764
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,640
who are full of anxiety but also think they are in love or love.

765
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,040
But there's a lot of anxiety.

766
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,520
I'm sorry.

767
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,000
They're in something else.

768
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,520
You have a sense of certainty.

769
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,520
I have to jump in.

770
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,240
Jump.

771
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,520
Because I want to comment on what you said.

772
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,600
And you can imagine how from the brain studies,

773
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,160
how true some of the things you said may be.

774
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,360
And in the next round table, you're

775
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,640
going to be talking about fear.

776
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,480
And you'll have Joe Ludu here.

777
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,960
He was the one who really discovered the amygdala.

778
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,000
Please, a big role in fear.

779
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,120
Now, there's another thing that happens in the brain

780
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,120
when people look at their beloved, at their romantic partner.

781
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,280
There's one area of the brain where activity

782
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,480
goes down tremendously in everybody.

783
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,560
And it's in the amygdala.

784
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,040
What?

785
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,120
It's in the amygdala, which we know

786
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,520
plays a big role in mediating our feelings of fear.

787
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,560
Now, anxiety too, but anxiety is different.

788
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,920
And you can certainly be.

789
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,120
You can have all these emotions around love of anxiety.

790
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,880
And you can be sad.

791
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,080
You can be euphoric.

792
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,040
You can have lots of emotions around love.

793
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:31,800
My idea is that love is best described as a drive,

794
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,800
a drive toward another person.

795
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,120
And when that comes, let me tell you some interesting data

796
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,160
we just got.

797
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,200
We did a study of people, they happened to be in China.

798
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,560
They were in love.

799
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,440
We scanned them four years ago.

800
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,440
So they were deeply in love.

801
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,600
And we called them four years later to say,

802
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,120
are you still with that person?

803
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,680
And we weren't sure that anything would predict.

804
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,520
We were looking for predictions.

805
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,440
Would there be a difference between those

806
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,840
who were still together compared to those who had broken up?

807
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,000
One of them, there turned out to be a difference.

808
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,200
I was stunned.

809
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,720
It was real.

810
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,160
But it's so consistent with some psychology,

811
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,600
because one of the things was parts of the brain that

812
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,640
are associated with negative judgment

813
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,800
showed a decrease in activity.

814
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,040
It's one thing that's interesting.

815
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,640
But the other thing that addresses what you said

816
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,040
is that there was a decrease in activity

817
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,600
of parts of the brain, and I'd have

818
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,160
to summarize a lot of stuff, that have

819
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,560
to do with our sense of self.

820
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,560
And what it looked like people were doing

821
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,520
was actually, first of all, not judging

822
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,920
the other person negatively, but secondly, also in some way

823
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,240
suppressing their sense of self.

824
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:12,120
And it does indeed, the psychologists know a lot about this.

825
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,920
They call it incorporation of other in the self.

826
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,360
A lot of people who study romance and relationships,

827
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,720
and there's even a scale for incorporation

828
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,440
of other in the self.

829
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,040
And that ability to incorporate someone,

830
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,560
you're incorporating someone in your sense of self.

831
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,960
Some people think that romance is actually

832
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,360
a very fast expansion of the self.

833
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,640
Self-expansion.

834
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,800
That's a great thing.

835
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,120
My colleague, Art Aaron, who's a psychologist who studied

836
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,440
love all of his career, his email address

837
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,960
is at self-expansion.

838
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,520
Not going to get it.

839
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,040
But so it's a rapid expansion of the self,

840
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:04,120
but also perhaps the ability to indeed put your needs kind

841
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,280
of last, even, the other person first.

842
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,480
And by the way, I just have to say one other thing,

843
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,080
because you mentioned animals.

844
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,800
And I grew up on a farm with horses, actually,

845
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,200
and love dogs and animals.

846
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,040
One of the things that I actually did for myself

847
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,800
was to scan myself to looking at my beloved dog.

848
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,300
OK.

849
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:43,160
But it was different from looking at my newlywed husband.

850
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:49,480
This ventral-tagmental area that is in the brainstem,

851
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,520
that is this area of the brain we share with other animals,

852
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,280
was not activated, although I was surprised.

853
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,120
So does that say about what that part of the?

854
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,600
So it's not the same drive.

855
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,840
And it's not the same complexity,

856
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:10,400
because the dog accepts anything.

857
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:18,880
Perhaps also I know that my self and my survival

858
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,320
is not dependent on her.

859
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,560
Whereas for my husband, I now, after doing these studies

860
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:30,520
for 10 years or more, I have come to see romantic love

861
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,440
and attachment as part of our survival systems.

862
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,520
We take them for granted.

863
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,240
Also, I've studied the motor system in neurology.

864
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,920
We take standing up against gravity for granted.

865
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,640
We take love and attachment for granted.

866
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,600
But they are actually essential for our survival.

867
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,880
It's my way of looking at it now.

868
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,360
That's a big illusion.

869
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,960
It's a big illusion to take it for granted

870
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,600
that the love is there and it's unconditional.

871
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,160
In your own research, I think you also

872
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,920
look at people who fall out of love.

873
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,440
Yes.

874
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,960
And what's the other side, the falling love that

875
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,000
is falling out of love?

876
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,480
The cruel tale of love.

877
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,640
What why do you fall out of love?

878
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:22,080
Well, the other night I watched the Metropolitan's version

879
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,200
of Othello, some of you may have watched it.

880
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,280
And you're watching a man who's so unbelievably in love

881
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,680
with Desdemona.

882
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,960
And shortly within just a short period of time,

883
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,600
Iago has him questioning that love.

884
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,560
And before you know it, he hates his wife

885
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,800
and is about any proceeds to murder her.

886
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,760
So I think we can't have this discussion

887
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,120
without looking at the dialectic of love and love and hate.

888
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,040
It will fear you.

889
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,440
I'd like to jump in there too.

890
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,320
First of all, I don't want to be held accountable

891
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,800
for what my Renaissance people thought about each other.

892
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,680
That's not my own personal feelings

893
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,720
and that love.

894
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,880
I prefer to meet the people that I idealize.

895
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,440
But it's very important, actually,

896
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,320
in the whole Renaissance system, the cruelty of love,

897
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,160
the opposite side of it.

898
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:26,240
And so, in fact, if they had been confronted with your evidence,

899
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,760
I think that for most people in the Renaissance,

900
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,520
they would say that proves that our system is the best.

901
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,560
Because what we are looking for, what we're looking for to build,

902
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:43,520
is a system of life that guarantees the survival

903
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,280
of the people in it.

904
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,880
And that gives them that kind of trust in faith

905
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,080
in the next day that they did not find an extreme romantic love.

906
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,720
What they found was an attachment.

907
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:06,760
That attachment led to a solid base for love, for ongoing love,

908
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,680
and for family.

909
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,560
And what they feared the most was the cruelty of love,

910
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,120
the betrayal, the loss, which, of course, for women

911
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,200
was catastrophe.

912
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,880
That if you could not put your faith in the actual family

913
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,960
building side of love.

914
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,840
So when they would have looked at the picture of their loved one,

915
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,720
they would have wanted that to be someone

916
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,120
who was going to be there the next year, the next year,

917
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,080
and then that would have been something that would have led

918
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:44,320
them to a satisfaction in life and to an avoidance of fear.

919
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,320
We put a lot of faith in romantic love

920
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,720
and the hope that it will continue, or so it seems to me.

921
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,120
I'd like to bring up another play, actually.

922
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,560
Sylvia the Goat is a play that Edward Albie wrote,

923
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,400
and in which a man falls in love with a goat.

924
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,800
And during the course of the play, someone asked him,

925
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,200
well, why did you fall in love with a goat?

926
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,000
How could that be?

927
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
He said, it was a look in the goat's eyes.

928
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,800
Somehow there was some kind of eye contact that was made.

929
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,000
At least that's what Albie gives,

930
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,400
is the modus of falling in love.

931
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,400
There's something about the eye contact, which, of course,

932
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
as an analyst, I'm listening to this and thinking,

933
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:38,400
what I haven't said yet in this symposium is that falling in love,

934
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,400
as Freud said, is refinding a love object.

935
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:49,400
That is, one infantile experiences dictate largely

936
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,400
what happens later in people's lives.

937
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,400
They may not want to believe that,

938
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,400
but the infantile sexuality has its way.

939
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,400
The finding itself in the adult world,

940
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:08,400
whether it's on the internet or whether it's letter writing

941
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,400
between people, actually, we're talking about how our parents met.

942
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:19,400
My parents met via my mother's brother putting an ad in the paper

943
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,400
in 1910 or something like that.

944
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,400
That was an early form of online data.

945
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

946
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,400
Of course, here's where sociology and anthropology come in.

947
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,400
We alluded to our cultures play a role in all of these questions as well.

948
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,400
We're going to have an anthropologist here this afternoon,

949
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
as well, there are a number of other disciplines.

950
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,400
We don't have the whole field to ourselves.

951
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,400
Anthropologists have a lot to say about what happens at any particular period of time,

952
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:56,400
like in the Renaissance, arranged marriages, outnumbered marriages by choice.

953
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,400
So there's no one kind of theory that's going to explain everything.

954
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:11,400
There's going to be a series of different factors that make for what happens at any particular time in our own history.

955
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,400
Can I say something about Albee for just a minute?

956
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,400
Albee.

957
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,400
He writes the most unlovable creatures on the American stage.

958
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,400
I mean, it was interesting that you brought up that particular play,

959
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,400
which I actually think is his best play, but look at his work.

960
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,400
He knows nothing about romantic love.

961
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,400
Really? It's what he's about. That's what his plays are about.

962
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,400
It's about the cruelty of love.

963
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,400
Well, he's not, maybe he would say that's not what he's writing about.

964
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,400
He would say many things. I did an interview with Edward Albee.

965
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,400
And I felt like I was interviewing an imposter, to be honest with you.

966
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
I never felt like I was getting the truth.

967
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,400
I tell you, to give you an example of how I think there was some truth in that play.

968
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:59,400
As the play moves on, you learn that George, when he was a teenager,

969
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:04,400
was in an auto accident in which he ran over his parents and killed them.

970
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,400
You talk about Virginia Woolf.

971
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,400
You talk about him as a friend of Virginia Woolf.

972
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,400
Yeah, he was a friend of Virginia Woolf.

973
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,400
And then Martha, we learned that Martha, when she was a young girl, her mother died.

974
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,400
Father remarried, and her stepmother also died.

975
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:26,400
So here you have two people who had loss of their one parent or two parents in their early years.

976
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,400
So what do they end up doing?

977
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,400
They end up hooking up with each other for a lot of other reasons,

978
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,400
and they don't have a child, except for the one that they make believe.

979
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,400
So here they are, because it's dangerous to have a child.

980
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,400
A child will kill you sooner or later.

981
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,400
So, I mean, I don't think that there's no truth in that play.

982
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,400
They love each other.

983
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:50,400
I think, you know, I knew when we were going to meet that there was going to be no agreement

984
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,400
about what love means, what...

985
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,400
Love means every time to say you're sorry.

986
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,400
I think it's one of the most misused words in English language.

987
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,400
And I was hoping that one of the things that would come out of this symposium

988
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,400
is that we give this word up.

989
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,400
It's not a word that means very much, except to what we want it to mean

990
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,400
and how we imagine it.

991
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,400
But what about love of the world?

992
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,400
I disagree. I'll just have to go on the record.

993
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,400
Yeah, you disagree with what?

994
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
Yeah, because that's what you're saying.

995
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,400
No, I think romance and love is something very specific.

996
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,400
I think we can be very specific about it.

997
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,400
I think we can describe its behavioral symptoms very clearly.

998
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
A certain kind of love.

999
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,400
And well, romance, a attachment, companion at love,

1000
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,400
and I think there can be definitions for all of the internal love.

1001
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,400
Yeah, but then we have parental love and we have platonic love.

1002
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,400
We can be very specific about the definitions.

1003
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,400
We can be specific about the definitions, and I think...

1004
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,400
And we see it in behavior.

1005
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,400
We can describe it behaviorally, I think, to each other quite easily.

1006
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,400
And anything that you see in behavior or any difference,

1007
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,400
there may be many types of love.

1008
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,400
But if you can describe it behaviorally,

1009
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,400
you know there's going to be a different brain system there,

1010
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,400
also mediating it.

1011
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,400
And I think one of the things that actually neuroscience can help

1012
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,400
to do is to help us with these definitions.

1013
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,400
And to realize we can come up with definitions for these things.

1014
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,400
Well, I think we can make correlations between the caudate nucleus

1015
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,400
lighting up and some kind of grooming behavior

1016
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,400
between either two animals or two humans.

1017
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,400
You can correlate them, but you can't say anything about what's causing

1018
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,400
which and whether you decide to call it love is a matter of definition.

1019
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,400
Not whether you're causing it, but it depends upon where it is now.

1020
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:54,400
For example, if I had found that everybody's pre-frontal,

1021
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,400
medial prefrontal cortex was active in this study,

1022
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,400
I would have a very different story to tell you, or maybe no story.

1023
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,400
The fact that it was in this primitive part of the brain

1024
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,400
gives me more to tell you about it

1025
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,400
and why it may be so hard to control when you fall in love.

1026
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,400
And by the way, so romance can indeed bring pain,

1027
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,400
and it does, and there's nothing like heartbreak,

1028
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,400
and even whole cultures are afraid of love.

1029
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,400
But the fact is for many people,

1030
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,400
when they are in a relationship and they were in love

1031
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,400
and they stay together and sometimes even in arranged marriages,

1032
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,400
you do fall in love after you get married.

1033
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:47,400
That romance period often plays a critical role in keeping the couple together.

1034
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,400
They can remember it when things aren't so good.

1035
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,400
I think that romance does play a role in attachment later, too.

1036
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,400
And so I do think...

1037
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,400
What if there's never any attachment?

1038
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Then you go on to somebody else?

1039
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,400
No, no, no.

1040
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:15,400
Does the result, or sort of, you know, the goal of love?

1041
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,400
You can fall out of love.

1042
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,400
Have anything to do with the definition?

1043
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,400
So like, if I'm in it for...

1044
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
We can hear you.

1045
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Hello?

1046
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,400
Do you read what you said?

1047
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:37,400
Yeah, I was just asking Lucy if the result of the relationship

1048
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,400
has any effect on what sort of love existed.

1049
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:46,400
So if it winds up being a week-long relationship or a 50-year marriage,

1050
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:54,400
does that fact then affect what actually happened from a neurological perspective?

1051
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,400
Between the people?

1052
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:04,400
Or is the love, at least from your perspective, analyzed as a separate thing?

1053
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,400
I'm not sure I understand your question.

1054
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,400
So what is the reason to be in love?

1055
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,400
Is there a reason for it?

1056
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,400
Yes, it's part of the human reproductive strategy.

1057
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,400
You have sex?

1058
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,400
Now wait a minute.

1059
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,400
I take issue with that.

1060
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,400
I'm not reproducing nothing.

1061
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,400
No, but you have a partner who is making you safer.

1062
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,400
It's even known...

1063
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:35,400
There have been a lot of studies that suggest that people live longer when they're in partnerships

1064
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,400
and you're safer when you're walking down New York City Street.

1065
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,400
It's survival.

1066
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,400
You're safer when you're walking down the street when you're with someone else.

1067
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,400
So it's not just part of the reproductive strategy and part of the safety strategy.

1068
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,400
But an important...

1069
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,400
It makes romance very unromantic.

1070
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,400
It's not a new reproduction.

1071
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,400
Even you're strong in love.

1072
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,400
It doesn't.

1073
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,400
When you fall in love, you very often...

1074
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,400
And I'm not talking about our society right now, remember?

1075
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,400
I'm talking about the evolution, or even human evolution,

1076
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,400
before there were such constraints,

1077
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,400
that romance was there.

1078
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,400
And then there were some things often...

1079
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,400
One way of looking at it, which I say, here's a working hypothesis.

1080
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,400
Okay, okay.

1081
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,400
That you've got sex, which just...

1082
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,400
You have to have the capability, you know?

1083
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,400
And sex brings pleasure too, besides being reproductive.

1084
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,400
But we do need to reproduce to survive as a species.

1085
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,400
Okay, we just do.

1086
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
But it's a different issue.

1087
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,400
But...

1088
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,400
No, no, no, it's not necessarily because you've got sex.

1089
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,400
But then you've got romance that keeps you focused.

1090
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,400
That's what I'm saying, I just said that.

1091
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,400
But they do it because it's part of a larger societal...

1092
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,400
People from many reads.

1093
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:05,400
Yeah, they do it for lots of reads, aside from some innate feeling that they won't be a person.

1094
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,400
Okay, I say you have your individual...

1095
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,400
Time out, time out.

1096
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,400
I knew this was going to happen.

1097
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,400
No, I just...

1098
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,400
I think we should keep it in open.

1099
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,400
I think we should be... I'm not being head over with sexist either.

1100
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,400
I don't mean to sound head over sexist.

1101
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,400
But I'm just saying, whatever, we're head over from people.

1102
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,400
Excuse me, there are a lot of assumptions that are being made here by all of us.

1103
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:35,400
One is that falling in love is good for our species and it helps with reproduction and survival.

1104
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,400
That's no longer true.

1105
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:44,400
It's no longer true that we as a species are going to do well by increasing our population at all.

1106
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,400
And more to do more to the world.

1107
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:52,400
And then as far as you're talking about reproduction, you know, when you're a teacher...

1108
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,400
Is Edward Albee says, it can ruin you.

1109
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,400
I mean, it's the opposite.

1110
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:01,400
When you're teaching students, you're doing a form of reproduction there as well.

1111
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:09,400
I mean, if you take it in a narrow reproduction of infants, that's not the only kind of reproduction that there is.

1112
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,400
Is reproduction of students?

1113
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,400
There's reproduction of students.

1114
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,400
Just went off.

1115
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,400
I think they all went off.

1116
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,400
You might want...

1117
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,400
Or techies went off.

1118
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,400
Just when it was getting good.

1119
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,400
I totally guess.

1120
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
You're absolutely right.

1121
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,400
I like that definition.

1122
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,400
You shouldn't say you put yourself down by saying, I don't reproduce.

1123
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,400
But that's just not true.

1124
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,400
Okay.

1125
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,400
I mean, we all reproduce in different ways.

1126
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,400
Right.

1127
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,400
And hopefully we reproduce in a positive way.

1128
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,400
Yeah.

1129
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,400
No, no, no, fine.

1130
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,400
Nurturing.

1131
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,400
But you know where I was going when I before too.

1132
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,400
I'm just saying, I think it's a loaded word.

1133
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,400
And if we make it more open, that's great.

1134
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,400
If we all know what the definition is, that we're all using fine.

1135
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,400
That wasn't the initial.

1136
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,400
Well, let us say that...

1137
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,400
Let us say that...

1138
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:07,400
Specifically just for reproductive purposes, there is no need for love.

1139
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:12,400
You can have sex and have kids without having love for the person with whom you had sex.

1140
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,400
So love in that way, that's why I look...

1141
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,400
We're shut down.

1142
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,400
So is that my...

1143
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,400
Is that my...

1144
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,400
Nothing's working.

1145
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,400
We're all going to have to speak louder.

1146
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,400
Just imagine.

1147
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Oh, no, here it goes.

1148
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,400
Here it goes.

1149
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,400
It's back on.

1150
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,400
Are we back?

1151
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,400
Yes, we're back.

1152
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,400
It's like a Super Bowl.

1153
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,400
You know, it's just a soul.

1154
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400
The lights are off.

1155
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,400
That's why I think that...

1156
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,400
There you go.

1157
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:49,400
That's why I think that it becomes a kind of just turning around and around because we don't start with proper definitions of the term.

1158
01:00:49,400 --> 01:01:02,400
And there are so many varieties of it, and it's not even clear what we mean when we talk about love, that it has the kind of correlation that you talk about.

1159
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:11,400
For example, you gave that when somebody is in love sees the face of the beloved, the amygdala coitons them.

1160
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:17,400
If he sees the face of a familiar person where there is no danger, the amygdala would quieten them.

1161
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,400
Oh, no, the experiment was comparing those two.

1162
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
But it does quieten it then.

1163
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:31,400
So we need to be more, I think, precise in terms of defining it, especially from the neuroscience point of view.

1164
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:37,400
Because neuroscience is what's going to enlighten us about some of the biological aspects of this.

1165
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,400
But of course, we don't only have to deal with neuroscience.

1166
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,400
It's an event that happens in life, and we need to see what is it about?

1167
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,400
But maybe it's the adjectives that help us.

1168
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,400
I mean, we are a little bit fixed, right?

1169
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,400
We have been a little fixed so far in this romantic love.

1170
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:03,400
And actually, I'd be very interested to know whether anyone in your field is doing the same kind of work on parents looking at children.

1171
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:10,400
And that's also survival, that's also building attachment and so on.

1172
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:20,400
And what would differentiate neurologically, what would differentiate that from a romantic impulse?

1173
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:30,400
Quite specifically, it's interesting that oxytocin, for example, which is also called milk let down factor.

1174
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,400
It's very important at childbirth.

1175
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:47,400
Oxytocin appears to play a big role in the brain to mediate these attachment feelings and behaviors that we engage in as parents.

1176
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:53,400
And also later in the relationship with a partner, I'll call it.

1177
01:02:53,400 --> 01:03:01,400
Yes, people are investigating this, and it's different from romance.

1178
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:13,400
It's using different brain systems and mainly different neurotransmitters or chemicals or hormones to have different things involved.

1179
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:25,400
So, and to go along with that when you were speaking about the group in China and going back four years later and seeing how they had progressed, let's say.

1180
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:32,400
So then by then, that extreme romantic love was probably pretty much played out for most of them.

1181
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:38,400
So then either they had split off from each other or they had built some other kind of attachment.

1182
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,400
So, what did that look like?

1183
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,400
I'm not so much talking about the splitting off.

1184
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:51,400
Those people probably were ready for new romantic love, but the people who were attached but not so energized anymore.

1185
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:59,400
So that too, the attachment seems to be, it's a little more complicated in the brain.

1186
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,400
It's higher up in the brain.

1187
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,400
It's not so much the reflex level.

1188
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:10,400
But it's still part of the reward system, by the way.

1189
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:17,400
But it's part of the reward system that's getting much more information from cognitive areas, these frontal areas of the brain.

1190
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:24,400
The attachment system is much more dependent upon probably your experiences with that person.

1191
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:32,400
You're not just memories about perhaps primary caregivers, but memories about with that person, what you've done,

1192
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:40,400
your evaluation of them, you're constantly, it turns out, we're constantly making evaluations about the situations

1193
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:48,400
we're in, and the people who we're looking at, and what we might get from it actually.

1194
01:04:48,400 --> 01:05:02,400
But this whole idea that attachment is quite different, more cognitively based, certainly more complex.

1195
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:09,400
So does this satisfy you if you put different adjectives in front of the word love, then you have...

1196
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:15,400
It depends at what level of discourse you are talking about.

1197
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:23,400
If you are talking about poetry and you want to use love to communicate something that appeals to you,

1198
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,400
feels that you're expressing something and communicating that appeals to the other,

1199
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:33,400
then it doesn't matter exactly what the definition of love is.

1200
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:40,400
When you move gradually towards psychoanalysis for that matter and towards neuroscience,

1201
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:47,400
where you're talking about the workings of the mind and the brain, then the ways you distinguish them

1202
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,400
and you define them become very, very important.

1203
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:57,400
For example, his maternal love, the same as romantic love.

1204
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:04,400
So it becomes increasingly more important depending on where you are.

1205
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,400
So that's all I'm trying to say, that we need to be...

1206
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,400
No, I don't need to say no matter what.

1207
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,400
No matter which way we look at it, it's multi-factorial.

1208
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:24,400
So anyone can study a level and get clarity with it, but you can only measure one level at a time.

1209
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,400
And then there are other levels that you can't study at the same time that you're studying one level.

1210
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:36,400
I would bring in here from a scientific point of view that we live in a world of scientific uncertainty.

1211
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:41,400
We cannot know the truth about everything through science.

1212
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:46,400
And I doubt that when Obama's plan for 10 years of mapping the brain,

1213
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,400
that we're going to know very much more than we know Shakespeare or some poet can tell us about love.

1214
01:06:52,400 --> 01:07:00,400
So let me tell you, I have a colleague named Simmer Zeki who was one of the other very first people to study

1215
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,400
romantic love and the brain systems of romantic love.

1216
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:13,400
And as he says, it's poetry and literature from the past that really help neuroscience inform neuroscience

1217
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:19,400
about love and kind of... and how to interpret what we see.

1218
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:30,400
Remember, a neuroscientist really thinks that all of our behavior is based in a brain system, right?

1219
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,400
And that it's all of behavior is physiological, some level, all right?

1220
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:46,400
So literature is just a... and poetry is really... is just a reflection of what's going on in our brains.

1221
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:51,400
But I had to, because poetry has been mentioned like 20 times in the last 10 minutes, I just have to ask.

1222
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:57,400
If that's true, what everybody's saying about poetry, why do so few people read it?

1223
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:03,400
It's an interesting question. It makes up that people write it generally.

1224
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,400
That's only a very recent development.

1225
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:11,400
By the way, I think a red poet, a tree at home in the Renaissance.

1226
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:17,400
And all the way through to Virginia Woolf's family where they all read poetry sitting around at home at night.

1227
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:21,400
I think it... and I happen to be married to someone who's Russian.

1228
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:26,400
And they read poetry to each other when he was growing up, so well into the 1970s.

1229
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,400
And it's definitely an American.

1230
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,400
But what would you say about all the popular songs that all the kids are listening to?

1231
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,400
I think they're all about the fact that if you don't have a partner, you're nothing.

1232
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,400
No, but...

1233
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:43,400
I think... is it... I mean, the Supremes say, you know, whenever you're near me, I hear a symphony.

1234
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,400
Is that poetry to you?

1235
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,400
No, it's a song lyric. That's not a bad song lyric.

1236
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,400
It's a pretty good song lyric.

1237
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:54,400
But is it anywhere close to poetry? I think more people are...

1238
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,400
Why is a song not a poem? Because it's a song.

1239
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,400
But a poem is a song as well.

1240
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,400
I could sing your poem and have a guitar or whatever.

1241
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,400
It could always be a song.

1242
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:12,400
I could sing this. No, everyone would leave, but I mean, I could sing this.

1243
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:17,400
And it's, you know, I don't know if there is that, but you know, it's rhyming, it's fine.

1244
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,400
Very short phrases, pippies.

1245
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,400
Yeah, but I think song lyrics get... I think songs are like sorry, not a poem.

1246
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,400
Yeah, I think it's more of a hurry than even a poem is.

1247
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,400
And they generally, I mean, forgive me for saying this, but most of the popular songs are right.

1248
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,400
It's so important to really roll lyrics if no one longer with us.

1249
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,400
There are a lot of great lyricists in the world. And let's face it.

1250
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:46,400
Right, it is different, but there may be some... I'm just trying to think... I'm not sure we're not...

1251
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:54,400
There aren't as many people maybe reading poetry now, but I think there's some poetry in people's lives in music lyrics, for example.

1252
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,400
Absolutely. I'm not saying that. I mean, God forbid.

1253
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,400
But wives are empty. But I also think it's an American phenomenon.

1254
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:09,400
And if you go to other countries in the world, you will find that poetry is very valuable.

1255
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:15,400
People will stand online in front of a bookstore in Russia when a new book of poems comes out.

1256
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,400
They need it as they need bread, but not in this country.

1257
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:23,400
And the reason not in this country is because people don't want to deal with their feelings most of the time.

1258
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,400
People don't want to deal with it.

1259
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,400
And poetry is about...

1260
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,400
They don't want to face what they're feeling.

1261
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:31,400
That's why... Look at this. That's technology.

1262
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,400
Well, it also just stands down to people who don't get it.

1263
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,400
They actually go to Fred.

1264
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,400
Yeah, I think they don't get it.

1265
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,400
You don't understand poetry.

1266
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,400
Since there's been a period of time.

1267
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,400
You stand in the middle reading.

1268
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,400
All you have to do is read it. And you understand it.

1269
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,400
Well, you don't understand astrophysics.

1270
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,400
It's going to be a plea. A plea here.

1271
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,400
It's going to be a plea here.

1272
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,400
It's going to be a plea here.

1273
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,400
You know?

1274
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,400
Like go to Dr. Ruth. It's going to be a plea to go to Fred.

1275
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,400
Well, first of all, I want to say about the audience that you've been...

1276
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,400
I'd like to say about the audience.

1277
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:01,400
That the audience has been extraordinarily patient and...

1278
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:08,400
And hopefully absorbed in the noise that's been going on here at the rat table.

1279
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,400
But we do like to hear from the audience.

1280
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:16,400
And so I thought maybe we'd have a few questions for 15 minutes or so.

1281
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,400
And then maybe we could have a chance to respond.

1282
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,400
You have to go to the mic when you have questions.

1283
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,400
Hi.

1284
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,400
I was very...

1285
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,400
I've taken Dr. Brown with your description of love.

1286
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,400
And to me, it sounds like a very addictive thing.

1287
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,400
Yeah?

1288
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:43,400
And so I was wondering if you could talk about that and whether any research is being done

1289
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,400
between romantic love and addiction.

1290
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:50,400
Because it sounds like it hits the same brain areas that addictive substances hit.

1291
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,400
So, indeed, thank you for bringing that up.

1292
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,400
She's a plant.

1293
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,400
She's a plant.

1294
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,400
She's a plant.

1295
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:01,400
Because when we first started doing these studies,

1296
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,400
that was one of the things I was interested in,

1297
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,400
because I thought there were commonalities.

1298
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,400
And I predicted brain areas would be involved.

1299
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,400
We knew we were involved in addiction.

1300
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,400
So, of course, because of the clinical relevance,

1301
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,400
the drug addiction studies were done first.

1302
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:24,400
But it wasn't quite the same, but it was very similar.

1303
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:30,400
So, there's ventral tegmental area that I've told you about that's so critical to romance

1304
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:38,400
and is really the drive and reward system is also active when cocaine abusers are given cocaine

1305
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,400
and they feel high.

1306
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,400
Now, when you're heartbroken, think about it.

1307
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,400
Even when you're heartbroken, you can be even more obsessed about the person,

1308
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,400
and even more in a way addicted to the person,

1309
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:55,400
and you must be near them and you're constantly seeking them.

1310
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:02,400
And that's, it was under the condition of heartbreak that we saw that the drug addiction systems

1311
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,400
really become involved.

1312
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:10,400
So, what actually I was asked to go and speak at the National Institute for Drug Abuse,

1313
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:15,400
one of the things we really came up with is we were a kind of round table like this,

1314
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:20,400
was that the systems for romance may be the natural,

1315
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:27,400
it's the natural system that the drugs hop onto, you know, and activate really strongly.

1316
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:34,400
But the reason we're, we get addicted to drugs at all is because we have these natural systems for addiction.

1317
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,400
That's the system that's being used when you abuse drugs.

1318
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:44,400
We need that system there, we need to be addicted to some things,

1319
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,400
we need to be addicted to other people for protection.

1320
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:53,400
We need these attachments there.

1321
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:58,400
So is Casanova syndrome a true addiction?

1322
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,400
Ah, so, and so you mean by Casanova?

1323
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,400
Yeah.

1324
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,400
Pardon?

1325
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:13,400
Yes, you know, Don Juan Casanova syndrome is a true addiction.

1326
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:19,400
Then the Casanova syndrome where you have where the person goes from one person to another to another to another.

1327
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,400
Always falling in love, always falling in love.

1328
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,400
Spitzer, and then immediately moving on.

1329
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:32,400
Yeah, well, in a way, yes, it's a little like cocaine, they're constantly getting the dopamine rush.

1330
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:37,400
But that's different in a way, I think, from that other question that she has.

1331
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:42,400
You can be addicted to love, so you want to constantly go back and get, you know, fall in love again.

1332
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:50,400
But what I'm saying is that the, that system for most of us is there for a very good reason.

1333
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:59,400
And the natural system is, we are naturally addicted to each other, which is nice.

1334
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:06,400
So we keep seeking, we keep, we keep going on these dates and keep going online to try to find someone.

1335
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,400
And eventually people do.

1336
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:14,400
Heartbreak is there for sure, but that addiction is...

1337
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,400
Well, there's a lot of merry-go-round too, and online data.

1338
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:21,400
I mean, you mean a lot of people who they found a good person, they can't seem to make it work.

1339
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:26,400
And one of the reasons I think it's, is it's become easier to not make it work.

1340
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,400
Right, and you know what... Because of this new expanded pool and all the technology we have to meet...

1341
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:37,400
And I think it's more and more important for people to understand who, that it's so much who you are.

1342
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:43,400
If you are the kind of person who can suppress a negative judgment and put the other person first,

1343
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,400
you're much more likely to make a relationship work.

1344
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:52,400
We're going to have to try to keep these questions shorter and the answers shorter.

1345
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,400
Yes.

1346
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,400
Hello, one player's drive further.

1347
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,400
Do you love the...

1348
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,400
A class drive further?

1349
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,400
I'm a psychoanalyst and a family and couple therapist.

1350
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:07,400
So I'm just wondering if other people in the room, and I know Fred's worked very well and really respected

1351
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,400
and used in my teaching for many years.

1352
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:16,400
And what I'm thinking of is you have more in common than is led to believe.

1353
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:22,400
One of the thoughts I have is the biological model is very Freudian,

1354
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:31,400
and you do bring in the unconscious libido love, and then there's a fabric and a social drive.

1355
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:36,400
And here, and I Fred brings in developmental and it works together.

1356
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:41,400
Now, when you're talking about the capacity to fall in love,

1357
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:46,400
there's one thing in the capacity to stay in love and maintain love is something else.

1358
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:53,400
And it's a very important paper also by Otto Kerber who does the range and Fred is sort of alluding to that.

1359
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,400
And it's really important.

1360
01:16:55,400 --> 01:17:03,400
Now, when you have attachment and it is disruptive and insecure and all the stuff that we're all aware of

1361
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:08,400
with Dan Stern and Beatrice Bebe and a lot of work that's being done,

1362
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:14,400
what you do find is that the infant who has wired up, and this is the research,

1363
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:22,400
and it's wired up so that the attachment is loaded, if you will, with strife or whatever,

1364
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:28,400
and comes out developmentally, and affect, and cognition as you get older and repetition.

1365
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:33,400
And so we can really hear, if you want to pull it together in some way,

1366
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:37,400
that it can be a tension between these two spheres, but you can bring it together.

1367
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:42,400
So you're wired up, it makes it hard later to let yourself have,

1368
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,400
or that you could have if things had been different.

1369
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:50,400
And I think biologically we are wired or set up to connect,

1370
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:57,400
whether it's in the social fabric kind of way, or it's in the, if you will, sexual area, a little bit,

1371
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,400
and the species going on, it all works together.

1372
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:06,400
And I think this is room then for an integration from what we're listening to.

1373
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,400
Thank you.

1374
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:13,400
Next question. Lady here is in line.

1375
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:25,400
Very short comment, and I have a very short comment in the defense of sciences.

1376
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:30,400
I myself, the researcher in music cognition and professional pianist,

1377
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:38,400
there is a beautiful line by Pushkin about music that among the pleasures of life,

1378
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:45,400
music differs only to love, and music is a melody, but love itself is a melody.

1379
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:50,400
They are dealing with two very different fields,

1380
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:56,400
while art and music gives us knowledge in highly condensed form.

1381
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:02,400
Science is moved by very short, but very small steps toward knowledge,

1382
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:07,400
and learning about the intimate things that are learning about ourselves.

1383
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:12,400
It's a difficult pursuit, and in order to understand the complexity,

1384
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,400
we really have to be very intuitive.

1385
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:22,400
So I don't see any conflict in studying very complex things in sciences.

1386
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:26,400
And just because the sphere of love and sphere of music,

1387
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:32,400
they both suffer from this attitude that we cannot explain everything about love,

1388
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:38,400
everything about music, but it's not what we expect from sciences today.

1389
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:42,400
We expect learning by small steps about who we are.

1390
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,400
Thank you.

1391
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,400
Thank you.

1392
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:51,400
Could I, that was very lovely, but if I could also say something about music,

1393
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,400
actually one of the things that we haven't really gone into,

1394
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:59,400
which would be a very interesting further discussion here,

1395
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:05,400
is how the senses really play into the initiation of love,

1396
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:10,400
and in the Renaissance, it was strongly believed that there were two senses

1397
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:16,400
that led most directly to the sensation of love, vision,

1398
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:23,400
and hearing through music, that music was the accompaniment of love,

1399
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,400
and this is why you have so many pictures in which there is a loop player

1400
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:31,400
playing to Venus and so on, that those two senses were the things

1401
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:36,400
that were most closely connected to the feelings of love.

1402
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:41,400
This lady and then this gentleman, she was waiting.

1403
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,400
Sorry.

1404
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:53,400
I think this has been a wonderful discussion that could go on for hours

1405
01:20:53,400 --> 01:21:01,400
and hours and hours, having spent 43 years as a relationship

1406
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,400
and couples' experiments.

1407
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:10,400
I really, and I'm sure you know as well as I do,

1408
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:17,400
that the brain changes with trauma, and that's what the speaker before said,

1409
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:25,400
and that what most people have some form of trauma, which to me

1410
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:29,400
makes me wonder why they didn't want marriage and that thing,

1411
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:35,400
because there's so much trauma and fear of attachment out here,

1412
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,400
especially in New York City.

1413
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:48,400
And you talked about love being a fear, and you answered it so beautifully

1414
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:56,400
by saying, if you grow up in a touch with fear, your love is going to be fear.

1415
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,400
There is some standing here to say something,

1416
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:05,400
as I'm starting with the 20-year-old's in our society,

1417
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:13,400
that I think we need to know more how we were imprinted as children.

1418
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:18,400
When I was at the World Economic Forum and ran workshops,

1419
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:27,400
everybody had to answer the question, what did I learn about relationships

1420
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:37,400
by watching my parents, and that somehow is the answer to how do I attach,

1421
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,400
which I think is the same as love.

1422
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:46,400
I have a couple where he is an antique dealer,

1423
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:52,400
and his wife says he loves this and takes much more than he loves her.

1424
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:56,400
So I don't know what that means.

1425
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:02,400
I think this is an important discussion, but I think we all.

1426
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:10,400
I should be able to ask which one of you, everyone in the room here.

1427
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:15,400
How were you imprinted with love?

1428
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:20,400
Do you reach for somebody that you can never have?

1429
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:25,400
And then when the extra day turned around, you dropped them,

1430
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:29,400
because the intimacy becomes too much.

1431
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:35,400
Are you somebody who likes to be invaded and abused?

1432
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,400
Are you somebody who imbues somebody?

1433
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,400
That is the love imprint that we all have,

1434
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:46,400
and we should know about and be more conscious of.

1435
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,400
Thank you.

1436
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:53,400
You know, I just want to say that I think one thing that's very important

1437
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:59,400
is that we all have different attachment styles, really, too.

1438
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:06,400
And different personalities that are biologically based also,

1439
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,400
even genetically, and I think especially for the younger generation

1440
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:14,400
coming up and dealing with these kinds of dating situations,

1441
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,400
I think self-knowledge becomes even more important

1442
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:23,400
and knowing your attachment style, whether you're an avoidant or an anxious attachment.

1443
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:27,400
I mean, I think I do agree that a lot of the answer to that is exactly what you said,

1444
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:32,400
which is to look backward at the experience, and maybe, you know,

1445
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,400
the biology may have less to do with it than you think.

1446
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,400
Okay.

1447
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:44,400
Probably not surprising that in this crowd, I'm another psychoanalyst

1448
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:50,400
and a couple's therapist more years than I care to count.

1449
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:55,400
I agree that we need definitions.

1450
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:59,400
I hope what I'm saying is in no way against defining,

1451
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:04,400
but I think that it's a problem if when we ask what is love

1452
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:12,400
that we treat that as a noun and look for some kind of separate definition

1453
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:18,400
with a frame or an edge around it, it seems to me that love is a process

1454
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,400
and it keeps changing even between the same two people.

1455
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:26,400
And it's a developmental process, what's more,

1456
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:30,400
and it goes through a lot of stages that may begin with infatuation

1457
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:37,400
or some kind of erotic chemical response, may begin with an awful lot of projection.

1458
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,400
I think that's always there.

1459
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:45,400
And then may head into romantic emotional union,

1460
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:51,400
and people might live together, try to make an everyday life together through that.

1461
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:57,400
And then there's a developmental stage that I think is as important as any other,

1462
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:02,400
and I would call it disappointment, because there's a fall into disappointment

1463
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,400
with a couple just as there is a falling into love.

1464
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:13,400
And when you get to disappointment, that's a very, very important kind of choice point,

1465
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:17,400
because how people treat their disappointment is going to tell everything

1466
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:23,400
about whether they might grow together into a more mature kind of loving

1467
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:28,400
or wind up partying into self-preservation

1468
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,400
and a change from abundance into scarcity

1469
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:35,400
and a sort of Darwinian struggle for control of the relationship

1470
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:38,400
and whose needs get met.

1471
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,400
And it goes from there.

1472
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,400
So I think, and as Walter Benjamin once said,

1473
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:48,400
the important thing is not love at first sight, it's love at last sight.

1474
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:55,400
And that's that stage of growing old together and facing each other's mortality.

1475
01:26:55,400 --> 01:27:02,400
So it's a long developmental process, and I think we have to be very careful not to be reductionist

1476
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,400
and say love is a this or that.

1477
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,400
Thank you.

1478
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,400
Thank you.

1479
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,400
That's true.

1480
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:18,400
Hi, my name is Maxine Safeman, and I was married to a member of this society,

1481
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:24,400
Israel Safeman, who died 27 years ago, and I'm also a psychoanalyst

1482
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:30,400
at the New York Freudian that's become contemporary psychoanalytic.

1483
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:35,400
I wanted to say very much what the last person had said,

1484
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:40,400
because I was lucky enough to find a soulmate,

1485
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:46,400
and no one has talked about a soulmate or kindred spirit.

1486
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:53,400
And I found him because when I was 15 years old,

1487
01:27:53,400 --> 01:28:01,400
because he was in total contrast to my parents' marriage,

1488
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:09,400
my parents had a very conflicted, angry, my mother hated the marriage,

1489
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:13,400
was very depressed, constantly was running away.

1490
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:27,400
And I found someone who had strength of character, who was totally capable of being there,

1491
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:31,400
and I knew this exactly when I was 15 years old,

1492
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:39,400
because when I was five years old, I very clearly understood what a terrible marriage was,

1493
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:43,400
but they couldn't resolve seemed to be so simple,

1494
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:47,400
and they weren't unable to resolve the conflicts.

1495
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:53,400
So I found someone who was that soulmate,

1496
01:28:53,400 --> 01:29:01,400
and it is really to have that kind of lasting love there.

1497
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:06,400
I used to get five calls a day saying, I love you, Mackie,

1498
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,400
which is pretty lovely.

1499
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,400
You can have that kind of luck.

1500
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:20,400
I think it is luck also to find someone who has those kinds of characteristics.

1501
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:25,400
I mean, and able to be there in a total way,

1502
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:32,400
trustworthy, with the caring about society,

1503
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,400
the other oriented, all those kinds of good qualities.

1504
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:40,400
So in some ways it is a matter of luck.

1505
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,400
I've never found anyone else.

1506
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:46,400
It's looking.

1507
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:52,400
There are other questions.

1508
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,400
There are other questions.

1509
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,400
Are there any more questions before we close?

1510
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:02,400
It was hard after the last testimony.

1511
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,400
I'm not doing a testimony.

1512
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,400
I'm a psychiatrist too, of course.

1513
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,400
I have a lot of patients who have a rhodomania,

1514
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,400
which we didn't touch upon today,

1515
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:15,400
but a rhodomania is when a patient falls in love with someone,

1516
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,400
usually have a higher social status,

1517
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,400
and they follow them around, stalking behavior.

1518
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:24,400
So Dr. Brown, you should study these people because they're full of, I think,

1519
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,400
dopamine and different kinds of chemicals.

1520
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:30,400
Exactly. It's these systems on, you know,

1521
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,400
it's overdrive.

1522
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,400
Overdrive, exactly.

1523
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:37,400
So they might be good for your studies, so I just thought I'd add that.

1524
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,400
This lady of children in the restaurant,

1525
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:26,400
and she had to be

1526
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:48,400
topic was love, the interrogation of love.

1527
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,400
Like correct? Is that the topic?

1528
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,400
Yes.

1529
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,400
Well, I started to think about it.

1530
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:57,400
You mentioned music. What is this thing called love?

1531
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,400
You mentioned all the other emotions,

1532
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:04,400
whether it's kindness, whether it's horny, whether it's whatever.

1533
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:09,400
We have, I'm in the mood for love. What does that mean?

1534
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,400
We have the libestone.

1535
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,400
You know what that does.

1536
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,400
So we're always thinking about love.

1537
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,400
It's a force. It's an energy.

1538
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,400
It's something that's invisible.

1539
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,400
And you never know what's going to happen.

1540
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,400
I do believe luck.

1541
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,400
It plays a part.

1542
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:38,400
But I think we need to think about where we are today in this culture.

1543
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,400
Unrealistic expectations,

1544
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:47,400
because the media is killing us with all this crotch stuff and everything else.

1545
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:55,400
I beg to do with my friend over here who thinks that only in Europe or Russia or in France,

1546
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,400
they understand anything about love and read.

1547
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:02,400
In my profession, I get calls all the time saying,

1548
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:06,400
don't tell me about this utopian. I don't want to hear about series.

1549
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,400
Just give me a great love story.

1550
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:12,400
When you get back to me with a great love story, we'll talk.

1551
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,400
Everybody's still looking for a great love story.

1552
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,400
We don't have a Shakespeare right now.

1553
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,400
We don't have any good love stories.

1554
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,400
No, I'm not talking about sonnets.

1555
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:27,400
I'm talking about wonderful expressions of love.

1556
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:32,400
The poets today are reflecting our society.

1557
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:35,400
We have a society that is not dealing with love.

1558
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,400
It's dealing with terror.

1559
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:41,400
It's dealing with sexual annihilation of women.

1560
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:43,400
We're dealing with trafficking.

1561
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:48,400
We're talking about the beauty and the museums of Ruben's women and gorgeous men

1562
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,400
and the Adonis and David.

1563
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:53,400
We're talking about slaying, killing.

1564
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:59,400
It's very hard to take this beautiful force that's still around us and

1565
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:03,400
grad and see each other and look at each other.

1566
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:07,400
I would like somebody to talk about the force of love.

1567
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,400
Would you be the example?

1568
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,400
You be the example.

1569
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,400
No, I don't.

1570
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,400
We have to be the example.

1571
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,400
It's universal.

1572
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:18,400
People read about it, but we have illiterate people.

1573
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,400
What are we going to do about that?

1574
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,400
We still have...

1575
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:30,400
We should look back to Cupid because, though, we have made Cupid a sort of silly figure.

1576
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:38,400
Cupid, of course, in mythology is an unbelievably powerful figure who shoots his arrows.

1577
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,400
You don't know where they're going to go.

1578
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,400
You don't know who they're going to hit.

1579
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:48,400
Once he hit his own mother, Venus, and she fell in love with the mortal Adonis,

1580
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:56,400
whom she could not save, that that force, which until recently was seen,

1581
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:01,400
indeed, as something so overwhelming that could strike at any time,

1582
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:05,400
at any person in a way that could not be controlled,

1583
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:10,400
is something that we should all be thinking about, the power of it,

1584
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:13,400
the way that it can turn our lives upside down,

1585
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:17,400
the way that it can turn for good or for bad.

1586
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,400
I mean, it is there.

1587
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:27,400
And we need to maybe help our children both get the very positive aspects of that

1588
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:30,400
and also realize the importance of it.

1589
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:05,400
I think I'd

1590
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:32,400
I'd like to do that.

1591
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:37,400
I think that's very, very important.

1592
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,400
All right.

1593
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:43,400
Well, that's I think as somebody said, we could go on for a few more hours.

1594
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:47,400
But my cup goes on.

1595
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,400
And thank you very much for your participation.

1596
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,400
Thank you.

1597
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,400
Thank you.

1598
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:59,400
Thank you.

1599
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:04,400
Still not like hands but it's real.

1600
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,400
See.

1601
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,400
That was a young buck.

1602
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,400
Because I've been following.

1603
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,400
And you.

1604
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,400
You want me to try it?

1605
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,400
Yeah.

1606
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:24,400
I chose the office.

1607
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:29,400
I'm not going to do that.

1608
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:34,400
But then I just don't want to talk about solely.

1609
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:39,400
We may have to get some.

1610
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:44,400
It isn't just the attraction.

1611
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:58,400
Yeah.

1612
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:16,400
I'm not going to do that.

1613
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:37,400
I'm not going to do that.

1614
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:58,400
I'm not going to do that.

1615
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:25,400
I'm not going to do that.

1616
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:34,400
I'm not going to do that.
