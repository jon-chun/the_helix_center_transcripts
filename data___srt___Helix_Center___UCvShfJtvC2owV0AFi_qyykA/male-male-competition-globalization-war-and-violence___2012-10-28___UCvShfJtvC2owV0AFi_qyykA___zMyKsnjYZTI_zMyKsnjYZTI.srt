1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Is this working?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Is this working?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Is this not working?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hi Joe.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm Ed Nersesian, Director of the Helix Center.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Today's round table was proposed and organized by Professor Shits Johnson.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Before I introduce her, I'd just like to remind you that our next round table is on November 17, and it's on animal language.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Professor Shits Johnson is a philosopher whose first life was a dancer, choreographer, professor of dance and dance scholar.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:01,000
She has an ongoing courtesy, professor appointment in the Department of Philosophy of Oregon University of Oregon, and she has published numerous articles and the number of books.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Her books include the phenomenology of dance, the roots of thinking, the roots of power, animate form and gendered bodies, the roots of morality, the primacy of movement, and the corporeal terms.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She received an MA in dance and a PhD in dance and philosophy from the University of Wisconsin, where she also studied evolutionary biology.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:44,000
She was awarded a distinguished fellowship for her studies of xenophobia by the Institute of Advanced Study, Durham University, United Kingdom in its inaugural year, the theme of which was the legacy of Charles Darwin.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Professor Shits Johnson will introduce the other guests and then we'll move on. Thank you.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, thank you very much to all of you for being here. I would also like to thank Ennarsesian for all of his extraordinary hospitality.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It has been a great pleasure to be invited here and to have organized this brown table and to have gotten in touch with such illustrious people here,

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:27,000
whom I've just had the pleasure of meeting actually at lunchtime and getting to know, except for Jim Lieberman, who I've been in correspondence with for at least the past year.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But I'd like to thank our participants also for coming and because I have just had the pleasure of meeting them and I have not memorized their backgrounds, I'm going to just introduce them now to you.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This over here is Brian Ferguson. He's an anthropologist who teaches at Rutgers University. His main areas of interest are war and political violence.

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:10,000
A generalist, he has published on war in tribal societies and among ancient states, archaeological evidence regarding the origins of war, large scale, identity linked violence in the contemporary world,

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:26,000
on human nature and war and anthropological theory about war. He is currently writing a book that examines theories about human nature and aggression through reports about chimpanzees in the wild.

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:41,000
His other interests are culture and biology, policing and the development of organized crime in New York history. So he has a very broad background that I'm sure is going to enrich our discussion.

22
00:03:41,000 --> 00:04:04,000
As is John Horgens' career as a science writer, he has written for a number of journals and has been his most recent book End of War, which was published in 2012, has been called the best book I've ever read in a very long time by the journalist David Swanson.

23
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It was called A Thoughtful Unflappable Closely Argued Book by Nicholas Nicholson Baker and a heartfelt and important book by evolutionary psychologist David Barrage.

24
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So he has also written for, I should say, he's a former senior writer at Scientific American and is currently a science journalist and director of the Center for Science Writings at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey.

25
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Jim Lieberman is a psychiatrist who is an emeritus professor at George Washington University. He was practicing psychiatrist for many years.

26
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He served as chief at the Center for Child and Family Mental Health.

27
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He has written extensively on the psychiatrist Otto Runk. Most recently editing the letters of Sigmund Freud and Otto Runk, an inside psychoanalysis, a book that received very high credits in a recent review.

28
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In other areas of interest, our sex education and family planning, couples therapy and non violent conflict resolution. He plays the cello in an orchestral group.

29
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He said that his first hand experience in male male competition includes chess and wrestling in high school and college and going through medical school at the University of California at San Francisco where within 82 classmates, 72 of them were male.

30
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So we have a very fine bunch of discussions here tonight. And what I want to do is start out with a few remarks, introductory remarks, and from there, we will go on to just a very unfolding discussion among us and with questions

31
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and confrontations maybe and elaborations among us.

32
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So I start with just saying that little attention is paid to the fact that in his book, The Descent of Man, selection and relation with relation to sex, Darwin devoted 12 chapters to male male competition.

33
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He called it the law of battle, starting with mollusks and working his way up through avians, through mammals, devoting ultimately two chapters to man.

34
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The law is certainly not sanctioned or obeyed by every male, but given human history, it appears an undeniable phenomenon all the same.

35
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Male male competition warrants examination. It's buried in present day research under the sober cat of sperm competition.

36
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And it never surfaces as real male male competition. And I myself devoted a chapter to real male male competition in a book called The Roots of Morality.

37
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And I want to just offer a few quotations from different people to give a kind of idea of real life, male male competition.

38
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Well, Churchill said that nothing is Churchill, Winston Churchill said that there's nothing so exciting as to be shot at without result.

39
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Ernst Becker, who wrote a book called The Denial of Death, said that if we don't have the omnipotence of gods, we can at least destroy like gods.

40
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Shakespeare in the Coriolanus wrote, one character said, these are lines from one of the characters.

41
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Let me have war, say I, it exceeds peace as far as day does night. It's brightly waking, audible, and full of vent.

42
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy, mold, sleepy, insensible, a getter of more bastard children than wars, a destroyer of men.

43
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And it makes men hate one another, reason because then they less need one another.

44
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Then there's also a kind of poem by a religion scholar by the name of Sam Keene, who also has written something in science literature.

45
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's called The Enemy.

46
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Start with an empty canvas, sketch in broad outline the forms of men, women, and children.

47
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Dip into the unconscious well of your own disowned darkness with a wide brush and stain the strangers with the sinister hue of the shadow.

48
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Trace onto the face of the enemy the greed, the hatred, the carelessness you dare not claim as your own.

49
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:51,000
When your icon of the enemy is complete, you will be able to kill without guilt, slaughter, without shame.

50
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Finally, I'd like to quote Darwin. This is from the sent of man in selection in relation to sex.

51
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:15,000
He writes, man is the rival of other men. He delights in competition and this leads to ambition, which passes too easily into selfishness.

52
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The thematic that will start our discussion, I hope, has to do with the idea that war is a, to my mind, a cultural elaboration of male male competition,

53
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
which in a biological sense serves the reproduction, for the reproduction of the species.

54
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
In other words, male male competition in the biological world is a, is a sexual phenomenon that serves reproduction.

55
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:57,000
My point will be that, that male male competition has been culturally elaborated by humans in various and sundry ways.

56
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But I'd like to start and ask because it has come up in our discussion at lunchtime and it served as a kind of introductory.

57
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Brian, if you want to start in with some remarks on male male competition and war?

58
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Certainly.

59
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Well, Maxine and I, there are many literatures to read and your, your own thoughts and your work are shaped by the literature that you're involved in.

60
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And I've been working on the anthropology of war for quite a long time.

61
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And that involves both looking at ethnographic discussions of war, archaeological evidence, but also responding to and challenging some theories that I see coming out of primatology, chimps studies in particular,

62
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and also evolutionary psychology.

63
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And in these areas, those fields, Darwin's law of battle, not in that phrase, is very prominent.

64
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And it's the foundation of lots of theorizing about conflict and, and more than that, an evolutionary psychology, the idea of an unbroken continuum of a struggle between males,

65
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:20,000
ultimately directed at reproductive success, is not only the image of our past, but it's the foundation for many other theories about gender,

66
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the nature of different genders today, the inborn nature, on things like why we root for sports teams.

67
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Many different theories are built upon it.

68
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And my own research finds that ethnographically, that is looking at tribal peoples that have been discussed,

69
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:46,000
described since the time of Columbus and more recently by anthropologists, there's a tremendous amount of variation in terms of how much violence there is, how much warfare exists,

70
00:12:46,000 --> 00:13:05,000
how people respond to aggressive impulses, whether if you go from one society where one will be considered somehow not a man if one doesn't extract violent revenge on another man for reflecting light from a mirror on the other man's wife.

71
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That is an expectation where in another society, this is South American Indian society, there's a real cultural disavowal of violence, and such that when occasionally they have to kill a witch,

72
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,000
which occasionally they do, even the person who does that with the social sanction of it's got to be done, no one will ever share food from the same cup from that person again,

73
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
because they think they're irrevocably damaged inside, so that there are real cultural variations.

74
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But archeologically, I think what is important is that there's many claims out there that the archeological record shows war ubiquitous in our prehistoric past.

75
00:13:47,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Those cases, and I've done a lot of research on that, and I'm happy to talk about it, those cases involve very selective presentation of very few examples where signs of multiple violent deaths are present.

76
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And if you take what I believe is a more proper methodology of looking at the entire archeological record of, say, Europe or the Near East, which I've just completed research on, what you find is an utter absence of signs of war in the earliest record.

77
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Then it begins sporadically in different places and gets more common, and eventually you get to the Copper Age or so, when war is ubiquitous, of course Europe, it's our image of Conan the barbarian, but you see it develop over time, and it's not there to start.

78
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What I think is one of the most important findings of this research is that in one particular area of the Near East, which is known as the Southern Levant, and this is an area that goes from Lebanon, southern Syria, Jordan and Israel, very different from the record today,

79
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:17,000
that while you've got evidence of war in all other areas of the Near East and all through Europe, abundant evidence of war, there's not a single case that you can say war existed in a period that goes from 13,000 BC to about 3200 BC, about 10,000 years,

80
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:33,000
without a single documentable case of war. And I think the reason for that is that they found, these are the people who domesticated plants and animals, and I think they domesticated conflict, and I think that there were signs that they had developed a peace system.

81
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So I think that's an optimistic note, but it also to me says that the Darwin's law of battle doesn't necessarily apply to cultural beings, and I know you're writing talks a lot about culture and humanity and how people try to distance them, the idea that humans are above the animal kingdom.

82
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This is looking at culture as an emergent domain that has different ways of processing conflicts. So that's what I work on, and that's what it might kind of response to your topic here.

83
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay, John, do you want to add to that? Yeah, so first I want to say that Brian is somebody who got me interested in the issue of war, and especially the roots of war, and that culminated in my writing this book, The End of War, which just came out earlier this year.

84
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And I actually wanted to ask this audience a question by way of setting up what I have to say. One of the reasons that I wrote The End of War was because of my perception of public attitudes toward war.

85
00:16:45,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So here's my question for all of you. How many of you think that it is possible for humanity to stop fighting wars once and for all someday? So a world without war between nations, and without even the threat of war, world peace, permanent world peace.

86
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
How many of you think such a world is possible?

87
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay, this is fairly typical, what that's maybe seven or eight people out of maybe, I don't know, 50 or 60.

88
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So I've been asking this question at every opportunity for about 10 years now, and usually between 80 and 90% of respondents say war is a permanent part of the human condition.

89
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So I teach at my students, I teach at a college in Hoboken, it tends to be more 90, 95%, I've had classes where every single student said that not only will there not be world peace, but hell no, there won't be world peace, they're adamant on this issue, they think that it's really

90
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:12,000
hard to believe that humans can stop fighting wars once and for all. Let me ask you another question, how many of you think that there is a strong biological component, and even more than that, that war somehow is an expression of human nature?

91
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So that means that some of you who think that war is inevitable, maybe see other reasons as significant.

92
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I wrote my book first of all because I think that the view that war is an expression of human nature, that it's really ancient and innate, this is what Brian was talking about, is wrong empirically, that there's massive evidence to show that war is actually a quite

93
00:18:41,000 --> 00:19:01,000
recent cultural innovation, it started really, the oldest evidence is maybe 13,000 years old, this mass grave in the Sudan, but really the evidence starts about 10,000 years ago in Mesopotamia and then you see it arise in other parts of the world and some people object that

94
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:20,000
well we don't have any evidence of humans doing anything before 10,000 years ago and that's obviously false because we have evidence of the emergence of art and music and religion and all sorts of other cultural innovations going back, tens of thousands of years before the origin of war.

95
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And what concerns me about the fatalism toward warfare is that it can become self-fulfilling, and I see signs of that in the world today, Barack Obama, when he was accepting his Nobel Peace Prize, and I think, you know, you can say this of him, I think he felt guilty that he was accepting it right after he'd announced he was

96
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:09,000
attending 30,000 war troops to Afghanistan, he recognized that that was a little bit embarrassing, but he had a statement to the effect, I'm pretty sure you've seen this, Brian, that war appeared with the first man and we will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetime, so he's

97
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:37,000
making a scientific statement there, I'm not sure if you've been reading the literature on warfare written by, especially for some reason, a bunch of very prominent scientists at Harvard, I call them the Harvard Hawks, this is Edward Wilson, Stephen Pinker, Richard Rangam, Stephen LeBlanc, people like that, but this idea that war is in our gene somehow has become very pervasive, and I think it has led to

98
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:50,000
an easy excuse for our own hawkishness and militarism, so first of all it's empirically wrong, and second it has bad consequences in the world today.

99
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But don't you think that there is a difference between saying that it's in your genes and saying that it's a cultural elaboration of something that is naturally there, because the other thing is that indication is that I think the distinction needs to be made between using the term humans and using the term male-male competition, because

100
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:31,000
as far as history goes it's not women who start wars and it's not women who fight wars, so you have to really make the distinction between male-male competition within a biological framework that serves reproduction, and male-male competition

101
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:44,000
that has become culturally elaborated by humans more recently, I agree, more recently, in the service of honing heroes, cultivating warriors who will fight, etc.

102
00:21:44,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And I think that those two distinctions really need to be made, because it's not that I don't think that war is in our genes, I think that that's a completely false and aberrant notion. I think on the contrary, as per Samuel Keene's poem that I read, it requires some very deep self-questioning on the part of all humans

103
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:27,000
in terms of their own predilections and own dispositions toward violence and toward just an awareness of their own, we'll just say, their own morality with respect to other humans. What do you think, Jim?

104
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:48,000
A lot of fuss here. I grew up with movies like Batan and Corregidor, which the Americans were emptying their machine guns at the oncoming Japanese, and it took until after World War II, for a new finding to emerge,

105
00:22:48,000 --> 00:23:10,000
General SLA Marshall found that most of the soldiers on both sides and in previous wars were not firing their weapons at an oncoming enemy. If they could see the person, they would be less likely to shoot, 80% would not shoot.

106
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Then they looked back at stashes of weapons found in battlefields, for example, the Civil War, and they found these rifles that were multiplied, they were multiple loaded, they were soldiers feigning, pulling the trigger when they were not being supervised,

107
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:53,000
because the oncoming enemy was an inhibition. These findings have been elaborated by Dave Grossman in two books on killing, which came out in 1995 with the second edition revised in 2009, and also he wrote on combat.

108
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:13,000
He was a Lieutenant Colonel and trainer of troops at West Point, now retired, and he said that after World War II, while the General Marshall's findings were hotly disputed by military people, it's now been established,

109
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:30,000
but it's also been established that normal men can be trained to shoot. First of all, if they're supervised closely, second, if the shooting is at a distance where the face of the enemy is not coming toward you,

110
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and so many more military casualties are inflicted on retreating troops than on advancing troops. The other thing that's happened, of course, is that distance killing has been increased. The weaponry has been increased.

111
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's easier to drop a nuclear weapon on a city than it is to shoot somebody whose eyes you can see. So it turns out that just as we have learned something about human nature being less violent than we thought,

112
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:20,000
we also have the capability to be much more destructive than we could in the past. So this is the dilemma, the conundrum of the present. Grossman says that of recruits nowadays to the military,

113
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:39,000
they can now, with special training methods, develop since World War II, but prior to Vietnam, you can convert the 80% or the 90%, so that 90% now will fire and did fire at human targets facing them in Vietnam.

114
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And Vietnam was also the beginning of a strong attention to PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, and a high suicide rate in returning veterans and in active soldiers.

115
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So there's a lot of psychology that we have to struggle with in this, but in a way I think it's progress if we can save ourselves from the big interments of killing.

116
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:18,000
When I was growing up there was a draft, and in order to be a conscious objector, you had to show that you were a good Quaker or a member of the Brethren Church or whatever.

117
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Catholics had a hard time, although there was a Catholic peace movement and so on.

118
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And then the draft ended, and so there's really no need for anyone who hates war to sign up. But it's interesting that when you sign up now, if you enlist, you have to sign a statement saying that you are not a conscientious objector.

119
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Which probably makes sense, except the people who are signing up now were not raised brethren or Quakers. They don't know what conscientious objector is really about until they get into the training, and then a lot of them crash.

120
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And so there's an organization called the Center on Conscience and War, which gives legal counseling to people who have signed a statement saying they're not a CO, and then they find out that they are.

121
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:24,000
The derivative of this also is that Dave Grossman says there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are a lot of conscientious objectors.

122
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Any comments on that?

123
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This is an issue that's come up a number of times, I've come across it. Grossman's work, Marshall's work, is something that I find very congenial.

124
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I like the idea that humans do have an inhibition against killing.

125
00:27:46,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I just haven't been able to determine that by looking at the ethnographic record of other societies. It's really a gap in what anthropologists do when they study war, of asking people, how do you feel about having killed somebody?

126
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:27,000
They look at the acts of war, they look at what leads to war. They don't ask many questions like that. And what's interesting is that a number of societies have some kind of ritual that involves segregating the man killers after they've come back for a period of time

127
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and purifying them before they go back into their normal daily life. And if someone like the Yannamami, you've written about the Yannamami, this is a tribal group in Brazil and Venezuela, if you don't go through that ritual, the feeling is that you begin to rot inside.

128
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And if too much time has happened between, like if you're an array that takes two weeks to get back from, you might begin to feel the sensations of rotting inside before you get home. So this goes along with that very definitely.

129
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But there's a group of people called the Alangat in Southeast Asia and an anthropologist, and there were headhunters and the anthropologists queried them deeply about whether they felt shame or anything like that for killing and just couldn't elicit anything like that at all.

130
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So the problem for me is that it hasn't been really studied. I don't feel comfortable in making any kind of generalizations, but I can't say that I find Grossman's finding to be backed up, maybe just because it hasn't been enough work on it.

131
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It seems that a lot of societies, I mean in United States societies, in United States society, unless you're in a military family, and that's some people who work with soldiers are not talking about the military class, you know, very unselfconsciously, these are people who know this is what you're going to do when you get to be of that age.

132
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Someone like me who wasn't the idea of killing anybody at any time was just impossible, something you could see on the screen, but not something you would ever contemplate doing yourself. But in some other societies, kids are raised with the idea of when you grow up, you're going to have to fight, and you should want to fight.

133
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So I just don't know how much this is a human thing and how much this is a cultural thing. And the male male competition can be expressed in non-violent ways as well. And I wouldn't disown female, female competition. I went to high school.

134
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And that's right. But there's gender stereotyping too that goes on. Male competition means you punch them in the face, and female competition means you say you ruin the reputation.

135
00:30:45,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So that's what you expect. I think in my book, I remind people that before we got into this age of genetic determinism and fascination with biological contributions to human nature, there was much more interest in cultural explanations for what we do.

136
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I think that Margaret Mead still had one of the best theories of war. She wrote a little paper, came out in 1940. I think the title was something like war is an invention, not a biological necessity, and talked about war as an idea that people had to invent.

137
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And then it propagates just as many other ideas to marriage and cooking and trial by jury. And a lot of the things that actually have improved our lives.

138
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
The problem with war is that it's got this bizarre property of spreading whether or not people want it.

139
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And you can sort of think of how that happens in a very simple way. If you've got a region with ten peaceful tribes and there's just one tribe in the middle, let's say it just happens to have a charismatic population.

140
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It happens to have a charismatic sociopath as its leader who thinks that fighting other people would be a really fun thing to do. And that tribe starts attacking the others. What are they going to do?

141
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:21,000
They either can run away or they submit to the aggressive tribe or they fight against it. And in this way war-like behavior and militarism spread.

142
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And the anthropologist Sarah Blaffer-Hertie has written in a way that I find really persuasive about how this process transforms societies, you know, beginning around ten thousand years ago, the time period that we talked about.

143
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And how it's because we're actually, mass killing does not come naturally to people, that we started to come up with these cultural norms that glorified martial skills and killing and courage and all this sort of thing.

144
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And so war transformed culture and it actually created the kind of macho model of masculinity that a lot of people now think is completely innate.

145
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So I think culture actually is by far more powerful explanation of war. I think that to understand something like the Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan or even the aggression of the United States, you can go back to the experiments of Stanley Milgram, the classics and social psychology

146
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:47,000
where it's conformity and deference to authority that leads people to commit horrific acts even when they are revolts by them.

147
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So the Milgram experiments, a lot of those subjects who thought that they were shocking people possibly, I'm assuming that everybody here is familiar with those.

148
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:10,000
They were extremely distressed and some were sadistic and were quite happy to do it. But a lot of people were very distressed by it and they did it anyway just because this guy in a white coat was telling them to do this.

149
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So this I think is actually a more disturbing fact about our makeup than any kind of innate propensity for war that we are so malleable, we are so subject to the influence of people and power.

150
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yes, I'm glad you brought that up because I think that's a great motivation for people if it's like Hitler's thousand year right, mobilizing people because there's a leader there who is charismatic enough to propel people to take up their guns, et cetera, and go fight for the glory of their nation.

151
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But I think also in present day times there's an equal that's not only national but it's religious and the religious is feeding in the same way that the national did.

152
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And I think on the other hand that which we haven't mentioned is the development of technology, which makes it so easy to decimate an enormous, I mean a whole nation practically,

153
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:33,000
in terms of just technological developments aside from the drones which can target smaller, but I was thinking of nuclear power and the spread of nuclear power.

154
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Grossman makes the point that about 3% of the recruits had no compunction about these exercises or actual killing.

155
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And he also points to the fact that demographically about 3% of the population would qualify as psychopathic, which means not having a normal,

156
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
conscious sense of responsibility or empathy.

157
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And it turns out that this is not a disabling psychiatric condition, it may be, and there are far more people with that diagnosis in prison than their numbers would warrant.

158
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
That is to say, it might be 40% of prisoners in penitentiaries who would qualify.

159
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But I recall hearing that the Nazi extermination machine was run by 3% of the population and it's probably true when people say I didn't know a thing about it that in fact most of the Germans didn't know about it.

160
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That 3% can be very significant. Also the media like to play up the abnormal.

161
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So you hear a lot more about violence and sadism and craziness of this type or unscrupulous behavior than is represented in the population.

162
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And I think that this wouldn't be the case if somebody didn't have an interest in portraying human beings like this.

163
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Whether to sell newspapers or to sell machine guns or to sell police uniforms or to make a purchase of guns legal, things like that.

164
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'd just like to add something to that.

165
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:34,000
War turns people into virtual psychopaths. I think we've seen that over and over again. I suspect that there were more than 3% of the German population who if they didn't participate directly in genocide would have been willing to do so because they basically

166
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:47,000
been brainwashed. I've read detailed accounts of what happened at Me Lie, the massacre in Vietnam War. And it's mass psychopathy.

167
00:37:47,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It's people who were transformed by the culture of war into monsters who have absolutely no normal human concern for others and end up slaughtering, brutalizing women and children completely.

168
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,000
They even killed all the animals in Me Lie. And you see this over and over again through human history.

169
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And I think that the obvious solution is to try to, you know, it's the old idea of we have to recognize that war is morally wrong.

170
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's also practically, it often devastates societies. I think our society is a lot of our economic problems are directly attributable to these issues.

171
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:57,000
These huge, costly, lengthy wars that we've had in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I'm hopeful that finally, once and for all, we can have this kind of cultural awakening and recognize how wrong militarism and war are and put it behind us once and for again with the help of this kind of cultural

172
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:06,000
malleability. How do you do that without a moral education? Well, I think it will require, I'm certainly working on my students, believe me.

173
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:20,000
But in what way? I tell them first of all about that I think that the theories of war that attribute it to biology are wrong because many of them believe in that.

174
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And I also talk a lot about the second most popular theory. I'm sure a lot of people here believe it is that war is the inevitable result of too many people and too few resources.

175
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So it's kind of ecological competition. Brian has has written about this quite a bit. There's an archaeologist at Harvard, Stephen LeBlanc, who's written a book on this.

176
00:39:44,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And it's a very popular theory right now, especially, and I find this really sort of disturbing among green progressives, dervish green progressives who fear that overpopulation and global warming are going to come together to cause terrible scarcity in the future of famines and

177
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:17,000
water shortages that are going to lead to catastrophic wars. I read this all the time. Bill McKibben, the leading environmental activist, has written about it.

178
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And the problem is that there's just no empirical evidence for that point of view. The evidence really strongly suggests that you sometimes resources play a role and some countries in

179
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:46,000
the period of Japan was looking for more secure sources of fossil fuels. But generally it's the old idea of war beginning war. Cultures of war, militarized cultures, find reasons to go to war.

180
00:40:46,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And if there's anything that is positive out of seeing wars, this kind of self-perpetuating meme, it's that we don't have to do anything radical to our society as a means to ending war.

181
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
We just have to end war, focus on ending war and militarism themselves.

182
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:17,000
But how do you do that? We'll have questions from the audience in a little bit. I just want to keep going around. Ryan, did you have a comment in the end?

183
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I agree with John that is an important point that we... The question John asked before is how many people believe war can be abolished in the future is really, I think, the second question that I asked.

184
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And the first question is how many people believe that war has always been with us? If you believe that war has always been with us, I think the second question is always going to be where this kind of follows naturally.

185
00:41:45,000 --> 00:42:00,000
The thing that I'm finding in my archaeological research, one thing that's very important is that across the board there's an absence of war when you had highly mobile people, even in the beginnings of agriculture.

186
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And it wasn't necessarily linked totally to agriculture. You had war before agriculture. You had a lot of agriculture without war.

187
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:27,000
But you could have one area that could go for 10,000 years through periods of population crashes when population had grown during favorable conditions and then unfavorable conditions led to drastic reductions in the populations in the area, classic malthusian problems.

188
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Still no signs of war. But I didn't mention before that this isn't the case of, well, you just haven't found the evidence for this because this period continues up to 3,200 BC.

189
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:51,000
What happened in 3,200 BC is that this is when the pharaohs arose in Egypt and began a colonial empire in what they call Canaan.

190
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And in a matter of 100 years, every settlement in Canaan was fortified. You can't find a single fortification for 10,000 years before that.

191
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Then you can't find one without fortification after that. So it's not just the recovery of evidence. This shows that you can have a system even when there are resource conflicts, even when there's environmental disasters where the result isn't going to war.

192
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And I think if people know that, that's step one. Step two, and this is one of the reasons I spend so much time challenging a lot of biological theories of war.

193
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So I think it distracts attention to where you should look. And where you should look, I think considering modern warfare, the wars you have to the fall of the Soviet Union, contribal warfare is in the self-interest of leaders.

194
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I think that this is the key to understanding war, not the genes of everybody, but what's the interest of leaders and take resources.

195
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:10,000
There was a conference, we had some post-Soviet scholars there talking about the conflicts that were erupting all over the former Soviet Union, ethno-political conflicts.

196
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Land is always an issue. It's never a question of land to farm. There's got plenty of land to farm. Sometimes it's oil.

197
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But land was always big because leaders were rising to power on the claims of this is our homeland. This is symbolic to us.

198
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:43,000
They were benefiting by these pleas, by these constructed history that uses land as a symbol of us against them who've always taken it away from us.

199
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And to me, this is where you need to look. Who is making the decisions for war? What are their interests in that particular situation?

200
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And then what I think makes humans particularly dangerous is that once leaders have, and it's not inevitable that leaders are going to argue for war, that they see that as their interests, but once they do, they come to believe their own propaganda.

201
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:19,000
They come to believe their own reasons that they put out there for why it's not just something we need, it's right, it's moral. You're a coward if you don't.

202
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
This is how they convince people, but I think through to avoid cognitive dissonance, they come to believe it themselves.

203
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And it's important to look away from wars in your genes or what chimpanzees are doing to what leaders are doing now who might say there's always going to be war.

204
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Do you think that, I'm sorry, surely.

205
00:45:49,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Fluidity in the way you are moving from male-male competition, aggression, violence, genocide and war. But these are not all the same. It may be that you have to have aggression in war. But these are different categories of things.

206
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The second thing is that it seems to me more often than saying something is moral in matters of war, is that people are scared and they go to war. They tell them there is a threat.

207
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
So let's say the situation with Iraq was that there is a nuclear threat from Iraq. That's why we have to go to war.

208
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Afghanistan is because of al-Qaeda. That's why we have to go to war.

209
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And that seems to me in a way a normal reaction to the extent that when we feel we are threatened, we want to defend ourselves.

210
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And that's why I'm a little bit puzzled by the period you are saying for 10,000 years there was no war.

211
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It was that those people were not threatened. There was no danger. There was no...

212
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
No, because there was no one going to war in the area.

213
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
No, but there must have been threats. There must have been...

214
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Why must there have been threats?

215
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Because food may be scarce, whether it may be bad in one place and excellent in another place, so they have a lot of food.

216
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And so how did they deal with those?

217
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
They deal with those apparently through cooperative responses. They had centers where redistribution...

218
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
We can find the centers of redistribution where people from different areas came together.

219
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:49,000
They had cultic centers that united vast areas of communal labor from people without residences around them.

220
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:58,000
People were coming from different areas. How they handled these things is really the question, I believe.

221
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:11,000
So that's a great question, but what I would suggest is that you're exemplifying the inevitability of violent conflict and the record doesn't show it.

222
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Again, it's not that it's so long ago you can't find it if you go to the northern Tigris at the same area, if you go to Anatoly at the same area, abundant evidence of war.

223
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But in this area, there isn't any. So this poses a question. What were they doing differently?

224
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And this is an area where domestication began. This is where they began to...

225
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Where they went from wild to cultivated plants and wild to domesticated animals.

226
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And what I believe they did is somehow developed a peace system. One of the things we know in anthropology, we figured out in anthropology, is that the causes of war are one thing, but there is a separate set of variables that you could call causes of peace.

227
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And they're not the same. Causes of peace include things like interchange between different areas, cooperative activities, joining different groups.

228
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:20,000
The recognition of some kind of social authority that can say no to violence, effective means of conflict resolution, and a value system that says you don't resort to violence.

229
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That's not the factors that lead to war, which you can say are resource scarcity, social hierarchy, bunch of other things, but they're different.

230
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And together, they make different kinds of combinations. Going back to the male-male issue, one of the things that's intriguing about the Southern Levant, not definitive, but intriguing, is that there isn't any sign basically looking at burials and art of a male-oriented hierarchy.

231
00:49:48,000 --> 00:50:05,000
There isn't sign of a gender hierarchy there, which is very intriguing, but I just don't know enough because I don't know about other areas in the Near East where there was war, whether they had signs of a gender hierarchy, not the article was about the Southern Levant, but it goes along with what you're saying here.

232
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So there were threats, there were dangers. There was population crashes, but when there were population crashes there, you don't find war where in the Northern Tigris area you do.

233
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
So there's something about the way people handled it culturally.

234
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So if there were two tribes and they had some dispute because somebody stole a girl from one tribe and the tribe went to fight with them and get the girl back, would you have considered that war or you have some other definition of war?

235
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
No, that's what you would call war among the Yannamami. They didn't do that.

236
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:51,000
The issue is how did they avoid it? And if they had some kind of mechanism for resolving the dispute, you've got a beef and here's how we're going to handle it.

237
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
That's what you might infer. You don't have the evidence of it. And people haven't really looked for the evidence of it yet.

238
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Somehow it was handled. So it's not that this was sweetness and light, but people didn't have problems.

239
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And if they found a way to do it, now why wouldn't one tribe, like John's idea of one tribe is led by this sociopath?

240
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:30,000
If you have a kind of a local world system of people who, as you had in these areas, who are in mesh and trade and intermarriage and movement, common ritual and all of these things, your life is dependent on being a part of this system.

241
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And someone who says to his followers, let's go out and kill all of them, well, it might be very difficult to get a following to do that when people would say, are you crazy?

242
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Then they'll never trade with us again. Then we'll never be able to marry with them again.

243
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Then we won't be able to go to the ceremonies. Are you crazy?

244
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It's quite a little more right now than we have.

245
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Go ahead. I'll make an exception.

246
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I'm not sure if you have the question.

247
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
How about you ask questions?

248
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
So I'll make them all.

249
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Male, male competition.

250
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Let me, let me.

251
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
May I make an exception, Ed? Because he's raised his hand several times.

252
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Is that all right? Okay.

253
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
First of all, the problem is we can't, we have to warm up.

254
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Okay.

255
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'll still be here.

256
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
This is, I wanted to bring, go ahead, Jim, did you want to say something?

257
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It'll be a slightly different topic, but go ahead.

258
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Okay, because I wanted to follow this up a little bit, because in some ways this leads into globalization in the fact that we're living in a global world where there are more and more people to come to the world.

259
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
There are people that we interact with.

260
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And it seems to me that, it's really interesting to me that you, Carl Jung, the psychiatrist, never included strangers within his archetypal system.

261
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And strangers are very much present in non-human as well as human animal societies.

262
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
In other words, a stranger is recognized as someone who doesn't belong to our group.

263
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And they are treated in a very different way.

264
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And it seems to me that with globalization that there are fewer and fewer strangers now and more and more enemies

265
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:51,000
or potential enemies because they either don't believe like we do or they have goods that we want, that they're not willing to send us, etc., etc.

266
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So it seems to me that with globalization, I mean you're talking about a small area here where people can interact.

267
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And the thing that it seems to me that one of the things that compounds the problem is the fact that there are so many different languages now,

268
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
in terms of English, has become kind of standard.

269
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,000
But still, that's an imposition on people who don't speak English that they have to learn English.

270
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And it's not their native language.

271
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:30,000
So there are a lot of ways in which this kind of communal coming together with tribal people is in this global world that we live in.

272
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It's an exacerbated problem. And it doesn't seem to me that we're able to grapple with it in some kind of moral way

273
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:53,000
because it's so focused on economics and not on humanness and on recognizing this poem by, at least it made an impression on me,

274
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:04,000
that this really delving into ourselves and coming to grips with the person that we are and our own aggressive or violent

275
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,000
or greedy or selfish proclivities until we come in contact with that.

276
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And I would also agree with Ed's comment about fear because fear is a very basic human emotion.

277
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:25,000
And with respect to strangers, fear is a very, is definitive emotion.

278
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And it seems to me when that's magnified into when strangers become enemies or potential enemies,

279
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,000
then fear is also magnified.

280
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I just want to try to lay my optimism on everybody again, especially because that was slightly dark the way you were describing globalization.

281
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:04,000
One thing that has happened, you read some quotes about war that glorified war and that talked about war.

282
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:11,000
You can find quotes from Teddy Roosevelt and people like that that makes war sound like absolutely the coolest thing that you can do.

283
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:19,000
The ultimate extreme sport, right? You don't have world leaders talking in those terms anymore.

284
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:27,000
War is sometimes necessary, but it's a necessary evil. That's how war is discussed.

285
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Well, of course, there's jingoism and drum beating. What are we going to work about? I'm a dinner child.

286
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I'm a dinner child from what I've read.

287
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:44,000
It also talks about defending his country against aggressors, not glorifying war for its own sake,

288
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
which is something that I associate with social Darwinism, late 19th century, early 20th century.

289
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Then we had World War I. And then we had World War II, which shattered any of these romantic

290
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
notions that we had about war.

291
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
What about North Korea? I mean, there are a lot of countries.

292
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:13,000
But these are countries that justify their own militarism in terms of fear, not in terms of some kind of positive goal of conquest for its own sake,

293
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:23,000
as a kind of ultimate expression of vitality. But I just want to give you some empirical evidence that I think we are learning our lesson

294
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:35,000
that war is destructive. It often undermines our goals. So war leads to resource scarcity instead of resource scarcity leading to war.

295
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:43,000
So you probably know I wrote about this, but also Stephen Pinker and Angels of our Better Nature.

296
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
We are now in one of the most peaceful periods in recent human history.

297
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:59,000
So war casualties, population has been going like this, but war casualties over the last decade globally have been about one-tenth what they were

298
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:06,000
annually in the second half of the 20th century, and about one-hundredth what they were in the first half of the 20th century.

299
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I think there are some scholars say we are just looking at random fluctuations.

300
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
We are seeing signs of humanity learning its lesson and moving beyond militarism.

301
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:28,000
There is one huge glaring exception to that, and I think it is the United States, which is by far the most war-like country in the world right now,

302
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:37,000
has a military budget as big as all other nations combined, is now constantly developing new technologies such as drones that are leading to new arms races.

303
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Everybody else wants drones now. Of course terrorist groups are already acquiring drones.

304
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:56,000
We are the biggest arms dealer in the world. I think if the United States can recognize its own militarism and how we are harming our security with these policies,

305
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
that the world could become demilitarized quite rapidly.

306
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Okay, may I ask a question? Okay.

307
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Economically, militarism is very, makes the U.S. prosperous.

308
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
No, that's not true.

309
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Isn't that true?

310
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
No, it's not.

311
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:25,000
If you look at the Fortune 500, Lockheed Martin is, I don't know, 45 or 50 among the biggest corporations in the world.

312
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And Martin is the biggest defense contractor in the world. They are dwarfed by Google and Apple and Amazon and Walmart and companies like that

313
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
that actually don't want war. They will benefit off of war if they have to.

314
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah, but I'm talking about, for example, I just heard recently that, for example, in the state of Virginia, Virginia has built a lot of naval vessels.

315
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And they don't want to stop building naval vessels because it's a very highly, I mean, it's a very good thing for them to be building naval vessels.

316
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So there's something about the military in terms of the production of equipment and of all kinds.

317
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Definitely.

318
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
By the military industrial complex.

319
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Yeah, which I'm talking about.

320
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:26,000
But what I'm saying is that for our society as a whole, the health of those companies is not the same as the health of our nation as a whole.

321
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,000
The military industrial complex for the amount of money that we invest in it is a lousy producer of jobs.

322
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It's minuscule compared to the jobs we get from investment in healthcare and education and energy and things like that.

323
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I just wish I think there is enormous potential right now for a really large peace coalition.

324
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:56,000
If you have a politician with the guts and the eloquence to point out how crazy militarism is for our society and for the world as a whole.

325
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:05,000
And if the military industrial complex, sure, Lockheed Martin is going to try as hard as it can to keep the defense budget up and be selling its stuff around the world.

326
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,000
But we have to recognize that their interests are not shared by the rest of us.

327
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It's a much lower multiplier effect for government money going into military spending than into other things.

328
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
It doesn't promote prosperity in the same way that non-military spendings.

329
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,000
But I would like to say one thing about fear before we and who else and I'll stop it.

330
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
The Iraq war is very instructive, I think.

331
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
This was generated fear.

332
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:41,000
This was something that was basically the intelligence on this was of the flimsiest sort of the weapons of mass destruction.

333
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:56,000
The evidence that this was part of a geopolitical strategy of a small group of people as the way the United States should project its power in the Near East and elsewhere is very strong.

334
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:08,000
And one of the most intriguing things is shortly after this war I was talking to someone who was the head of the New Yorkers, Washington Bureau at the time.

335
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And as they were going into the Iraq war, when everybody had decided they were going into the war before the shooting started, but it was a foregone conclusion.

336
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,000
The phrase went around that they had to moral it up.

337
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
They had to moral it up.

338
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And that's where the democracy thing came in.

339
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And this was a very clear idea.

340
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
We can't just use the fear.

341
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
We've got that, but we've got to moral it up.

342
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And so this is where you've got to be skeptical about leaders because leaders very often are the ones who generate the fear.

343
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Yeah.

344
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Let me just say that because then we'll open it up to the audience, but I just want to ask Jim if you had any other comment about this.

345
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
It's removed.

346
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
So why don't we open it up?

347
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Okay.

348
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Yes.

349
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Thank you for really providing some very stimulating.

350
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I'm sorry I have a partially paralyzed vocal accord and this is all I can do.

351
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Right.

352
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Any closer to the mic.

353
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Thank you all for your comments, which I think you've been very stimulating.

354
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I feel like it's a lot more complicated than the issues that you've mentioned.

355
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Power and control, I think, are almost, if not actually instinctual.

356
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I think that the human being has impulses to hurt.

357
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I just heard a patient tell me, the patient I've known a long time just told me for the first time that when he was four to five years old,

358
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:02,000
remember dropping kittens down this stairwell of his building, then holding them under water until the bubble stopped.

359
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Now I understand that some of this kind of behavior is a result of the trauma that he had experienced earlier.

360
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
But there's a lot of that that's out there.

361
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
There's a lot of people that love Schodenfraub.

362
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Okay.

363
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And I think that's very important.

364
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I think that's something that I think may be instinctual and is not something that's educated.

365
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I don't think that a three or four year old boy has been, has been, uh,

366
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:45,000
cultivated to kill cats or dissect insects or break the heads off of chickens.

367
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I think there's something instinctual there.

368
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Well that's pathological behavior.

369
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
It's not normal.

370
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Is it?

371
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I've been my experience.

372
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I was a boy myself.

373
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I don't remember.

374
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Well, I would say, well, I would say what is the norm?

375
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
You see?

376
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Okay, it was.

377
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Well, you think you were.

378
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I'm not sure you were.

379
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Okay.

380
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
How did you think you were?

381
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
How did you think you were?

382
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
How did you think you were?

383
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
How did you think you were?

384
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
How did you think you were?

385
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I think the sadistic child fits well into the 3% or the 10% who are abnormal.

386
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Yeah, but I think there's more than 3%.

387
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I really do.

388
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Yeah, because Churchill would feel like the 3%.

389
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Look, how many hundreds of thousands of people fill our football stadiums every year?

390
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
That's more than 3%.

391
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Okay.

392
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Our soccer stadiums.

393
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
If you go around the world, it's more than 3%.

394
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Yeah, but soccer is not sadistic.

395
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Football is.

396
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I grant you.

397
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Well, you know, it depends on how you play soccer.

398
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I would say you're a father.

399
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
In which player you're talking about.

400
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I wouldn't say that soccer's necessarily not sadistic.

401
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So I think that there's something about, there's also part of the reason for competition,

402
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
and male competition, and war is castration anxiety.

403
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
We have to prove that we're not vulnerable.

404
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
We deal with that by trying to castrate somebody else.

405
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
And this is a different level than you all have been talking about.

406
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I'm a Freudian analytic therapist, so this is the level that I think about many things at.

407
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And so I just think that there's a more basic element.

408
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Our speaker here says there's no war for 10,000 years.

409
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
You know something?

410
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I don't know how that could be right.

411
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I understand that you spent 20 years researching that.

412
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
But I think there's either something you're missing or something you don't understand.

413
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I just cannot believe that there was not something.

414
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

415
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
You don't know anything about the area, yet you know the history,

416
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
better than someone who's gone through the entire archaeological record of this,

417
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
who's gone through every reputed case, looked at every instance.

418
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Well it doesn't sound like I'm wrong.

419
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
It doesn't sound like I'm wrong.

420
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You don't understand the longest and rightness, you are wrong.

421
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
It doesn't sound like I'm wrong.

422
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Okay, I will just...

423
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Yeah, next question.

424
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Hi, my name is Ben Roth.

425
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I'm also a group therapist as well as being an animal that I've been trained.

426
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I've been working for 10 years since 9-11 on psychogroup therapies,

427
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
avoidance of talking about violent groups.

428
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
As part of the correction, not everybody fired and be lying.

429
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
There was one platoon that didn't fire.

430
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
This comes from Bob Lifting, who I've spoken with.

431
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:45,000
They had recently lost their sergeant, who was very beloved as a caretaker,

432
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
and they were in mourning and hoped the people that responded as a group.

433
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:58,000
The only group that didn't fire and be lying was this group had recently lost their sergeant.

434
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Also as a correction, millgroom's experiments did not require lethal.

435
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:13,000
That's one of the criticisms of millgroom study is that it was painful, not lethal.

436
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:19,000
The top of the dial, the people were told that it could be life-threatening.

437
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
It could be life-threatening.

438
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
The actor said, I think I'm having a heart attack or had some kind of...

439
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
There's a difference.

440
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And anyone silent.

441
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So the subjects thought that the person might be uncomfortable.

442
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
But it's not the same as pulling a switch in Auschwitz.

443
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:42,000
My interest is in genocide, which is a particular form of killing, mass killing,

444
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
and that is usually derived from war.

445
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:52,000
But I want to tell you about a French group therapist who might support some of your findings.

446
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:59,000
He essentially says all groups are established to establish security first.

447
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
That that's the main goal and to have free transactions among the group.

448
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:13,000
It's only when that is disrupted in some form and there is no mechanism for dealing with it that a group will become violent.

449
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:19,000
One of the ways that groups become violent is to find another.

450
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And other is to find that somebody not like the main characteristics of the group.

451
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It's not quite a stranger because a stranger can be brought in and can be educated.

452
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:45,000
But the other otherization seems to be a group phenomena, which was used by Solomon Ash in the German studies by creating otherization.

453
01:09:45,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And if you hear and analyze Hitler's speeches, I haven't done it, but I just discussed and contempt for another person or another group was the central issue of how Hitler spoke about Jews.

454
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And this is a process of otherization.

455
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:13,000
So when you look at this study in terms of group behavior,

456
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:23,000
they were bypassing this plane when they were making somebody else into another by maintaining a secure group.

457
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Well the question I would like to respond to the idea of security, not just domestication.

458
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I just want to point out that in a way you could just be talking about tribalism and even the kind of fanaticism that you get with sports fans, which I experienced firsthand.

459
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,000
And it's totally irrational and I assume that there is some involved program for that.

460
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:59,000
But that doesn't necessarily lead to, and you even see it between Obama supporters and Romney supporters now.

461
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
That doesn't necessarily have to become violent.

462
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And if we could have a world in which we still have fanatical tribalism and all sorts of bickering and fighting over politics and sports and whatever, but without the violence, which I think is quite possible, then obviously that would be a better world.

463
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:30,000
There's no reason that we can't achieve that. Those two programs, the violence and the tribalism, are not necessarily connected.

464
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
They're two different things.

465
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:40,000
They are in group theory and all the issues about group tend to disprove your hypothesis.

466
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Okay.

467
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I'm Prince Kenzel, I'm a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst.

468
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
A little bit closer to the mic.

469
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I'd like to just question the issue of the conference.

470
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Is male male competition does the lead to war?

471
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I'm conscious anxiety with male competition is envy and jealousy.

472
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Yes.

473
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Envy and jealousy.

474
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Envy is an intent to bust out someone's lights, is to snuff out their flame.

475
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I can't stand it that you have it and I don't have it.

476
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Jealousy is you have more than I do.

477
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
So I'm going to demote you. I'm going to pull you down.

478
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
But neither of those are killing.

479
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:40,000
The other issue is going from biology to humans.

480
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I was a medical center for federal prisoners in Missouri and I had the most violent mentally ill people.

481
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I did a study on violent prisoners versus non-violent prisoners.

482
01:12:52,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I had the prisoners stand in the center of a room and was me with my white coat on.

483
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I said, I'm going to take a step toward you.

484
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
If you feel I'm too close, tell me to stop.

485
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Take a step and go say, okay, take another step, stop.

486
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:18,000
The body buffer zone or territoriality around the inmate was four times larger in the violent people than in the non-violent people.

487
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:31,000
So there's a pathological territoriality that I think may, if two are going down a corridor at right angles and they pump into each other, there isn't a salt, there's violence.

488
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:43,000
The men would describe when I hit that point when they said stop, they felt I was looming.

489
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,000
They actually felt I was rushing. It was almost a hallucination. I had stopped.

490
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,000
But they felt almost as if I was on camera that I was looming at them.

491
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,000
So there was a perception. Suddenly I was dangerous. One in fact, I was not.

492
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:12,000
The final thing is the weapons of mass destruction of Iraq, you can make a case for a kind of paranoid group.

493
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Where the Wilson, Bush, Cheney, and so on are whipping each other up.

494
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And I kind of, if you listen to Hitler's tone in these two or three hour rants that he had, a tone of almost ecstasy.

495
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:46,000
There's a quality of almost erotic arousal that the French have the expression foliar du, madness of two, foliar, and so on.

496
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
That this thing escalates, escalates the point where they almost have to go to war.

497
01:14:51,000 --> 01:15:01,000
In other words, it's a psychotic delusional state. I guess that's what I want to just introduce the notion that war may be psychotic.

498
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I remember they had a lot of help from supposedly rational liberals like some of the pundits for the New York Times in going into Iraq.

499
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Thank you. I appreciate your comments. My name is Ben White. I'm a psychotherapist in training.

500
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Then we'll close with the mic. Can you hear me? I'll speak here. My name is Ben White. I'm a psychotherapist in training.

501
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I was listening. I was thinking of two incidences of male-male confrontation that I've had in the last three days.

502
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I live in southern Vermont. And I walk with my dog every day across the road.

503
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,000
It's a dirt road on National Forest Land. To let him off a leash. You wandered up a corner the other day.

504
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I heard a gunshot ring out. I rounded the corner and there was a guy walking down the trail.

505
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:59,000
He had a 22 pistol in his hand. Thankfully, my dog was fine. He was sitting there.

506
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:10,000
My thought was what the heck just happened. He approached me, thankfully, holstered his weapon and had this very strange interaction with him.

507
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Where he proceeded to convince me that my dog was posing some sort of threat to him.

508
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:21,000
He perceived and I maintain as I'm sure everybody else does. My dog is the sweetest dog in the world.

509
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:31,000
His contention was he was growling at me. My thought was, well, maybe if you put that 22 away, he wouldn't growl at you.

510
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I was left with the sensation of what the hell happened to this guy.

511
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:50,000
What was it that caused that reaction? I was very interested in your comments about attributing these kinds of tendencies to respond to conflict in a particular way.

512
01:16:50,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Maybe back to one event. I think the application of theories on the intergenerational transmission of these responses to traumas.

513
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Everybody history is not without its traumas. I'm very curious about how that has worked itself out in our culture.

514
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I guess if I could pose this in a question, I would ask how would you classify our role as people having informed conversations about this sort of thing in furthering this conversation.

515
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Maybe as members of this world and this culture, I'm not so deluded that I can change the entire world. But what do you think is our role?

516
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I hate to use your gentleman as an example, but how I saw a little moment of conflict there. And just pose the question, how would that have worked itself out differently?

517
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:03,000
You two had different backgrounds with how to resolve conflict. So I'll open that, I guess, to anybody.

518
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I didn't know my job.

519
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Well, there's a number of questions. Go ahead. No, go ahead. No, no, no, please.

520
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:23,000
A number of possible answers. I mean, one is that it could be if you two had very different, these two individuals had very different backgrounds.

521
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,000
It could have been a very different result. It would have been something that it would have been seen.

522
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I did my field research in Puerto Rico. One of the things that I saw was conversations escalate into nearly violent arguments in ways that took me quite by surprise when someone said something to challenge the legitimacy of someone else speaking.

523
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Where, to me, it was just kind of normal back and forth. It was taken in a very different way. And it was suddenly pulling people apart.

524
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I don't want to make too much out of that, but it was just a different kind of reaction than I was accustomed to.

525
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:15,000
And there's infinite numbers of ways you could multiply it. And I think going back to one of the things Ed said before that we have been in this conversation kind of conflating things from individual to males versus females to cultures in war.

526
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And it's important to keep these things distinct when we're talking about what we can do about it.

527
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And I think that the thing at the individual level, I think that that's where you can make the impact.

528
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I don't think that while the idea that you were talking about about psychopathic in war, there's an article in the journal Military Review, which I can't remember the author's name.

529
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:56,000
The military of the military psychopath, where it is stated quite clearly, not as an intellectual exercise, you've got to find these people because you can use them.

530
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:06,000
And then I went to my friend, former drill sergeant, said, is there a process of finding these people in basic training and said, yes, there is.

531
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:19,000
So that's part of the system. It's not why wars happen. So that's where you go from something like psychopathic to war, not in an integral way.

532
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:29,000
But if you have psychopaths at the top, and this is something that a lot of people have argued by, if you get to that point in our political system, pretty good chance you're a psychopath.

533
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:39,000
People have said that. Maybe then it does have a factor. The idea of trying to discriminate these things is very important, but you said this was fluid.

534
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:47,000
That's what we're going for. You know, going for fluid. So if you're writing a paper, you've got to be non fluid and try and tamp it down.

535
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:58,000
At the larger global level of war, some of the reactions, when I was working on this some time ago, not the recent work on the Near East, but a similar project.

536
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Looking globally, I told both my mother and my mother-in-law, neither of whom had any academic inclination whatsoever, that the point was that there was a time before a war.

537
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,000
If you're going just by the evidence, it's clear that there wasn't war in these earlier records.

538
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Both of them came back with something like, you've got to be kidding me.

539
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Because they just knew there was war. And as you do. And what I'm saying is, I could be wrong.

540
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
But if I'm answering this kind of question, I'm saying let's look at evidence.

541
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:47,000
And for the Near East and for the earlier periods in Europe, it's clear that there is evidence in some places and in some times, and in other places and in other times there isn't.

542
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:59,000
And that you should take that as the facts and then try to make your theories accommodate those rather than what you know before you go into it from the way you've grown up in our society.

543
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:10,000
So you've got to, I think for what you're doing, I think working at the individual level in Vermont, you know, I've got friends in Vermont and they complain about what they call the alternatives.

544
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,000
The new people move up who complain when they're spent, they're spent shells, land on their roofs and make noise.

545
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:24,000
These guys just don't know how to do country living. So you may have to make an adjustment for the Vermont local culture too.

546
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I want to make sure my dog.

547
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Yeah, I'd say the rational person would not risk life in a confrontation with somebody who has a gun when you don't.

548
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:46,000
So the psychopath could be on either side. But a person with reasonable judgment would be able to avoid conflict.

549
01:22:46,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I am recalling the technology studies in the 1960s that showed that social animals like wolves and apes do have the male establishment of hierarchy among males.

550
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:11,000
But this number two guy will make a resignation move like this exposing the jugular which stops the fight.

551
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:19,000
And that's good for the species. And I think if some get killed, a few.

552
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
That's the issue. You see on the bottom of the post-doc.

553
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:32,000
But the majority, the reflex works.

554
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Yes.

555
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:41,000
How do you know it doesn't work for men?

556
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Well, I don't think we have evidence. But don't turn your back on the person with a gun.

557
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Hi, everyone. Thank you for the talk.

558
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:05,000
My name is Elizabeth Reed. I have two reflections and a question.

559
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:14,000
My first reflection is the contagion of war.

560
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I was going back to this 10,000 years of peace that reminded me of Eden.

561
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I just wanted to bring of Eden. This idea of Eden and then the fall.

562
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And in that case, what is the fall? The fall is from a concept. A concept of war.

563
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
So I just want to bring that as we bring our different concepts and different disciplines.

564
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I think there's some way that each of those inform perhaps the concepts we live out.

565
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Second, reflection. I guess I wanted to declare by allegiance to the optimistic side,

566
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
along with John Horgan. And I want to, to the best of my ability and list,

567
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:02,000
anyone who wants to join us. One of the things I think about is like a suicide.

568
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Who here as a clinician has dealt with? Someone who has suicidal ideation.

569
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And how serious is suicidal ideation? What makes suicidal ideation dangerous?

570
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
The ideation. Once again, the power of the concept.

571
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And how do you work with someone who is suicidal ideation?

572
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:25,000
You create a survival plan. Or what I might call survival ideation.

573
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And I think that's really what you were talking about about sort of what leads to war versus what leads to peace.

574
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Whether or not we have ways to share our grain and all the rest of it.

575
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:40,000
This leads me to the question. We didn't talk about, I think to answer you,

576
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:46,000
what are these, in these 10,000 years of peace, what are they? Who was the enemy?

577
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
We talked about rise and fall in the population. Was the enemy not disease?

578
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Or how fragile human life was? And I think maybe we've lost that.

579
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:01,000
And one thing we didn't talk about now is how much we don't accept the idea of death.

580
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:06,000
We've disowned death in our culture. We prolong life at all costs.

581
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,000
And maybe because we've lost this value of death, is that related to war?

582
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:19,000
And how? I'd like to answer that because I was going to make a comment before and you have usurped my comment.

583
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Because it ties in with Ed's comment and I think it ties in with the whole notion of individuality also.

584
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And that is, and it also ties in with a moral education that we're talking at a certain level here.

585
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:42,000
But we're not talking about the individual and the individual feelings and emotions that go on in everyday life.

586
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And it seems to me that that's a really important aspect because we are all vulnerable and we're all vulnerable in being alive among other humans.

587
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:01,000
And that's a vulnerability that we don't, we're not really cognizant of.

588
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
We don't let come into our aliveness at all.

589
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,000
And it seems to me that that's a really important kind of realization.

590
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:16,000
And the realization of our own death too is something that's tied to that.

591
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And one thing that I want to bring out with respect to your comment has to do with the proliferation of guns in this country,

592
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:33,000
which simply exacerbates our vulnerability in being alive among other humans because we don't know what the hell another human is going to do to us,

593
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,000
whether they have a gun in their pocket and when it's going to happen or whatever.

594
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:46,000
And it just seems to me that that can't help in subliminal ways influence us in our everyday lives.

595
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
When we go, we hear about Aurora or when we hear about these things in Milwaukee or wherever it is,

596
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
it can happen anyplace that somebody can pull a gun that we're simply vulnerable.

597
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And that's at an individual level.

598
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:14,000
So in our present day lives, it seems to me our fragility has been magnified in our, especially here in America with the proliferation of guns.

599
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
It seems to me.

600
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
A related comment.

601
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Yes.

602
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:25,000
There are 50 gun suicides a day in the United States and 38 murders, 50 suicides, mostly by gun owners.

603
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Interesting. We don't hear about that from the NRA.

604
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,000
But apparently they keep their membership roster up in other ways.

605
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Well, if I could just do one response on the idea of Eden, that I think is an appropriate point.

606
01:28:45,000 --> 01:29:02,000
The area that around 3,200 BC, there was the central Templar region of central Jordan was Megito.

607
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:09,000
There was an enormous temple structure there, completely unfortified like all the temple structures had been.

608
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And then the Egyptian settlements, which had been there for several hundred years, put up their walls.

609
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
And Megito put up a wall virtually the same home.

610
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
We can't even tell which came first.

611
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
And Megito was shortly thereafter abandoned.

612
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
We don't know whether it was attacked. It's only been partially excavated.

613
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
But they put up a wall, a terrible wall.

614
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:36,000
It was a most poorly constructed defensive wall that you could find anywhere because they'd never done it before.

615
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:46,000
But one of the things that you see in the temple, which is really striking, is a completely without precedent in the whole area.

616
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
There's a copper, I'm sorry, a bronze sword.

617
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
There's never been a sword anywhere in this area.

618
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
And now they've got a sword in their main temple.

619
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
And then it's abandoned.

620
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And the reason I think it's relevant to Eden is that Megito is the basis of Armageddon.

621
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
That's what the war of the end of the world is.

622
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,000
And I think in a sense, the world of peace already didn't at Megito.

623
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Armageddon happened in 3,200 BC.

624
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:23,000
It's interesting that you say that because of when you were talking earlier, I was thinking,

625
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:33,000
well, that's, I was thinking of the Bible, which of course is, seems scholars seem to think is based on experience or myths.

626
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:43,000
That occurred far more recently than the period you're indicating, but you could also see Eden as that period.

627
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Okay, I'm not a psychiatrist.

628
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I'm a literature professor.

629
01:30:48,000 --> 01:31:00,000
But I want to go back to the question of what you really haven't focused on is social structure.

630
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:11,000
You did it, Mr. Horgan did it initially when you asked us whether we thought war was inevitable or not,

631
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
whether peace was possible among nations.

632
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:27,000
And the description that you gave us, Mr. Ferguson, about this period in the Levant indicates that probably they weren't nations.

633
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:31,000
They were tribal groups, cooperative societies and whatever.

634
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:39,000
So my question really is, do you think it's possible to go beyond the nation's state?

635
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Because I would argue that if you're stuck with the nation's state, you're stuck with war.

636
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I disagree.

637
01:31:48,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So I know that there has been Einstein and other leading intellectuals of the 20th century after World War II thought that the only way to prevent this from happening in the future was to have a global government because nationalism inevitably would lead to war.

638
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:17,000
But we see lots of relations between nations where there's not only war, but war is inconceivable.

639
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:32,000
So between the United States and Canada, for example, what is remarkable today now is that war between Germany and France, I would say, is also inconceivable.

640
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
You know, maybe you've got a very small period of time here.

641
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I know, but I think it's significant that we can feel that way when there was this horrific violence.

642
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:49,000
So recently, and when you look at the history where they're always at each other's throats.

643
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:58,000
So I'm hopeful because I see this kind of social change happening at the national level and international level so rapidly what you have.

644
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:12,000
You know, I think one of the most obvious kind of dumb reputations of the idea that war is at all biological is that you get the most war-like societies on earth practically overnight turning into a bunch of past.

645
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Which you had with Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany.

646
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Now those obviously were countries that were conquered, but you have other examples of very war-like nations like Switzerland and Sweden, which in the 18th century were feared for their war-like ways.

647
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Suddenly, getting sick of war and saying we're not going to do this anymore and they've managed to maintain at least neutrality right through all the horrors of the war.

648
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:52,000
So I think there are demonstration proofs through history and around the world today that nations can live peacefully together.

649
01:33:52,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And I think that's the direction that human reason points us in and the direction that any kind of reasonable interpretation of history leads us in.

650
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,000
And I think that's why we actually are doing it.

651
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:17,000
I think that the issue of nation-states is what's happening now, you shouldn't assume it's going to keep going. Things can change.

652
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:27,000
But you look at South America, which people don't talk about because there's no wars going on, internal or external, but they've got all of these states.

653
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Africa, most of the wars that have been going on recently are not between states, but somehow within states or around states or across states.

654
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:45,000
The nation-state at present isn't really the war-making unit in much of the world.

655
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
On your point of can we get past this?

656
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:58,000
William Urey, Bill Urey, is an anthropologically trained conflict resolution guy and he's got a book called Getting to Peace.

657
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:07,000
And his main idea is that we can use these ideas of developing what he calls a third side of people standing outside of a conflict,

658
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
pressuring people, belligerents to solve it without violence.

659
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:21,000
And also talking about the growing importance of horizontal networks that aren't part of the power pyramids that have characterized most of our until-very recent history,

660
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
and that they may be a way of moving in a different direction.

661
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:34,000
We're not going to go back to simple hunters and gatherers, but horizontal conflicts rather than these pyramidal structures, that's a possibility.

662
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:42,000
And I pick up from a previous point that made about the concern about suicide.

663
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I have this concern emerging, for example, from the statistic that for two years running there were more of our troops committing suicide than lost in battle in Afghanistan.

664
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:07,000
And I have read somewhere that half of the suicides are among troops who have not seen battle, but I don't know if that's reliable.

665
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Not true, okay. It doesn't surprise me.

666
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:15,000
But the thought comes to me this way.

667
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:22,000
The VA, the Veterans Administration, hired a thousand new psychologists and so on to treat people.

668
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:34,000
But can they ask this question? That the mind has been changed by the training, not necessarily by the experience of killing, but by the training to be able to kill.

669
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:46,000
And when a soldier gets home, as Grossman points out, we don't have troopships anymore as we did after World War II, where people got re-socialized and they stayed with the units until they got home, etc.

670
01:36:46,000 --> 01:37:06,000
There are many factors. But suppose you're trained to kill and you're sent home and you find out that you are angrier at your spouse or your neighbor or the guy who cuts you off in traffic than you ever were at the designated enemy.

671
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
How do you deal with that?

672
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:19,000
What's the way of going backwards? Now are the VA psychologists going to be able to take up the issue with their, shall we say, their bosses?

673
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:35,000
There are people in the VA. I give them credit for coining the phrase moral injury as a contributor to this maybe post-traumatic experience leading to suicide and depression and so on, inability to fit in.

674
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:52,000
But are we able to take psychiatric professionals and enable them to say what you've done to these people has to be prevented because it can't necessarily be cured?

675
01:37:52,000 --> 01:38:07,000
You mean as a kind of anti-war movement? No, it's that we have to take responsibility for the training that enables people to kill very easily and then it leaves them suicidal in large numbers that we own up to that.

676
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:19,000
But then it's making them possibly less affected as soldiers and that's why I'm hoping to take the next step and just say, well this military training is wrong.

677
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Tell someone traumatized. Someone said today that the military trainers, somebody up there, knows that psychopaths do very well and we should cultivate that.

678
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Pure psychopath army, that's what we need.

679
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Only heroes can be all that you can be.

680
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,000
That's a good psychopath.

681
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
A good psychopath.

682
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Hi, thank you very much for a great conversation and a lot of interesting points.

683
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I would like to point out that all here, mostly like peaceful people.

684
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:13,000
But let's talk about who is on the top of military complex and high military officials.

685
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:35,000
If you look at these, for example, as a game, they invested a lot of energy and a lot of resources in producing new weapons and they have the...

686
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:50,000
When they look at these new technological advances, they probably have this feeling of pleasure and they want to use them.

687
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,000
They use these toys. They want to play with them.

688
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:04,000
We have so many toys already that how we can stop them. I personally don't see it away.

689
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I would like to... I have one example of one of them, maybe the biggest players in these kinds of games and Yoshif Stalin who said that one person is a tragedy.

690
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And of million person is statistics.

691
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
So they don't see soldiers or even us as human beings.

692
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
They already on other level.

693
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:41,000
And they could not... On Wall Street, they also don't see us as people.

694
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:49,000
They see us as potential for their... for gaining... for something gaining.

695
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:58,000
So you see society is so already divided on so many levels. What do you think?

696
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Of course, maybe sometime long ago when it was much more simply, not divided on so many levels, maybe it was possible there was so long time of peace.

697
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:21,000
But is it possible today? And how it's possible, what's the real instruments of this?

698
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I think we've been talking about psychopaths. We've been talking about people who are happy to go to war.

699
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:37,000
You just mentioned Joseph Stalin and I voted for Barack Obama and I probably will again, but I'm not happy about it.

700
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I think he is decent, obviously extremely intelligent person, but he is carrying out drone assassinations where he knows he will kill civilians.

701
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:57,000
And that has now become US policy has become accepted. And I think that this is war crime.

702
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:06,000
And George Bush also carried out war crimes and he was elected to a second term when it was apparent that he was carrying out a moral military policy.

703
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:14,000
So this isn't something that we can foist off on leaders or people in the military, industrial complex or psychopaths.

704
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,000
It's something that we all in a democracy like ours, bear responsibility for.

705
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:32,000
And I think we have to examine what it is in us that allows us to, because we collectively do, perpetuate these attitudes that make it so easy to go to war in the future.

706
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:39,000
It's not the crazies on the fringes. It's really all of us.

707
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I agree and I'm glad to report though that the people who operate the drones are also having stress syndromes because they view these people on television screens for days and weeks and then they kill them.

708
01:42:52,000 --> 01:43:02,000
And they're experiencing some of this post traumatic stuff.

709
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:21,000
I would just also ask again something about how we get to this better place that you keep envisioning and how we do it without some kind of moral education that involves some kind of deep self searching to find out who the hell we are.

710
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:28,000
And just what it means to live among other humans in a peaceful way.

711
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I think that there's a lot that needs to be done.

712
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
It's not some simple process.

713
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I think a moral education is really quite essential.

714
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I don't know whether the rest of it.

715
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:47,000
And that involves really delving into feelings as your thing in terms of fear and threat, et cetera.

716
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:53,000
This is going back to Ed's point about the different levels of analysis of what we're talking about.

717
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:59,000
And I think that this is certainly true at an individual level.

718
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:07,000
The focus on the individual, even the gender differences of what it means to be a man or a woman.

719
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:14,000
That this is something that has importance for our notions of war in our society.

720
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:23,000
In Joshua Goldstein, I'll just mention to someone who's written about war and gender and has a new book out on fighting for peace.

721
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
These are books of people who are interested in the subject.

722
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
I disagree with him on some things, but he's really on the mark there.

723
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:38,000
But to go back also to your point is that I know generals like to, people like toys.

724
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I don't think it's so much playing with him though.

725
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I'm meeting yesterday on counterinsurgency, which is something that I also work on because the military has really been trying to get anthropology,

726
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:56,000
either to mine anthropology for counterinsurgency efforts, and it's a real problem for the discipline of anthropology.

727
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:04,000
And this guy's a history professor at West Point, but a dissident, and he says that counterinsurgency is dead,

728
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
and that we now know that it doesn't work.

729
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
It's dead.

730
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:18,000
And my question was, I'd like to know that it's really most sincerely dead because of what it's doing for anthropology.

731
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:25,000
And then he said that even though it doesn't work, and when he's talking to field officers, they'll listen to them,

732
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
but general staff, you cannot criticize the idea because it is doctrine.

733
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:36,000
And the reason it's doctrine is that in the military and the Marines, this protects their budget as they are pivoting to

734
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Asia, it's the Navy, and the Air Force.

735
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:44,000
And the only way the military can protect its budget is counterinsurgencies.

736
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
We've been looking at it doesn't work.

737
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I know it's a shocking idea that the Pentagon could support a program that doesn't work just to protect a budget,

738
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
but seems to be happening.

739
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:03,000
And that Seymour Milman, one of my mentors from Long Go wrote about the military economy, just drilled it into me.

740
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:09,000
He says it's the bureaucratic imperative, protect your or expand your budget.

741
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
That's what's the important thing.

742
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:17,000
And the budget is hinged on the concept of successful counterinsurgency.

743
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
It's not true.

744
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
It doesn't work.

745
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
But they're going to defend it.

746
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
And this is why I say you've got to look at the leaders.

747
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:32,000
And when someone in politics, either Obama or Romney or anybody else, says, let's go take it to the general.

748
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
And see what the generals have to say.

749
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
The generals are protecting their budgets.

750
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:42,000
They're the last people to ask, because they're there to protect the army and the Marines.

751
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Their enemy isn't the Taliban.

752
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
It's the Navy and the Air Force.

753
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
That's the peace piece.

754
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Well, yeah.

755
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,000
So this is, you've got to look at the interests of people in power.

756
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,000
So I agree with you, although the playing with it, they can play with it in peacetime, too.

757
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:02,000
I mean, George Bush landing on the aircraft carrier, you can do that.

758
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
But their budgets are very important.

759
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Thank you all very, very much.

760
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Thank you.

761
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Thank you very much.

762
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Thank you.

763
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Thank you.

764
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
That's really wonderful.

765
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Thank you.

766
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Good work, Captain.

767
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I have some water.

768
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I have some.

769
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I don't like these two.

770
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I'm sorry.

771
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Thank you.

772
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Thank you.

773
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Thank you.

774
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Thank you.

775
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Thank you.

776
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Thank you.

777
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Thank you.
