1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
...

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,220
...

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,860
wise

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:25,300
evidoring

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:40,720
I'm Ed Nursece in Director of the Center.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:49,520
Before we get going on today's program that was proposed by Beverly Zabriski and Harold

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:59,340
Atman Sparkers, I'd like to tell you what we are planning for spring of next year.

8
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,560
So far we have planned three round tables.

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,600
One will be on data versus this course, humanity is in the age of big data.

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,280
The other would be on the ethics of AI, machine learning, and the last one would be on the

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,800
general subject of memory looked at from various perspectives.

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,000
Beverly will take over from this point and introduce the speakers.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Thank you.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's see.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,640
Let me do this way.

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,320
Welcome, welcome.

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,840
The persons in this room are one of the three audiences for this program.

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,360
There is also a live stream audience and there will also be a YouTube audience going

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,680
through the years.

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,400
So remember that if you get up and ask a question or make a remark, you will be recorded out

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:04,680
at infinitum and that's taken as a release that we are allowed to use your question

22
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,560
and your presence in the YouTube video.

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,880
So welcome to all three audiences to this day.

24
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm a Jungian analyst at Gave Me Permission to say that in this hallowed building and

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,640
tells you what an ecumenical mind he has.

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,320
And Jung said that if he ever came back to another life, he would study prime numbers.

27
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,600
That's how he would spend his time.

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,920
And he urged all of his followers to do so.

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,840
I have not done so.

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,680
So the closest I get to understanding mathematics is by being around minds like in this circle.

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,960
And so I think that's a pleasure we'll all have today.

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:56,320
So thank you all for agreeing to come and to be with us and Alma, especially to you.

33
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,120
You stepped in the last minute because Stephanie was ill.

34
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
So thank you.

35
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,240
Alma did not intend to be here this morning and here she is.

36
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,760
And she's a great lady.

37
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,560
So Harold and I were talking about this as a possibility and he suggested the title

38
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,720
Mathematics and Other Reality.

39
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,280
So that's what we'll be speaking about today.

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,520
And it's a spontaneous conversation.

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,920
There's been no preparation.

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,200
And it's meant to be scholars and intellectuals who hear each other and then get into an exchange.

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,440
Harold is a senior scientist at the Collegium Helvetium at the University of Zurich and

44
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,080
the Polytechnic in Zurich.

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,720
After a PhD in physics at Munich, he worked as a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute

46
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,040
for extraterrestrial physics.

47
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,200
Then he served as head of the theory group at the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology

48
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,360
at Freiburg.

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,040
This fields of research are the theory of complex systems, conceptual and theoretical

50
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,520
aspects of quantum theory and mind matter relations.

51
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,280
He's the president of the Society for Mind and Matter Research and editor in chief of the

52
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,640
interdisciplinary journal Mind and Matter.

53
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,080
Last summer I went to Harold's conference on the Science of Consciousness in Interlochen.

54
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,960
He said it was one of their smallest conferences, it was 620 scientists from around the world

55
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,040
discussing the matter of consciousness and where it emerges from and scientific perspectives

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,600
on that.

57
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,800
And Switzerland, we like to keep everything small.

58
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,120
We're a small country, after all.

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,480
And then Amma Steingaard.

60
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,360
Herages the interplay between politics and mathematical rationality.

61
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,440
Her second book, Accountable Democracy, Mathematical Reasoning and Representative Democracy in America,

62
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:09,320
1920 to Now, examines how mathematical thought and computing technologies have impacted electoral

63
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,640
politics in the U.S. in the 20th century.

64
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:19,560
She investigates how changing computational practices from statistical modeling to geometrical

65
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:27,040
analysis insinuated themselves into the most basic definitions of fair representation of

66
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,920
the American electorate.

67
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,360
Nothing could be more timely than what you're working on.

68
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,220
In pure abstraction, mathematical thought and high modernism forthcoming.

69
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,400
She investigates the influence of axiomatic reasoning on mid-century American intellectual

70
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,800
thought.

71
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,840
She's a junior fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows and a pre-doctoral research fellow

72
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,320
with the Max Planck Institute in Berlin.

73
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Pardon me?

74
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,960
I was a junior fellow.

75
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,760
I'm now in Columbia.

76
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
All right.

77
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,960
So, yes, that's true.

78
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,000
You are now a professor at Columbia that was not added to this.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,400
Thank you.

80
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:16,040
Michael Harris has become a mainstay intellect of the Helix group here.

81
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,840
He's a professor of mathematics at Columbia and is on extended leave from the University

82
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,880
Perry D. Duro where he taught for 20 years.

83
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,680
He was professor of Brandeis, got his PhD from Harvard.

84
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,880
He's organized and co-organized more than 20 conferences and workshops.

85
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,880
In his field of number theory and until 2018 directed the European Research Council Project,

86
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,960
arithmetic of automorphic motives.

87
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,040
Fantastic.

88
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,680
I have to find out what it means, but I know it's fantastic.

89
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,320
He's been a visiting professor at Bethlehem University in Palestine.

90
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,840
He's been an exchange scholar at the Stecholov Institute in Moscow.

91
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:14,000
He's initiated the project of science for people in Nicaragua and London Paris number

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,800
theory seminar.

93
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,680
His book, Mathematics Without Apologies won the Prose Award in Mathematics.

94
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,520
He is a contributions to the Langlands program.

95
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,200
Maybe you'll tell us what that is.

96
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:34,480
He won the Grand Prix Sophie's Jormendow, Blocademy in Sciences in 2006.

97
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:43,160
That he asked me to condense his introduction because it was not too long, so many accomplishments.

98
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,920
Harry Field is a silver professor and university professor at NYU.

99
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,360
Before that he taught at Princeton, USC and CUNY Graduate Center.

100
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,280
He's the author of Science Without Numbers, Expanded Edition, and Saving Truth from Paradox.

101
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,440
As well as numerous articles in the philosophy of mathematics and logic.

102
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,360
His Science Without Numbers defends the view that one can develop physics without assuming

103
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,440
the existence of mathematical entities.

104
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:22,320
He's been working in the philosophy of mathematics, less on the existence of mathematical entities,

105
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:30,120
and more on the objectivity of mathematics, which you're going to prove today.

106
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Chris McDonald.

107
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,360
McDaniel has a BA in Philosophy from Western Washington University.

108
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,440
His PhD in Philosophy is from University of Massachusetts Amherst.

109
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,200
He's been teaching at Syracuse University until 2019 and is now professor of Philosophy

110
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,160
at Notre Dame.

111
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,320
His publications include the books The Fragmentation of Being and this is metaphysics, which is

112
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
forthcoming.

113
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,560
Topics in metaphysics, ethics in the history of philosophy.

114
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,320
Welcome, Chris.

115
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,080
Marcus.

116
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,040
He's one of the founders of New Realism.

117
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,600
He studied in Heidelberg, Lisbon, New York.

118
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,960
He has held the chair since 2009 for epistemology, modern and contemporary philosophy at the University

119
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,120
of Bonn.

120
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,560
And at his appointment, he became Germany's youngest philosophy professor.

121
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,480
Now I just heard you upstairs tell the others that now there's a younger one.

122
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,360
The mathematics, he also won a fields medalist at my university, he was hired one month

123
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,520
after me, so I was the youngest full professor at my university for one month.

124
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:51,560
And then Peter Fausberg was hired at the age of 21 and just won the fields medal last year,

125
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,840
so apparently you go tired.

126
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,480
Yeah, so that's the reality of mathematics.

127
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,520
Someone comes along younger, right?

128
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,840
He's also the director of the International Center for Philosophy in Bonn as well as the

129
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,720
Multidisciplinary Center for Science and Thought.

130
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,600
He's held faculty in visiting positions at many different universities, including NYU,

131
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,360
and he's written popular books about philosophical issues.

132
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,760
His book Why the World Does Not Exist has been translated into 14 languages.

133
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,520
Sometimes we wish that was right, right?

134
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,960
So I would now, after this long pause, ask Harold to open up the discussion and thank

135
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,520
you for your patience.

136
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,920
On this round table, you will hear a lot about the term ontology and ontology as opposed

137
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,200
to epistemology.

138
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:54,120
So I thought it might be a good idea to start with a very brief, maybe anecdotal piece,

139
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,400
which illustrates to everybody what ontology is all about, what epistemology is all about,

140
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,800
and then we might go from there.

141
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:10,480
In my example, my anecdote of course comes from the history of my own fields from physics.

142
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:19,440
It goes back to the early 1930s, it goes to Ireland to Dublin because at that time I

143
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,520
was working at Dublin and he was often visited by his physicist colleagues, like in this

144
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,880
case, Erwin Wehrner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac.

145
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:39,320
So Heisenberg and Dirac just took a little walk after the lunch out of Dublin in the hills,

146
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:49,320
I hope, and then they come over such a hill and in the valley they see a huge herd of sheep.

147
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:58,680
And Heisenberg says, look Dirac, these sheep are all shorn and Dirac, he was known as a

148
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,560
very meticulous thinker, so he had to analyze the statement before he could answer.

149
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:13,280
And then he said, well Heisenberg, at least on this side.

150
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:20,960
So you see, this is about being and knowing, right?

151
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:28,520
So I don't think I have to explain that, but being, this is the notion of philosophy which

152
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,200
ontology deals with.

153
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:36,760
So ontology is about existence, whenever you make an existence statement and philosophy

154
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,320
this is about ontology.

155
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,880
Whenever you make a knowledge statement it's about epistemology.

156
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:52,160
And I think many sciences in the 20th century have seen a tendency to build up an ontology

157
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,840
which many of them call a fundamental ontology, which in physics would be about the existence

158
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:05,880
of particles as kind of building blocks for the universe and everything else.

159
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:13,360
Like for instance, biology, genes or even up to neuroscience is actually in some way,

160
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,600
in one way or another reducible to these particles.

161
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,240
Even though this program is of course not completed, but the assumption is in principle

162
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,560
this is the way to go.

163
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,360
And you know, when I still was a student I had a PhD advisor who could still tell me

164
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,480
that chemistry is not yet understood physics.

165
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,640
So the hope was really to take all of chemistry back into physics.

166
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:45,960
And the research program for instance of microbiology or molecular biology is set up in the same

167
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,320
spirit, just produced in the smaller parts.

168
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,200
In the neuroscience there is the neuron doctrine where people think that you can understand

169
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,600
everything in the brain once you understand how the neurons operate and cooperate.

170
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,960
So this research program is the program in all these fields to build up the kind of fundamental

171
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,000
ontology, we have the notion of ontology.

172
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,600
So there's only one fundamental sort of beings and everything can be reduced to that.

173
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,000
Now interestingly the second half of the 20th century voices here and there came up and

174
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
these voices became one more who sort of doubted that this is really working.

175
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,840
So we see today a kind of development in which people at least in the natural sciences, that's

176
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:46,800
what I can talk about really started out this notion of fundamental ontology.

177
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,800
And talking about fundamental of course raises immediately a resonance with fundamentalism

178
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,120
in much broader sense.

179
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:02,800
So this round table is also at least to some extent a round table that could be, I don't

180
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,480
know how it works, how it will develop, it could be a kind of critique or traces of a

181
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,520
critique of fundamentalism generally.

182
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,320
I mean in physics and in the sciences we see that anyway.

183
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:30,120
And I'm really curious to hear from all of you how you think about that.

184
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
You want to do a round?

185
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Sure.

186
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Yeah.

187
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Yeah.

188
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,880
Well yeah I can say a few words about the meaning of those terms, how I understand them

189
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,960
and then how this relates to this claim that you flack that the world does not exist which

190
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:52,320
is short hand or like a slogan for saying that we shouldn't even be foundationalists

191
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,760
in ontology itself which I think is not identical to physics.

192
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,400
But just a few words about that how at least I understand those terms.

193
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:09,680
So I think ontology is the systematic investigation into the meaning of existence or depending

194
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,320
on your methodology just into existence.

195
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
Right?

196
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,120
So it might be a good idea to think about the meaning of existence, statements to approach

197
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
existence.

198
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,640
So that would be a good methodology that's why I'm saying it or just into existence.

199
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,520
And epistemology is the discipline which deals with the nature and scope of what we can

200
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,280
know about what there is.

201
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,160
However I think that of course the two cannot be thoroughly separated because trivially

202
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,360
knowledge exists.

203
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Right?

204
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:48,760
So and what we've learned from just the development of modern natural science is precisely that

205
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,240
there's a sense in which the universe insuffides the observable universe is somehow intimately

206
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:02,120
tied to its nobility by creatures such as us for the trivial reason that our best and

207
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,280
maybe only way but you will tell me about that to know anything about the observable

208
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,200
universe is by way of interfering with it.

209
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Right?

210
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
By intervening.

211
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,640
That's you know you don't know the universe a priori maybe there's something that you

212
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,840
know about the universe without experiments such as that the universe is the universe

213
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:26,280
or maybe some more demanding things but anyhow so you know I think that one of the things

214
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,440
that we actually learn from the development of modern science is that we need to take

215
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,160
into account that no one exists within the universe.

216
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,840
So this is something that I would also like to discuss with some people here.

217
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Right?

218
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,280
There seem to be paradigm cases of very demanding knowledge claims where we precisely cannot

219
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:53,280
just distinguish between epistemology and ontology in that neat way.

220
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:07,520
Oh well I have opinions about the universe but none of them is legitimated by my professional

221
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,560
expertise I'm going to keep them to myself.

222
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:18,480
And instead I'm going to talk about what existence might mean to a mathematician because

223
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:27,040
it's a word that is used systematically and yet as I've thought about this for some time

224
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:35,360
I in its use the use entails no metaphysical commitment whatsoever.

225
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:44,040
This is certainly how I understand it now there are versions or interpretations of the foundations

226
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,680
of mathematics say a hundred years ago people might have thought differently that it is

227
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:59,400
a need to found mathematics on something that's metaphysically transparent but not so many

228
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:08,720
people think that way anymore and when the word existence is so that a typical mathematical

229
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,880
statement begins the theorem there exists such and such.

230
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,960
Another typical opening for mathematical statement is let X be something.

231
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,640
When you analyze that of course this is just really a performative gesture that is saying

232
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:35,480
this is how one opens the discussion if you analyze that's an imperative.

233
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,640
Now who is to whom is that imperative addressed?

234
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,840
It's nobody who is reading it is going to object or is going to prevent this X from

235
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
existing.

236
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:53,640
So this is just a way of talking and you might say that mathematicians have managed

237
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:01,320
to develop a coherent system of communication in the absence in spite of the disadvantages

238
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,760
of natural language the fact that.

239
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:13,720
So that's a first approach and the other thing I would say is that at least over the past

240
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,880
well maybe 50, 70 years mathematics has been increasingly the practice of mathematics has

241
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:27,440
been increasingly dominated especially in my field of number theory by the fact that

242
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,040
our imaginations are expectations have outrun our ability to verify them.

243
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:40,320
So there are large programs in which people are working.

244
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:49,760
The aim of which is to construct objects whose existence in whatever sense one wants

245
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:57,840
to mean that and again I don't think it's metaphysically very significant but the existence

246
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,040
has been anticipated.

247
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,240
So there's a that's to say there's a there are series of conjectures that such and such

248
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:10,840
as structure should be invoked to explain the what has already been studied in terms

249
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,560
of something more.

250
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,040
So this is this is a this is a different this part of the discussion I don't want to get

251
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,560
into it but something that one might call more fundamental although in a sense it's the opposite

252
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,040
of more fundamental as that would be used by the physicists.

253
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:33,720
So for example Peter Scholzem was given this position became the youngest professor in

254
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,280
Germany on the basis of his contributions to constructing a theory kind of theory that

255
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:48,520
had been anticipated that explain many many of the phenomena that had been or the mathematical

256
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
theorems that had been developed.

257
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,840
So I think I should just stop there.

258
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
Sure.

259
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:59,080
I'm I have to say I guess the two things that I want to say isn't I come to I'm an historian

260
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,240
so I come to this question for a little bit from a different perspective.

261
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,480
What I'm interested in is the question how question of existence ideas about ontology

262
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,800
and specific specifically in mathematics have changed over time.

263
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,200
So what Michael was just talking about the question about foundation right we know that

264
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,240
interest in the foundation of mathematics really at the end of the 19th century and the 10th

265
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,160
or 20th century really start because of the discovery of non Euclidean geometry right.

266
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,960
So part of what interests me is how new mathematical developments new idea new research project

267
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,440
call into question what are already kind of existing assumptions that people and mostly

268
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,400
are both philosophers but they're also thinking about mathematicians himself are thinking.

269
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,320
So this is kind of the the question that interests me is how this idea is about ontology and

270
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,400
post-emology change over time in relation to research itself.

271
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,080
And then to get to this question that you're saying about the ontology and epistemology

272
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,560
I was very interesting because one of the things that I've been thinking about for a

273
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,200
long time is that in a way in mathematics there is no distinction between ontology and

274
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,360
epistemology I mean I know I'm saying I know it's a big claim and I'm throwing it on purpose

275
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:23,480
out there but if you take something let's take something like that notion that there

276
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,960
exists a four dimensional object right.

277
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,360
For years for centuries mathematicians did not acknowledge that this is something that's

278
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,080
even possibility it's only in the 19th century that this idea that the four dimensional space

279
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:45,000
right exists comes along and then first how mathematicians learn to think about the four

280
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
dimension also then shapes what is the existence of a four dimension is.

281
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,520
There's a way in which the way people think about ontology and the way of thinking about

282
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:01,400
ontology are so linked in mathematics and I'm surrounded by philosophers so I kind of

283
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:08,640
want to throw that back at you you know how to make that distinction historically and even

284
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,640
right now.

285
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,120
So I don't do philosophy in mathematics but I am interested in existence so I assume

286
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,320
that's why I was invited here.

287
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,080
So I think that's maybe one thing it's a couple questions just as a person coming to the

288
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:31,200
outside of this that maybe I'll just enter into the discussion or downstream people to

289
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
consider.

290
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,080
How do we tell when we are using a notion of existence that is metaphysically committal

291
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,520
or not?

292
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:46,800
You might think when you're doing mathematics you don't care whether or not it is the day

293
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,600
the numbers that you're talking about or the functions or what not really exist that might

294
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,240
be something that's not relevant to your concerns as a practicing mathematician but you might

295
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,480
still wonder does the fact that I don't care mean that I'm not using a notion of existence

296
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,680
as committal or is it that I just don't care whether I am using a committal notion?

297
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,160
I hope you said.

298
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,240
May I interject because I have a it's not a joke.

299
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,400
It's a true story.

300
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,200
I was one of the reasons I'm here is the first things that happened.

301
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,360
My career is a mathematician who was invited to talk about things other than mathematics.

302
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,000
I was invited to review a book for the notices of the American mathematical society.

303
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,120
In the book I made me I had to read a fair amount of philosophy including Heidegger at

304
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
the time which...

305
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,960
Did you say Heidegger?

306
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Heidegger, yes.

307
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Heidegger.

308
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,800
It was written by a mathematician but he well well...

309
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,960
Heidegger studied mathematics people who forget that.

310
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,080
He was an utterly agree mathematics and theology which kind of explains what's going on.

311
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,400
So while I was thinking about this I was at a conference in minster and I was sitting

312
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:11,120
at a table speaking beer with some of my colleagues and they were discussing the reality

313
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,040
of the continuum.

314
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,920
There was a German and American and a French.

315
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,720
This is a true story.

316
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,080
This is one of these things that you can't make up.

317
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,240
So the Frenchmen said and didn't believe the real numbers existed.

318
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,960
These are all very successful mathematicians by the way.

319
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,560
And they all work in numbers theory.

320
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,400
The Frenchmen said no he just doesn't believe it.

321
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,440
It doesn't stop him from working with them.

322
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:47,440
The Germans said well he doesn't believe that they exist individually but as a...

323
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
As a collective.

324
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,000
They had some sort of collective existence.

325
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,560
And the Americans said not only do they exist but he can show you one anytime you come to

326
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,040
his computer screen he can just make them exist.

327
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,840
So all of them are doing mathematics, the same kind of mathematics reading Joseph's papers.

328
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:18,280
When that sense I would say if there's a fit metaphysical commitment it's something

329
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:24,520
that escapes any of the people who would supposedly be committed.

330
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,920
And so I would say that if a commitment is not conscious it doesn't count.

331
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,840
One of the things the last three or so comments bring out is this idea you started in like

332
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,000
by mentioning that some objects are positive.

333
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,840
Some seem to be discovered based on mathematical research.

334
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,680
Others one starts by positive.

335
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,240
So even the idea as you say I'm a four dimensional space was originally sort of put out there

336
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,680
as a almost like a prescriptive.

337
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,240
And then later it seems to be an existence and maybe that's a little bit about what you

338
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,760
were talking about at the beginning.

339
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:06,000
There's this edge between the being of it, the positing of it and then the discovery

340
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,440
of it which is more of a epistemological issue I suppose.

341
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,440
So Chris look what you provoked.

342
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,640
Do you want to actually carry on?

343
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,240
Maybe part of the good change.

344
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:29,960
So I liked the idea of physics as fundamental that Harold started with.

345
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:42,960
In in in in particular the idea that particles in fields are fundamental which seems to have

346
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:54,080
gone out in recent versions of recent news about quantum mechanics.

347
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:08,000
I also liked Michael's idea that in mathematics.

348
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,360
So entities don't exist in the same way that physical entity to do that.

349
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:23,800
That existence in mathematics is a special.

350
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:29,280
My early work was trying to put these together.

351
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:39,360
So there's no there's no problem when you just consider pure mathematics of just saying

352
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,520
well basically any consistent theory is fine.

353
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:50,640
There is an issue though about the applications of mathematics.

354
00:29:50,640 --> 00:30:06,320
And so in particular people there there was a time at least when when when people argued

355
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:19,400
that the same reasons for for believing in particles and fields also were reasons for

356
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:27,600
believing in the existence of mathematical entities because the idea was that the reason

357
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:35,280
for believing in mathematical entities is that all our business theories postulate them.

358
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,080
But all our best theories are foreign related to the heavy mathematical language so they

359
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:54,440
also postulate mathematical entities and so some same same argument that applied to particles

360
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,880
in the fields all to apply to mathematical entities.

361
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:10,920
So I didn't like Chris conclusion.

362
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:16,280
I wanted Michael to see you that basically in whatever sense mathematical entities exist

363
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:22,920
is just because there's a consistent theory in in faulting them.

364
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:33,520
So a bunch of my work has been trying to reconcile these two things and the in the initial stage

365
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,640
it was trying to show that you can actually formulate the physical theories without positive

366
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:54,600
stability mathematical entities and in more recent years it's kind of taken a different

367
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,520
turn but the but it reconciled the views that the two of you mentioned it's been sort of

368
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:04,440
a major project of my work in philosophy of mathematics.

369
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:11,320
Let me just relate to what the mathematicians sort of speak but the idea of non-committal

370
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:17,320
or something when you talk to you mentioned that conference in Talaqah last year.

371
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:25,280
One of the keynote speakers there was I guess who Roger Panros is actually both he is an

372
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:31,480
accomplished mathematician and an accomplished physicist and Roger Panros I mean he's completely

373
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:39,660
clear about his belief that mathematical objects exist and not only in the sense of

374
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,360
let X be or something like that.

375
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,920
Ten years earlier we had a conference with Alar Khan.

376
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:55,560
Alar Khan is a totally serious about mathematical objects exist out there and this is interesting

377
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:01,880
also with respect to another debate the debate between the question is mathematics discovered

378
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,680
or is it invented and of course all these people have written a lot about this and I

379
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:15,000
only want to say that it seems to me simply due to the existence of these people that

380
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
somehow the question is still unresolved.

381
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,960
And I mean as you know their physicists like whatever you know David Doyle is George Ellis

382
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,600
who now say mathematical objects are the prime cause of force for the universe.

383
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,400
I mean George things causation is primarily from mathematical objects to the material

384
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,600
energetic system of the universe and it's not that he's an either an incompetent mathematician

385
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,280
or an incompetent physicist because he wrote the standard book about space time with Stephen

386
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:49,880
Hawking in 1973 so I think he knows what he's doing in the technical field but he believes

387
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,800
that right and David Doyle is also not like a zero figure in quantum computing and he

388
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,880
also argues that you know he thinks the major mistake that the philosophers that he surrounded

389
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,520
with that Oxford is that they do not get this so I think it is an interesting sociological

390
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,600
piece of evidence right so there are those and there are those mathematicians and physicists

391
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,920
right so that apparently it's not sufficient to be either a good mathematician or physicist

392
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:23,160
to just to finish what I wanted to say originally the idea was actually also to have Max Tegmark

393
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,640
here.

394
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,680
Max Tegmark has written this book you all know it in which he claims mathematics is not only

395
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:37,080
existing in the sense that it is a basis for physics but it also exists per se I mean he

396
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:43,240
the book's title is the mathematical universe it exists per se and every you know if you

397
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:48,200
would put kind of evolution of existence then mathematics would be the first thing that exists

398
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:54,520
in his belief I mean I'm only I'm only throwing this around you know it's a little bit hard

399
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:01,240
to buy I mean Max Tegmark is an extremist in this in this case but I don't know invention

400
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,880
or discovery.

401
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:10,960
Can I bring a back to history just because I always find it useful so I think that a

402
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,920
lot of the this this conversation about the issue at stake about discovery and not to say

403
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,640
the discovery and the relation between physics and mathematics in terms of existence is again

404
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,760
something that becomes a real problem only in the turn of the 19th century and early

405
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,840
20th century it was even if until then people believe that mathematics arise out of them

406
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:40,600
anyway arise out of the world right if a mathematical concept understood is an abstraction right

407
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,640
the notion of a fundamental triangle was an abstraction from you know all the individual

408
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,400
triangles that one have seen right that's the basic idea so if you think about mathematics

409
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,800
this way as mathematics existing abstract is something that comes from the world then the

410
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,040
notion that mathematics then applies to physics and that you need to be in the mathematics

411
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:05,240
and physics is not as problematic right it's only once at the turn of the 20th century

412
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,360
once you mathematicians and philosophers believe that mathematics is no longer bound

413
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,920
by the world if mathematical ideas are not just descriptive of what's out there then

414
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,000
the philosophical question about what's the relation between physical mathematics become

415
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,440
as troubling as it is for us today right so it's not to say there's an answer just to

416
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,440
say that that itself has history itself as kind of a history that's I think important

417
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:37,400
I think and I don't have the answer to that but I think that looking at what was the question

418
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,560
of the turn of century helps kind of think through a little bit about how we think about

419
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,800
this question about existence and the role of mathematics and I'll just say one more

420
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,880
words about it at the turn of the century mathematicians really I mean there are a lot

421
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,200
of mathematicians that really cared about it and the idea was so people like George Beacock

422
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:01,000
for example or Vaitland as well they were thinking about what is it now to say that mathematics

423
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,680
applies to physics right what does it say now to mathematics if mathematics doesn't

424
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,240
come out of the world it's not an abstraction for the world how can we think about it and

425
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,280
and the argument they end up making is that you know should say building on kind of a

426
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:26,280
kind of Hilbert idea of mathematics mostly but the argument that they end up making is

427
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,120
that the difference between a number and you know an electron is not one of kind but of

428
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:35,080
degree that it's all abstractions all the way out and write them in that there it is

429
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:41,280
and it's not that the numbers are in that terms are two different kinds so again this

430
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:48,160
is all things that have been contested at moment for particular reasons right so even

431
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:55,160
in even in the case of say mid-nineteenth century math like remind differentiable

432
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:04,960
manifolds so there's I mean if you really think that all that exists is physical space

433
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:15,840
in its contents there's so the way you standardly explain differentiable

434
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:24,160
manifolds introduces things that are not in the physical space because it it introduces

435
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:32,760
the attention spaces and so if you really think that all there is is physics then you

436
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:44,480
might think that well you you really need to be able to read read describe the mathematics

437
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:53,080
of differential geometry without going into the attention space but just using the curves

438
00:38:53,080 --> 00:39:01,840
in the space itself and probably that can be done but there is at least a technical challenge

439
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:11,600
and so maybe maybe you think this challenges and really worth doing because because the

440
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:20,640
tangent space is a fairly simple idealization but but it just depends really on your attitude

441
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:27,680
to how much I do a station you are or are prepared to think is is okay

442
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:36,200
I'm wondering how often some of these formulas are used as analogies and if that's relevant

443
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:42,680
to what you were starting to say Chris in terms of the other realities that are somehow

444
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:50,680
related to all of these these ideas and elements can you say a bit more about what you mean

445
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:57,240
by analogy well I'm just I mean coming I know that there's all sorts of analogies that

446
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,600
are drawn from physics and drawn from mathematics by people like me who don't really know what

447
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:08,560
I'm talking about and yet I'm talking about something that has to do with existence and

448
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:16,120
experience and I thought you were sort of approaching that realm in what you were saying

449
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,280
earlier.

450
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:28,560
So the question I was at least trying to raise was a question of how we can tell whether

451
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:38,480
a theory is committed to some genuine entities or not and I was suggesting that it's not

452
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:46,040
sufficient to simply look at some practitioners who are disavowing commitment to say that the

453
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:53,960
theory isn't committed and maybe the kind of antidote that you were alluding to do with

454
00:40:53,960 --> 00:41:01,560
people that you both mentioned further illustrate that point because you can have successful

455
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:07,520
theoreticians who disagree on whether or not the theory is committed to the entities in

456
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
question.

457
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:15,800
And so I think it takes a bit of work to figure out what actually are the metaphysical

458
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:22,560
consequences of a given theory whether it's in mathematics or physics or what not it's

459
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,960
it could be that there are some people that don't care about that and so it's irrelevant

460
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,520
to the primary things that they're working on.

461
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,600
And let me add that you know like you need a lot of philosophical theorizing right to

462
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:43,960
state exactly what is at stake when you ask for instance say the discovery versus invention

463
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,960
of the section so there's a very broad tendency and I think this is a mistake in ontology.

464
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,360
So it's as it were not an obvious real mistake but you know it's a mistake that many people

465
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:59,120
make I call this an e-fontalogical realism so according to an e-fontalogical realism you

466
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:04,960
think that you're really committed to something that it really exists if it's mind independent

467
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,760
right so you think of it in terms of you know how things were before they were minds or how

468
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,440
things are if you abstract away from the fact that their minds right so remarkably you

469
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,800
think that the hallmark of existence is what I call the world without spectators take the

470
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,800
spectators out and what's left that exists right that is I think problematic to the as

471
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,920
a criterion for existence trivially because minds exist right so if your views their minds

472
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,800
they should matter and then there's matter and that this shouldn't be mental and whatever

473
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,320
is on this side is the existence stuff and the other thing is kind of either non-existent

474
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:47,120
or has to emerge supervene or do things that are not fully existing I think then you already

475
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:53,000
got into like philosophical trouble and some ways of formulating some versions of formulating

476
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,600
the discovery versus invention distinction for mathematical objects or in other fields

477
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,120
you know fictional objects have similar you know very similar problems you know dream

478
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,800
objects you know dream of a certain unicorn you know then you know did you discover the

479
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,960
unicorn or did you invent it you know they're similar problems there and I think that quite

480
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:18,000
often you know if we don't settle these purely philosophical issues beforehand then we get

481
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,520
easily confused I think that's really a contribution that philosophy will make there and you need

482
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,600
to be you know why right you need to be like a trained ontologist to be like a really good

483
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:35,400
mathematician or physicist these are you know orthogonal capacities I think yeah yeah well

484
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,440
in physics usually the practicing physicists is not concerned with these questions at all

485
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,560
in in most cases I mean in philosophy of physics we have exceptions of course right but the

486
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:51,640
practicing physicist if you ask him around ontology he will just he will either not understand

487
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:58,640
you or he will close the door and keep you outside you know because he is just he goes into his

488
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,920
lab in the morning switches on the pumps and makes his spectra and then he analyzes them

489
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:13,160
and that's that's the work of 99.9% of people working in physics then there is this remaining

490
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:22,840
point one percent who are actually interested in these philosophical questions and then

491
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:27,480
you know the advent of quantum mechanics actually erased the attention of this point

492
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,600
one percent you know because in quantum mechanics the first time in the history of physics the

493
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:41,560
measurement itself becomes a problem that it didn't happen before and why is this so

494
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:50,320
it is so because I don't know I don't go into all these formal details but conceptually

495
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:57,720
speaking it is so that the state of a system that you measure has to be understood differently

496
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:04,720
from the state of the system as it exists on tickle before you measure it and that the

497
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,720
additional complication is once you measure the system you extract information so this

498
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:15,880
is an epistemic process but at the same point you act back on the system so that it becomes

499
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:22,960
so that it moves into a state of being the on tick state in which it was not before so

500
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,560
the information that you extract is actually already outdated outdated when you read it

501
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,520
out somehow and that's that's a complication that you that you never had before and that

502
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:40,480
drove people crazy in physics in the early in the early days of quantum mechanics until

503
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:47,480
in the 1970s some philosophers of physics Ehrhard Schuyber and others came up and really saw

504
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,600
how they can conceptually solve this riddle with the introduction of on tick and epistemic

505
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:58,400
states which is now when you go to perimeter institute and other institutions everybody

506
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,600
talks about Scientology and scientist dimension this is this has become a standard notion

507
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:10,480
in the interpretation of quantum mechanics an interesting case actually because they

508
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,160
are it becomes important otherwise you confuse everything all the time if you don't make

509
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:21,880
that distinction and of I don't know whether this is now really a and a philosophic whether

510
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,800
this is a distinction that philosophers might understand as something that has really to

511
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,480
do with ontology and epistemology or whether this is again only another kind of practical

512
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:40,080
use of the notions you see what I mean so I don't know the issue about measurement was

513
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:50,800
different I mean even even pre quantum I mean measurements do always disturb the system

514
00:46:50,800 --> 00:47:04,880
I mean and you can say okay well well you can reduce the disturbance to a small amount

515
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:12,640
more more than you can in quantum mechanics I agree completely but I think disturbance

516
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:19,240
by measurement is certainly not itself novel but I would have thought of this is the real

517
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:29,160
problem about measurement in quantum mechanics is that the early formulations of the theory

518
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:49,840
took it as this this special process that wasn't quantum mechanically explained so so

519
00:47:49,840 --> 00:48:03,400
there was supposed to be this more or less general law of quantum evolution but then it

520
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:10,120
was supposed to be broken by measurement even though measurement presumably is a physical

521
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:17,280
process so so how how could it could could it measurement break the general laws and

522
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:29,760
I think I think around the same I do I do think that in in recent years there have have

523
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:44,720
become attempts to to to resolve this problem I think I would have cited John Dell as the

524
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,920
business that made the greatest contribution talk about these measurements now we can reduce

525
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:56,280
the interaction to an extent that is almost becomes invisible anymore but I agree with

526
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,920
you completely measurement is always an interaction that's right right but in quantum mechanics

527
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,040
it turned out as a problem and you know of course you are right that the measurement

528
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:10,560
does not follow the laws of unitary evolution that's what you're mentioning you need a different

529
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:22,680
law or at least it at least in the early theories they both said that law didn't hold but also

530
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:30,360
didn't offer a serious alternative law that did hold I don't want to emphasize too much

531
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:35,040
but let me just mention why I still think that it is an important conceptual difference

532
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:42,160
because what you come up with a quality is I mean the important insight that sequence

533
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,280
of measurements makes a difference we call it non-commutativity of observations and so

534
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,680
on that can be easily understood actually by the fact that when you make a measurement

535
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:56,640
and you change the state then you make the second measurement of another observable then

536
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,640
you make that measurement already on another state which means that when you when you

537
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:08,760
invert the sequence of measurements different result right in that sense it becomes important

538
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:18,120
and really at the basis even at the mathematical basis of the theory let me get back to mathematics

539
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:25,280
that to say even starting when you talk about measurement then pretty much all the time

540
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,040
you are talking about a measurement with respect to a theory which is based upon properties

541
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:38,400
of the real number of course real we are talking about reality nothing is more real

542
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:46,560
nor less real than the real numbers there were real was introduced in as it is to draw

543
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:52,080
distinction with the imaginary numbers which were very problematic and even I didn't even

544
00:50:52,080 --> 00:51:01,520
realize this until yesterday that even Cauchy invented a theory of complex analysis of wrote

545
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,800
somewhere that he would have preferred not for their not to be imaginary but but that's

546
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:13,680
but the and what were they are there or not but they come up in the in processing equation

547
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:23,040
whether real numbers or invented I guess maybe I gave that away but I could also say discovered

548
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:30,680
it was that people use these things in this indiscriminately for the purposes of physics

549
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:41,080
and to allow and to make it possible to to get past the pre-secratic paradoxes of continuity

550
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,840
and so things were fine things were fine there were people were working with real numbers

551
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:52,600
except that there was no there was no axiomatic complete axiomatic theory until the middle

552
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:59,680
of the 19th century and then it turned out that the axiomatic theory was settled but then

553
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:10,640
these real numbers have properties that people couldn't understand the the the the the the

554
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:16,960
point the chronic crucial point was the discovery that the continuum hypothesis was undecidable

555
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,800
you don't know how many real numbers there are in fact you can it's up to the theoretician

556
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:29,960
to decide how many how many real numbers there are and so I'm maybe right now I should I

557
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:36,240
wanted to make an apology to the set theorists because I was I've written an article in Quanta

558
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:42,960
in which I suggested that the set theorists were concerned about the kind of foundations

559
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:49,000
for set theory that were used in by number theorists improving for example from us last

560
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,360
year there was a there was some controversy around that and that I actually learned by

561
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,360
interacting with set theorists that this is not at all their concern they were not trying

562
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:06,440
to establish roles for wave to the any if they're any if they set theorists are watching they

563
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:14,880
were not they're not all interested in establishing rules some people not set theorists were concerned

564
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:23,000
I'm not sure where this where this controversy came anyway that's the the upshot is that

565
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:37,880
as to maybe to move to the 21st century that's now yes well we're not going to project the

566
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:47,400
same questions remain unsettled in a sense that is to say what kind of foundations for

567
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:53,080
set theory do you want and it so happens that the kinds of mathematics that are being developed

568
00:53:53,080 --> 00:54:03,320
not in in fact in part in order to provide mathematical the coherent explanations of

569
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:09,480
some physical theories theory some some things that are being developed in in in string theory

570
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:18,360
in particular involve going beyond the axioms the zermelofrankel axioms of set theory so

571
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:28,640
on inaccessible cardinals for example and so then the question is who decides who decides

572
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,720
what is what the foundations might be my what are the foundations of mathematics well it's

573
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:40,760
becoming more and more popular to develop series use theories that are based on the presumption

574
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:48,760
of existence of existence in the sense that one works with them of inaccessible cardinals

575
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:55,680
but that means there's big big sets that are much much bigger than anything one can produce

576
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:03,040
by the intellect one has to this whether called inaccessible because there's no reason cannot

577
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:10,560
establish their existence on the basis of the axioms even including existence of infinite

578
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:15,280
set they're much much more infinite in fact there are something called a hierarchy of

579
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,080
different kind of infinities which where it was one want to stop within that hierarchy

580
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:27,400
well the only the only historically reasonable answer that question is that mathematicians

581
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:33,560
are going to use whichever kinds of foundations what for set theory that provide the answers

582
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:39,400
to the questions that they that we consider to be reasonable and important

583
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:49,600
I was just going to say that I mean it's it seems to me that one of the things that came

584
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,280
out in few of the comments is this distinction between the philosopher and the mathematician

585
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,360
and what sort of kind of what you think maybe the mathematician itself don't have certain

586
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:03,440
kind of commitment but the commitment that you know that's where this is come but I'm

587
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:09,680
going to try to push on that just because I'm here and why not and just ask can you even

588
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,480
go like I mean what does it mean to go beyond the mathematicians themselves right I mean

589
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,080
the example that Michael just gave is why in which the mathematicians are the one that

590
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:24,680
getting to a point that they redefine with the foundation or the question of deciding

591
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,480
infinities to the correct you need to read the question again what the foundation which

592
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:38,760
the theory builds on right so the where the kind of questions about the existence always

593
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,520
come from the practicing mathematicians or I mean the innocent question or I mean physicists

594
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,800
you can think about as well so what is even the separation that you're between them the

595
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:53,320
philosophy and them the kind of the mathematicians well you know mathematics is a discipline

596
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:57,480
with its own rule book including a sociology you know what counts as evidence you know

597
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,200
like a whole discipline that you can characterize in manifold ways and so is philosophy and

598
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:09,320
they sometimes intersect in the history right sometimes big time Plato Aristotle some sometimes

599
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:15,120
like super big time Kantor set theory right then a little less right now right so you

600
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:19,080
can describe those curves and philosophy is just one of those disciplines right so and

601
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,680
then philosophy to something so it would be of course an interesting question right I

602
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,040
mean contemporary ontology is like a very well developed field right it's there's a lot

603
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,680
happening in ontology and metatology and metaphysics and metamethophysic and how they relate right

604
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:38,160
so that's its own development and these fields like intersect in very interesting ways and

605
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,600
that always remains to be explored right with what's going on in contemporary mathematics

606
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:48,160
my experience talking to my mathematics friends and colleagues is that indeed there's a very

607
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:54,200
widespread pragmatism when you talk to you know very high level mathematicians they would

608
00:57:54,200 --> 00:58:02,320
say there's a sense in which right now we care less right so you know and then there might

609
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:07,080
be an interesting question about why this is solved right so why in the field is this

610
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:12,200
the case right but I think that what we need to bear in mind when we ask these questions

611
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,720
about philosophy and other disciplines this is often this often goes unnoticed in particular

612
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,960
in the Angofon world because there's a different very different way of thinking about the philosophy

613
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,640
is you know position in the academic division of labor but in my neck of the woods you know

614
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,800
we think of philosophy as just you know another discipline it's just one of the sciences so

615
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,000
I want to make sure that you give me this understanding.

616
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,240
No no no no no this is I think this is a you know so that's why you know if you ask me I

617
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,880
think you know we all if you do philosophy off and then that's another discipline same

618
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,040
mathematics or history of course I'm in history mathematics so I understand what you know that's

619
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,280
what I'm trying to say it's not I'm not trying to say that philosophy has no place there was

620
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:56,040
not really the really question was try to say how do you explain the the relation when

621
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,960
you think about those specific question right about ontology of when we're talking here

622
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,880
about ontology mathematics now then how do you understand the relation between the philosophy

623
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,760
and the mathematics is again historically right how do you understand the way in which the

624
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:16,520
ideas that arise from mathematics then infronts the kind of philosophical debates or that

625
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,000
the way right now you do think that there is obviously there's two ways yes it goes two

626
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,960
ways yeah yeah like but how do we that's the question was related to say how do you understand

627
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,800
that relation yeah I would ask Michael Fenson skin or the way in which Michael developed

628
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:33,400
his relationship you know towards set theory you know I would want to know whether you would

629
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:38,640
you know so there's a view let's just call it you know mathematical pluralism and you

630
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,640
know I'm heavily simplifying but you know like roughly it go would go something like

631
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,840
that look they're very different you know it depends on the foundations that you choose

632
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,960
right so there's a really there's a sense in which you can just choose your axiom system

633
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,560
this is something we learned from mathematics of the second half of the 20th century right

634
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:02,040
and and then there's this mathematics and this other mathematics and the the choice between

635
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:06,560
the axioms can be you know in terms of like elegance they can be all sorts of mathematical

636
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,760
internal criteria for why I am a mathematician mathematician would say I go for this rather

637
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:16,800
than that right and then this kind of pluralism would just mean that there's no you know then

638
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:21,040
this would raise for instance for me a philosophical question you know is there even a universe

639
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:29,000
of mathematical entities you know if we interpret the contemporary mathematics realistically

640
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:36,480
right so so even if we think that they're comitable you know given mathematical pluralism

641
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,640
is that like a universe of mathematical objects given what mathematicians know right now that's

642
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,320
something that would come to my mind but this would also depend you know like we have a

643
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:50,240
leading philosophy of mathematician here so I don't know how Hartree looks at this how

644
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:57,160
you would describe this discourse right so just I I I view myself as a pluralist here

645
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:04,120
and and so just sharpening the issue of slightly in the in the terms of the example that Michael

646
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:17,680
raised about so Michael said that the continuum hypothesis is under side of all I mean in

647
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:23,800
in some sense is radically understated things in that you can give almost in the answer you

648
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:29,480
want to what it sizes and it will be consistent with the rest of the axioms of

649
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:43,080
of said it's a no it's a no it's a theory yeah but so so a version of the pluralist

650
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:52,200
view that that I kind of like is that there really is no serious question what is the

651
01:01:52,200 --> 01:02:04,720
real size of the content you are there are basically any any consistent answer is perfectly

652
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:12,800
okay and the idea of of asking which is the right one is just a wrong way to think about

653
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:20,680
it and that this marks a serious difference between mathematics and physics where where

654
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:27,600
basically there is a right answer even if we don't know it aren't you considering that

655
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:35,800
there might be at a later time a reason to choose there are the set there is yeah I want

656
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:41,920
to they want to find right maybe add an axi because the set of right seems was just established

657
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:48,520
to make set theory workable and use useful and if they have access right but more right

658
01:02:48,520 --> 01:03:02,360
but but but what they do is they offer aesthetic criteria for for saying well you know it's

659
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:08,600
it's a prettier theory if you make the size of the content you own the smallest possible

660
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:19,480
or the second smallest or or whatever and and different people offer different aesthetic

661
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:25,000
criteria that you mentioned a different geometry before we have it could be described perhaps

662
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,760
this way and then using the dimensions and how does that decision get made and is that

663
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:42,440
an aesthetic one or other consideration well so I'm not sure I understand the question

664
01:03:42,440 --> 01:04:00,680
I mean one thing which I think may be your question but but probably isn't but but so

665
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:13,400
theories of differentiable manifolds are developed using the theory of the real numbers and the

666
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:21,560
different answers to the size of the continuum give you different pictures of what the real

667
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:33,800
numbers are like so but so there's a separate question as to how much objectivity there is

668
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:45,400
about say lines in physical space but even if you thought it was completely objective

669
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:53,560
what the size of in affinity of the of the lines in in physical space was

670
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:05,160
that doesn't really settle the size of the continuum as mathematicians tend to view it because

671
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:14,200
because mathematicians tend to think well mathematical reality is it's one thing physical reality is

672
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:22,920
something else of course we we we got to our conception of the mathematical real numbers

673
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:28,200
by thinking about physical space but still there are different things it could turn out

674
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:38,280
empirically the physical lines aren't anything like the real numbers I mean maybe there's just

675
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:48,360
like the rational numbers but but the mathematical realist things well that doesn't tell you anything

676
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:54,600
about the real numbers it just shows that the physical lines need to correspond to the real

677
01:05:54,600 --> 01:06:04,840
numbers so so even if there is a question as an objective of question as to the size of an

678
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:14,040
affinity of physical lines I think the the typical mathematical non-pluralist is going to say well

679
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:24,920
there's no obvious reason why the answer to the question of the size of the genuine real

680
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:33,720
numbers has to be the same as that I was sorry yes I just wanted to get to the other realities

681
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:39,400
yes exactly that was my point too yeah I think that has enough to do with the notion that that

682
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:44,360
popped up in some of the commentary in the last maybe 10 minutes the notion of pluralism

683
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,440
you know in the in the sciences when you look at the development of the sciences I mean physics

684
01:06:52,440 --> 01:07:00,040
is the paradigm example but the others too talking about ontology always had I think historically

685
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:10,440
speaking the the or or brought the implicit request not only to talk about something that exists but

686
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:16,520
actually to talk about one thing that exists not many levels not pluralistic one fundamental

687
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:23,000
ontology and of course this has good reasons I mean for physics one of the interesting reasons

688
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,560
behind that was actually that physicists try to formalize mathematically and in the mathematics you

689
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:35,880
can very powerfully do that with symmetry principles and and this is the symmetry increasing the

690
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:42,840
symmetry always has the kind of taste of the unification picture unification picture leads to

691
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:54,360
one fundamental ontology now this fundamental way to look at things also created the idea that

692
01:07:54,360 --> 01:08:01,080
in physics this is actually a byproduct it's secondary but it's created by the fundamentalisms

693
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:06,600
let me speak let me say that everything can be reduced to this fundamental level so all other

694
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:14,680
descriptions like thermodynamics hydrodynamics physical chemistry can somehow be reduced and of

695
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:21,000
course then we have to explain in detail what we mean by that to a kind of elementary fundamental

696
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:29,720
ontology and I think this program has I mean it from the very beginning it was of course not

697
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:35,720
realized to its full extent but people were thinking in principle this is doable and now in certain

698
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:44,680
areas we know for sure that it's that it's not working that way we know now I mean this is still

699
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:51,000
not covered in the textbooks but we know that thermodynamics cannot be reduced to statistical

700
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:58,280
mechanics I mean what I'm saying is the knowledge that we have at statistical mechanics is not enough

701
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:04,760
to create thermodynamics and the fact that Lord Kelvin and others Boltzmann they they had this

702
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:09,800
heuristic guess of this of the relation between the kinetic energy of the molecules and the temperature

703
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:17,480
was completely heuristic we only understand that really fully since the 1970s through quantum

704
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:23,000
through quantum field theory and developments by Rudolf Harg and others this is algebraic quantum

705
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,880
field theory only at that late time hundred years after the heuristic guess it became possible to

706
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:36,760
build the bridge really in a pro mathematically profound way and then it turns out that you in

707
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:41,960
order to make the bridge it's not enough that you know that you know the lower level the mechanical

708
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:48,920
level you have to you have to select a context at the higher level and implement that at the lower

709
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:55,160
level and then you can make the bridge formally in a formerly sound manner so this this is in a

710
01:09:55,160 --> 01:10:01,480
way in an example for a kind of pluralism because if it is if this is so then you have to assume

711
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:08,840
that the temperature of a container of gas is also a property that exists in the ontological

712
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:16,600
sense in physics it cannot be fully reduced to the to mechanical properties I'm keen to

713
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:24,840
explain that more fully I don't I don't know if it makes it just my I don't know if I do want it to

714
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:36,200
say well that's stronger than I know to say but but I I would like to be convinced in more detail

715
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:42,280
of course this because yeah okay technical pretty extraordinary but we can make it

716
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:50,600
you know but they know something I'm ready to do that actually but I'm only giving you this picture

717
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:55,560
because everybody knows what temperature is and everybody knows what the motion of molecules

718
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:01,880
somehow is and it's it's actually a simple example which I wanted to use to really talk about

719
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:13,000
now to get the discussion into the pluralism thing and and I think for us in physics we in some way

720
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:19,160
we have to to give up this kind of deep seeded conviction that everything goes back to the

721
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:25,240
particles let me ask a question about other reality maybe you don't want to answer this because

722
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:33,320
much more radical than than the emergence of temperature as a separate property is the notion

723
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:39,480
that you can actually quantify over all possible anthologies and then there are I don't know how

724
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:48,840
seriously physicists take the notion of multiverse but is that okay is that what is uh but I but

725
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:55,560
people certainly do talk about it quite a lot I know I see

726
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:03,400
so and this is a this is a different idea of pluralism because if you if you go that way

727
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:09,880
then you have you have all these levels of description that I want to have as pluralistic

728
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:14,280
you have you you double the pluralism in each universe you have them again and in the next

729
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:19,160
university of all of that again and this is that I mean I know this is an interpretation of quantum

730
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:27,720
mechanics which some people um appreciate I don't I want to switch the register a bit to get more

731
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:35,160
to the other realities because from the outside mathematics and number carry the notion of real

732
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:44,760
truth the reality is carried by by the numbers whether it's polling numbers or you know how many

733
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:51,560
people believe such and such and I think it's had a profound effect on our society and our culture

734
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:58,840
and Alma has written and worked on the whole idea of how numbers get used in terms of the political

735
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:06,520
scene and I mean I think you maybe don't realize the amount of authority that we on the outside of

736
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:12,360
your world project onto number and I'd like to understand that a little bit in terms of how it

737
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:20,520
affects the other realities not just what the other realities are is that of interest to you Alma

738
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:29,560
to me it's of interest but I'm I'm in a company I mean I should say just that there's a I wonder I

739
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:35,400
wonder to what degree this to conversation relate to one another I think that you absolutely

740
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:40,040
write it that they greet the which the reality or kind of so there's a very famous book in the

741
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:45,880
Eastern mathematical by a that protocol trust in numbers which really deals to this question really

742
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:55,320
of how making numerical argument have you know one in a sense why why and he has I mean the argument

743
01:13:55,320 --> 01:14:02,280
is much more complicated than this the history that he tells but this notion that if you were saying

744
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:07,560
that numbers have a certain kind of numerical argument has certain kind of validity that

745
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:15,000
other sort of argument might not have but I wonder to what degree and I'm asking that back I mean to

746
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,120
a degree that relates to the ontological question of number I don't know right I mean he's just a

747
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:27,320
convent the numbers used as conventions here when people make new argument based on kind of

748
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:33,640
numbers or is it really has to do with that other question that we were talking about until now

749
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:40,200
which is down the existence the real existence of numbers so I'm kind of going to throw that back

750
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:46,600
I would have thought that the reason why numerical arguments that use a lot of numbers

751
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:53,960
tend to sound more convincing is just because they get the appearance precision and oftentimes

752
01:14:53,960 --> 01:15:01,320
they are more precise so it's clearer to see what the argument is so that's not a very deep observation

753
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:07,480
I suppose but amidst it's what this precision that's I think a deep question

754
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,400
why is precision important?

755
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:15,480
Yeah, where is the subjective factor that gets related to these things?

756
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:22,600
If you have quantum mechanics or if you have a electro dynamics and you solve a sort of problem

757
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:29,880
then you get a solution and experiment coincides with that solution let's say in five digits after

758
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:37,000
the comma and after that if you measure further than it deviates now you do quantum electro dynamics

759
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,520
you get the next three digits correct in that in that sense precision might be an important thing

760
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:49,480
to test your theory precision in terms of numbers but the way it is precision of a true value that

761
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:55,160
you know no I think I think the way in which we as physics I mean it is in theoretical physics

762
01:15:55,160 --> 01:16:01,320
or mathematical physics the way in which we apply let me say mathematics has nothing so much to do

763
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:09,080
with numbers it's really what we apply is the structure it's actually a qualitative feature

764
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:14,520
but that goes into the physics when you come from math and then of course when we solve it

765
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:21,160
and we have equations you can have an equation and then it sits there but then you want to solve it

766
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:25,480
and then you know you put in initial conditions and all this kind of stuff initial conditions are

767
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:31,960
not something that I think mathematicians feel so much with they just have to form a structure

768
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:37,480
I mean yeah yes and no but I think another strategy if I was trying to say since

769
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:48,360
we were more responsible I think we we would find more precise arguments more compelling because

770
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:56,440
a more precise statement is more easily is one for which it's more easy to figure out whether

771
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:03,080
or not it's a correct yeah and people that are willing to assert responsibly who are responsible

772
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:09,800
about making assertions will be willing to assert statements that are more easily falsifiable

773
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,960
proportionate to the degree to which they've evidence for them and so that in an ideal culture

774
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:24,120
we would ideally try to state things that have a degree of precision proportionate to our evidence

775
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:31,160
for them and maybe you know we're not obviously we're not there yet but given that that is something

776
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:36,520
that we could imagine as an ideal it wouldn't surprise me that looking outside we think oh this

777
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:41,560
is this guy saying something sounds very precise he must have really good reasons to say it like

778
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:48,760
what the rocks said at least on this side can i bring in another reality where you see I think

779
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:53,720
that some of these ideas about precision and the relationship or truth break down quite quickly

780
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:59,400
right I mean take most of the things that we all believe to be true such as there's a certain

781
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:04,360
amount of you know there's either finite or we're clearly finite but you know either an odd or

782
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:09,720
even number of people in this room right or here there's either an even odd number of people here

783
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:15,160
right now that is in some sense not very precise it's not quantum mechanical fine resolution

784
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:18,760
because from the quantum mechanical standpoint it's going to be hard to find the people here

785
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:23,960
right but it's perfectly all right and objectively true and completely unproblematic and just true

786
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:28,040
that there's either an odd or even number of people here even though probably no one in this

787
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:32,920
room or not all scientists together in the world right now can tell you what one person is because

788
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:38,040
we don't know what unifies an organism etc etc right so I think there are like very good

789
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:43,560
exceptions to the rule that a scientifically rigorous statement that's not what Chris intended

790
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:50,360
right with precision but I think that if if the scale of precision that we deploy and thinking

791
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:56,280
about the objectivity of truth etc etc right is modeled along the lines of the progress of modern

792
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:02,760
mathematical physics then I think we run into very serious political problems right so if you know

793
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:09,000
like social problems cannot be tackled in this way clearly not now so you know like if we

794
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,360
wonder you know the unification of physics and reduction is a hard enough problem but going from

795
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:18,680
there to like making a real prediction was going to be the next president of the United States of

796
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:25,000
America right there are very very many gaps right that you cannot fill out you we can fill them out

797
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:30,680
as a world almost and try all right right in a in a group of you know like here we can maybe

798
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:36,760
figure out whether we should be reductionist about social facts or not right but in the real

799
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:42,280
world you know where this stuff matters there's going to be a different form of precision right

800
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:48,520
so and I think that it will be ultimately you know very problematic on the real level of social

801
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:55,000
facts or political facts to think that you know decision procedures there should be mathematical

802
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:59,720
or etc in that sense so there are different kinds of precision an example that one of my

803
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:04,440
you know professors in philosophy always gave for this you know the relativity of precision

804
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:09,400
problem is simply this right I mean you fall in love with a certain person right and then there's

805
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:16,520
a degree of resolution of that person's phase in which you can still recognize the person and

806
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:22,040
fall in love etc right if you come to close and you look at you know like whatever you know molecular

807
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:28,440
details then then the object that you're dealing with in this particular case simply dissolves

808
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:35,800
so I think there's no you know there's no absolute thing you know precision and that is the that

809
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:41,400
is you know like be precise and then you're more likely to say something true I think quite often

810
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,840
if we if we have precise mathematically we're going to say something false

811
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:51,560
yeah not in mathematics right of course there's not a point about mathematics but we don't only

812
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:56,520
think about mathematical objects if we think about them at all I think that's one of what was a wonderful

813
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:02,520
place to put pause to our conversation and maybe invite a few audience to come up and ask questions

814
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:18,520
Tess some of you indicated that you believe that mathematical objects exist in the real universe

815
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:33,080
and Roger Penrose next peg bar not not withstanding the fact of the matter is that we described the

816
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:40,360
physics of the real universe with abstract concepts like Euclidean or Riemannian geometry

817
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:49,240
and differential equations and these are all based on abstract concepts that do not exist in the

818
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:57,720
real universe a point a line a plane a manifold even a particle do not exist in the real universe

819
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:06,840
so my question is can any one of you give me an example of a mathematical object or more specifically

820
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:18,120
a geometric object that you believe exists in the real universe then then you would tell I mean I

821
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:23,400
would have a question for you I would say I need a better grasp on what you think is a real the

822
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:29,400
real universe because for some people this is real for some people that may be real well if you let's

823
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:36,360
start with the most basic object in mathematics a point in geometry a point does a point exist in

824
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:43,160
the real universe the mathematician who thinks about mathematical realism in the sense like Roger

825
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:49,560
Penrose does yes well it's mathematical realism but it's not physical realism there's no such

826
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,960
thing as a physical point well but you know it's fact real things like what he says let's say

827
01:22:54,760 --> 01:23:02,840
which I think we would say racism exists but you can't little point to well your racism exists but

828
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:07,560
it can I don't believe that it could be described mathematically you think New York City system

829
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:12,760
is correct do you think New York City exists in the real I believe I believe in existence but

830
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:25,800
my question is using mathematics to describe exactly the existence of real objects is a fallacy it's

831
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:34,360
an approximation at best even I want to say if if you I mean as I do actually have a pluralistic

832
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:40,520
worldview then I would say biological species exist in biological reality physical species

833
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:47,000
exist in physical reality mathematical species exist in mathematical reality minds exist in

834
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:54,200
mental reality and free will exists in free will reality I don't know okay but I but my question my

835
01:23:54,200 --> 01:24:01,160
original question was I thought that some of you agreed with people like Penrose and Tegbark that

836
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:08,040
mathematics mathematical objects actually exist in real universe uh-huh that the real

837
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:12,760
universe consists of what we call mathematical objects this is I have to apologize this is

838
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:18,920
not the idea we just brought this up in order to have something to discuss right I'm not I don't

839
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:24,680
I know I believe that here I know that I thought some of you said that you do believe that not

840
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:32,280
that I think okay oh I don't know maybe does anyone does anyone I don't even sure I understand

841
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:46,520
what the question is okay yeah okay I have two questions for you um the first is is there any

842
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:54,360
work on whether this issue is decidable so as you said there are crucial issues in mathematics

843
01:24:54,360 --> 01:25:01,960
so they've been decided that we have discovered are not decidable and I'm wondering whether you

844
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:09,560
feel that one can look at this question from a perspective of is it won't be possible ever for

845
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:16,040
us to decide this issue is there any work going on in that arena which question is that exactly

846
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:25,080
or whether math math objects are real or bad so this and the second question is this we are creatures

847
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:34,840
formed from evolution we believe and there is some sense in which that limits how we can see the

848
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:44,360
world and I'm wondering if there's any work on whether that inherently will affect the type of

849
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:49,480
beliefs that we can come up with and the types of reality that we can come up with and whether

850
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:56,840
that then plays into the the question of whether this is decidable or not so two related questions

851
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:03,880
well I think there's a lot of work I mean contemporary philosophy is like there's going to be a huge

852
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:08,120
landscape I don't know about philosophy of mathematics whether there's like a prominent like skeptical

853
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:14,680
position right now where someone would say that you know the answer to the to certain ontological

854
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:19,800
questions in philosophy of mathematics is somewhat unknowable or undecidable it's clearly not a

855
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:25,160
prominent view I don't know if this but you know for any I think for any you know so that's

856
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:30,600
that landscape is very rich and the other question you know this there's of course a huge

857
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,800
literature and discussion about that I mean most recently now I think people are debating the

858
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:43,080
Donald Hoffman book the case against reality right so this is a nice you know case for for I think

859
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:48,200
your second question you know the most recent version of neuroscience has discovered for such

860
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:53,720
and such a reason we cannot know reality I think this is nonsense but it's a very widespread kind

861
01:26:53,720 --> 01:27:05,560
of argument I didn't understand your answers whether there is serious work like specifically

862
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:11,320
on the side of this question of the philosophy of mathematics question yes just general I don't

863
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:15,000
know I don't know that's I would ask if I if you ask me you to ask I would ask I would ask

864
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:25,560
you to ask somebody else if I want to hear what I can say is there is an interesting book

865
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:32,520
which collects dialogues between a mathematician I mentioned the name before

866
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:39,240
L.R. Kahn who is a convinced a convinced playfulness in that sense with with a brain research

867
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:46,520
person Jean-Pierre Georgie and they talk about this issue and it's a discussion it's it doesn't

868
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:52,440
result of course there are two there are two points which they try to make over 250 pages

869
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,520
and at the end you decide

870
01:27:54,520 --> 01:28:04,520
I'm sorry you know this is are you know that book probably right sorry you know that book

871
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:10,520
I don't know the title I'm trying to remember but if you if you go by the authors con c o n n e s

872
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:18,280
and charge you that's you find it okay well this I'm always bringing in the another issue but it

873
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:26,440
relates to pluralism and it relates to painting in particular and also to the question previously

874
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:31,880
painters have particularly always thought they want to find the truth or do they want to find

875
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:38,520
the truth within the world of painting and early on in painting in the Renaissance they saw for

876
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:44,040
linear perspective for anatomy for understanding the body and as painting evolved they became more

877
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:49,240
and more involved in this very issue of what are they searching for are they searching for

878
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:55,640
similar for similitude in the world or are they searching for something ontological in terms of

879
01:28:55,640 --> 01:29:02,120
internal or external search and I think right now is a very pivotal time in the arts and particularly

880
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:09,560
in painting which I know where there's a lot of confusion about of the motivation for the creation

881
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:16,600
of works of art and there are painters more in the in the 40s and during the wartime where they

882
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:24,920
explored topological space they went against non non-neuclidean space and they attempted things

883
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:29,640
but then when they dealt with it they didn't deal with it probably with the true logistics of the

884
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:35,160
way a physicist or mathematician would deal with it but it's very much a pivotal issue

885
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:43,000
do we do we follow what we what we are searching for internally in our internal brain structures

886
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:49,320
or are we looking at the world precisely and trying to reproduce the world obviously painters and

887
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:55,480
not can no longer need to reproduce the world and the way they once did so I came today because I'm

888
01:29:55,480 --> 01:30:01,640
very fascinated by this very crux of problem ontology and epistemology in which many painters

889
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:07,880
have arguments about with one another about what they're trying to do I don't I don't know if you

890
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:14,600
can even be good but just I just some of your thoughts may be on the possibility even of an art

891
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:21,640
form entering any of this discussion I'll go ahead I just want to say that there actually have been

892
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:27,080
work on that have argued that the kind of there's this the moment of the turn of the century is a

893
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:32,200
modernist transformation but there is a relation between the modernist transformation in both arts

894
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,720
and mathematics specifically so I'm thinking about the work of Jeremy Gray and I started

895
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:39,880
mathematics that actually made the link specifically that this sort of question like you were saying

896
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:49,160
about what is mathematics about what is painting about etc are actually quite similar so there have

897
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:52,520
been I don't know but I can't answer the question right now I can say that they have

898
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:58,680
been works that looked at this moment in the turn of the century and made that comparison directly

899
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:02,600
and physics as well yes it's part of exactly yeah

900
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:09,880
yeah I mean I recommend a forthcoming book by this gentleman art and object that's a debate

901
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:13,880
between Graham Hammond was the author of the book that I recommend and Michael Freet about this

902
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:21,000
issue you might find that interesting so there's a whole recent trend in ontology of art you know

903
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,320
which relates to that you know so that might be interesting looking you know Michael Freet set

904
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:31,240
the tone for a long time but they're like recent ontological trends also in philosophy of art that

905
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:37,880
might speak to that question yeah because the traditional aesthetic theories don't really hold

906
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:43,240
in terms of what the real problems are now or even in the middle of the 20th century yes yes that's

907
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:48,360
why there's like a whole new like strand of theorizing about this which in the art world goes by the

908
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:52,440
title of speculative realism so you might find that material interesting

909
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:59,560
it may say one small one small thing it might be interesting to look in whether or not there are

910
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:07,240
analogies in the philosophy of music so music it's a tone structure it has there's structures

911
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:15,400
that musical pieces exemplify and there are similar questions about the ontology of music so is the

912
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:22,760
is the symphony the the physical performance is it the physical inscription on the paper or is it an

913
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:28,600
abstract object that's represented by those things and that's why one and the same symphony can be

914
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:35,080
performed in different places it might it might be that because the nature of music is is more

915
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:41,240
easily detachable from particular performances of it in a way that a painting doesn't seem to be that

916
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:47,240
the the questions will seem more parallel if we're considering those art forms rather than maybe

917
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:52,600
architecture has some architecture would be another one to think about this is also this very interesting

918
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:58,200
analogy i'm not sure whether it applies across the board but there have been instances here where

919
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:03,240
we hear we learn that mathematicians or physicists don't spend that much time wearing without their

920
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:09,320
ontology many physicists and i think mathematicians would say well that's good and we need to we'll

921
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:13,480
look at it and if we're interested in it we might look at it the question is is that a quick

922
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:18,920
prescription for painters or artists as well should they be spending a lot of time thinking

923
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:23,880
about the ontological implications or is that really what art is about is a good idea we're a

924
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:28,680
bad idea to focus on that should they do that more of it than mathematicians or physicists say i'm

925
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:32,920
not sure i know the answer but similarly what what would you how does the following sound to you

926
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:37,480
you know the philosophers are currently discussing whether they should spend any time on doing

927
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:42,440
mathematics right i think this would be like a bad headline and i think similarly the other

928
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:47,720
headline is equally bad mathematicians now this and physicists now you know think that they should

929
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:53,160
do less ontology i think it's equally bad you know and just go back to the great moment you know

930
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:59,000
we you mentioned the foundation foundational crisis and quad mechanics etc you know Einstein wrote

931
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,880
you know like one of my colleagues we just moved him from caltech he edits Einstein's papers he spent

932
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:09,880
a lot of time reading neo-kantian philosophy literature writing reviews which are now published

933
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:14,520
it with the Einstein papers etc and so forth for the other great figures and that might not have

934
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:18,760
been a coincidence that often physicists right now worry about the grand unification and when

935
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:23,560
it's coming and then they are doing honestly speaking incompetent metaphysics like max tech

936
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:28,200
marker i think this is terrible metaphysics what's going on there or Donald Hoffman is just an incompetent

937
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:33,720
philosopher of mind and so you know like so that's you know he is bad news neuroscientists care much

938
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:39,640
less about ontology right now are you saying this is good or bad i think this is terrible equally bad

939
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:43,480
because it becomes a philosopher who doesn't care about mathematics you know that's what the baby

940
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:49,480
with the bath water because you know you can do bad metaphysics as he i mean i agree with you and then

941
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:56,920
typically what physicists have you know learned to say is when someone does metaphysics at all it's

942
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:02,920
all automatically bad physics or bad metaphysics but there is very helpful metaphysics also of course

943
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:08,440
someone mentioned the name of john bell i don't know you you mentioned john bell came up with

944
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:14,440
actually two metaphysical assumptions and then he derived for one of the assumptions classical

945
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:21,080
local reality and inequality by which you can test whether this assumption is right or wrong so you

946
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:27,160
can make you can make empirical tests that are motivated by metaphysics but then it has to be good

947
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:34,360
metaphysics yes of course i think i think with the artist or with painters it's really the study of

948
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:40,360
the brain because i don't think it can really be controlled of what they're thinking in categories

949
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:45,960
i think very often that the arts come closest to an attempt at some kind of unification of the

950
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:51,080
intellect the mind the emojis and so therefore it's very hard to say well don't think about this only

951
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:58,600
think about that because the act of creation is an exploration and a search for where they stand

952
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:04,040
and where how they relate to the world so i i think the divisions are very dangerous in terms of

953
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:10,440
creativity and probably in science too if you go deep into it i don't know enough i have a good i

954
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:17,560
i'm sorry i don't want to dominate this but since we are talking about art now it's uh i this is not

955
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:24,120
directly about ontology and episode but it has to do with it there was this German artist who was

956
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:30,920
made ridiculous who was ridiculed by many people Joseph Boyce Joseph Boyce had really he had a

957
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:36,840
philosophical philosophical talent to some extent and in terms of his actions he did this action

958
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:41,800
art even here in New York in New York City the the the the action with the coyote i mean i don't

959
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:50,680
what what what Boyce did conceptually was he undercut the subject object distinction because he as the

960
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:58,200
artist made himself an object of his own art by the action so he this is this is i think remarkable

961
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:04,680
it's it's a great idea just to show people that um it's not that here's the artist and here is the

962
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:12,600
painting he just puts himself into that room and together with the coyote right and and he does it

963
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:17,960
in such a way that people were standing there and looking through the glass through the window

964
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:25,000
and wouldn't go away for hours because they thought something must be happening and nothing

965
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,440
happened except he was lying there with his i don't know you know all these these stuff that he

966
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:35,880
usually brings with him and then there's the coyote you know that was amazing and people were of

967
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:41,080
course they were getting angry because they were expecting something and nothing happened but they

968
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:48,920
didn't go away amazing then see he really had this talent to to do something that is philosophically

969
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:55,000
highly relevant in a way that affects people it was just i mean i'm just you know but Michael

970
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:01,880
what is the same thing i was just going to say that the history of art is a good place to look

971
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:09,160
for a history of the of the value attached to precision because there are different periods when

972
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:13,480
a precision is considered an important value but then it doesn't always mean the same thing

973
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:19,480
and in fact it can take opposite meanings and there's also uh this is not unrelated to the

974
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:28,600
history of objectivity as analyzed in the book of dastard and gallisin which again the valence

975
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:36,200
objectivity in that case is the value but what it means takes it becomes moves to its opposite

976
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:41,480
from one time yeah i just wanted to say also as far as ontology and mathematics there is

977
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:48,120
a small group of mathematicians who are talking to philosophers it's called the n category cafe

978
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:54,760
and the uh it's been online for quite some time the original motivation was precisely

979
01:38:55,320 --> 01:39:02,840
uh the the some concern or not necessarily concern about the uh development of

980
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:11,400
mathematical uh practices that were not based on on the axioms of set theory specifically that

981
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:19,560
were uh and the but what i've noticed is that this there's not any much interaction between

982
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:27,000
this uh this circle which was mathematicians and philosophers and physicists and the rest of

983
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:33,080
uh philosophy so there's a lot of researching contemporary ontology in europe and france in

984
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:38,200
particular of category theory as a matter of fact so that idea i've also like happened to have

985
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:43,160
written something about this so there there's uh you know there's just a little more there but

986
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:49,720
yeah so that issue you know like given that so category theory was uh you know like people

987
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:53,560
became aware of this and it's through interaction with mathematicians yes yes

988
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:56,440
through self-centaction actually with some of the founding fathers actually

989
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:02,680
in the most in the french context uh oh okay i'm familiar with this i know you know this

990
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:07,320
i'm familiar with it yeah but this this is a different because this is there are mathematicians

991
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:12,840
from various uh different fields this is because to keep the category theory so we're working

992
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:16,760
we're talking to the french philosophers were category theory that was that was what they did

993
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:21,000
they were not yeah they were somewhat isolated within mathematics yes this is something different

994
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,800
yeah i had the question about history and it was mentioned that um

995
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:32,280
in popular imagination the fourth dimension at the beginning of the last century

996
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:41,160
uh and then when i was a kid watching tv watching twilight zone uh i think his name was surling

997
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:49,080
he talks about the fifth dimension and now we're in the internet age and we were during the

998
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:56,680
introduction uh we talked about the three audiences the audience in this room the audience beyond

999
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:06,840
this room the future audience that might be looking at the archive of this event and many of us who

1000
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:13,880
are observing and participating right now may be in that audience right because when this is

1001
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:21,000
uploaded we can all look at it so i guess my question is about the the culture and how um

1002
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:29,160
um the past president future is changing so quickly um and how our our participation in the

1003
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:35,720
technology is accelerating that and there's a buzzword uh post truth i'm sure we've all heard that um

1004
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:43,720
and what that could possibly mean so i guess my general question is about um what is all this how

1005
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:50,520
is this impacting our culture and our our imagination and our politics sort of a broad question

1006
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:57,240
and if there's anything you know now that you did not know at the beginning of this conversation

1007
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,960
i would be very curious about that thank you

1008
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:09,320
i know that i have to withdraw some of my projections onto math that's very important

1009
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:15,320
lesson and also i've been thinking about daniel connamans uh endowment principle

1010
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:21,160
uh of how much what we endow is having value because we know it or we have it

1011
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:27,480
changes our perception of it and its value in the world and throughout this conversation i've

1012
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:37,800
been thinking about that that whole endowment principle idea anyone else yeah i was i i actually

1013
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:46,440
wanted to ask you that later tonight what do you think of don huffman's book but now i know yes

1014
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:52,840
you know i run a research center of reality in crisis a center for the human being in the

1015
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:59,320
digital age it's a large international research network uh withstands disciplines here at uh

1016
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:04,920
and my new university of Tokyo of picking university and pericine kamrich in the future and um and so

1017
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:10,280
it's uh deals with all these uh post truth etc phenomena on various levels so i think that

1018
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:15,720
you know let me be very brutal about this i think that some of this huffman's style material is

1019
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:20,280
you know what people worried about here in the 90s in particular in philosophy about you know

1020
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:26,040
post modernism and so forth giving up the truth and richard rorty and so forth i think the kind of

1021
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:31,880
incoherence what really people worried about this has now infiltrated politics neuroscience

1022
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:36,920
but other disciplines too you know like rovelli the way in which rovelli speaks about physics

1023
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:44,040
and nobility i think it's the same so i think that's like a whole i call i call this climate of uh

1024
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:51,000
misdegotten conceptions of knowledge uh food Kantianism you know it's the worst of koko and the worst

1025
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:57,320
of Kant and it's also crazy Kant food Kant it's also it's a valgus form of Nietzscheanism and i think

1026
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:01,320
donald trump you know like if you look at this you know Nietzsche it's the first of what Nietzsche calls

1027
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:08,440
the blonde beast and uh and this whole truth thing i mean there you know everything that we worried

1028
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:13,720
about you know decades ago from philosophies like you know now this has come become a principle

1029
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:21,160
almost everywhere and i think there's a lot uh of work for philosophers to be done and in many

1030
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:27,080
in europe the contemporary philosophical trends are therefore often associated with the label of

1031
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:31,800
realism new realism that's just my word and speculative realism and this realism and that

1032
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:37,560
realism and the reason why in particular philosophers in europe have you know moved to the realist

1033
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:45,880
cam broadly speaking right uh is you know resisting that we have our own version of it you know the

1034
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:49,720
in germany the christian democrats but since people don't think about this you know you think

1035
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:53,800
about the far right when you think about political problems in germany but we have the christian

1036
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:57,240
democrats that's nasty i shouldn't have said that on the record

1037
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:06,040
well i did say that was the last question but we will have one one last question now

1038
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:08,280
but yeah the whole thing i'm sorry i'll make a little nervous

1039
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:18,680
well i suppose this has to do with realism um in veda there there's 40 aspects well one is

1040
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:24,920
yoga and there was this patongently who cognized it four chapters the third chapter is called city

1041
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:33,080
sidhi and sanskrit often translated as perfection power uh super normal ability attainment

1042
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:41,240
cities are are listed as things like levitation walking through walls and visibility strength of

1043
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:49,000
an elephant um being in multiple bodies at the same time knowledge of past and future knowledge

1044
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:58,440
of the contents and nature of other people's minds uh challenges to our understanding of reality and

1045
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:04,040
veda deals with these seven states of consciousness neurophysiological states of consciousness

1046
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:12,120
beyond the first three being waking dream you've sleep so we've been talking a lot is about mathematics

1047
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:18,120
as kind of a one application of mathematics is to describe physical reality but here you have a

1048
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:26,200
physical reality which is you know right here i mean in the room if some of these things

1049
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:34,840
um actually exist which doesn't seem to be challenged um so what are your thoughts about this uh

1050
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:43,640
this knowledge has you know quite serious um um history and uh

1051
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:51,800
maybe i can't say two things about this there have been attempts to actually in some of the

1052
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:59,400
labs particularly in the u.s even in Princeton to demonstrate phenomena like this and much of

1053
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:05,320
that has been shown to be um some experiments haven't been done well designed some experiments

1054
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:11,640
have been well analyzed and so i'm doubtful about that material but still there are other

1055
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:17,640
situations in which these cases happen spontaneously i mean not under under laboratory conditions

1056
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:26,440
and then um my first reaction would be is that really something that fits into the range

1057
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:33,800
of validity of physical theories i mean i think we all agree that the world does not only consist

1058
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:39,400
of consist of physics and physical reality right there's more to depend on that and for instance

1059
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:45,640
what we do not understand at all up to the present day uh not withstanding all all neuroscience and

1060
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:50,280
brain and stuff and so on it's the relationship between the mental and the physical we don't have

1061
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:55,960
any clue we can measure correlations but we don't know where they come from what they do and so on

1062
01:47:56,600 --> 01:48:01,560
i don't know what science will bring us when we understand this better i'm not saying that we

1063
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:08,520
can explain this all this all then but i'm only saying that it is maybe not the not the best reaction

1064
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:16,600
to try and ask physics to explain that because it maybe may go far beyond what physics is designed

1065
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:23,960
for it to explain so well thank you everyone for an excellent afternoon and i'm looking

1066
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:45,400
forward to looking at this for years to come on youtube

1067
01:48:53,960 --> 01:49:11,880
so
