1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,160
Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,720
Welcome to the Hill Center's final event for the spring of 2022.

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,440
And again, we're sorry to report that we've continued to have to be a Zoom-only presentation,

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,640
but this is also available on YouTube in perpetuity.

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,920
Today, I have the, well, I'm Gerald Herrowitz.

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm the Associate Director of Hill Center.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,800
And I'm here with this illustrious panel of discussants who are going to discuss the

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,440
rather large topic of metaphysics.

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,560
Let me take a moment to introduce our panelists, and then we'll get our conversation underway.

10
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:04,000
Of course, future HELEX programs will be announced in due time, which will start again, start

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,680
up again in the fall of 2022.

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,440
And we're hoping that those will include live round tables.

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,780
So first, I'll introduce Harold Atman-Spacher, who is a Senior Scientist and Staff Member

14
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,920
at the Collegium Helvetikum University of Zurich and ETH Zurich since 2007.

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,560
After his PhD in Physics at Munich University, he worked as a Research Scientist at the Max

16
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,720
Bong Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics at Garching until 1998.

17
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,860
Then he served as head of the theory group at the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology

18
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,960
at Freiburg until 2013.

19
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,040
His fields of research are the theory of complex systems, conceptual and theoretical aspects

20
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:59,120
of algebraic quantum theory, and mind matter relations from interdisciplinary perspectives.

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,320
He is the President of the Society for the Mind Matter Research for Mind Matter Research

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:12,480
and Editor-in-Chief of the Interdisciplinary International Journal Mind and Matter.

23
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,280
Moving on, Elizabeth Barnes is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Virginia.

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,760
Her research interests are divided between metaphysics, social philosophy, feminist philosophy

25
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
and ethics.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,840
She's particularly interested in the places where these topics overlap.

27
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,280
She's written a book on disability called The Minority Body and is currently writing a

28
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,160
book about the nature of health.

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,600
Lately, she's also been thinking a lot about the metaphysics of social structures.

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,200
Hans Halverson is the Stuart Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University.

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,760
He has written extensively on the foundations of quantum physics, philosophy of science

32
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,360
and the relationship between science and theology, with articles appearing in the Journal of

33
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,880
Mathematical Physics, Physical Review and the British Journal of Four Philosophy of Science,

34
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,360
among others.

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,800
Jefferson has received a Mellon Foundation New Directions Fellowship, a Cushing Memorial

36
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,400
Prize in the History and Philosophy of Physics, best article a year by a research PhD, and

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:22,040
10 best philosophy articles of the year, both in 2001 and 2002.

38
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,880
Greg Yeager is a Professor of Natural Science and Mathematics at Boston University.

39
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,520
Her postdoc will work in the history of science and experimental quantum optics physics, sorry,

40
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,280
quantum optical physics.

41
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,480
He assumed his current interdisciplinary professorship in 2006.

42
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:48,040
He was awarded a Cavill, a Cauvley Fellowship in 2008, for his work on quantum computing,

43
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,280
holding two fundamental patents, and co-edited Philosophy of Quantum Information and an Add

44
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,360
in Tanglement on Cambridge University Press.

45
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,880
He is the author of the monograph's quantum information, entanglement information and

46
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,560
interpretation of quantum mechanics, and quantum objects.

47
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,400
Most recently, he co-authored quantum metrology, imaging, and communication, and co-edited

48
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,240
quantum arrangements.

49
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,680
His current work focuses on the ontological status of elementary particles in quantum

50
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,640
field theory.

51
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:27,200
Finally, Arkady Blatnitsky is a distinguished Professor of Literature, theory, and cultural

52
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,280
studies program, and philosophy and literature program at Purdue University.

53
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,840
He has published nine books, several edited or co-edited collections, and about 200 articles

54
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,200
on continental philosophy, romantic and monodist literature, the Philosophy of Mathematics and

55
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,760
Physics, and the relationship among literature, philosophy, and science.

56
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,280
His most recent book is Reality Without Realism, Matter, Thought, and Technology in Quantum

57
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
Physics.

58
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,920
His next book, Logos and Alagon, The Thinkable and The Unthinkable in Mathematics on the Pythagoreans

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,200
of the Moderns, is forthcoming from Springer Nature next year.

60
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,960
So with that, I'd like to get things rolling.

61
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,640
I thought we might start by having each of our discussions make a brief comment about,

62
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,160
let's say, what they think metaphysics is and what it's for.

63
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,880
I think it would be nice if it would be brief and then we can get the conversation rolling.

64
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
So whoever wants to volunteer, they go first.

65
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:42,160
Let's go for it.

66
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,520
Do I have to pick someone?

67
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,360
On to it, take a shot.

68
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,920
You look like you're making a move.

69
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Okay.

70
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:57,800
Well, I'll say a couple words about my own professional background because I've had the

71
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,320
good fortune that although my primary field of study was philosophy as an undergraduate

72
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,360
student and then I became interested in, I mean, it became very clear to me that philosophical

73
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,680
research, I think, benefits a lot from looking at what's going on in science, hopefully to

74
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,720
learn for itself, but also actually I hope the contribution can go the other way.

75
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,560
One of the main reasons for me that was important is I was educated in the United States my

76
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,920
entire life.

77
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,120
I got in many ways what I thought was a good scientific education, but I thought it was

78
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,680
a scientific education that said, stop at a certain point asking certain questions, right?

79
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,320
Because we need to focus our time on calculations and new technologies and we don't want to

80
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,520
get hung up in these big questions about like, why do we exist?

81
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Why is there a universe?

82
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
Things like this.

83
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,120
So that's what naturally led me into philosophy.

84
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,400
But then I was fortunate that I was around philosophers that said, hey, these are really

85
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,360
the same conversation.

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,880
So although I would not actually consider myself a metaphysician because within philosophy

87
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,200
there are some who have very special professional competence in metaphysics, but I actually think

88
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:17,120
that anyone who's reflecting on the nature of reality is to some extent doing metaphysics.

89
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,640
And I think even scientists who may feel like it's important for them professionally to

90
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,800
say what I'm doing is physics.

91
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
It's not metaphysics.

92
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,560
I think that's actually unfortunately not really true.

93
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,160
I mean, I think they are doing metaphysics even if they're not being completely honest

94
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
about that.

95
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,640
So I'm glad that we're able to talk about this openly here and that we have people with

96
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,320
sort of both, you know, angles on this, both coming from the sciences and from philosophy.

97
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
Great.

98
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,120
If I could follow up on what Han says, because I have a somewhat different background.

99
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,080
I'm not as nearly steeped in the sciences, but I agree with a lot of what he said in terms

100
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,800
of what metaphysics is.

101
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,040
I mean, if I, I think it's kind of a foolhardy project to try to give definitions of any

102
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,640
aspect of philosophy because it's so slippery, but I guess in a nutshell, I would think of

103
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:16,040
metaphysics as something like questions about the nature of reality that aren't better or

104
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,680
at least completely addressed by empirical means.

105
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,080
And of course, it's a somewhat often fraught and tendentious question exactly what those

106
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,800
questions might be or the extent of what empirical inquiry inquiry can show us or what linguistic

107
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,480
inquiry can show us or that kind of thing.

108
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,160
But in terms of what metaphysics is for, my own background is that I came to metaphysics

109
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,480
from a place of skepticism.

110
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
I didn't like it.

111
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,960
And I didn't want to do it.

112
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,680
And I wanted to do ethics and sort of the more humanistic end of philosophical inquiry

113
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
without doing metaphysics.

114
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,880
And I found that I couldn't avoid it.

115
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,360
I mean, my philosophical trajectory has kind of been like me yelling at metaphysics.

116
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,800
I wish I knew how to quit you.

117
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,840
And I haven't been able to.

118
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,760
It seemed to me that one of the key aspects of metaphysics as a part of philosophical

119
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:17,200
inquiry is just that these questions always come up, it always comes up.

120
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,400
What is the difference between correlation and causation?

121
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,360
If we have these observed regularities, what do they explain?

122
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
What do they say?

123
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
What are these things?

124
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,800
What parts of this thing that we're saying is just an aspect of theory into what extent

125
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,960
does it represent reality?

126
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,680
And they're like all of these things inevitably involve metaphysical questions.

127
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,760
And so I would say, for me personally, the primary role of metaphysics is most of these

128
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,960
inelimitable questions that are not primarily empirical questions, but they are questions

129
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:55,040
about what the world is like.

130
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,240
There seems to be this, oh, Greg, I think you're muted.

131
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
You want to go ahead?

132
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Sorry.

133
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Yeah.

134
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,040
Yes, I was going to say, I mean, I think that this discussion has gone very nicely in the

135
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,240
sense of people painting their own sense of what metaphysics is and why it's important

136
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
for me.

137
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:18,360
I'm also someone who has studied different aspects of learning and have inquired about

138
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,280
the nature of reality my entire life, which is why I've studied mathematics, physics,

139
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,360
and philosophy my whole life and tried to do them regularly.

140
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,640
And the thing which really drives me to metaphysical questions is the whole issue of precisely

141
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,960
what is the relationship between our theory and reality.

142
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,160
And it doesn't really matter what science you're in a Carnapian sense.

143
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,680
It doesn't really matter which science you're talking about, which part of the humanities

144
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,720
you're talking about, you're trying to understand the world in a certain sense.

145
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,040
So I'm a physicist primarily or interested in philosophy of physics.

146
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,120
And so when I approach these things, I always imagine the standard sort of thing of physicists

147
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,480
would think, which is, well, reality, you know, it's definitely physical in some way.

148
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,600
And the default position metaphysically for most physicists is realism.

149
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,960
So if there's an objective reality out there exactly how does the various sciences and

150
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,880
methods of thinking connect with each other.

151
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,400
And in the sciences, you know, you have this natural tower of the sciences with presumably

152
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,120
physics at the bottom and then chemistry and then biology and then perhaps mind at a higher

153
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
level.

154
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,880
And there's an attempt to reduce these things down to the lowest level.

155
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,160
So that's why I'm primarily focusing now on the ontological status of elementary particles

156
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,920
because the default position in physics has been for a long time that if you understand

157
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,480
the things at the lowest level, then you can understand these other things.

158
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,760
So it's a sort of natural drive to metaphysics, the physics and science in general, natural

159
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,040
sciences brings, I think.

160
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:56,600
I know I was about to jump in and say, I know there's this history that I think we

161
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
seem to be past.

162
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,680
And I'd recommend that it's a title for this roundtable originally is metaphysics dead

163
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,520
because there had been this long, you know, reign of logical positivism and the analytic

164
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:16,320
philosophers who had sort of claimed that metaphysics should be eliminated as best it

165
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
can.

166
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,560
And so the job of philosophy is just to clean that up and make metaphysics as minimal as

167
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,880
possible.

168
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,240
And now there's been a little bit of resurgence and I think it's really interesting to see

169
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,840
why that is.

170
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,920
And we're we're headed with that.

171
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,800
So, Arkady, do you want to make a comment about your thoughts?

172
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,960
Yeah, I'm kind of new to the word metaphysics, although not to the subject because, you know,

173
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,240
my I have a double trajectory in my intellectual life.

174
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,400
My and was originally trained in quantum field theory and mathematics.

175
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,960
And my first graduate degree wasn't that specifically group representations and things like that.

176
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,320
And then I got interested in certain trends and continental philosophy.

177
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,360
And in both of these, the metaphysics was, I wouldn't say dirty word, but just about

178
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,600
and the and the reason for that part of the reason for that I think is that in some of

179
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,920
these previous comments, it seems to me that there is a kind of sense of metaphysics.

180
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,000
Well, the term has many various meanings.

181
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,760
For example, the question, what is reality and what is representation of reality and

182
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,760
the difference of that type could be seen as metaphysicals or may not be seen as metaphysical

183
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,240
depending how you define metaphysics.

184
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,280
I think in both of the trends to which I came into both of the subjects of my interest,

185
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,800
these questions were of course all these asked.

186
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,840
But the reason that there was skepticism about metaphysics, especially in subtle continental

187
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:02,520
philosophy apart from one philosopher whom I know, Algio Delus, who used the word was

188
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:09,000
not so much these questions, which were always asked, but the way we ask these questions,

189
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,680
I think that's the one thing which I wanted to say that the question is how we ask these

190
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,520
questions rather than simply these questions as such.

191
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:25,080
And anyway, as I mentioned to Greg earlier, my thesis for today is there is no metaphysics,

192
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,960
there is only metaphysics.

193
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:34,760
So that's a double statement which I think is true depending on how you define metaphysics.

194
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Thank you.

195
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,640
So the king is dead long with the king.

196
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,760
Anyway, Harold, you want to make a comment?

197
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,720
Oh, you're viewed in Harold.

198
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,120
Yeah.

199
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,640
Am I unmuted now?

200
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Yes.

201
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Okay, good.

202
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,400
So I want to connect up with what Hans actually said at the beginning and start with what

203
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:07,560
I was studying and what the problems were that our teachers actually confronted us within

204
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,600
our studies.

205
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,120
And interestingly, I think Hans is completely right.

206
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,640
Whenever questions came up to the meaning of this or that, and then typically the response

207
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:27,880
was this has become a winged word shut up and calculate.

208
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:35,000
And then I entered into a phase in my studies when I went Hans Primoz at the ETH in Zurich.

209
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,200
He was actually a professor of theoretical chemistry, but he was much more than that.

210
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,160
He was actually a mathematical physicist with strong philosophical inclinations.

211
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:54,880
And he would always say, you know, when scientists claim that they have no metaphysical position

212
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,200
that they usually have a poor one because they are just unconscious of it.

213
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,800
And of course, every scientist, he would say, must have a metaphysical position.

214
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:12,400
Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to do science, even the practicing physicist in his lab goes

215
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,560
with the assumption that there is something there that he does experiments with, even

216
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:25,280
though specifically in quantum physics, we know that our empirical access to the system

217
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,080
out there changes that system or the state of that system.

218
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,920
So we never see the reality out there.

219
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,480
Just by trying to access it, we change it.

220
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,880
This is pretty clear now in quantum mechanics, but it's also pretty clear in cognitive science.

221
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,760
What we see out there is not what is out there.

222
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,080
There are very interesting experiments about that.

223
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:56,640
So in my trajectory, it became more and more obvious that the metaphysics has the study

224
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:06,360
of what is there other than what we see there or what we can empirically do experiments

225
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
with.

226
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,080
This is an important question.

227
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,520
So that's why I got into that.

228
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:28,240
Well, there's this issue of the fact of metaphysics being the foundation of a lot of physical science.

229
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,080
And this other interesting fact that some scientists seem to want to deny it.

230
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,400
I wonder if there are so many wonderful historical examples of scientists informed by their

231
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,000
metaphysics.

232
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,560
And rightly and wrongly, I think some of the examples that are often put forward as being

233
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,720
a wrong example of metaphysical influence and science would be, let's say, alchemy.

234
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,160
I mean, many other examples.

235
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,320
Of course, Newton was completely absurd without me and yet produced all this wonderful science.

236
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,440
And there are other examples where scientists obviously did have some form of a metaphysical

237
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,800
position and it really did help them very much in their scientific research.

238
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,480
So I wonder if there are any thoughts you might share about that.

239
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,880
Well, I could say that one of the examples that usually comes up when people think about

240
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,720
the relationship between physics and philosophy is Heisenberg.

241
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,320
And Heisenberg was, of course, the person who's most closely associated with this idea that

242
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,080
looking upon something can influence it and restrict potentially your ability to see it

243
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
in itself.

244
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,040
And he certainly did bring in philosophical ideas in order to try to move forward.

245
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,960
One of the most important things, which I've been interested in is his investigation of

246
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,640
quantum potentiality.

247
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,960
That when you start talking about the mathematics of quantum physics, what you're really talking

248
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,080
about is mathematical description of the thing in itself, but you can never really access

249
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
that thing.

250
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,960
But when you go and measure it, you do see something real and there's a certain mathematical

251
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,600
relationship between those two things that the external reality has a potential, but it's

252
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,880
only actual when you see it and it takes a form which we can understand when you actually

253
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,520
do make that observation.

254
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,520
So I think that's a case of not a bad, but actually a good example of somebody bringing

255
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:26,440
philosophy in the physics and he was a very thoughtful person, obviously.

256
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:34,200
I think this is a great point and great because in the beginning, in the pioneer phase that

257
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,440
we say of quantum mechanics, there was an interpretation of quantum mechanics that was

258
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,680
called the Copenhagen interpretation.

259
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:50,400
And the Copenhagen and Heisenberg was part of it and part of the founders and the Copenhagen

260
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,920
interpretation tried to stay away as much as possible from saying something about the

261
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,920
metaphysical or what you call the potential now.

262
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,080
Heisenberg moved forward from that in his later years when he came up with the ideas

263
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,880
that you just mentioned.

264
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:13,040
But of course, the Copenhagen interpretation is a knowledge-based interpretation whereas

265
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:20,600
many people in reaction to that, quantum mechanics, tried to find an ontological basis for it.

266
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,520
And this was the starting point of ongoing discussions about which one is the right interpretation

267
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,280
to be the epistemic, the knowledge-based interpretation or the ontological interpretation.

268
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:39,240
Now, the modern point of view now is that it's not really quite right to play these interpretations

269
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,000
out against one another.

270
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,960
The really interesting question is how they hang together, how one plays into the other

271
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:55,160
and maybe even find some rules, how something that is out there due to an experiment or

272
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:04,160
due to an observation comes into our mind-dependent representation.

273
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:14,600
I have a little bit of difficulties with some of these terms because first of all, there

274
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,840
is no such a thing as a single Copenhagen interpretation.

275
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,680
It's never been.

276
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,120
That's of course, Jia.

277
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,560
Because for example, even from the very beginning, Bohr and Heisenberg's interpretation were

278
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
somewhat different.

279
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:34,240
It is also true, however, as Karl pointed out, that Heisenberg changed somewhat his views

280
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,400
of things.

281
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:42,320
In fact, if you look into his earlier book in 1930 on the physical principles of quantum

282
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,560
theory, there is a very interesting comment.

283
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:53,520
We shared with him that one of the reasons that we cannot see, there was always a kind

284
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,160
of ontology in the Copenhagen interpretation that has to do with what we see in measuring

285
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,240
instruments.

286
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,160
That was assumed to be real and in fact, representable by means of classical physics.

287
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,520
The question is that classical physics could not explain how what we see comes about and

288
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,040
could not predict it.

289
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,440
So Heisenberg made a point in which he said, look, it's not so surprising because our

290
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,160
brain evolutionary developed in dealing with the object consisting of billions of atoms,

291
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
et cetera.

292
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:32,040
So there is no special reason to assume that it can deal with how nature is constituted

293
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,400
at the ultimate level.

294
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,680
So his position in that way was saying that was much closer to Bohr, which Bohr sort

295
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,280
of always maintain and for Bohr was always central, the classical description of measuring

296
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:53,200
instruments later on in the book where he talks on potentiality, especially physics and philosophy

297
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,400
to which I presume Greg in part refers.

298
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,960
He takes a very interesting position following in part, responding to Kant.

299
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,160
Big part of this book is his response to Kant, idea that we cannot really know things on

300
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
themselves.

301
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:14,160
I cannot go into detail, but he said it may be that for a physicist, if things on themselves

302
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,800
exist, they would at all, they would be mathematical.

303
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:23,080
It was influenced by quantum field theory and group representation and all these things

304
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,400
and Dirac's ideas.

305
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,920
So I think so from that point of view, first of all, so he has a somewhat different view,

306
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:38,760
but the second point which I want to make that in a way, the things I agree with the

307
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:44,440
point that the things that are epistemological and ontological are kind of mixed, we also

308
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:50,280
need to define these terms because ontology can have two meanings.

309
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,040
One is assumption that there is something outside us which is real.

310
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:01,240
And another one is the assumption that we could describe or represent or at least conceive

311
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,840
of what it is outside.

312
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,400
So I think these are two different meanings of ontology.

313
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,160
And I think from within most people in Copenhagen interpretation, certainly born in Reisenberg,

314
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,040
there was an assumption of the outside material reality.

315
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,480
The question is, to what degree you could represent the ultimate constitution as opposed

316
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,720
to the effects which it has on what you actually observe.

317
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:34,400
And I think in parallel development, actually the psych analysis and Freud's theory, et cetera,

318
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,360
use the idea of unconsciousness, the unconscious, which had some of connections of this line

319
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:46,160
that we see the effects of the unconscious, but not necessarily the unconscious itself.

320
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:52,800
I think there's a lot of very nuanced structures to this, to this, to this, to this, to this

321
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
term.

322
00:24:53,800 --> 00:25:00,200
I think it's a little bit so difficult to, so that's what I would want to add as a footnote

323
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,040
to this comments.

324
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:09,920
I wanted to, because that's a lot of really interesting commentary.

325
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,360
I wanted to make my own brief interjection and bring it down the ground a little bit.

326
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:22,080
I always think of the quantum revolution as being a case where perhaps, and you can correct

327
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,320
me if I'm wrong for the first time, this sort of physical theory outstripped any sense of

328
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,960
where it's connected to reality.

329
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,440
It reminds you a little bit of those cartoons where the character runs out over it off the

330
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,880
end of the cliff and is out in the air and doesn't know where it is.

331
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,720
How exactly to interpret the Schrodinger equation, whether or not it referred to some physical

332
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,440
thing or not, seemed to be to be a unique problem that physics found itself in.

333
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,520
And maybe that is something to do with the return of metaphysical thinking among some

334
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,320
of the later generations.

335
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:59,200
I would say that's a fairly unique situation where the science insisted on a metaphysical

336
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:09,000
interpretation, whether you like it or not, so to speak.

337
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,920
My comment on that would be that I believe that there's some historical momentum because

338
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,600
of the success of classical physics that presented this default that things would naturally

339
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,400
work out very well if we just thought about the world as made up of core puzzles moving

340
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,120
around according to specific sorts of differential equations that we could make all the predictions

341
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
we wanted.

342
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,840
Of course, that wasn't actually the case, but that was the sense.

343
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,880
And I think that that's why this feeling of going off a cliff was so severe in the case

344
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
of quantum mechanics.

345
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,280
I think in the stretch of history, maybe it wasn't so unique, but certainly it's the

346
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,760
closest and very dramatic.

347
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,400
So I would agree with you in that sense.

348
00:26:45,400 --> 00:27:04,680
I'm wondering if it might be okay to come back to something that Greg mentioned earlier

349
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,160
that I think I'm just quite curious.

350
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,200
I think we probably have a very different range of opinions about this was that Greg

351
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,040
mentioned the sort of traditional picture of the layers with physics at the bottom and

352
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,560
chemistry and so on and so forth.

353
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:27,400
And I certainly, I mean, I've done some physics myself and I understand that sort of intuition.

354
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:33,120
I would say though, I think more recently I've started to think, I'm not sure I understand

355
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,200
why we would think that way as a sort of descriptive layering just in the sense that it may be

356
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,720
motivating in a certain sense to physicists and they think, you know, we're getting down

357
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,560
to the deeper, deeper, deeper part of reality.

358
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:54,240
But I mean, I would say my sense is that we're not making more progress in sort of seeing

359
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,320
the, I mean, this relates to the quantum thing.

360
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,040
It's not like we're seeing more progress now explaining the common sense world from the

361
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
physics.

362
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,360
It's actually kind of like the physics is getting so weird that we're getting further

363
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,960
away from sort of, you know, making sense of the world around me.

364
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,200
I mean, it's not like now I can look around me and go, well, now it makes sense because

365
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,920
I understand the Schrodinger equation.

366
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
It's sort of the opposite.

367
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:23,320
Like the Newtonian picture was almost like, oh, I can just replace, I can replace the

368
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,520
manifest image around me with the Newtonian picture and it's like, okay, that's better.

369
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,720
It's like, it's hard for me to think I can replace the manifest image of the world around

370
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,720
me with the quantum mechanical picture.

371
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,040
It starts to me to feel like, okay, that's a great, you know, it's a great story or like

372
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,840
sort of great painting of what's going down at the very bottom.

373
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,320
It's a very useful painting.

374
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,040
It certainly does a good job of describing experiments, but I'm not sure it's helping

375
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,440
to make sense of the world around me better.

376
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,600
I'm just curious what the different attitudes were that because I think that it almost

377
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,840
divides people I found sort of in terms of philosophical intuitions.

378
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,320
And there are those who just think, yeah, everything at the bottom is just the physical

379
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,920
stuff and everything else kind of you pull it out of it.

380
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,800
And there are those who resist that.

381
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:15,240
Let me just just say that that is, I mentioned this is the default position, certainly not

382
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,680
my own position, by any means.

383
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,680
And in fact, I agree with you wholeheartedly, except that I would say give a little bit

384
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:26,520
of, you know, support to that idea and not insane basis for that, which is that, you

385
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,240
know, the nature of science has been to spread our, the scope of our knowledge and the scope

386
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,840
of our knowledge has been where we've understood fairly well, we can go to the moon with pretty

387
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,400
lousy, I would say physics in the sense of not very sophisticated and a computer, which

388
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,560
is no like the cell phone that I have here.

389
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,520
And that can get you to the moon.

390
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,320
So that's pretty impressive, right?

391
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,680
And so we develop all this technology for us to see different scales.

392
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,160
And when we get to the atomic scale, then we have this interesting thing where, well,

393
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,720
okay, it looks a little bit difficult to understand in our ordinary way of understanding what's

394
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
going on there.

395
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,600
But at the same time, if you look at the alcohol process, for example, building up the nature

396
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:08,360
of the, you know, the periodic table, just from your basic mathematics of it's not so

397
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,520
different from the classical version that you can actually see a structure build up and

398
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,680
you can think of chemical things as built up of those pieces.

399
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,960
And then you can get biochemistry and then you can explain biology and then you can

400
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
explain the brain.

401
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,640
Now, I would say like Descartes, well, mind is a different story perhaps.

402
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,360
But you know, there is some basis for thinking that in successive sciences, what I want to

403
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,440
say, but I agree with you, otherwise.

404
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:38,240
Well, you know, the Anderson, of course, in 1973 famous article, more is different, was

405
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
anti-reductionist.

406
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,720
It's a very important article.

407
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,760
I agree entirely that it's, I don't think we could even reduce chemistry to physics,

408
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
strictly speaking.

409
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,200
There is a lot of chemistry as Greg just noted, which could be explained by means of chemistry,

410
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,280
but it's very hard to reduce it to physics, except very simple case.

411
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:06,360
It has a basic explanation of, with Bohr's atomic theory of the table in terms of electron

412
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,360
levels, et cetera.

413
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,560
But it doesn't mean that it can do much of chemistry.

414
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:17,240
On the other hand, I do think that that's the point which Heisenberg and Park made, that

415
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:25,680
we should not expect that quantum theory should help us to understand the world around us.

416
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:33,320
I think Hermann Weil at some point said about mathematics, actually, and he said to relate

417
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:41,120
the intuition of continuity in mathematics, he was referring to Kantor's theory to our

418
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,600
everyday intuition is meaningless.

419
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:51,320
But he said we can use this very abstract mathematics in physics, including in relativity

420
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,320
and quantum physics.

421
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,080
And the way you can say that the whole history of mathematics, beginning with roughly the

422
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:02,240
end of the 19th century, was a developing of abstract mathematics, which had very little

423
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,040
connections to the description of the world.

424
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,920
And remarkably enough, if you think about that, quantum theory Heisenberg, of course,

425
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:17,320
he didn't use the language, but he essentially used Hilbert spaces over complex numbers.

426
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:25,160
It's not an object which in any way is related to our intuitive or other descriptions of the

427
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
world.

428
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:33,080
And that's why I think that point about the connections between quantum physics or its

429
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,080
story, et cetera.

430
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:44,440
And the relationships between the world as we see it is really complex and maybe impossible.

431
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,440
It may be impossible.

432
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,200
I think behind Professor Halberts, when I see painting, which is kind of abstract, and

433
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,280
made me think about Kandinsky and other painters who were contemporary of quantum theory, who

434
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:02,920
created all these images, which you cannot really connect to the world.

435
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Unlike somebody like Picasso, who always scrambled reality.

436
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:13,280
Somebody like Kandinsky just came up to totally different, of course, he related it to some

437
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,320
spiritual reality and commenting on this book on spiritual and art.

438
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,600
But I think the point is that I think it would be hard to expect that a quantum theory has

439
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,680
much connections to the actual world.

440
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:34,920
In fact, to think so in terms of even classical theory is already complicated.

441
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:41,560
A classical physics is not necessarily, it was born as a mathematical refinement of our

442
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
intuition.

443
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
This is true.

444
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,280
But by 19th century, it's already developed if you think about Maxwell electrodynamics

445
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,440
and things of that type, very far from what we do.

446
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,440
And I don't think it can explain this different emergent level of how we do so.

447
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,280
We need different explanation.

448
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,560
And in a way, you can say different metaphysics, which operates at different levels of explanation.

449
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:12,880
I think it might be useful here to make a distinction between different senses of explanation.

450
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:20,920
So there might be the question of, like, does physics explain ordinary everyday reality

451
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:27,000
as we encounter it in the sense of, like, if we studied a lot of physics, would we be able

452
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,800
to understand how to make dinner or things like that?

453
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,920
So that sense of, like, would it give us epistemic insight?

454
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,160
And then there's a more metaphysically loaded sense of explanation, which is, like, you

455
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:46,520
know, if we understood the nature of the fundamental physical particles or something like that,

456
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:53,160
would that then give us the metaphysical grounding or would it, like, would it explain the nature

457
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
of everything?

458
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,880
Would you kind of get everything else for free?

459
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,720
You know, if you were God and you were creating the world, would you basically just have to

460
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:06,120
create the fundamental particles and the laws and say, you know, let it be thus?

461
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,320
And then you would get the manifest image.

462
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,000
So I guess the difference between, like, is there epistemic emergence?

463
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,240
Or there's some facts that you just couldn't know by knowing the fundamental physical facts?

464
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,080
And then maybe is there ontological emergence?

465
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:33,120
Is there some stuff that isn't just some basic recombination of the fundamental physical

466
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
particles?

467
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,840
Or, like, you could understand everything there was to understand about the nature of

468
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,920
that reality by understanding fundamental reality?

469
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,160
And certainly, like, one of the things I've been interested in thinking about the metaphysics

470
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:55,880
of the social world, social ontology, is, you know, might there be some interesting ontological

471
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,600
and metaphysical claims about that the nature of the world as we have made it, where we just

472
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:06,640
need different explanatory tools, we need different concepts, we need different ways

473
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,880
of talking about what the world is like precisely because we're talking about reality.

474
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,760
That is in part social.

475
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:21,000
It's part of the way that we have made reality to be that you don't necessarily just get

476
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,040
for free by thinking about the nature of fundamental particles.

477
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:34,640
But, you know, that's a very, very, very complicated metaphysical question that wouldn't necessarily

478
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:41,000
be settled either way by settling whether, you know, if you did enough physics, you would

479
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,360
be able to understand what flamingos look like or something like that.

480
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:54,480
Well, Elizabeth, you mentioned earlier this interesting issue of correlation and causation,

481
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,320
which often arises in these large ensembles, like large groups of elements.

482
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,280
And then the question becomes, how do you decide whether some sort of correlation is

483
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,400
causative or that's just hanging together in some other sense?

484
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,200
And typically when that arises, it also pulls into question whether everything just comes

485
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,280
down to billiard balls, right?

486
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,120
Because now you've got the action of all these ensembles.

487
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:26,480
I think it's a really interesting handle on this problem.

488
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,680
Well, I'm going to go ahead and come back.

489
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,680
Oh, sorry, Craig.

490
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,520
So I would just say quickly, you know, the real question that comes to mind there, if

491
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,000
you're a true believer in this kind of physicalist view is, you know, kind of mathematics do

492
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,440
it and the answer is no, the mathematics can't do it.

493
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,960
The mathematics will probably never do it, absolutely.

494
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,160
But on the other hand, you know, we didn't really understand why the sky was blue until

495
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,000
we did enough quantum field theory, which is not very well-informed fact.

496
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,960
But as a matter of fact, this particular sort of scattering is something that is understood

497
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,640
best and probably only correctly after quantum field theory.

498
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,640
So it's a very complex question, but I would agree with you on the basic level of it.

499
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,720
It's a fantasy to think that you're just understanding some elementary particles you're

500
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:17,160
going to understand the mind or social reality or anything terribly complicated.

501
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,680
My strong sense is, again, I speak as someone who's, I hang around a lot of philosophers

502
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,960
and even meta positions, although I don't think I would call myself meta position.

503
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:32,040
My sense is that, you know, so somebody, you know, physics, when one is doing physics,

504
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,440
the job description is fairly clear.

505
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,640
It's, I mean, it's fairly institutionally fixed, what a physicist does.

506
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,400
I think my sense is for metaphysicians, their self description of their task is probably

507
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,840
quite different from meta position to meta position.

508
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,840
And my sense is that the way Elizabeth described her way of thinking is very different from

509
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,040
some other meta positions who sort of think, my job is to look at all the sciences and

510
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,480
just tell you how everything kind of flows out from the bottom to the top.

511
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,720
Yeah, I think sociologically, that's definitely right.

512
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,720
And I mean, one thing I've like personally been interested in criticizing the idea of

513
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,240
like the goal of metaphysics is to describe the nature of fundamentality or something

514
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
like that.

515
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,600
So there's this idea that, you know, we figure out what's fundamental, what the basic reality

516
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:28,520
is that sort of, you get a lot, there's a lot of interesting word choice and so you get

517
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,560
the language of like purity.

518
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:37,200
So the pure reality or the, you know, the ungrounded or the all this kind of stuff.

519
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,400
And so it's like, if we could just describe that, then the task of metaphysics is sort

520
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:48,880
of carving the beast of nature at its joints or is talking about the absolutely fundamental.

521
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,440
And then everything else is maybe just kind of derivative on that or grounded in that or

522
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,120
explained by that or an ontological free lunch or something like that is the phrasing that

523
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,120
you sometimes use.

524
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:10,320
And I think that's a very common way of thinking about the projects of metaphysics within at

525
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
least analytic philosophy.

526
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,360
But I think it's also a way of thinking about project of metaphysics, which a lot of people

527
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:22,920
have been critical and that there's a lot of really interesting metaphysics that's not

528
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,240
doing anything like that.

529
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,640
So two of my colleagues at the University of Virginia who both self describe as metaphysicians

530
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,840
have just published books.

531
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,880
And one of them is about the nature of personhood and personhood over time, like what makes

532
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:43,080
you the same person that you were 10 years ago, 15 years ago, can we give any sort of

533
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,560
account of that.

534
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:54,880
And the other is about dependence and explanation and basically trying to criticize the idea

535
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,400
to criticize the assumption of foundationalism, that explanation always has to come to an end.

536
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,240
So could there be infinite change of dissent?

537
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,480
Could there be circular chains of explanations?

538
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,680
Did there, you know, so there's big discussions of explanation and non-well founded set theory

539
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,800
or things like that.

540
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,960
And they both think of themselves as doing metaphysics, absolutely.

541
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,640
But they're not trying to carve the beast of nature at its joints.

542
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,360
They're not trying to explain the nature of fundamentality, but nor are they doing something

543
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,800
that they think of as just conceptual engineering.

544
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,480
We're talking about, you know, what's reality like?

545
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,520
I think the real question is, you know, you just brought that up, carving nature at its

546
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,720
joints, right?

547
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:50,400
Because nature has, you know, joints, primarily, or is it our descriptions that produce joints

548
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:58,200
that we try out to describe nature and decompose it into elements that are connected by these

549
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
joints.

550
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,000
So I think a very interesting proposal, which goes along the lines of what you were saying,

551
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,680
Elizabeth, is already due to Kwein in 1960, something where he tried to relativize ontology.

552
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,320
So actually, the article that he wrote has a title, Ontological Relativity.

553
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:23,120
And the idea is, and of course, Kwein says that in much more detail than I can, reproduce

554
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:29,640
it now, the idea is something like every domain of description that we choose for a certain

555
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:35,840
situation to describe it can be considered ontologically or not.

556
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,800
And then we can have many ontologies, which are connected to one another and actually

557
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,120
Kwein charges us that we should find translations between these ontologies.

558
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,400
And this is actually his program of ontological relativity.

559
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,280
And once you, but once you look at a certain situation and find the best way to describe

560
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:02,240
it, then you should commit yourself to that ontology and not change it during the description

561
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,040
all the time.

562
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,720
Hillary Putnam actually had the same or worked this out with his idea of internal realism,

563
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,920
which is a little bit different in the nuances, but essentially the same idea.

564
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:22,120
And that's the way to find a middle path between foundationalism, which Kwein rejected Putnam

565
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:27,640
II, and the other extreme of something like radical emergence where everything is possible

566
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,880
and nothing is connected with one another.

567
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,720
So complete arbitrariness of descriptions.

568
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:41,080
I think this is a proposal which is still somewhat understudied in the sciences, although

569
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:47,840
it has received some serious consideration philosophy, of course.

570
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:56,440
Well, of course, if you look at the word meta to start with, like restotials books on metaphysics,

571
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,280
which was not his title, was added by somebody, some say, it means, it just means that the

572
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,800
books come after metaphysics, next set of books.

573
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:15,120
I think the word meta implies in a way that you describe one system in terms of an other,

574
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,240
which is can comprehend the system from outside to some degree.

575
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,560
So I think so from that point of view, you can have a very different level of metaphysics

576
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,480
depending what you define as physics.

577
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,960
One of the main big contributions and my view in quantum mechanics, especially in the

578
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,640
Bohr's interpretation of an early Heisenberg, I'm not sure about Copenhagen, is that we

579
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,480
and I think you extend it can be for at least in physics.

580
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,160
We always deal with our interaction with the world.

581
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:55,120
To some degree, clients different level of ontology describe different levels of this

582
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,120
interaction.

583
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:02,920
In that sense, if you take an extreme position, which I actually like and we're not completely

584
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,240
taking it, that everything is metaphysics in terms of it.

585
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,680
We can only have a human description of anything.

586
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:18,040
Part of Heisenberg's point was, with which I started here, that there is no reason to

587
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:22,560
believe that we could describe the ultimate level of reality or maybe some other level

588
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,560
of reality.

589
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:30,680
We hear that we were fortunate that mathematics is to some degree free of limitations of common

590
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,880
language and concepts and it can predict what happens in quantum mechanics.

591
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:43,280
But we don't necessarily can hope that it could work in any other set of areas.

592
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,120
I think it's true that the metaphysicians, in part for that reason, define this task very

593
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:55,440
differently from most physicists beginning with Galileo and after who could think in

594
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,720
terms of mathematical description of predictions of what is going on.

595
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,560
Because technically, that's why the origin of the so-called the heart problem of consciousness.

596
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:13,400
We really don't have a physicalist, functional interpretation of our conscious experience

597
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,640
in terms of coalesce.

598
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:21,760
I think that really tells you that it may not be possible to describe many things to

599
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,200
which we relate to the worth of our mind in mathematical terms.

600
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:33,280
So I think that seems to me that that is the, it's very hard to believe that that program

601
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:39,360
of from bottom, on the other hand, I'm not quite sure who would subscribe to that extreme

602
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,840
view that everything it really doesn't matter.

603
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:49,960
There's all these connections and there's always some sense of systematicity in description

604
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,960
and the interaction between various levels.

605
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:59,040
Since you're talking about the meaning of meta, Arkady, do you know what Karlab said

606
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,040
about that?

607
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,040
Yes, I do, yes.

608
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,000
Whatever you do, I can do meta.

609
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:13,760
Exactly true, because there is all this system which, you know, Lakota Shka's has

610
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,680
an interesting comment on that as well, you know, but the Lakota Shka's, you know, it's

611
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:23,600
a great statement of Lakota Shka's that all physical theory have the same probability

612
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,640
to be true, namely zero, right?

613
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:37,120
So in a certain sense, it's always our engagement with the world in different domain through

614
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:44,360
mathematics and technology and physics, which produces because while the ultimate likelihood

615
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:49,120
the theory is to be true even though Einstein believed that thermodynamics will probably

616
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:55,560
always be true is the local possibility of how it works.

617
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:04,680
So in that sense, it is a kind of workable theory which is at this giving moment is we

618
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:10,960
accept, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it continue to be and therefore from that

619
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,040
point of view, and I say there's only metaphysics, I mean by that, that we don't have any description

620
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:23,960
except the ones which produce by who we are as evolutionary developed by biological beings

621
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,640
with the brains which produces the mind which we don't know how it does either.

622
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,320
And only briefly my second comment to what you said about the heart problem of consciousness

623
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,640
is it's only a brief comment, I'm just coming back from the consciousness conference, the

624
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,800
big consciousness conference in Tucson which takes place in Tucson every other year and

625
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:51,200
you would be astonished how many neuroscience people still believe there's only the brain

626
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,200
that we have to talk about, right?

627
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,040
No, I'm not astonished, I know that's called.

628
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,600
Yeah, of course I know that.

629
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,600
That's true.

630
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:08,920
Yeah, I was going to say, look, I think I need to defend those who take a slightly more

631
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,720
hardcore view about, you know, we just want to describe, you know, reality like it is

632
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,720
not.

633
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,680
I completely agree with the phrasing for example that, you know, every description is a human

634
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:24,200
description but the thing is, I think that's also can be interpreted in a negative way

635
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,880
where somebody says, okay, so then there's no more standards, right?

636
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,360
I mean, like my description is my description, your description is your description.

637
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:39,480
So you know, I think that taken in the wrong way, it can just, it can sort of destroy the

638
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,680
grand scientific project or even the minor individual seeking truth projects we have

639
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,320
as individuals, right?

640
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,360
Where you somehow always have to tell yourself, my view, the view that's influenced by who

641
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,760
I am is probably in many ways very wrong because of who I am, because of my perspective, because

642
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,360
of various things inside me.

643
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,600
So what's, you know, I think I feel that I think that longing that some people have

644
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:06,000
and they say that but there's just that description of the way things are is because they're trying

645
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,040
to say, remember, not every description is equally good.

646
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,000
So I think that's one thing we're missing here is we, you know, what is that standard

647
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,760
we're trying to live up to?

648
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,920
That's very true.

649
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,880
But I don't think you need to have one need to take this position is also some do that

650
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,080
meaning that every, as you say, you agree that every is a human interaction doesn't imply

651
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:32,720
because within each giving the main there reasons, you can, you can still do quantum

652
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:39,640
mechanics under the assumption of all the constraints which are involved without necessarily assuming

653
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:44,160
that you strictly describe the ultimate nature of reality.

654
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,520
I don't think anyone like I said, in fact, bore, you know, as a great statement says

655
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:56,800
about complementarity, he says the complementarity actually contrary to Einstein fulfilled all

656
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:03,200
the basic principle requirement as science as a mathematical experimental engagement

657
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,960
with nature.

658
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Science, including institutionally has this type of rules and constraints which tells

659
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:18,640
us something about that is to say we may not know things about reality but our interaction

660
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,840
with reality is not free.

661
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,880
You know, it's not strictly free.

662
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,160
It's not it's a matter of how it plays itself out.

663
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,640
So I cannot, you know, come out and say without any constraint.

664
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:40,240
Look, as I think that there is some universal consciousness somewhere, et cetera.

665
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,120
It's not a scientific statement.

666
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:49,200
So from that point of view, we are governed by this rule, some of which could be personal.

667
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,920
The question is what you believe as a ground and wish you stand and for many people as

668
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,560
you say to believe that you describe reality, give you such a ground, but such a ground

669
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,560
is not necessary.

670
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:07,120
If you think about people like nature and to some degree, they believe in each famous

671
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:13,800
because they say long live physics because it gives us the sense of integrity, right?

672
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,520
But at the same time, he believes in certain in the radical perspectives.

673
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:26,120
I think it's a I think your comment is extremely good because it is a very complex landscape

674
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:33,040
of negotiating between how you ground what you say about your interaction with the world.

675
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,280
So that seems to me is a crucial point.

676
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,320
You can't grow them in reality, but you don't in the ultimate constitution of reality, but

677
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,400
you don't necessarily need to in my view.

678
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,400
But just to follow up on what Hans, the point that Hans was making, no, I do think there

679
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,400
is like, there's something about and you don't have to go as far as like scientific realism,

680
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,960
but something about like the metaphysical assumption that there is an external reality

681
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,560
that we are attempting to describe, that we are attempting to, you know, to describe

682
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,480
with scientific theories.

683
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,160
That's maybe different.

684
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,800
And that's a different type of project than we might be doing in other types of humanistic

685
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:22,320
inquiry that does seem to be an important constraint on the practice in some cases, or

686
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,200
at least like a hopeful aspect of the practice.

687
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,760
And of course, you can distinguish between thinking that it's what we're trying to do

688
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,680
and thinking it's what creatures like us are able to do.

689
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,240
Like, you know, in my everyday life, I'm trying to treat everyone equally and everyone fairly

690
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,760
in order to try to be a moral person.

691
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:47,360
I also kind of don't believe that someone like me is actually capable of doing that.

692
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:52,360
You know, I think inevitably I am going to be influenced by bias and influenced by nepotism

693
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,920
and influenced by being grumpy and like all these sorts of things.

694
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,600
And yet, nevertheless, it's what I'm trying to do.

695
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:05,880
And it's also what I think that someone like me is never going to be in a position to do.

696
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,840
So we might think that like our theories are trying to describe a structure of reality

697
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:18,680
and yet are never in a position to actually do that because they're done by limited fallible

698
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,840
creatures and because it's really hard to distinguish between what's the element of the theory

699
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,280
and what's the element of, you know, the thing being represented and so on and so forth.

700
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,800
And it does seem like sometimes we want to be able to criticize practices for having

701
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,300
gone wrong.

702
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,120
Whereas if we thought like all you need to do is have like ideological presuppositions

703
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:41,800
and a coherent way of viewing the world and then get your theories to work out right,

704
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:46,160
there might be places where it's hard to provide a critique that we want to be able to provide.

705
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:52,920
So this isn't physics, obviously, but you know, there are these famous cases in psychological

706
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,040
research where studies of whether ESP is real.

707
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,080
And what seems to be the pattern in the research on this is that like people who believe in

708
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:09,840
ESP design all these really great, well-organized studies and they go and they find ESP and

709
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,640
they find evidence that ESP is real.

710
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,440
And then people who don't believe that ESP is real are like that can't be right.

711
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:21,960
And they go and they describe design all these really well-organized, you know, great well-designed

712
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,440
studies and they prove that ESP is not real.

713
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,880
And so you've got this practice going on where you've got two set, you know, you've got different

714
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:36,760
communities that have different assumptions and, you know, different ideological stuff

715
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,680
affecting what they think the world is like and then they're doing scientific practice.

716
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,960
But it seems like what we want to say in this case is, look, either ESP is real or it's

717
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,960
not.

718
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,640
And something's going wrong when science is like this.

719
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,840
You need to be able to figure out what's going wrong here.

720
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:58,480
But if you don't have that assumption that like either ESP is real or it isn't and the

721
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,920
goal of scientific practice is somewhat imperfectly to figure out what the world is like, then

722
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:11,040
you can't kind of make that external critique in a way that seems important in an epistemic

723
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,520
situation like that.

724
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:18,800
Well, it depends on the sense that, you know, it interacts with what I said, it depends on

725
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,160
the level on which you assume ontological reality.

726
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,360
I don't have to make an assumption in physics in principle.

727
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:31,800
You know, I make an assumption and most physicists do it's very hard to do without it, all the

728
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,800
possible.

729
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:39,640
There are four layers of Berkeley and fundamental physics that there is exist an external reality

730
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:45,080
in the sense that the world existed before we came on the stage and will continue to

731
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:52,000
exist after we are gone from the stage is going to be very soon by the standards of the scale

732
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,560
of the universe.

733
00:56:53,560 --> 00:57:01,120
But that does not mean that I can make any unambiguous or meaningful statement about

734
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,920
how the world really is ultimately.

735
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:11,360
But I can make an ambiguous and correct statements about the interaction with the world through

736
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:17,520
technology and mathematics through which I can predict what's going to happen.

737
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:23,760
And in the case of extracellular perception, you can pause it in a similar way.

738
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:29,680
You can check to what degree these things correspond to the experiments of which we

739
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,680
conduct.

740
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,640
It doesn't really undermine that on the other hand, even in physics, there is still

741
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:41,160
always disagreement between people who take ontological position and who don't take ontological

742
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,680
position or there is still different theory.

743
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,480
You know, there are people who are strong believers in so-called bombing and mechanics

744
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,720
and you cannot really, they will not be convinced on kind of similar ground.

745
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,800
It's always to some degree ideological.

746
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:01,960
But my point is that you could conduct science without making an assumption that the ultimate

747
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,080
nature of reality could be represented by a series.

748
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:11,080
But there are all these will be levels which will need to be so represented as, for example,

749
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:17,440
in physics, we need to describe measuring instrument because otherwise we cannot really

750
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,440
do it.

751
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,560
So I think it's not, there are different level.

752
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:27,120
It's really the level of, as Harold pointed out, Wack-Wine, it's at the level of ontology

753
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,880
and reality which you have to assume.

754
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:35,960
And if you deal with kind of social metaphysics as you pointed out, it will be different from

755
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,240
doing the metaphysics and physics.

756
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,320
That would be my position on that.

757
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:48,400
That you don't have to assume that something is real, they assume that something is real,

758
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:54,800
but you don't have to assume that you could describe even in principle what is real.

759
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,760
You don't have to make this assumption.

760
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,960
But after all, we have no idea what elementary particles are in terms of the physics.

761
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,480
We can only observe the effects on measuring instrument.

762
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:09,880
Nobody has ever seen an actual elementary particle on its own accord.

763
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:16,040
You can only see the photographs which they live by collisions with instrument and things

764
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,040
of that.

765
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,240
There's, yeah, please.

766
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,600
I was going to say, Arkady, what would you say then though is that, I mean, if one thought,

767
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:32,400
okay, I think there's a reality, but it can't be described, what should the goal then be?

768
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,000
So what should the scientist be trying to do?

769
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:42,480
Well, as I just said, you describe and predict what's going to happen in experiment which

770
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,480
you observe, right?

771
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,040
Or describe reality at the level where you can describe them.

772
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:54,480
I mean, it was really crucial nuance that you cannot describe the ultimate nature of reality,

773
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,800
but it does not mean, as Carl said, that you can or they must describe.

774
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,480
So you have plenty of goals.

775
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,280
Look, my goal is to develop, listen, I think Paul Girock was quite interesting about that

776
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,520
because he was very mathematical.

777
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:14,600
So he wasn't even thinking, one of the people who didn't probably have metaphysics, although

778
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,720
I would write the wrong about that.

779
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,800
But the goal was to write an equation which predict was going to happen if a relativistic

780
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,080
electron hits the screen, right?

781
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:29,120
So he writes the equation which leads to the discovery of a positron.

782
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,480
But what is a positron?

783
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,680
It's another assumption of something which if you hit the screen in a particular way,

784
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,040
you have this and that type of data.

785
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:42,120
That's a pretty good task to perform.

786
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:46,320
It's a good task, but I'd say I want to come back to sort of for me at the very beginning

787
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:53,280
of this, I'm a little bit afraid that that sort of idea is what led to a lot of what

788
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,480
I see in science education.

789
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,200
No, no, no, listen, I'm not in disagreement with that.

790
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:04,920
Look, you can, this idea is just a little bit forgiving for that comparison.

791
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,160
That's why somebody like Nietzsche could be very dangerous as he said himself because

792
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:16,600
you can use these ideas in all manner of wrong way, you know, like you have some so-called

793
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:21,280
postmodernist philosophers, people like De Reda, Foucault de Lewis, et cetera, whose

794
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:28,080
ideas were quite complex and controversial, but the way they were used, including in education,

795
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:33,320
is sometimes ridiculous, you know, but they try to base them with these philosophical

796
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,320
things.

797
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,840
I think it's very not fair.

798
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,520
I think it'd be interesting to outline for people for our audience, especially too that

799
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:44,680
there's a little bit of a caricature of the history of analytic philosophy that sort of

800
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:49,160
leaves out some of the struggles with foundationalism.

801
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:53,280
And this also goes over into the philosophy of mathematics, where, you know, a number

802
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,720
of them, including Rudolf Kornop, who's been mentioned here several times in the point,

803
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:03,040
have moved along toward saying having the sort of naturalistic posture whereby they say,

804
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:08,080
okay, well, look, science is, we're going to assume science is largely correct.

805
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:14,160
And now, how do we proceed now, because we're going to not assume, it says something foundational

806
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:20,760
about the ontological reality, but we'll say it does provide true statements.

807
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,640
So what can we do from there?

808
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:29,200
And from there, things like quine, quine's relativized ontology, relativize comes out,

809
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,200
and they were moving along to a sort of like a little bit of a lazy Susan of ontologies,

810
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,440
like, you know, pick the ontology one.

811
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:40,040
Now, Katie made this interesting comment earlier about the difference between, I think, is

812
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:45,320
what Hider called on tech versus ontological, whether you could argue within science about

813
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:50,800
what are the fundamental elements that your field is interested in, which is more of an

814
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,200
on tech consideration.

815
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,120
What are the things that are relevant to what we're doing?

816
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,880
And they may not be objects, they may not be physical objects.

817
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,120
And then what is the meta, what is it at the metal level that can we say something about

818
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,120
that?

819
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:11,000
Naturalizing metaphysics has had this benefit of holding on to what we know within science

820
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,760
and seeing what we can do from there, not necessarily to produce some sort of ultimate

821
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,760
foundation.

822
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,760
Is that?

823
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:23,760
And finally, Davidson like Karnaugh had this notion that collaboration between people

824
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,920
and having everyone debate this, the scientists involved in these various disciplines was

825
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,960
the way to arrive at some sort of like quote unquote real truth of what's going on, rather

826
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:40,960
than to be completely nullified.

827
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:46,720
And does that have or anything else?

828
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,560
I'll just say one thing about my own education experience.

829
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,800
Like I think that has had some very positive effects.

830
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,480
So because I think in philosophy of physics, one of the things people do is they think,

831
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:04,120
well, actually it's come to be that there's sort of two camps here, the camp that I was

832
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:09,160
sort of trained in was, yes, you take it to be largely correct, but probably not fully

833
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,640
understood.

834
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,960
And so the philosophers job is to go and dig deeper and say what really is going on here.

835
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,440
So for example, with non-locality and quantum mechanics, you know, is that really cause

836
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,000
and effect, stuff like that.

837
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,400
There's another camp of philosophers of physics though, who think, you know, maybe it's not

838
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:31,360
largely correct, maybe because they're sort of cutting corners, maybe they're not actually

839
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:37,040
doing their ontology properly, we should probably try to improve upon what they've done, or

840
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,040
maybe even try to try to urge them to do it differently.

841
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,920
Obviously, I think that first of the way that I think that's been a very positive influence

842
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,600
in philosophy, it's given, you know, many people kind of a fun, interesting careers,

843
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:59,320
doing science that's a little bit more sort of metaphysically oriented.

844
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:04,880
I would say certainly in terms of the influence that it would have on metaphysics, I think

845
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:11,680
like so much of, so much of the trajectory of contemporary metaphysics could be seen

846
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:20,600
as a response first to the, you know, you have the skepticism of the sort of like the

847
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:26,840
positives, the positive, sorry, I can speak, the positivists, the Carnapian era, that kind

848
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,880
of thing.

849
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:36,560
And then you have Klein where this is sort of rehabilitation of ontology, but like ontology

850
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:44,120
light, it's not the kind of ontology that likeness was into, this very, very, very sort

851
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,080
of minimal thing.

852
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:52,200
And then from there, you have this building backup of the field of metaphysics, but in

853
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:58,400
this very, especially with David Lewis, right, with this very, very intensely naturalistic

854
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,400
spirit, right?

855
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:10,920
So like, can we do metaphysics in this way that is cohesive with the practice of the

856
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:15,600
natural sciences, or maybe even much more strongly, like, and I don't think this would

857
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,720
have been what Lewis thought, but what a lot of people think, like in service to the natural

858
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:26,200
sciences can be like metaphysics can like trim around the hedges at the places where the,

859
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:30,040
you know, the science is going to get a little bit confusing or you need someone to, you

860
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:34,680
know, to come in and do some cleanup or say, what exactly does this mean?

861
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:40,560
Or maybe metaphysics can, I guess, like, so Ted Sider has argued that one thing that metaphysics

862
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:47,040
can do is just provide like explanatory tools or resources that could be useful in the discussion

863
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:51,240
of the natural sciences to try to figure out exactly what we're doing.

864
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:59,520
I think that there is increasingly strands of thought in metaphysics that push back against

865
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:03,680
that and say, well, no, that's like, we're doing a lot more than that.

866
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:10,600
You know, there's a lot that's going on in metaphysics that isn't necessarily related

867
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:15,720
to the, you know, the sort of foundational claims or isn't necessarily just in the spirit

868
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:21,200
of like, like, highly minimalist ontology or things like that that is more just like,

869
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,760
again, questions about what the world is like, the nature of reality, which might be questions

870
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,080
about the fundamental, but they might not, but that aren't necessarily going to be addressed

871
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,680
by empirical means.

872
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,940
And sometimes that might be with an assumption of realism.

873
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:40,160
Sometimes it might be with like more to try to argue for a certain type of deflationism.

874
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,880
But the cool thing about any of these debates is that they all kind of end up being debates

875
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:44,880
about metaphysics.

876
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:51,120
You know, philosophers like Nelson Goodman who tried to give this like incredibly metaphysics

877
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:56,200
free view of the world and end up with like one of the craziest metaphysics out there.

878
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:02,600
So it does end up always being debates about the nature of reality that aren't empirical

879
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:08,040
one way or another, even if you're trying to argue that, you know, there's no there there.

880
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:22,280
Sorry, I'm sorry about that.

881
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:23,280
I was on mute.

882
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,160
I was a bit of fantastic conversation.

883
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:29,400
I wonder if people feel it would be a good time to open up questions from our audience

884
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,480
because we do have some that have accumulated.

885
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,560
Does that sound okay to everybody?

886
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,560
Sure.

887
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,560
Great.

888
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,560
Great.

889
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,240
Thank you for Alex to come in.

890
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,240
Okay.

891
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:47,120
Yeah, people, you could write questions in the Q&A in the bottom panel or if you're on

892
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:53,520
YouTube right in the comments on the live.

893
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,520
So we first have a.

894
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,920
We have wind shorts.

895
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,520
It's sort of referencing was said earlier.

896
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:09,160
So from elementary zilch particles to persons, what about the other way?

897
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:13,200
Given what we are able to do, what we take ourselves to be, does our understanding slash

898
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:18,560
claims about the elementary particles allow us to get to us, emergent properties emerging

899
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,840
from what?

900
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:25,920
And then they also add maybe a zilch particle is a person with almost everything left out,

901
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,680
top down rather than bottom up.

902
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:34,840
So any thoughts to that question?

903
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,600
That sounds like live minutes to me.

904
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,600
That's right.

905
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:45,680
I mean, he was a fantastic metaphysician, I think.

906
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:50,040
I mean, so it's his ideas, live minutes, his ideas sound pretty wild to us today, but

907
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,960
it's sort of, it's interesting that it takes someone like live minutes and compare them

908
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:58,080
to what people or metaphysicians are doing today.

909
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:03,040
Live minutes in certain sense, he was like his age is greatest physicist and then thought

910
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,160
he just needed to go further.

911
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:09,480
And so he thought the only way you can really under, the only way you can sort of really

912
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:16,120
explain all of the stuff you know in physics is by having this additional layer, the monodology.

913
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,360
And therefore, not that I understand that stuff at all, but it certainly does.

914
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:25,520
You know, he ends up having mind and body come together in the fact that the fundamental

915
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,120
things are these mental things, the monads.

916
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:34,520
Now, I take it actually, I'm no expert on this, but is that I'm sure someone else here

917
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:40,720
does is this not somewhat similar to like Chalmers, for example, today, David Chalmers.

918
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:45,160
It related to something because monads are the kind of atoms of the soul.

919
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:52,320
So they windows into the or rather windows without windows if I can put it that way.

920
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:59,680
But in lightness as opposed to somebody like, let's say, others coming from quantum theory

921
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:10,520
or even in mathematics, there is such a thing as in in top of theory as things without points,

922
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:19,320
you know, so the monads that they it monads could be read, not by Leibniz himself, as

923
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:22,640
the image of our interaction with the world.

924
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,120
Leibniz of course, made an assumption, which was metaphysical and realist.

925
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:33,920
You are absolutely right in terms of his problem, but I doubt that we can never get as Greg

926
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:42,240
suggested earlier from elementary particles to the this as a kind of level.

927
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:52,280
I think in the time of Leibniz, there was a little simpler picture of the layers of reality.

928
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:58,600
I think right now we have this incredibly complex picture of the layers of reality because even

929
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:04,200
in fundamental physics, we obviously cannot reconcile quantum field theory and relativity,

930
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,880
which is a huge problem.

931
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,000
And nobody knows how it's going to happen.

932
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,360
But I do agree with you that bringing up monads is a very, very interesting point that Leibniz

933
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:21,880
who was very different from Newton in terms of his calculus and things like that type,

934
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:28,560
but his idea of monads is a quite a remarkable idea, which tried to push it obviously beyond

935
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:34,760
and see how we, there is a metaphysics and that sounds.

936
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:39,960
So Leibniz's metaphysics, as soon as you come to the monodology is of course an idealist

937
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:46,160
but of course, no of course, no, it's completely the opposite of a physicalist metaphysics,

938
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,240
which started as a matter of a particle.

939
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:54,240
And then it comes somehow because the question was about the relationship between persons,

940
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,880
if I got that right, and elementary particles.

941
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:04,440
So we are talking about two different domains here, which are very hard to reconcile.

942
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,440
What is that?

943
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,360
The Shakespeare line says, we'll come and unwilt on thing at once.

944
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,240
It's hard to reconcile.

945
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:15,960
You know, that's really the question is, and do we need to necessarily reconcile it?

946
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,440
Yeah, that's the question.

947
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:18,440
Yes.

948
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:23,880
Well, but then we go back to Hans's question about Chalmers, for any way that panpsychism

949
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:29,440
seems to constantly reemerge in these conversations, right, every so often, we hear more about

950
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,440
it.

951
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:36,760
And I guess Leibniz was one of the most colorful proponents of that sort of approach, right?

952
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:44,300
Well, I don't think he was panpsychist in that way as some of the people who come from

953
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,800
Chalmers' problem do not everyone.

954
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:54,400
I think, you know, no, no, Leibniz, I think was more idealist, as Carl just said, that

955
01:13:54,400 --> 01:14:01,120
it doesn't mean that he projected any form of consciousness on material things.

956
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,040
You know, Berkeley was contemporary of Leibniz.

957
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:09,560
So I think I think it was a somewhat different view from flanpsychism, in my view.

958
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:10,560
Oh, yeah.

959
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:15,280
I just want to add, when wrote as Hans was talking about Chalmers, they mentioned Nagel.

960
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,600
I think they're referring to Thomas Nagel.

961
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,600
Yeah.

962
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,600
Yeah.

963
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,600
Okay.

964
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,600
Well, thank you, Wynn.

965
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,400
So you have a question from a team music on YouTube.

966
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:29,240
He wrote a few things, I'm just going to get to one, just because other people are writing

967
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,240
in questions.

968
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:34,640
So they wrote, how do you define consciousness?

969
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:40,000
And then which aspects do you focus on when you try to define it?

970
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
And with what?

971
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Yeah, anyway, so.

972
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
It's a small question.

973
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Yeah, keep it to a few words, please.

974
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,120
Simple as possible.

975
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,360
Can we all just think the answer?

976
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:59,160
David, show or not tell?

977
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:03,120
I guess just to add, because I know there was a comment made about neuroscience and I

978
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:07,720
guess the limitations of metaphysics within how neuroscience is currently applied.

979
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:13,320
And so having done, I'm currently a research tech within a neuroscience lab.

980
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:20,720
Yeah, the lab I'm generally using more behaviorist techniques to try to deduce depression and

981
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,920
satiation with regards to anodonia.

982
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:29,760
So I'm not obviously, I'm not like a distinguished panelist here, but it's definitely hard for

983
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,520
a neuroscience perspective to sort of answer that question given that it's very much

984
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:39,400
caromentalized and limited to whatever field that the neuroscience is looking in, in terms

985
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,400
of their research.

986
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,720
I also didn't want to belittle that question, it's a perfectly great question actually.

987
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,760
Oh yeah, I just needed just a gigantic one.

988
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:52,400
If I was to answer honestly, and succinctly, I would say, in terms of like, how do you

989
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,200
define consciousness, I would say I don't.

990
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,200
Right.

991
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,880
I don't make that attempt.

992
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:02,160
I think it's also perhaps one of these areas.

993
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:07,680
There may be quite a few in metaphysically rich areas of philosophy where there might

994
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:10,520
not be a single thing that we're talking about here.

995
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:14,880
There might be multiple overlapping things that we care about that sort of give rise

996
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:22,680
to this cluster of features that we care about and that are great, you know, phenomenological

997
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,680
and normative importance to us.

998
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:29,600
So I wouldn't even, I mean, I'm not a philosopher of mine, but I wouldn't even begin to know

999
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,800
where to start trying to define consciousness.

1000
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:38,000
And sometimes these definitional projects seem like the kind of thing that are doomed

1001
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,120
to failure.

1002
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:46,920
So for something as rich as consciousness, yeah, we've got to have no idea.

1003
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:52,520
Yeah, there's certainly no single agreed upon definition of consciousness when you look

1004
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,640
into all these consciousness studies related fields of research.

1005
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:04,200
And even if you go back into 1904, there's this very influential paper that William James

1006
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:10,080
published, which at the title does consciousness exist question mark and he even would deny

1007
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:17,080
that consciousness exists in the sense that it has no ontological quality to it.

1008
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,760
It's something very superficially would say.

1009
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,760
1904.

1010
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:26,600
Well, Freud started as a neuroscientist and the originally scientific project of scientific

1011
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:32,840
psychology was a kind of attempt to relate memory to neurons.

1012
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:40,880
But of course he gave up because he knew that's not possible.

1013
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,480
You're a mute out.

1014
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:52,200
Okay, go to the next question.

1015
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:56,600
Thank you, team music.

1016
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,760
Constance old on zoom wrote, would it be possible to use a metaphor from another discipline,

1017
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,760
I use word metaphor in another field of study?

1018
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:05,800
Can you repeat the question?

1019
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,240
Yeah, maybe Constance could rewrite it.

1020
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:12,520
Go to the next one, but they wrote, would it be possible to use a metaphor from another

1021
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:18,680
discipline, for example, use a word metaphor in another field of study?

1022
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:22,880
I could go on the next one and ask her to write and flesh it out.

1023
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,800
I wonder whether whether that refers to the idea that, you know, for us to understand

1024
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:34,080
something, we often borrow metaphor or anyway, analogies from other disciplines.

1025
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:40,080
It seems that physics is often the favored one because based on our earlier conversation,

1026
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:45,520
it's thought to be the foundational science, let's say, and we borrow some ideas from physics

1027
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:52,200
and important to chemistry and biology and computer science and neuroscience, et cetera.

1028
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:57,200
And then the question is it always should always be barred in that direction from what

1029
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:01,200
used to be considered a lower tier like physics in the upper tier.

1030
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:06,040
These are such a things borrowed in the other direction.

1031
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,200
That's how I, that's the sense I make of the question.

1032
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:16,480
I think working with metaphors is very important and also useful, but you have to memorize that

1033
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,600
it's a metaphor because if you don't do that, at the end of the day, you think everything

1034
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,600
is physics.

1035
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,600
If you use physical metaphor, that should be avoided.

1036
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:29,640
Well, and of course, physics uses a lot of metaphors.

1037
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,000
All of them, it's just the question that I, Harold, is completely right.

1038
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:40,760
You have to keep in mind the level of its application because it could be useful to explain some

1039
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:47,720
of these things at a certain level, but it has limits, but it's extremely productive

1040
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,640
analogy and metaphor.

1041
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,560
And it goes in both directions.

1042
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:59,880
I mean, it's quite clear, you know, if you read people like Heisenberg, Bohr, Hermann

1043
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:06,240
Wahl, all these type of people, a very rich metaphoric field from all manner of things,

1044
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:11,920
but it's a level of explanation, which you have to constantly keep in mind the limits

1045
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:17,520
of its application because there's no distemptation to think that metaphor explains it, but it

1046
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,240
nails it, but it doesn't.

1047
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:24,320
There's some interesting discussion about this actually with the uses of teleological

1048
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:32,120
metaphors in the naturalistic sciences, so a lot of scientific research or scientific

1049
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:37,120
papers will avail themselves of Taylor's like strongly, teleological language.

1050
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:43,200
So they'll say like, you know, the X wants to fight or it's designed to fight or it's

1051
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,120
like all this kind of stuff.

1052
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:49,840
Talking about things as though they're purposive or that they have intention or, and if you

1053
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,280
ask people about this, they will say, Oh, of course, it's just a metaphor.

1054
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,280
It's just a metaphor.

1055
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,640
It's not to be taken seriously.

1056
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:02,720
But then sometimes if you dig down a little bit into the details of the theory, it looks

1057
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:08,960
like actually the teleological explanation is pulling a lot of weight.

1058
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:15,000
It's not obvious just how metaphorical the teleological language is because some of the

1059
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:21,800
explanations that are being offered in the theory are sort of relying on the idea that

1060
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:26,360
the explanations are counterfactual in some way, they're relying on the idea that there

1061
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:32,240
is this almost sort of explanatory oomph to the idea of teleology that's it's not clear

1062
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,560
how naturalistically supported that is.

1063
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:39,600
So I think it's a good example of a place where sometimes the metaphors that we use,

1064
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,560
we can kind of dismiss them and say, Oh, it's just a metaphor.

1065
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:46,880
We're not taking it seriously, but in the actual practice of giving explanations here,

1066
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:52,040
it's not clear just how seriously people are taking the metaphors, which I think is really

1067
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,040
interesting.

1068
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:57,880
Well, that's very true because at early stages of quantum theory, the phrase nature makes

1069
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:01,600
a choice was really very big discussion.

1070
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,600
Yeah.

1071
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:07,320
It took a lot of time to explain it on the other hand Einstein, of course, as a brilliant

1072
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:12,760
rhetorician, he was an atheist, but he knew that to say that God played dice makes your

1073
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,360
statement immortal.

1074
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:18,640
If you just say nature played dice, nobody will pay attention.

1075
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:19,640
Yeah.

1076
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:24,200
Also, you know, it's interesting to go back to this very quick reference to Nagel, which

1077
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:29,960
I think which is Nagel that he referred to in his discussion about consciousness, what's

1078
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,400
it like to be a bad?

1079
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:37,800
And it's interesting to think how much metaphor is a lot of what consciousness is about in

1080
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:38,800
some way, right?

1081
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:45,640
Because we, if what it's like to be is sort of asking a metaphor, a question about a metaphor,

1082
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,640
isn't it?

1083
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,640
Ultimately.

1084
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:59,000
I mean, actually, what Nagel wanted to point out with this is that the experiential quality

1085
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,520
of a mental state is different from the neuroscientific description of a mental state.

1086
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,520
Yeah, absolutely.

1087
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:11,280
He was a sort of precursor of what later Dave Chalmers called the hard problem of consciousness

1088
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:18,480
or other people called the explanatory gap between qualitative experience on one side

1089
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:22,440
and brain functioning on the other side.

1090
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:28,400
And this was, I mean, Tom Nagel's paper was a very important paper.

1091
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:33,080
Historically, because the term consciousness was actually out of discussion.

1092
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:37,040
It was almost like a forbidden term from the beginning of the behaviorist school, like

1093
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,480
Skinner and others, right?

1094
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,120
They didn't talk about consciousness at all.

1095
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:49,400
So between the beginning of the 20th century and 1974, I think when Tom Nagel's paper appeared,

1096
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:55,760
consciousness was not it was just like exercise, even from psychology, where it intrinsically

1097
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:01,240
belongs to action, right?

1098
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:05,200
Constance also commented to consider political science.

1099
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,760
They referenced justice as an example.

1100
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:14,480
Any comments you could add to that given what else has been said about metaphors?

1101
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:18,720
The topic of justice.

1102
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:24,200
Yeah, like with regards to way to discuss with metaphors.

1103
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:28,480
If there's not much you think he could add, I could go on to the next question.

1104
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:33,280
I just thought to mention it because she wrote that as you guys were talking.

1105
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:39,080
Okay, I'll go to the next one.

1106
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,080
Let's see.

1107
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,520
Don't worry, Scott.

1108
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,000
I see your comments.

1109
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I'll get to you.

1110
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,160
There's one question on YouTube before you from Johannes Wecky.

1111
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:51,560
I hope I didn't mingle your last name.

1112
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,800
They wrote is physics necessary for metaphysics?

1113
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:00,960
Well, in what sense of necessary I'm going to get in some sense, physics is necessary

1114
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:01,960
for reality.

1115
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,880
Well, yeah, they will.

1116
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:07,440
So they wrote is it well, they wrote in the sense of like, can you study it without a

1117
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,920
good understanding of physics?

1118
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,920
But I think there's also that other that other realm that you were sort of referencing that's

1119
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:18,280
also I think quite interesting to discuss.

1120
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,720
I mean, I think that the answer to that question has a lot to do with what we discussed earlier

1121
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:27,680
about different methods in metaphysics because I actually do think that my sense is there

1122
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:32,200
is a movement among metaphysicians where they're like, yeah, we really got to know our physics

1123
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:36,960
because otherwise, you know, we at least need to have a, you know, know enough about the

1124
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,480
things we say latch up to it the right ways.

1125
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:44,320
But I take it there's other metaphysicians who think, you know, the part of reality I'm

1126
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,560
focused on, yeah, it's not really physics, so it doesn't really matter that much as I'm

1127
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,360
not, you know, very up to speed and physics.

1128
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:57,120
So I think it kind of depends on the metaphysicians methodological presuppositions.

1129
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:02,880
Yeah, I mean, speaking just as someone who does metaphysics for a living, like I don't

1130
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,160
know very much physics at all.

1131
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,880
I could just be bad at my job.

1132
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:20,440
So I think it depends exactly as Kansba saying on like any field, there's disputes about

1133
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:26,880
how, you know, the best methodology for practicing in that field.

1134
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:32,160
And so there are definitely people who think, yeah, I know we need to be able to understand

1135
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:38,120
what the science is saying so that we can understand how to make our metaphysical theories not

1136
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:43,880
only consistent with the science, but also know like at what point is it time to hand

1137
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:49,320
over the mic to the meta physician to say like here's where empirical inquiry runs out

1138
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:51,480
and so the meta physician might have something to say.

1139
01:26:51,480 --> 01:27:00,760
I mean, a lot of the work that I do is on stuff about the nature of social reality, like

1140
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,480
can we make sense?

1141
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,120
What do we mean if we say that something is socially constructed?

1142
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,240
Like is that can we make sense of that claim?

1143
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:10,640
There's about 10 different things at least that people seem to mean like at the same

1144
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:14,400
time when they say that.

1145
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,200
Are social kinds real?

1146
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,600
Are they different from national kinds?

1147
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:24,440
Like for me doing that, I don't necessarily think that knowing a lot of physics would

1148
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:29,040
be helpful to me for that explanatory reason that we talked about earlier.

1149
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:35,200
I need to know a lot more about areas of the social sciences.

1150
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:40,200
And so I think it partly depends on the fun thing about metaphysics is that there's like

1151
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,520
metaphysics of X for most any X.

1152
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,600
So partly depends on what kind of metaphysics that you're doing.

1153
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:51,480
It partly also depends on what you think the project of metaphysics is and what the task

1154
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,640
of metaphysics is.

1155
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:56,760
I have an interesting follow up question I propose both to you Elizabeth.

1156
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,320
But all the panelists I want to hear how it has to say about this as well.

1157
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:09,520
But when one performs an experiment on let's say in any particular scientific field that

1158
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:19,000
may test different metaphysical views of the world, does that turn the metaphysics into

1159
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,880
physics or neuroscience or social science?

1160
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:25,720
Like does it move it across the line from what was formerly metaphysical?

1161
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:30,680
If you're able to extinguish with two different forms of metaphysics one understanding?

1162
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:37,920
Well clearly not necessarily because in some aspects of psychology and sociology you do

1163
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,880
that in a different way.

1164
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:47,480
I think it has a lot of historical and ideological baggage this debate because to get what you

1165
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:55,440
talk to Greg's friend Aristotle because the term physics coming from physics and nature

1166
01:28:55,440 --> 01:29:02,880
emerged through modern science like why this type of meaning because in 18th century the

1167
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:07,520
word nature referred as much to human nature.

1168
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:13,840
So I think that what was said about different levels of metaphysics that you could certainly

1169
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:21,440
have a metaphysics in a real sense of explaining nature without physics if you give nature

1170
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:25,280
a broader meaning which nature deserves incidentally.

1171
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:35,600
So from that point of view I think the answer is it really has a big historical and cultural

1172
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:43,280
baggage because of the dominance of science even relating to the form the terms of nature

1173
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,640
and understanding nature.

1174
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:51,200
It goes back to as Greg said the reduction is a problem that when I was young so much

1175
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:57,680
younger than today I thought to my physics professor that I have difficulty with chemistry

1176
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:01,600
and he said of course you have difficulty with that because chemistry does not exist.

1177
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,120
So it's only it's only physics but it is wrong.

1178
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,760
It's not true.

1179
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:15,280
So I think that I do agree that the and Harold that it's metaphysics is defined what your

1180
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:23,160
system X is which I mentioned before the metaphysic is the X additional level of the system X

1181
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:26,560
and your system does have to be physics.

1182
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:35,320
It can't be social, ethical, moral or whatever and that's why I think as it was said before

1183
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:42,480
by Professor Halverson I believe that physicists tend to have a kind of agreement in terms of

1184
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:51,520
demarcating the field they do but the metaphysicians have a much more complex stratification of

1185
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,960
what they do as a field.

1186
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:59,720
You know they do different things under the name of metaphysics.

1187
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:06,600
I wanted to add something to to Gerys question which actually I thought Greg might respond

1188
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:12,600
to because Abner Schimone and I think Greg you were working with Abner Schimone for a

1189
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:20,320
long time he coined the notion of experimental metaphysics which seems to be contradiction

1190
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:25,840
in terms because experiments are never metaphysical experiments are experiments that provide knowledge

1191
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:29,320
so they are epistemologically grounded.

1192
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:34,520
But I think what Schimone meant to say what they were meant to describe but this idea

1193
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:44,040
is that you can if you have a good theory that comprises something that you would ascribe

1194
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:52,640
to a metaphysical domain and also comprises something how the metaphysical domain might

1195
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:58,200
appear to us when we do an experiment then you can do the following you can test two

1196
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:05,240
different theories which have metaphysical which have different metaphysical presuppositions

1197
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:11,400
and also have different experimental realizations by doing the experiment and then you can backward

1198
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:19,520
infer by the result of the experiment which was the correct metaphysical assumption within

1199
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,280
that theory right.

1200
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:28,080
So this is exactly what happens in in bell type experiments you have two different metaphysical

1201
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:34,200
assumptions we have the assumption of local realism and non-local realism both assumptions

1202
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:40,760
give you different predictions for bell type experiments and then what you find is that

1203
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:45,960
in the experiments one of the assumptions is violated right.

1204
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:52,400
This is a nice example of this seemingly contradictory notion of experimental metaphysics.

1205
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:59,640
Well, so I agree and that really gets down to the question of what is metaphysics like

1206
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,960
so for example of clearly ontologies part of metaphysics.

1207
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,120
So if you're a physicist and you say well I'm with Newton I believe that things are corpuscular

1208
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:12,480
or I'm with the other people who believe that there are waves and those are the fundamental

1209
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:17,320
things and so which is right and then that changes your ontology but that's the extent

1210
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,400
to which that's really metaphysical is suspect.

1211
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:23,440
I mean there is an overlap and that's the interesting place if there is an overlap that you experiment

1212
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:27,760
with if you can't there isn't you're not going to reject an entire deep metaphysics by any

1213
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,240
experiment of course which is the whole point of seeing it as being oxymoronic on the other

1214
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:36,240
hand that's one of the reasons I'm interested in ontological status of elementary particles

1215
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:41,680
because physicists endlessly speak about elementary particles it's been going for 50 years past

1216
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:45,600
the time when many people said no they're only quantum fields and I happen to believe

1217
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,840
that they're both and you need to understand the relationship between them but you know

1218
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:53,200
this is this is you know the the schmony thing which makes a lot of sense and I think when

1219
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,640
you find yourself at the certain point in dealing with your physics it's sufficiently

1220
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:02,720
difficult their novel you're faced with this question of how deeply do I need to go into

1221
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:07,760
the boundary to define my at least my ontology and many of the paradoxes come from bad ontology

1222
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:12,120
bad ontological assumptions which is you know part of this whole reaction that we don't

1223
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:16,120
want to do any philosophy like it messes up physics well that's you know quite wrong

1224
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:19,240
right but so yeah that's it very interesting.

1225
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,480
I totally agree.

1226
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:21,480
Yeah.

1227
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:25,400
This is the truth the physicists are keen to reconcile their own theories with what they

1228
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:31,320
understand or of metaphysicians are keen to reconcile their views with what they see as

1229
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:37,000
current day physics there must be some interplay between them like they're at some point.

1230
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:43,080
So I think that there's there's always going to be interplay but it's not many I I think

1231
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,360
just to follow up on what Greg said like I'm skeptical of the idea that you could just

1232
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:51,800
like wholesale you could have a metaphysical theory and then you would have like an experiment

1233
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:56,840
that could just tell you that it was wrong or something even just for the simple question

1234
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:01,720
and you know the fact that data always under determines theory choice or because there's

1235
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:09,600
always going to be these added philosophical questions that you have to contend with which

1236
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:16,120
is not at all the say that the empirical stuff is just unrelated.

1237
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:22,000
So I'll give you an example that's not anything to do with physics but again this is more in

1238
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,480
my wheelhouse so like a lot of the work that I have done recently is on the relationship

1239
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:34,760
between disability and well-being and the question of like does having a disability automatically

1240
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:39,920
reduce a person's well-being or their quality of life or can we make sense of claims about

1241
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,440
disability that are made within the disability rights movement that it's like just a way

1242
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,920
of being different but not necessarily being worse off.

1243
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:51,000
Now psychologists are also interested in this claim they're very interested in the question

1244
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,720
of the relationship between disability and well-being and there's a ton of empirical

1245
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:00,320
data on it and so you might think well isn't that just an empirical claim like you should

1246
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:05,040
just go and look at the science but of course when you go and look at the science for one

1247
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:09,520
thing the way that they do you know the way that the experiments are structured it's kind

1248
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:15,120
of like you go and you survey people and you ask them rate your happiness or rate your

1249
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:18,040
life satisfaction on a scale of one to ten.

1250
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:24,680
Now that is really interesting data what it actually tells me about what I as a philosopher

1251
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:29,480
I'm interested in when I'm thinking about well-being is a very complicated question and there's

1252
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:34,200
all sorts of things about like comparing different people and there's also different things that

1253
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:38,240
they might mean by disability and different you know the study populations that they're

1254
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:43,080
looking at so I think it would be a mistake for me as a philosopher interested in disability

1255
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:45,520
to just pretend like that data doesn't matter.

1256
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:50,680
That data is incredibly interesting and important to me but I also think it would be a mistake

1257
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:56,320
for me to be like oh this thing that I'm interested in it's just an empirical question because

1258
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:01,640
psychologists are studying it too I need to look at their data and be like okay what do

1259
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:06,960
I think any of this means and how if at all does it relate to this philosophical question

1260
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:11,200
that I'm interested in and might there be ways that I as a philosopher might be critical

1261
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:15,920
of some other methodology or say I don't think that this shows what you think it shows or

1262
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,360
various things like that.

1263
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:23,480
So I think similar things can often be said about the relationship between a philosophical

1264
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:30,960
and great and an empirical inquiry I'm sure Hans has thoughts on this.

1265
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:35,200
I mean I think this all I mean I'm actually sort of coming up with new thoughts as we go

1266
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:40,720
because it was very interesting inputs I was also really grateful to hear Greg's reflection

1267
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:47,000
I mean I've got a great abner's a great hero in philosophy of physics and he's also a great

1268
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:53,800
hero for really trying to I mean in one way reviving the philosophical spirit in physics

1269
01:37:53,800 --> 01:38:00,560
sort of you know physics is exciting because physics tells us stuff about what metaphysicians

1270
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:05,400
have been asking about for ages.

1271
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:11,560
So the one thing I'll just say is like I mean this is just sort of off the cuff a little

1272
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:17,760
bit I don't know where the line is between empirical science and metaphysics or even

1273
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:22,040
just philosophy in general in some sense it often has to do I'm this is going to be an

1274
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:28,280
oversimplification but often I think has to do with the normative right so that the you

1275
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,200
know what should be the case.

1276
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:35,160
And I think they can come up in a lot of different ways one is this the simple way of language

1277
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:40,480
engineering in other words like we have choices about how to use words and the thing is though

1278
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:45,760
in science often I think that's kind of forgotten right because you have these sort of you know

1279
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:50,160
the terms are fixed you know you ask a person you make a survey you say how do you feel

1280
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:54,560
you know is your pain level you know 10 or whatever but we don't say like what should

1281
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:59,440
we mean by you know the term well being or things going well stuff like that so I think

1282
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:05,040
that's something we're philosophers we have a bit more of a degree of freedom to say maybe

1283
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,760
we should change the way we're talking about this.

1284
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,720
And then also I think we're always sort of looking over our shoulders and thinking in

1285
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:16,080
philosophical inquiries like and so so I you know Elizabeth brought out the keyword that

1286
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:21,120
you know in flop we always say what does it mean and the thing is I think that often is

1287
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:26,120
like what should I do about it right so it's like it's not just the data sitting there

1288
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:32,760
it's like so I wake up tomorrow what shall I do in the light of this fact so and that's

1289
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:37,600
true an experiment can't tell you what to do right I mean experiment you get okay that's

1290
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,080
the result of the experiment you can hold on to the old worldview if you want to you

1291
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:46,560
know that's again the theory under theories under determined by data so I think it's a

1292
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,440
super interesting question you know but it's man I this is maybe one of the things again

1293
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:56,360
where you just say maybe we shouldn't try to give a shark you know this is where the

1294
01:39:56,360 --> 01:40:03,600
science stopped and this is where the the metaphysics begins although I think it's also

1295
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:10,040
bad to sort of like look there there's of course territorial battles sadly in current

1296
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:14,320
culture the humanities whatever counts as humanity's usually lose right so in other words

1297
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:17,840
like people think all just science you know all you do is the science and the rest of

1298
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:23,640
that stuff is like you know somebody somebody has to you know sit in those chairs that exist

1299
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:29,680
in the humanities buildings but in my sense is really good to remind to remind people that

1300
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:35,400
the experiments there's a lot more to discuss after the results come in.

1301
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:40,960
Great you want to move on to the next question?

1302
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:45,080
Yeah so how many more are you feeling because I have four from people I haven't asked so

1303
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:48,040
how are we feeling about?

1304
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,480
We feel four is that okay or?

1305
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,240
I think four might do it let's see how we feel.

1306
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:57,360
Okay yeah so it's going to be Scott then Walter then you know just so people know because

1307
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:03,520
I saw Walter was posting a few times just to make sure he knows I got him anyway so Scott

1308
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:10,240
thank you Scott for writing a question it's kind of a run on so I'll try to fix it up

1309
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:15,240
he could lamb basme later he's my friends so if I get it wrong he could critique me later

1310
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:21,080
but I'll try my best so he wrote is there any middle ground between the idea that science

1311
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:26,080
and mathematics are our human interpretation of the world and that there is only the human

1312
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:31,600
perspective on the world and there's no view from nowhere and then as an aside I think

1313
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:36,480
because that's sort of a question in terms of I guess idea an idealized world but he seems

1314
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:41,200
to then suggest that in terms of how it's actually done there seems to be only a human

1315
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,960
world the world and a scientific realism that seems to be the default attitude for most

1316
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:49,920
Americans in the 21st century that science and mathematics are the fundamental structure

1317
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:56,920
reality and our study of these fields therefore allows access to such structure.

1318
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:01,360
Well this is a little bit what Hans brought up was bringing out raising earlier as a concern

1319
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:10,720
right this idea what has been unleashed when we think of scientific study as being a social

1320
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,680
construct right.

1321
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:18,400
Well it doesn't seem to be a question about so much social construct that's an additional

1322
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:28,160
level of that discussion because you could use the view that we only have human interaction

1323
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:34,580
with the world through mathematics and technology and the social dimension was as additional

1324
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:41,920
question in all these debates in the so-called social studies of science few years back and

1325
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:48,920
social constructivism that was involved to what degree you know there is a symmetry between

1326
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:53,600
social sciences and natural sciences from that point of view and there is much more complex

1327
01:42:53,600 --> 01:43:02,640
view on this point now but I am all this little bit uneasy with people looking for a third

1328
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:11,600
way or way sort of in between because it seems to me that one could perfectly do well science

1329
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:18,160
under the assumption which as I said people like Niels Bohr and that it is about our

1330
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:25,920
interaction with the world through the experiment the technology etc rather than making the

1331
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:33,440
claims concerning making such a claim that the nature even in the physics level is described

1332
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:38,280
by mathematical equations and things of that type of window I do know that many people

1333
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:48,280
do believe in that but I would call this unfalsifiable metaphysical assumption because you know look

1334
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:55,400
von Neumann made similar type of thing he believed that quantum mechanics described the

1335
01:43:55,400 --> 01:44:03,040
independent behavior of the and only experiment and their fears was that and brings in probability

1336
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:10,600
etc but I think it's an unfalsifiable ontology the only thing we can falsify is what we see

1337
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:18,040
the experiment and how well our theories predict that but I don't think we can the advantage

1338
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:26,400
of seeing the world in terms of interaction in scientific theory and technology is falsifiability

1339
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:32,280
you know for me even the theory of relativity even the most people believe that it but not

1340
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:40,920
all there are philosophers of science who I think push or don't believe that general relativity

1341
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:47,560
actually describes it's an idealization which enables us to predict very important effects

1342
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:53,720
right I think this position allows us to do science and it is you can say it is a form

1343
01:44:53,720 --> 01:45:01,560
of metaphysics because it makes an unfalsifiable ontological assumption about the fact that we

1344
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:08,000
cannot describe or represent the universe but it's different from making assumption that

1345
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:13,440
we can because there is a symmetry in them because that assumption is non falsifiable

1346
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:20,240
there is no way in my view to falsify the assumption that the nature is described by

1347
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:25,560
any mathematical equations apart from our existence on the other hand I can perfectly

1348
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:33,320
well falsify theory such as quantum mechanics classical physics which can predict experiments

1349
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:38,680
some of which has a kind of metaphysical flavor not only Bell theorem rightly brought up by

1350
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:45,280
Harold but even the double slit experiment initially Schrodinger and Heisenberg's views

1351
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:54,040
of quantum mechanics were very different metaphysically so it's all so in any event I don't think

1352
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:59,640
I understand the temptation of the third way or the temptation of scientific realism but

1353
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:05,200
I don't think they're necessary and it's not made a matter of welcome razor it's a totally

1354
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:13,280
different question why one take one position or another on that I cannot explain why I

1355
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:19,680
take this interactive position versus scientific realism I don't know that I think it's very

1356
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:27,280
difficult to explain maybe Elizabeth can explain that because she deals in her domain you deal

1357
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:33,120
precisely with discretion they are psychological historical philosophical they're not mathematical

1358
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:39,960
there is no explanation why I believe in that type of position I can offer some but I could

1359
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:48,320
be a scientific realist but I'm not okay thank you Scott fish fine you didn't do it

1360
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:55,040
yeah he said he's on the train so I'll relay him later if he missed out he told me later

1361
01:46:55,040 --> 01:47:00,760
if I didn't mess up how he wanted that asked so thank you Scott so next we have three more

1362
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:06,720
so this is from Walter K. Lou thank you Walter they wrote I'm gonna use the latest when he

1363
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:12,720
wrote which he wrote as meta linguistic and meta perceptual activities respectively to

1364
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:18,040
what extent are poetry and cinema both physics and metaphysics in the senses discussed today

1365
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:34,440
that's an interesting one well I mean it right they partake of metaphysical subject matter

1366
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:40,640
right or their subjects might encourage a metaphysical reflection is that a fair way

1367
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:48,120
to frame it out everybody also like what comes straight to mind is a lot of movies both very

1368
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:56,280
popular and even I guess more was seen as high art are using the multiverse concept in their

1369
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:00,440
storytelling now right like everything everywhere all at once the recent movie I was mentioning

1370
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:06,160
to you earlier yeah yeah and then another one I was thinking so obviously it's being used

1371
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:10,760
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the more pop culture reference and then another one

1372
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:15,800
I thought of as you guys are talking was it was a short series by the guy Alex Garland

1373
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:22,200
on Hulu called devs which was about sort of Silicon Valley company making a computer that

1374
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:33,480
sort of predicted sort of predicted how you just I guess some examples that come off the

1375
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:39,760
top my head with the flesh out the cinema aspect of that question yeah so I think actually

1376
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:46,080
one really interesting way and maybe where these places can interact is that maybe especially

1377
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:52,400
speculative fiction to pick up on that can give really really interesting thought experiments

1378
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:58,800
for thinking about metaphysical theories that is good sort of this is again one way in which

1379
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:05,120
I think you can think about the way that metaphysical inquiry goes beyond pure empirical inquiry

1380
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:09,840
because you're thinking about situations that you know by their nature don't exist but nevertheless

1381
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:15,840
might tell you something interesting about the nature of reality if they give problems

1382
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:23,280
for your theory so you know very often when we're talking about the metaphysics of persons

1383
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:27,400
for example somebody's going to mention something that happened in Star Trek the next generation

1384
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:32,360
because here's a thing that happened when there are two rikers after they go through

1385
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:37,320
the transporters and what like which one is the real riker and I think I don't just

1386
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:43,080
think that that is people goofing off I think it's that like interesting questions about

1387
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:51,080
how we think about ourselves can be raised by purely fictional scenarios that allow us

1388
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:55,720
to sort of like filter out the noise of the everyday world a little bit and just think

1389
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:59,040
about like well what is the nature what do we care about when we care about personhood

1390
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:03,960
what do we care about when we care about survival there are also really interesting questions

1391
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:08,640
just about like you know what is the nature of fictional representation like how is it

1392
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:14,120
both like true that Frodo took the ring to Mount Doom and also true that Frodo doesn't

1393
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:17,280
exist because there's no such thing as Hobbits and things like that so like well these are

1394
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:20,960
the kind of puzzles that philosophers worry about so there definitely is like interesting

1395
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,960
overlap.

1396
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:27,960
Great stuff. Alright when I move on I think we want to get through these last two if possible.

1397
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:33,160
Yeah yeah so it's just Ruth and Ena so Ruth wrote a comment a question the comments I

1398
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:38,360
think pretty funny was not a question it was I like the point that those claim to shed

1399
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:42,680
the metaphysics often have the wildest implicit metaphysics I just like to add also that when

1400
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:47,560
I heard that I generally think of Neil deGrasse Tyson because I think it's a fortune a lot

1401
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:52,440
of science communicators I'm kind of resort to those viewpoints I think like him also Lawrence

1402
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:56,720
Krauss I think he's been kind of discredited due to me too but then also Sam Harris a little

1403
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:02,280
bit when he talks about philosophy I kind of tune out because it's not it's not great

1404
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:08,800
anyway to their question they wrote why would metaphysicians need to know physics rather

1405
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:14,720
than chemistry I think as a comment made to the previous question without already assuming

1406
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:21,840
that chemistry reduces the physics which is a hefty assumption.

1407
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:31,360
Any quick answers to that I it doesn't turn to know chemistry and physics you're muted

1408
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:38,800
arcadey you're you're immune but you can stratify it you can have metaphysics of chemistry as

1409
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:45,920
you know it's true that the philosophy of chemistry was a very marginal aspect of the history of

1410
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:51,840
philosophy of science but actually it is an extremely interesting or even history and philosophy of

1411
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:58,960
chemistry so you can certainly have a metaphysics of chemistry and or you can have I do think that

1412
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:07,120
if you take the emergence view you would you would qualify that any claims you make and

1413
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:14,720
concerning the metaphysics in terms of fundamental physics could have limit in other domains so I

1414
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:21,040
think you have two approaches there and that from that point of view just like you can have

1415
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:28,240
metaphysics of biology or the unconsciousness or whatever you know or sociological things I think

1416
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:35,360
you can perfectly well have metaphysics of chemistry or philosophy of chemistry without assuming that

1417
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:42,560
it is reducible to physics even though at some level you can make this assumption it just practically

1418
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:50,240
is not true because a lot of chemical phenomena cannot be explained by in terms of physics in

1419
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:57,440
very practical terms and it has its own history and its own scientific thinking which is very

1420
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:03,280
long going all the back to alchemy and things of that time. Just to pick up on the bit from

1421
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:09,360
risk question I just think was really interesting this this idea of metaphysical inquiry is kind of

1422
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:13,440
inevitable like you just always end up doing it is like even just the very question of whether

1423
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:19,440
metaphysicians need to know metaphysics sorry they do need to know metaphysics whether metaphysicians

1424
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:24,400
need to know physics is itself this really substantial metaphysical question like you just

1425
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:29,920
the annoying thing about this these questions but also kind of the cool thing about them is that

1426
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:37,280
like you you just run into them constantly you can't get away from them. Okay I would also

1427
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:41,920
just like to add I've heard sort of the the same thing talked about physics from mathematicians where

1428
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:47,200
they say oh physics isn't real math is right because usually they nitpick the fact that in physics

1429
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:51,440
you make a lot of assumptions while you shut the pill from the ground up and math so it's the

1430
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:59,120
cycle continues I guess they say and then I guess last but not least so I have to find it on okay

1431
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:04,320
Enoch, Aldina thank you Enoch they wrote in what is the role of language in metaphysics?

1432
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:12,080
Another small question yeah very the beginning there was such an important yeah it's important

1433
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,240
right anyone want to take a shot at that?

1434
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:26,080
Well I maybe we can reference some we made a number of references to sort of the

1435
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:29,520
tradition of analytic philosophy which is all about that question

1436
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:37,200
but by the way I made a reference earlier to Karnaugh and Davidson as people who are

1437
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:42,000
seeking consensus within the discipline I meant Richard Vordi not Donald Davidson

1438
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,960
what I meant in that comment about different how different fields can you rely on sort of

1439
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:52,720
democratic process among your participants to settle on what the truth might be or anyway

1440
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:59,920
what they're striving for the truth but I'm sorry I just didn't object because Walter I think

1441
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:05,120
wanted more of the emphasis in poetry and cinema as inherently inquiries into language and perception

1442
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:09,760
in and of themselves so I think I could kind of add to it to what Enoch was asking and also to

1443
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:13,280
maybe better answer what Walter wrote previously sorry

1444
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:22,560
so anyone else want to say something about linguistics and it's a big topic

1445
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:28,880
Wittgenstein in the end of Treg Thetas my language is my world you know so I think it's

1446
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:34,400
irreducible because there is no language result thought and there is no thought result language

1447
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:40,480
so the language plays a huge role and actually in the history of quantum mechanics there are

1448
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:46,560
people including Reisenberg who reflect that as well as more on the necessity or even common

1449
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:53,120
language that you cannot avoid it you know so I think that that's the but it will be used different

1450
01:55:53,840 --> 01:56:00,640
I'd love to I love the I mentioned of Wittgenstein this context because we've mentioned how so many

1451
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:06,720
people so many thinkers have said they want to do without metaphysics and then develop their own

1452
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:12,560
terrible metaphysics or rely on it anyway I think Wittgenstein is a wonderful and elegant

1453
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:19,840
example of someone who tried his darndest to sort of get rid of metaphysics or any way to be

1454
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:25,920
an anti-metaphysician and yet he's created industry of metaphysics so I which is a lot more elegant

1455
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:32,160
and sophisticated than some of the other folks we've touched on um anyway I want to thank everyone

1456
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:37,680
I think you've had an incredibly stimulating conversation and I'm not surprised to find that

1457
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:44,000
I'd love for it to continue on further I want to thank you all for participating and I hope you

1458
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:50,240
all will consider coming back in the future for other PLX talks to be determined we're going to

1459
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:55,200
be starting up again as I said in the fall and we will be sending out announcements to all of our

1460
01:56:55,200 --> 01:57:00,080
audience members about when that will take place almost certainly sometime in September

1461
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:08,000
anyway thank you all again that was been wonderful thank you Mr. Dope thank you thank you everybody bye bye

1462
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:21,040
it's unmeasable if you say that so how how do we get out of here

1463
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:32,320
you just I'm worried about that but let's talk about it yeah so well yeah at least they they they

1464
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:53,280
attract people

1465
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:06,880
you
