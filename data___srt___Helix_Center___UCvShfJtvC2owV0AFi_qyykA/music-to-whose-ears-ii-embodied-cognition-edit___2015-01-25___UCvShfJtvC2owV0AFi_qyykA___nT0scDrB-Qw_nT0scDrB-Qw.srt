12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,040
documentary for which Helix Center Executive Committee member, Carla Solomon, was a producer.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,600
It tells the remarkable story of the monumental search for the Higgs Boson, the elementary

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,840
force particle that was predicted by the standard model of particle physics.

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,080
Following the morning screening in its entirety, we will have at least one roundtable.

16
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,040
We're working on the possibility of two, but among the participants, producers Carla

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,520

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,720
will again distinguish our roundtable.

27
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,520

65
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,520
to your ears, the quest for 3D recording and other mysteries of sound, in which he was

66
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,960
described as quote, a distinctly modern type engineer, a steed, unquote.

67
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,920

73
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,680
The New York Times observes there's probably no frame wide enough to encompass the creative

74
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,240
output of the pianist Vijay Iyer.

75
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,960

Rade, Rade, am I saying that correctly?

79
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Rade, Rade.

Her research is focused on emotional responses to music and on the perception of melodic

94
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,960
transformation.

95

98
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,960
and motion in tonal space which makes a friendly introduction to the science of music.

99
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,040
Tristan Parrish who is on his way is a composer and sound artist whose work is inspired by

100
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,280
the aesthetic simplicity of math, physics and code.

101
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,040
Wire magazine described his compositions as an austere meeting of electronic and organic.

102
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,680
One bit music, his 2004 release was the first album ever released as a microchip programmed

103
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,800
to synthesize his electronic composition live.

104
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,220
His latest circuit album, One Bit Symphony, has received critical acclaim, New York press

105
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,520
calling it sublime and the Wall Street Journal saying its oscillations have an intense hypnotic

106
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,840
force and a surprising emotional depth.

107
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,800
His award-winning work coupling One Bit Electronics with traditional forms in both music such as

108
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,040
his work active field and observations and visual art in his machine drawings and micro

109
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,320
tonal wall has been presented around the world from sonar and arse electronica to the Museum

110
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,840
of Modern Art and Bit Forms galleries.

111
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:12,000
Without further ado, our panel.

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Well I'll ask what sounds like a stupid question but I would be interested to hear what my

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:37,520
fellow panelists would say if I asked what is music because I don't really know if there

114
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,960
is a stable definition of it.

115
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:47,320
There is no, this is the most amazing art and for me, and a professional musician and

116
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,560
scholar and music technician, music is a sorcery.

117
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,360
It's a magical thing.

118
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,120
We can learn about the foundations of music, about the elements of music, the sources of

119
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:08,080
music but why music affects us so deeply and what ways music is able to deliver not just

120
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,320
emotions and they are not basic emotions, they are complex emotions and even general

121
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
ideas.

122
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,720
This is still, it's a magic.

123
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,560
And the most amazing thing about music is its accessibility.

124
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,000
Everybody understands what music is and music is able to reach everybody.

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,560
It's a truly universal language that has no barriers, it affects everybody.

126
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,280
People with no music education, people with no musical training, people with different

127
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:56,480
cultures are able to understand the heart of music even when they listen to exotic music.

128
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,440
My own research shows that people with no musical training, not only feel with great

129
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,800
precision, the most important elements of music but they also are able to recognize

130
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:17,000
musical styles as a technology for music, musicologists.

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If I was asked to give a definition about this music, kind of a very dry definition,

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,760
I would say music is a distribution of perceived tonal tension along the era of time, artful

133
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
distribution.

134
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,280
You said perceived tonal tension.

135
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:46,920
Yes, because perceived tonal tension, it's the main morphological principle of music and

136
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:55,880
it's so primitive that it's exactly this primitive nature of music communication that

137
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:02,600
makes music available for everybody.

138
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:11,320
And we feel tonal tension on the level of muscle responses.

139
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,400
With their visceral responses, their subconscious, their intuitive responses, we don't need to

140
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,200
be trained, we just need to be born into human society and have normal hearing.

141
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,840
We don't need special training to understand the language of music and the foundations

142
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:37,760
of melodic elements of music that in the physics of sound, this is another important thing

143
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,560
that we are dealing with just direct context section, intersection of the physics of sound

144
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
and human neurobiology.

145
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,200
And of course it's a cultural construct available only to people.

146
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,640
Just to fill you, we started with UJ's question, what is music?

147
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Sorry, I'm...

148
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,640
You're not ready.

149
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,320
Hi, everybody.

150
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,080
Are we kind of all offering our answers?

151
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:20,200
Gosh, well, I'll give you a shot.

152
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,600
I mean, I guess if we take for granted the perception of pitch, then we're talking about

153
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,840
higher level things, like the organization of sound over time and rhythm and these things

154
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:37,360
that probably we all respond to in a variety of different ways, I think that our perception

155
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,440
of music comes from a lot of different interacting things.

156
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,680
So more social, some are physical, some are more cognitive, I'm sure, and some are just

157
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,480
purely aesthetic, whatever.

158
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,280
Maybe that's something...

159
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,120
That's what I took from the last part of what you're talking about, but I might be misinterpreting

160
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,600
it.

161
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,600
But one of the ways that, at least I interact with music a lot and where the music that

162
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,720
I write comes from is finding this intersection between simple patterns, things that we can

163
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:20,720
understand on a very basic cognitive level.

164
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,640
Things like repeating structures, simple rhythms, simple melodies that build up into

165
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,880
forms that are more complex than those parts, but nonetheless based on these very simple

166
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,000
ideas that we can understand.

167
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:44,280
And part of that for me is that that is taps into the part of our experience of the world

168
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,400
where we are attracted to things that we can understand.

169
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:56,840
And so an example of that is if you learn about biology, then you can understand how

170
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,640
the animal form can grow from some simple biological rules, or if you understand physics,

171
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:13,160
and you can understand the sort of more basic ways of building blocks of nature form complex

172
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
things.

173
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,480
And we find beauty in that simplicity.

174
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,480
I think we can connect on a sort of profound way, and clearly I'm just jumping in because

175
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,640
I just ran up from the car, but I think we can connect to these things that we can understand

176
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,600
in a different way than just something that's more aesthetic or more resonant.

177
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,480
I think that when we can understand something, when it gives us something to latch onto,

178
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,960
then we can find some sort of beauty in that.

179
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,000
And that is true in a lot of different art forms and how we see nature, but also true

180
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,320
in the perception of music, I think.

181
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,120
I think I just brought up too many different points there.

182
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:01,400
Well, for me, I see and I understand music like a multi-dimensional experience.

183
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:08,240
For me, music is an experience, which is really, really hard to record.

184
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,320
We do that, right?

185
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:17,160
But we know, unless we developed three-dimensional immersive sound, that music engages so many

186
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,440
different levels of the human being.

187
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,200
And the most important thing, as I'm saying, is an experience, really hard to reproduce

188
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,120
again.

189
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,320
Engaging different parts of the brain, different parts of the body with resonance, the brain

190
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,720
with entrainment, just these two simple basic principles of music, like resonance, like vibration,

191
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,920
the reason really engaging the body in every cell of the body, and entrainment engaging

192
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,520
the brain, right?

193
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,560
So these two elements, for me, are the most important thing.

194
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:57,760
It would talk about more like principles of sound, resonance, and entrainment.

195
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:04,880
But for me, above all, music is a tool for transformation.

196
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,240
A tool is pure technology that has been used for thousands of years in different communities

197
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:18,440
of the world as service to the community for challenges, for really, really go through

198
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,640
daily life.

199
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Why?

200
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Because all these principles, right?

201
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,680
But music has been in cultures through the very first thing.

202
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,880
Sound, basic, before music, is what I want to talk about.

203
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,920
It's the source of life.

204
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
Sounds promote movement.

205
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,680
Sounds really create vibration, and we are vibration.

206
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,120
We were discussing in Atlanta, it's like our favorite relationship with the world when

207
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,160
we were nine months in the womb of the mother.

208
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,240
Our relationship with the world is through sound, is through vibration.

209
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,360
So that's how we codify emotions, that's how we codify language and information.

210
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,280
And it's really interesting because if you pay attention when we were in the womb, our

211
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,840
ears are plucked.

212
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,680
So how we perceive sound?

213
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,320
We perceive sound through vibration, through bone conduction sound.

214
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,920
And then I'm going to do a little experiment with you.

215
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Can I do it?

216
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Sure.

217
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:24,040
So does anybody, can I hear this?

218
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Can you listen?

219
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,800
Can I do something with you?

220
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,040
Do you mind if I put this on your head?

221
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
It's all right?

222
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
You sure?

223
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
Okay.

224
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,400
So let's do this.

225
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,480
Now anybody can hear this?

226
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,680
All right.

227
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:50,160
Can you give us the tone?

228
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:58,960
How is it possible?

229
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,640
Because sound moves through our bones.

230
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,600
Through vibration sound and through our bones connects directly to our inner ear, which

231
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
is you know what?

232
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,520
The cochlea is one of the first, first, first things that is developed in uterus.

233
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,640
To get information through life through sound.

234
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,880
So this is, we are vibrational beings.

235
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,520
And through vibration we codify life.

236
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:33,360
So just to remark these principles, but remind us, remind also this cultural effect of sound

237
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,240
for communities.

238
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:42,320
How sound and rhythm has been always there as a tool for the communities to transform

239
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,760
and go through their life processes.

240
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,920
That's why I understand music.

241
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:56,200
I should confess that I don't have a faintest idea what music is on a fundamental level.

242
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:03,400
And I have even a problem drawing a line between perception of sound, which is you

243
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,040
were describing almost primordial activity and music itself.

244
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,880
And that line seems to me very culturally conditioned.

245
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,280
What is a simple tone for you could be music with somebody else?

246
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,080
What is a core tone singer in Arabia could make somebody one out of the room, could charm

247
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,280
somebody else?

248
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:33,120
So these are all, I find the line shifts so much that from a scientific level, I can

249
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,600
give a definition which is almost banal that music is sound that gives someone pleasure,

250
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,160
to some extent, who moves you.

251
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,960
And that's really not very prevalent, doesn't tell you much.

252
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,800
But only then I can have a definition.

253
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,520
Anything beyond that is so culturally conditioned, so complex, so beautiful and so powerful.

254
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,680
And that it kind of evades pinpointing as a definition.

255
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:08,600
And particularly enchanted or terribly interested in how humans interact with the spatial aspect

256
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,800
of the sound.

257
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,320
And it's interesting because we experience sound on a daily basis, not just as pitch,

258
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,520
rhythm, melody, extent in time, repetition, and so on, timbre.

259
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,840
We experience it as localized in space somewhere or moving in space somewhere.

260
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,280
Yet it doesn't, in music, because we have limitation in performance, we cannot make

261
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,560
violin fly around the room.

262
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:42,680
So it seems to be a limited extent to which spatialization has been used in composition.

263
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,840
To give you an example of what I think, why I think spatial aspect is terribly important

264
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,120
in music and one component that now with technology can be for the first time really used as part

265
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,640
of the palette of the musician.

266
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:03,240
Imagine waking up in the morning nicely to the sound of a bird song right outside your

267
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,880
window.

268
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:12,160
Very nicely we all love bird songs and composers wrote great music based on bird songs.

269
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,480
So that's one day.

270
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:22,040
Now imagine the same exact experience, the same bird, the same melody, and the same

271
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,520
melody wake up that you go through except this time the bird is inside the room with

272
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
you.

273
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,840
And it would be very unnerving because first your mind tells you from the river, from the

274
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,520
acoustics of the room, you know right away your brain knows that way there's a bird trapped

275
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,000
in the room.

276
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So there's an anxiety being trapped with a wild animal is not something, even a bird

277
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,320
can be threatening.

278
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:55,560
So on one day the experience is that of musical experience that's blunning, that's very comforting.

279
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:03,360
On the next day with that bird trapped in the room the spatial aspect of the sound which

280
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,480
is the only thing that has changed can be terrifying, can create anxiety, you have a

281
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,800
bird trap in your room.

282
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:19,040
So I'm very interested in how the spatial aspect of the sound can tremendously color

283
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,680
your connection or your experience of the musicality of the sound.

284
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,640
And I'm very interested, I'm not a musician, I'm a scientist, I study the interaction

285
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,440
of humans with how humans perceive sound, especially how humans perceive the localization

286
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
of sound.

287
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,520
And I'm very interested from sitting among musicians to hear how if I give you today a

288
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:46,080
technique where you can project sound anywhere in space and play it back for your listeners

289
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,400
anywhere in space, which we can do almost right now for the first time using advanced

290
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,800
computers and technologies, how would you use it as a musician?

291
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,800
So that's the next question I want to put around the table as musicians, how would you

292
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,040
use such a pillar, such a tool?

293
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,440
Imagine the entire space is now your canvas, so you're not limited to just pitch rhythm

294
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,720
you know melody and so on, but now you can say I want to violin to come from infinity,

295
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:20,080
come whisper in my ear, fly off and then I want somebody to whisper my other ear song

296
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,600
as opposed to sing always from a speaker in front of you.

297
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,320
So, at least for me, that's something that I'm specifically not trying, I'm trying to

298
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,880
do the opposite of that in my own work, I'm trying to make us very aware of the sound

299
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:42,920
source as a point in space coming from a physical material so that if you play a note on a pitch

300
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:50,240
on a violin that we are as listeners very aware of this string vibrating in space as

301
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,040
bowed by this hair of this bow with a little bit of friction and the resonance of the body

302
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,600
of the violin amplifying that sound and spreading outwards from a location over there coming

303
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
towards us.

304
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,640
But that is the stationization in his home.

305
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:15,040
But it's one that's extremely explicit and very direct and very much tied into our experience

306
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:21,000
of sound, like you said about that we typically think about sound as coming from points or

307
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,240
when it's from the ocean we kind of think of it as a spatial thing but still very much

308
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,600
delineated in space.

309
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:35,480
And for whatever reason, this is just me and I'm not meaning to close off your inquiry

310
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:42,360
at all, but I'm interested in this sort of separation almost.

311
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,920
A separation that just makes us more aware of what we're experiencing, this kind of,

312
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:57,200
I guess is the idea that the piece of music for me is, and this is why I think live sound

313
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,920
is so important as opposed to recording for instance, is that the piece of music is an

314
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,400
experience that's unfolding by the means of physics in space with us as listeners and

315
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:16,160
our experience of that music is very much tied to the sound production in space.

316
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:33,000
Would it be fair to say that in a sense your one bit music sort of underscores the aspects

317
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,920
of the embodied music cognition by disembodying it in a certain sense?

318
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:44,160
Well, yeah, I should say I work actually a lot with electronics even though I'm interested

319
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,920
in acoustic instruments, but the way I work with electronics is very low level.

320
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,800
I use this one bit waveforms which are just on and off, also, of electricity that make

321
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,880
the speaker membrane move in and out like this and create sound.

322
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,120
It's a very, very primitive approach to electronic sound.

323
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,400
And a lot of that is to make us aware of the speaker as an instrument.

324
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:16,080
And I would call that embodied and I'd even maybe go a step forward to say that it's

325
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,960
trying to make us aware of how the electronics are even working, that the more we can see

326
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,440
that system is something very mechanical and physical, the less magic it has, and the

327
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,880
more we can kind of be connected to it experientially.

328
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:41,840
But that's really just my approach, which is this very kind of concrete approach.

329
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:49,800
But in experiencing the sound, the listener is listening the sound that has been reflected

330
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,840
off surfaces around him or her reaching their ear.

331
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,320
So the reverb is part of the experience.

332
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,080
But that's what I'm referring to, being able to control that or use it as part of your

333
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,520
own palette, and not actively you're not when you compose the one bit music.

334
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:13,760
But to what extent you feel that the entire spatial aspect of the reproduction is important

335
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
to the listener?

336
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,080
Yeah, well, it's very important.

337
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,280
But for me, that's an aspect of the performance of a piece of music in a space.

338
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,520
And like us in this room hearing our voices reflect...

339
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,880
That's very informal for acoustic music, production is to reproduce the reverb of a room.

340
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,160
And when you have a 3D audio technique to do that, you can then create the illusion that

341
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,400
you are in a real space or actually produce a real space, which for the first time now

342
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
can be done.

343
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:47,000
Well, it's really interesting because my approach to music is always from traditions, traditional

344
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,040
music, but always music and sound happens in space, always.

345
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:58,400
Yeah, I want to tell something about the space in music.

346
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,840
So on one hand, we are dealing with acoustics.

347
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,320
And acoustics is about vibration and some medium it could be.

348
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,240
Air or water, it could go through metal, through bone.

349
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,680
And this is the basically space of acoustics, of the physical sound.

350
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,760
But when we are talking about music, as we all understand, so this is a pitch being something

351
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,360
which is made of melodies and harmonious, we discuss very different space.

352
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,120
It's a space of tonal relationships.

353
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:39,320
And it's kind of very, very separated from acoustics because you can take the same melody,

354
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,600
let's say, Mary had a little lamp.

355
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,360
Somebody could start playing it on violin and other person would finish it singing.

356
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:55,720
So the timbers differ, violin could be on a radio and somebody would finish it on the

357
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,200
radio, so physical space is different.

358
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,440
But the melody is the same.

359
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,640
It has, it's an object, it's a melodic shape, which can be divided between different players

360
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,920
and it can be produced in different spaces.

361
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:18,760
But still we feel it is something united because this melody exists in tonal space.

362
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:29,280
And not long time ago, there was a very interesting book written by a very interesting person.

363
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:36,480
They can serve as a philosopher, Rogers Groton, who, the book has named the Stégixo music.

364
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,440
Rogers Groton, he's not only author of more than 40 books, mostly on philosophy, he's

365
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,600
a conscientious philosopher.

366
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,240
But he's also a composer of two operas, Stégix and Prague.

367
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,400
So in this book, he reminded about so-called acasmatic space.

368
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:04,200
This word came from ancient Greece, acasmaticus, that was the name for the students of Pythagoras.

369
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:15,320
Rogers used to lecture from behind the screen, so not to distract their attention, so they

370
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,000
will listen to them.

371
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,480
So when we listen to music, we listen to shapes, to ideas, we go into this special space which

372
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
transcends acoustics.

373
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:36,440
It's not just sound production, it's not just sound events, those sound events that

374
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:45,600
they came together into melodies and harmonic sequences thanks to special forces, forces

375
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,560
of tonal attraction.

376
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:53,640
And what is amazing about music, it's actually a fantastic thing about music, that the music

377
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:00,720
we are doing, the phenomenal space of tones of phenomenal gravity, because the main thing

378
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:09,080
about tonal system of reference, which is just musical scale, that the tones differ in

379
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:16,080
their frequencies, and this is acoustical characteristics, but they differ in psychophysics, they differ

380
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,800
in the degree of attraction to tonal center.

381
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:26,800
It's very easy to illustrate, may I?

382
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,240
I have to go to the piano just one second to make it every particular.

383
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:50,220
Alright, I would like to bow in my

384
00:31:50,220 --> 00:32:09,520
So, if you have just seven basic elements, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

385
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,640
just seven basic elements, all the incredible wealth of music that we know today.

386
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,860
It's made just seven basic elements and they are repeated again and again because space

387
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,380
of music is organized cyclically.

388
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,180
It's the same seven names.

389
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,260
This is how we got 88 keys on the piano.

390
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:36,220
So playing with just seven notes, basic elements, we are able to create incredible compositions

391
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,140
and incredible structures.

392
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:47,740
And we feel motion in music because we have stable tones and unstable tones.

393
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,380
This is unstable.

394
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,220
This is stable.

395
00:32:54,220 --> 00:33:02,220
So all we have in music, it's a playing with tonal attraction.

396
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,300
We are within the field of tonal gravity.

397
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,900
It's gravitational forces.

398
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:15,100
And this is so simple to perceive that music is available for everybody.

399
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Already a newborn have different patterns of brain activation for dissonant and consonant.

400
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:34,060
Already two months old recognized that this is pleasant to the air and this is not.

401
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:39,220
We are born with musical expertise.

402
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,020
And when they listen to music, it's tonal space.

403
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:53,180
I guess I find this particular construction to be pretty specific to Western culture and

404
00:33:53,180 --> 00:34:05,700
Western culture.

405
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:18,700
And I think you would probably agree and perhaps you would too.

406
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:25,340
There are a lot of other ways of putting music together and also a lot of ways of experiencing

407
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,180
music.

408
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:32,620
I think what you are calling dissonant.

409
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,740
It was to hide in.

410
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:42,660
It was less dissonant to Mozart and even less dissonant to Brahms and certainly not really

411
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,460
dissonant at all to someone like Schoenberg.

412
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:55,860
And there is also the possibility of incorporating a certain amount of tension into what you

413
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:03,500
might call a sound that produces pleasure, which is how you define music.

414
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:10,580
So in the same way that with food we can accommodate a certain amount of bitterness in the course

415
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:19,620
of a meal, if I had a shot of espresso, which I just did, even though I am not acting like

416
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:27,380
I did, that I did.

417
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,620
That can be pleasurable too.

418
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:36,900
This thing that we might perceive as tense is actually useful at the moment.

419
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,660
And I think also stability is relative.

420
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:47,780
I mean if you listen to blues, it has dominant chords as stable entities.

421
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:53,660
And if you listen to someone like Phonius Monk, he will incorporate roughness like the

422
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:59,620
auditory experience of tones rubbing against each other as part of the aesthetic.

423
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,780
And that can be, we can tolerate a certain amount of roughness and in fact even enjoy

424
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:11,100
it in the course of musical experience.

425
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:18,500
I guess I have been, you know, I am thinking back to my first, my opening question because

426
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,260
I have been trying to see if there is a way that we are all talking about the same thing.

427
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:28,700
And I am not actually sure that we are yet.

428
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:33,620
It is not, we don't even have to exactly.

429
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:39,980
But my, I suppose in particular we have been talking about music as something that happens

430
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:46,780
to us, that we perceive or receive, which means that generally it seems that we think

431
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:56,620
of music as not our own doing, but somehow coming from somebody else.

432
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:03,860
And so I guess I just think back to, well a friend of mine Gary Tomlinson, he is a professor

433
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:09,980
at Yale and he has a book about to come out, I think it comes out in a week or so, called

434
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,580
Musicking the First Million Years.

435
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:21,260
And as you know, we as a species are only a tenth of that in terms of our own, you know,

436
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,620
the amount of time that we have been on this planet as homo sapiens.

437
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,180
So what could he possibly be talking about?

438
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,980
And these are the kinds of questions that I am interested in because if we are going

439
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:40,020
to start making assertions about the cognitive universals of music like that everybody in

440
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:47,340
the world hears something as dissonant or something like that, we have to make sure that

441
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,140
we are really talking about everybody in the world.

442
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:56,900
And for me it makes more sense to start from the opposite end, which is what must it have

443
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:07,780
been like to be not yet human for example, but find yourself walking early hominids.

444
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:13,580
You know when you go to the Museum of Natural History, the sort of canonical scene of early

445
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:18,660
hominids or as a little nuclear family walking through the woods or something like that,

446
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,660
right?

447
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:28,540
And then you start hearing each other walking in sync, like you hear the footsteps starting

448
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:34,340
to synchronize and then could that be the beginning of what we are calling music?

449
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:42,660
In other words, is music actually come from not just sound of anything but sound of us?

450
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,620
Because that to me is what makes the most sense.

451
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:52,580
If we are going to even use this word, which is a very fuzzy word, and I mean for me the

452
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,620
biggest problem is I don't know where music stops.

453
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:03,620
If we say it starts in a certain place, like it starts with sound or it starts with tonal

454
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:08,220
gravity or it starts with rhythm, where does it end?

455
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,740
What is the other side?

456
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:18,180
Is there an experience that is not music?

457
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:23,860
And that is actually there is no answer to that because it is going to entirely a cultural

458
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,580
decision about what the bound view of this thing that we call music is.

459
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:32,220
In fact it is bound up with our name for it, you know we say this is music.

460
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,020
But the other thing that is bound up with is that we in the last hundred years have gotten

461
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,940
used to receiving music without seeing it.

462
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:48,140
So basically we have in our midst like in everyday life the equivalent of our acoustmatic music,

463
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,060
which is what we call recorded music, you know.

464
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,300
And that has only been around for a hundred years and if you think about music in the

465
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,860
less million years, the less even a hundred thousand years that humans have been here,

466
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,820
a hundred years doesn't make, doesn't have any significance, evolutionarily speaking.

467
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:10,500
So we evolved to something that we were before we had recorded music, which was to hear each

468
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,740
other making sound, right?

469
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,100
Not just to hear sound in general, but to hear each other.

470
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,620
That's what we're really good at doing.

471
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,540
I mean we've evolved to be really good at hearing each other.

472
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,940
We can hear footsteps.

473
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,860
If I hear footsteps I can tell if it's a man or a woman most of the time.

474
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,540
I mean that's statistically true that most of the time you can tell.

475
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:39,100
In fact that's so true that when people audition for the symphony they also audition behind

476
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,940
a curtain and not only that, but they put a carpet down so that they can't hear your

477
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:53,460
footsteps because it was found that people who you know decide who's the best in these

478
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,820
auditions were somehow being implicitly sexist.

479
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:03,860
So they actually conceal gender in order to get the best players.

480
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:09,220
So that's how good we are at hearing each other, that we can hear properties of somebody's

481
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:13,420
body just by hearing them walking for example.

482
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,860
We're also really good at hearing our environments.

483
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:26,220
My graduate advisor had a moment in the early 70s where he got to hang out with Stevie Wonder.

484
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:32,980
And at the time Stevie Wonder was making Intervision's or Talking Book of one of those albums.

485
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:41,500
And so my friend got to go with Stevie Wonder to the head of what was at the time Columbia

486
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:48,340
Records which is at the top of the Sony building and they wrote an elevator up to the top floor

487
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:54,540
and you exit the elevator into this pyramid shaped atrium.

488
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:01,220
So Stevie Wonder comes out of the elevator and he says, you just stood there for a second

489
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,580
and he said there's something up this room.

490
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:08,620
It's like the walls are triangular or something like that.

491
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:15,780
So that's how good we are at hearing space, you know, hearing the space around us.

492
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,660
But that's partly because we've evolved to perceive each other.

493
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:27,220
I want to talk to many things I feel strongly about and mostly very much what you said.

494
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:33,340
One thing you mentioned early on when commenting on Marina's little experiment is the fact

495
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:39,460
that what we perceive as something let's say an unstable or atonal can evolve taste wise,

496
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,060
can evolve across even the same culture technically going from Hado to Schoenberg.

497
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,300
But also as I said earlier can evolve across culturally.

498
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,620
It could be something dissonant and nice.

499
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:58,460
But there are turns out going to some recent research some very, very universal feelings

500
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:03,660
we get from some sounds which are almost common to all of us, we'll have to do with our revolution.

501
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:09,300
For example, it's been shown quite recently with research on how we interact with reverberation,

502
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:15,300
late reflections that if I take, if I give you headphones or if I can simulate 3D sound

503
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:20,140
from speakers and simulate the sound of very early reflections.

504
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:24,980
In other words, make it click and make it sound as if it's coming to you very early

505
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,660
from the reflections come to you very early.

506
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,900
You will be very anxious.

507
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,380
All of us will be very anxious.

508
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:37,100
Almost 100% of subjects feel anxiety of some sort because that simulates the sound of what

509
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,300
happens if you're trapped in a corner.

510
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:44,580
And your brain knows that this is as humans have to evolve in getting away from danger

511
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,820
that we are trapped.

512
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:51,180
Now if I take you to an anicoid chamber and I have one in my lab or if you're going

513
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:55,820
in an anicoid chamber or it's similar if you stay in the wild in the open, there are

514
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,140
no reflections.

515
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:06,340
And there almost all humans have a sense of enhanced alertness or you know, we are

516
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,340
tens alertness.

517
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,500
It has to do with the fact that we are exposed to danger.

518
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,980
We don't get any reflections.

519
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,620
That means we are totally open.

520
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,940
So holes are designed to have just the right amount of reverb.

521
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,780
What I'm getting to is something you touched on is that where is the limit of what music

522
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,780
is.

523
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:26,660
If I define music as simply as I designed earlier, which is a sound that gives us some

524
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:32,620
kind of feelings or emotions or pleasure, then it seems to me the limit is almost nowhere.

525
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:39,100
It's almost to the point where even a verb by itself can just the reverb of this click

526
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,980
in the room only open can give us anxiety, all of us, or give us pleasure.

527
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,020
And I found that tremendous that we have these fundamental mechanisms.

528
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,340
Probably have to do with the fact that we have to survive or worry about predators coming

529
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,580
at us and feeling trapped or not trapped.

530
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,380
Absolutely, we react to auditory stimuli.

531
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,700
That's true.

532
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,620
Just I think we are discussing about musikas.

533
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,580
And there are different directions.

534
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:09,420
For example, I was a music by Exynakis, which was very popular recently.

535
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:15,780
And he used random numbers to create something really interesting.

536
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,460
And some of his creations are very beautiful.

537
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:24,500
But this is not exactly what we would tell, name music, because still today we understand

538
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,340
music, something which is made of melodies and harmonies, something you would think to

539
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:33,860
be a child or recognize its familiar melody.

540
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,300
Music really gives people pleasure, by the way.

541
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:42,740
Music activates biological reward pleasure, nuclear circumference, which also reacts to

542
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,980
sex and food.

543
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:48,220
Even sad music, because it gives us pleasure.

544
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,220
Even Zanakus?

545
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,220
He used random numbers to cast it.

546
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:56,940
No, I'm asking you, does Zanakus give us pleasure?

547
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,860
I found it interesting.

548
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,180
But that's not what I'm asking you.

549
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,740
I'm asking you to spend it.

550
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,740
I don't know, but it is.

551
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,100
Yes, it still did research.

552
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:11,980
I think what happened, because I was bitten by a scientific bug, so I'm looking for precise

553
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,980
data.

554
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:18,820
So when we're talking about melodic universals, and when I say the universals, it's not just

555
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,060
conjecture.

556
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:25,740
It means that people around the world recognize octave, which is the first overtone of harmonic

557
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,060
series.

558
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:35,300
And octave to just a thousand years ago was sometimes substituted with fifth, quinta,

559
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,900
which is the next overtone.

560
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,700
My point is that melodic elements are defined by the physics of sound.

561
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:47,460
If you have two harmonic series, two different thoughts, which have the beginning of the harmonic

562
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,380
series overlapped, the strongest overtones overlapped.

563
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:57,180
The appreciative does dissonant, most likely it's related to the neural cost of processing.

564
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,180
It's easy to process.

565
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:02,140
It makes this event silent.

566
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,340
And also another thing.

567
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,460
Can I just ask?

568
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:14,980
When you ask someone, do you perceive this as dissonant, even in a scientific setting?

569
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:18,340
There's already culture around them to figure out what that even means.

570
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,340
Yeah, but octave is not culture.

571
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:25,300
Well, octave is octave around the world, even for Australians that do not have melodies.

572
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,540
I mean, I'm a britianist.

573
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,180
I don't want to be obnoxious.

574
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:33,740
It's just they don't have melodies and harmonies that European music has, but they do recognize

575
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,060
octave.

576
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:39,980
My point is that melodic elements, they are not ordered by somebody.

577
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,460
It's a discovery of human mind.

578
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,220
It's discovered through all visceral reactions.

579
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:53,140
And as far as tonal tension and release, we know about music by Schonberg and his students,

580
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,820
Bergen Webern, who wrote the 12th tone music.

581
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:03,100
Basically they try to escape the dictatura of tonal tension.

582
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,620
In the music they use noble technique of polyphony.

583
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:12,220
They would take, create a melody made of all chromatic tones, never repeating any of the

584
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:17,620
tones, so to avoid any tonal attraction, any preference, any hierarchy.

585
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,900
And they would work with this series.

586
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:26,140
They would invert it, they used it in different timbers, they would, when collapse it, nobody

587
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,620
sings those melodies.

588
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,300
It's interesting music.

589
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,380
But when we talk about blues, it's still tension and release.

590
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:38,300
If you start to play for us, we would immediately recognize that this sounds less tense than

591
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,300
this.

592
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,300
That's Marina.

593
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:49,780
I mean, if we go more than 500 years ago, we will not even talk about music about this

594
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,780
in these terms.

595
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:56,460
We will not talk at any time, we just do it.

596
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,460
And that will be enough.

597
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,220
What do you mean 100 years ago?

598
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:07,980
That what you're talking about is basic on an agreement of 100 years ago of Western music.

599
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,180
I don't think so.

600
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,180
I think it's a discovery.

601
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,420
And I want to talk about the results of the studies.

602
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:20,860
It's my personal study in perception of tonal modulation, which is discovery of European

603
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:21,860
tradition.

604
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:26,340
It's a very sophisticated thing for music theories and it's nothing but people with

605
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,100
no music education.

606
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,460
What I found, the people from different countries from around the world, they listened to harmonic

607
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:37,460
progressions that medulate to different degrees and they perfectly recognize what is.

608
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,460
There is no modulation.

609
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,820
I'm not in many, many cultures and musical cultures.

610
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,820
Yeah, but my point is that European tradition, it's not an agreement.

611
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,540
It's a discovery that became accepted.

612
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,780
But okay, that's great.

613
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,780
It's European tradition.

614
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:54,820
But we have other continents in the world that create music.

615
00:49:54,820 --> 00:50:00,620
And probably European tradition is based on all this music that has been done for 100,000

616
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,620
years ago.

617
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:06,260
Let's say 50,000 years ago, after today, this is the conservative estimate that music

618
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,140
exists at least for 50,000 years.

619
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,140
So perfect.

620
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:16,780
So then we have 15,000 years of music, of doing it, of sharing it, of being in circles like

621
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,780
this.

622
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,820
We have to pay attention how music was performed.

623
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:26,660
And for me this is the key because music was a part of the community, probably always

624
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:32,740
in circle for certain, certain, certain objecties to promote, to promote to the individual and

625
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,140
to the community.

626
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:38,300
So first of all, the music production and recording scenes 100 years ago, the stage in

627
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,140
music for me is the most unnatural thing for music, the stage.

628
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,140
You're not alone.

629
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:48,660
Glenn, who did not like to perform stage Victor, did not want to be seen when he was performed.

630
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,660
Exactly.

631
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,260
So I think you promoted a great question.

632
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,260
What is music?

633
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:58,180
And I agree we have to speak the same language because if not, we are lost in concepts.

634
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,260
And for me, music is not even a concept.

635
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,260
It's not a concept.

636
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,260
We are trying to really...

637
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,740
It's a leading tradition.

638
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:10,140
It describes something that has been existing before us maybe.

639
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,580
Sound has been before us.

640
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:20,420
And we just jump into this pause of life, of this vibrational field that then we, as humans,

641
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:26,500
we start to pick up some elements from there and we just start creating music for what?

642
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,620
For me the question is, we do music for what?

643
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:33,660
But the key is that we do music for 15,000 years ago till now.

644
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:39,980
With years like with 30 years one tone, I can demonstrate here, you know, to really

645
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:46,580
complex harmonies because the human existence evolve and the music evolve with it.

646
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:52,580
But we cannot just explain music as the last 100 years ago.

647
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,780
Because music is something that comes from human nature.

648
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,940
And I think it's really interesting what you're talking about.

649
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,300
It's like, what is about pause?

650
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,300
What is this?

651
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:10,820
There is no harmony here.

652
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,740
There is no tona progression.

653
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,740
This is pause.

654
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,740
It's rhythm.

655
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,740
We can discuss if this is part of music or not.

656
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,980
I think it's one of the elements of music.

657
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:22,780
But what is true is that in many traditions ago, this is a chord.

658
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,940
They were doing music with elements.

659
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,940
With each community, what do we have?

660
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,940
We have a stone.

661
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,220
We start creating pause.

662
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,300
For what?

663
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,700
Because maybe we have a pause.

664
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,540
We can be together in a space and that will promote something in us.

665
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,340
Maybe a sense of security.

666
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:44,820
Maybe to dance because if we attend, each tradition has rhythm for what is the rhythm.

667
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,460
I wonder if...

668
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:53,020
I'll almost go back to actually what you were talking about in terms of our pace, our walking,

669
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,020
our steps and stuff.

670
00:52:54,020 --> 00:53:01,220
That was so interesting because it's something I've thought about before in terms of mathematics,

671
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:07,060
actually, is that our experience in the world, as human beings, is based...

672
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,460
How can I say this?

673
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,860
Like walking is very intrinsic to us.

674
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:16,820
It's ordering time into these discrete steps, whether they're uneven or uneven or whatever.

675
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,100
There's sort of step zero, step one.

676
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,260
Something might be like 10 steps away.

677
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,540
We also have our breathing.

678
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:31,260
That's this discrete unit-based activity, which is very different, for instance, than when

679
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:37,140
you have a bird soaring through the sky from one tree to the next, which is not the same

680
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:43,220
way we subdivide our entire experience of the world, which to me connects to rhythm.

681
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:48,820
But then I was also thinking about how maybe we can connect rhythm and pitch in terms of

682
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:53,900
just multiplying multiplications of some event.

683
00:53:53,900 --> 00:54:01,620
If a fundamental tone is a certain frequency, how we find multiples of that, the overtone

684
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:09,260
series or mathematical ratios of that to be pleasing or displeasing, etc.

685
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:13,220
The simple ratios, more pleasing, more stable, etc.

686
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,380
There's something true also about rhythm.

687
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,940
The rhythm you played, for instance, was very regular that was based on some sort of unit

688
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:27,020
and that had these kind of like meter that fell into meter that changed, but was still

689
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:33,100
this kind of grouping into some number of elements or something.

690
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:42,700
I think that in both of these worlds, I think that evolutionarily clearly it's tapping into

691
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,340
the things that we relate to.

692
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:50,900
I think a lot of it comes from our need to understand where sound comes from and to understand

693
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,060
the voice of your family, which is based on pitch.

694
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,060
I mean, you need to know pitch.

695
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:00,500
I'm sure there are so many, so many evolutionary reasons for us being attracted to understanding

696
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,500
certain sound.

697
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,660
I don't remember what I was going with that.

698
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:12,660
I mean, that starts to finally get to the title of this conversation.

699
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:18,100
The reason that you've been listening to more about rhythm is to know from both scientists

700
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:22,660
and musicians about the mind in bodily action.

701
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:28,980
I mean, because you're describing something about the movement of the body, the sensory

702
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,480
elements that you're receiving.

703
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,820
What about those aspects of your experience of music?

704
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:45,940
Well, you know, I go back often to this quote by one of my favorite pianists.

705
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,420
His name is Cecil Taylor.

706
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:54,020
There was a film called Imagine the Sound that came out in the early 80s, and it opens

707
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,820
with this line.

708
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:59,860
It's an interview with Mr. Taylor.

709
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:07,260
He says, well, to me, what music is is everything that you do.

710
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,060
So he grounds it in it.

711
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,780
Not everything you hear, but everything you do.

712
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,660
So he grounds it in action.

713
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:22,020
And of course, our actions are, you could say, constrained in the sense that there are only

714
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:25,140
certain things that we can do with our bodies.

715
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:28,900
There's only so fast you can walk.

716
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,940
We don't walk at 10 hertz.

717
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:40,020
We walk closer to one or two hertz, right, in terms of cycles per second, right?

718
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:43,700
We don't breathe at 10 hertz.

719
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:50,620
We breathe at one or less than half a hertz or more like a tenth of a hertz if you're

720
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,220
meditating.

721
00:56:52,220 --> 00:57:01,540
So these kind of create these natural constraints on action which are temporal and then grouping

722
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:10,500
those actions like you say in ways that are either regular or not, but that we can synchronize.

723
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:18,340
Because I guess for me, if it's about everything that you do, who's the you, first of all?

724
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,460
It's all of us, right?

725
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:24,340
So it's everything that we do together as well, which means like our ability to synchronize

726
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:33,580
our actions, which is so fundamental to music making and music listening is that well, the

727
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:39,700
fact that we can actually generate a pulse and then have everybody clap that pulse together,

728
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:45,740
for example, and then that we can sing in unison and these kinds of things.

729
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:52,020
I saw this one paper, this scientific paper about, you know, there's a lot of speculative

730
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,340
origins about music.

731
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,820
Like, why are we even able to do this?

732
00:57:55,820 --> 00:58:03,100
And one idea was that if I clap by myself, it's only as loud as I can clap, but if we're

733
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:08,620
able to clap in unison, then it suddenly twice as loud, which means it reaches twice the

734
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:13,700
distance, which is four times the area, which is four times as many people.

735
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,140
So suddenly it's this massive communicative leap because we can do things together.

736
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:23,340
You can reach more people and we can synchronize more.

737
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:31,100
So that to me seems like it's so grounded in us doing things together that I don't see

738
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,820
how we can talk about music without thinking about it in social terms.

739
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:39,820
It's really interesting that we were talking about also about grouping the pulse, which

740
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,700
for me is eternal.

741
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,420
The pulse is always there.

742
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,860
We just can open to listen to the pulse, but we are pulse.

743
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:50,540
I mean, our heart is pulsating, but also there is something pulsating.

744
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:56,780
Then how we organize the pulse is the key for starting to talk about, which are the cycles

745
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:01,860
because the pulse is eternal, kum, kum, kum, but then depending on how we organize that

746
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:08,260
pulse into cycles, then we're going to be able to breathe and walk.

747
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:13,140
And through the breathe, then for me melody starts to happen.

748
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,260
So for me this is like the key of music.

749
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,660
It's like this pulse that is eternal that is always accessible.

750
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:22,060
And if it's steady, we can just create anything.

751
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:28,060
But then that cycle that we decide is going to generate the breath and from the breath

752
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,860
the melody.

753
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:30,860
And that's it.

754
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,820
So then when we all come together, you want to do guys like in the experiment, maybe doing

755
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,140
something.

756
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,900
So let's just do this.

757
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,860
Right?

758
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:46,260
So this is just like an entrant like pulse, as it's always right there.

759
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:51,900
So as he said, if we just start, for example, doing...

760
00:59:51,900 --> 01:00:00,380
Okay, now what is the cycle?

761
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:07,780
So you see how fast we get into it without not even thinking about it.

762
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:11,260
But then if we start adding the melody, just would be the way that we breathe.

763
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:17,580
I like to understand that each country, the difference about music is different ways

764
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,580
of breathing.

765
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:21,820
It's different with breath, you know.

766
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:22,820
And rhythms is...

767
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,900
Each culture has a different rhythm, you know.

768
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,700
But I believe that also there is like underneath the roots, there is a common rhythm and a

769
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:33,620
common pulse that we can really all get together and really communicate.

770
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:40,140
So maybe a better title for this would have been embodied cognition and embedded cognition

771
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:44,180
in the sense that it's not only about the sensory motor of the individual, but the social

772
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,180
connection that...

773
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,180
I believe that is a social...

774
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,980
That cognition is embedded also in the interaction.

775
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:49,980
But it's a social...

776
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:58,300
It's a very interesting part of the social communication between humans that has not involved

777
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,300
ideas.

778
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:04,820
I mean, one thing music is miserable at doing, which I find remarkable, is communicating

779
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:05,820
ideas.

780
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:11,060
Stravinsky said music is incapable of communicating ideas.

781
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:14,300
By ideas I mean something not like feeling or emotion.

782
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,260
For example, let's take an idea.

783
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:19,180
Let's say child labor is abhorrent.

784
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,700
I can write a poem for trade out no problem.

785
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:29,420
I can write a painting showing child labor somewhere in the powers of some factory in

786
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:34,380
India and make you revolt in the new feeling of injustice.

787
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,660
I can make a movie, I can make a...

788
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:43,820
But try to make a symphony that portrays the sentence child labor is abhorrent.

789
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:44,820
It's very hard.

790
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:45,820
Let me ask you.

791
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:46,820
And I find that spectacular.

792
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:53,100
It points to the visceral power of music, what you are talking about.

793
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:56,220
None of us mention ideas, by the way, which I think is natural.

794
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:01,700
We don't think of music as a little paragraph in the New York Times can portray more ideas

795
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,340
than all of Beethoven's non-sympany.

796
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:11,940
Yet we all think they are incredibly powerful.

797
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:17,980
You said something using your voice in rhythm and with pitch.

798
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:20,700
And you then said that that wasn't music.

799
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:26,820
And so that involves you having drawn a line about this is outside of music.

800
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,980
Me saying something is not music.

801
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,140
So you're saying that speech is not music.

802
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,420
And that to me is not so clear a distinction.

803
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,220
You're making a distinction about sonorous human action.

804
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:42,660
I'm using my early, very simplistic definition of music as sounds which interact with us.

805
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:46,100
Of course, once you put speech in the middle of that line, this is why I started saying

806
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,100
I really have no clue what music is from the beginning.

807
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:52,620
And I diversed myself on any really good knowledge of the whole business, especially

808
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,780
in front of musicians.

809
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:59,660
But once you start putting speech and tonality, of course I'm making, I'm using these.

810
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,740
But I'm talking, can you imagine just using pure sounds?

811
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:06,620
You can probably portray ideas, especially if it's a cultural context.

812
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:10,620
But it's not the most efficient way of all forms, I think.

813
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,020
That's one of the middle ground's most code.

814
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:20,260
Which is like using rhythm specifically to encode information.

815
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:28,900
And I mean, I think on a working level, I do agree that they're, I don't want to get

816
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,100
too caught up in this part of the conversation.

817
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:37,900
But I do think that there is sort of like the absolute truth of what is music.

818
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:42,100
And I cannot argue with the entirely open end-endness of that.

819
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:47,460
But I do think that culturally in 2015 or whatever.

820
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,420
On the Upper East Side.

821
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:53,260
We can, like probably there's a consensus about what music is.

822
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:57,940
And written, spoken word does not necessarily fall into that.

823
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:02,860
Which basically, or at the very least we can talk about music that includes language or

824
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:06,780
something that specifically has identifiable meaning in music that doesn't.

825
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,420
Maybe we could at least not say that it's only, that's the only kind of music.

826
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:19,620
And at least for me as a composer, I am really not interested in communicable narrative through

827
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:20,620
text and language.

828
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:24,020
I'm much more interested in abstract forms and stuff.

829
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:28,340
So my music falls to the non-verbal side of things.

830
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:36,020
And that's one of the reasons I think I can even do like music at all is that I really

831
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,820
don't have much to say for the narrative side of it.

832
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:41,020
I think that's actually the definition of music.

833
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:44,740
It's a non-representational way of communication.

834
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:49,740
This is why we even cannot compare it with Morsey because Morsey still gives you letters.

835
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:54,180
In music we have no recognizable images.

836
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,820
We have no words to translate.

837
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:59,540
We have nothing tangible.

838
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:06,220
We just have a flow of sounds organized in tonal relationships.

839
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:09,140
Or it's a rhythm.

840
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:14,140
Because in music, like in conventional music we are talking about two dimensions, most

841
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:15,140
important dimensions.

842
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:21,220
It's time dimension, era of time, rhythm, meter and rhythm, and tonal relationships.

843
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:24,580
And music can be without tonal relationships.

844
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:29,820
And it could be very effective as natural demonstrates.

845
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:34,700
You can use different rhythms to include people in different psychological state and produce

846
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:35,700
different results.

847
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,020
And it's really spectacular.

848
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:46,300
Do you think that music can get away from any kind of metaphorical representation?

849
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:52,700
When you have alterations in time, in space, or tone, it almost seems that it implies a

850
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:57,260
certain metaphoric interpretation on some level.

851
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,100
And that how can you really get away?

852
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:06,140
It's not the same as using words, but one tone might be higher than the other.

853
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:10,740
And this is going to create certain spatial metaphors in the arts.

854
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:16,540
But it also maps onto something, again, getting back to embodied cognition.

855
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:22,540
It maps back onto bodily experience and experiences in time and space.

856
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:27,620
Basically, this is what I tried to find in my studies when I measure people responses

857
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:31,820
to different tonal tension, to different tonal distances.

858
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:37,660
And there are responses to tonal distances expressed in the sense of perceived tension,

859
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:42,220
but also in the sense of perceived brightness and perceived warmth.

860
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,740
Do you think, why do you never dance?

861
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,740
I did not finish it.

862
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:47,740
I did not finish.

863
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:54,380
So basically, when we listen to music, when we perceive this world, we are the very comfortable

864
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,380
and very relaxed.

865
01:06:55,380 --> 01:07:01,060
We can be frightened, we can be tense, and it's physical tension.

866
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:07,580
So we can think about our life in general as a sequence of tension and release.

867
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:12,060
Like it's a very simplified, terribly simplified explanation of music.

868
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:16,820
That music captures this particular aspect of living.

869
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:24,740
It basically gives us sequences of tension and release that somehow creates emotion,

870
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:32,820
creates our living, when we listen to music, we live through music.

871
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,780
It's always in time.

872
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:37,100
It's tightly controlled in time.

873
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:40,180
We experience psychological state in time.

874
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:46,580
It's developing through those tension and releases, through those synestatic reactions,

875
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:49,700
warmth and brightness.

876
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:54,580
Some music does something to us that makes us live in parallel.

877
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:57,460
It's a sorcery.

878
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:59,820
Like I told you, I was a applied philosopher.

879
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:05,340
I looked into the V.A. Foundation of Music and I'm trying to give something tangible,

880
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,340
some explanation.

881
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:08,100
This is what I found with data.

882
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:13,780
I think this is cultural.

883
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,780
What is once?

884
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:16,620
What is called?

885
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:20,620
What is cultural?

886
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:23,020
If we do an experiment with tapping into different cultures, maybe we can agree on that.

887
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:28,420
But my perception, for example, for me is a seven, a cycle in seven, super stable.

888
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:29,420
Nobody will say that.

889
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:32,860
A cycle in five, for me, is really stable and also for the brain.

890
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,060
But let me finish.

891
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:43,020
So brightness, warmth, tension, harmony, those concepts, I don't think that really even

892
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,020
define music.

893
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:47,020
They do not.

894
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:48,020
This is very important.

895
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,500
I'm not talking about global music perception.

896
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,860
I'm talking about where it begins.

897
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:58,980
Like a single cell doesn't define human organism, but we need to study human cell-how functions

898
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:02,940
and not understand how the organism functions.

899
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:07,220
And as far as cultural constructs, yes, music is cultural construct.

900
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:13,660
But the same study, the replica of it, of my study, was run in India with people who

901
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:19,020
never had this experience of moving on different tonal distances, modulations.

902
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,740
And the results were the same.

903
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:25,380
I'm talking about subconscious, pre-cognitive perception.

904
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:30,420
Yes, there is European tradition, there are different traditions, but the study show again

905
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:37,140
and again that people, culture, the heart of musical message, even this musical message

906
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:39,460
comes from different cultures.

907
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:42,540
Music is the universal language.

908
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:47,100
All other languages, if I start talking in French or Russian, only a few people would

909
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,100
understand me.

910
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:52,260
Why are the music falls into that category too?

911
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:57,660
I think there's a lot, probably most of the kinds of music in the world are not necessarily

912
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:02,700
music to everybody at first listen.

913
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:11,620
I for one listen to a lot of noise music that's built specifically on a richness of harmonic

914
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:19,620
overtone and spectrum that wouldn't collapse nicely into the clean ratios at all.

915
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:24,820
You mean folk music or inventing music?

916
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:30,940
I guess I'm coming at it from noise music, particularly maybe an electronic sound.

917
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,780
Oh, I'm talking only about folk music.

918
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:38,060
Only about living traditions, something which was developed by people through real musical

919
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,060
practice, not invention.

920
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:46,220
What happens in music and this is really fascinating, yes, there are all these experimentations

921
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:51,140
and the limitations are wonderful because they give impetus for development of new expressive

922
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:52,780
means.

923
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:56,180
But there's also such things as craftsmanship.

924
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:02,480
When you look into the creations of Jürgen Sibachinbach, even his sons called him Old

925
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,420
Wig, like old-fashioned.

926
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:10,940
But if you look carefully in his compositions you would find politicality, you would find

927
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:16,940
whole tone scale, you would find some amazing thing which we already see that is developed

928
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:17,940
as avant-garde.

929
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:25,820
I am very much for avant-garde experimentations because this is what gives new life to music.

930
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:34,380
What do you think about the inherent problem in pitch between pure intonation, like just

931
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,380
intonation and equal temperament?

932
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,260
It's a fantastic theme.

933
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:41,380
I remember I was torturing.

934
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,180
Well, so just to…

935
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:44,180
I was torturing.

936
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,180
Yeah, it's about the tuning.

937
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:52,340
There are two approaches to tuning the sort of natural one which maybe we often sing in

938
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:58,900
which is frequencies being clean, multiples and ratios of frequency to one another.

939
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:07,100
And then in western music in particular, for instance, with the invention of the piano,

940
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:12,300
I don't know my music history so well, but equal temperament is a way of sort of pushing

941
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:17,420
this clean mathematical representation of pitch into something that is more regular and that

942
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:20,740
can be, for instance, transposed and…

943
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:21,740
Exactly.

944
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:24,300
You've got this idea of keys and stuff like that.

945
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,900
But it mostly lines up and it doesn't quite line up.

946
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,540
It's a fantastic theme.

947
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:33,100
Let me give some foundation for that again.

948
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,300
I don't know if you were finished with your remark.

949
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:39,460
Well, there's this kind of inherent divide between them.

950
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:45,700
You can either go one way towards this sort of pure world of sound which happens to actually

951
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:49,940
be like what we natively sing in and it has…

952
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,100
There's sort of so many things to say about it.

953
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:56,660
I'm not sure where to start exactly, but it's always built off of a fundamental frequency

954
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:02,620
which is kind of like your unit of time whereas in equal temperament, which is, for instance,

955
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:08,580
where the piano example came from, everything is slightly out of tune so it is to make it

956
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:09,580
work.

957
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:10,580
And they're pretty close.

958
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:14,460
So it mostly works, but there is kind of like this fundamental problem.

959
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:19,060
I actually want to shift a little bit.

960
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:22,100
Typically important just one minute.

961
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:25,740
We can always get back to it during the question and answer period.

962
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:30,580
We haven't had a chance to hear a little bit more about your acoustical research and

963
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:33,980
I thought it was a very important dimension to bring in to…

964
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,420
My parochial interest.

965
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:38,460
But I think there is a…

966
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:42,940
Despite the chatter, so to speak, there is a common…

967
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:47,980
I think we can all agree that there's a whole spectrum from all the way from very culturally

968
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:54,700
conditioned perception of sound that we call music, we can change across time, as you said,

969
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,180
across cultures.

970
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:57,180
But there's also some…

971
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:58,180
I think also…

972
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:00,860
I think what you're saying has…

973
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,860
I agree with a good part of it.

974
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:08,020
There's some fundamental built in perception of music that has to do with our evolution

975
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:09,020
most likely.

976
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,020
So the whole spectrum…

977
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:13,380
I don't find that shocking at all.

978
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:19,100
I do think that taking out of context, many music can be a boring.

979
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:20,620
It can be…

980
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:25,580
If you take popular music of one culture, put it in another, even today, despite the internet,

981
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:32,940
it can elicit at least boredom, if not revolt in some cases.

982
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:33,940
So that's definitely…

983
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:34,940
But I don't think…

984
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:37,340
I don't see anything shocking about it.

985
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:41,900
Also, I added the fact that it's not particularly good communicating ideas.

986
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,780
It doesn't mean it cannot communicate ideas.

987
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,380
Stravinsky went to extremes that it can't.

988
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:46,380
It's incapable.

989
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:50,020
But I don't think it's the best way if you want to write an op-ed to write it in a sonata

990
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,020
form.

991
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,660
It's better to write.

992
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:54,300
You know, so…

993
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:55,300
So I think we all…

994
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,300
Despite…

995
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,780
I think we all covering different same ground at the end.

996
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:04,660
But I'd like to ask another question that maybe changed the perception of the discussion

997
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:09,140
a little bit in your own realm as musicians.

998
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:17,740
What you find lacking in terms of tools, so to speak, not tools I'm talking about,

999
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:21,660
but what is it that you would like to be able to do that you can do now?

1000
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:24,220
Is there anything you reach…

1001
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,260
I mean, of course, you're all accomplished musicians.

1002
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:30,340
And I've actually, this morning, I said in bed, listened to all of you.

1003
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:31,340
And it was remarkable.

1004
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,020
The variety in tremendous spectrum.

1005
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:40,980
But as musicians, do you feel that there is an exploratory part of what you do, aside

1006
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:45,340
from performance, that you're reaching for something that hasn't been done or you want

1007
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,340
to do?

1008
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:49,180
If it is so, what is it?

1009
01:15:49,180 --> 01:16:00,660
Well, I could say as an improviser that we're always…

1010
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:05,100
You know, kind of make it our business to reach for the unknown.

1011
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:13,100
I mean, that's like the name of the game.

1012
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:22,060
You know, you get…or in other words, what really transforms and what really communicates

1013
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:28,220
is in that moment, in the improvisative moment.

1014
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:38,740
Somebody or a group of people on the edge of what they know, on the edge of what their

1015
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:46,220
masters at, where you find it maybe almost breaking apart to this space where you're

1016
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:50,780
not even sure if it's music anymore, where you're right on that boundary.

1017
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:58,220
And that to me, that vulnerable place is the most rewarding aspect of music.

1018
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:01,140
I mean, I experienced it last night.

1019
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:05,100
I really didn't know what was happening, but I knew that we were all experiencing it

1020
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,100
together.

1021
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,900
I mean, everybody in the room.

1022
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:15,780
And that is to me…so I guess I'm not really saying like, what don't I have?

1023
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:20,220
Because I am very fortunate to get to say I had that experience last night.

1024
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:22,340
Which is an atmosphere that you are reaching for.

1025
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:26,700
So you're reaching that moment in the improvisation where you are almost untethered from everything

1026
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,620
you've heard before and you're experiencing something new.

1027
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:30,620
Well, yeah.

1028
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,340
You know, for me it's terrifying to be pianist like you.

1029
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:35,900
I mean, for me, if I was a pianist like you were sitting on piano, I'm thinking of

1030
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:36,900
Thelonious Monk.

1031
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:41,460
I'm thinking of, you know, every great jazz pianist before me and I'll be terrified

1032
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:45,260
that I'm…what am I going to…what am I going to go from there?

1033
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,940
Except every good musician's performance without this fear.

1034
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:53,740
And you said you do so by pushing yourself to an edge and I'm trying to get a feeling

1035
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,260
to what that edge is about.

1036
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:58,740
So what happens there when you get to that point?

1037
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:04,580
You know, the thing is that we've all been…we've all been there.

1038
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,460
I mean, we're all improvisers.

1039
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:11,580
I mean, in the same way that we can debate until the cows come home if they ever do.

1040
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:13,460
I don't know if people stay there anymore.

1041
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:19,420
But what music is, we can also have a similar conversation about what improvisation is.

1042
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:25,020
And the more you examine that concept, it also kind of melts away in the sense that, well,

1043
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:28,860
everything we do is improvised, except the things that aren't.

1044
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:34,100
And that stuff we know, like, well, oh, they all did the same thing at the same time, so

1045
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,860
they probably weren't improvising.

1046
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:38,020
Like they must have…how do they know how to do that?

1047
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:43,340
You know, or they…you know, but even that is an illusion that can be, you know, like

1048
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:48,820
dancers use this…they do this…there's an improvisational dance technique called

1049
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:54,740
flocking, where, you know, if you just follow the person in front of you and I started doing

1050
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:58,860
this, then we all started doing this and suddenly it looks choreographed, you know?

1051
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:06,100
So that kind of thing of like the fact that we can just in the spur of the moment do something

1052
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,100
in sync or in unison.

1053
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,100
It's in a residence.

1054
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:09,100
Yeah, yeah.

1055
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:16,180
So, you know, so another…what I was going to say is that improvisation is something

1056
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:22,500
we're born doing in the sense that we're…you know, it's how we explore the world, it's

1057
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:27,740
how we come to learn about our environments, it's how we learn to do everything, it's

1058
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:30,860
how we learn to talk, how we learn to eat.

1059
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:36,220
You know, I mean, very…how we're willing to walk is by a lot of stumbling around and

1060
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:39,820
eventually finding a path, you know?

1061
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:44,100
And that's really, to me, we're always doing that.

1062
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,740
So that's a very primal experience.

1063
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:51,740
And so experiencing that in the course of performance, where, you know, you develop all

1064
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:56,460
this mastery at these different instruments and stuff, but then you also take yourself

1065
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:10,780
to this point where this…the sort of ideas side or the kind of intellectual side or

1066
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:18,740
the deliberate side of you, like the stuff that the part of you that plans what to do

1067
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:23,980
next and when to do it and how to do it, that seems to become relaxed.

1068
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:30,020
It's almost like being drunk, actually, when you just make a lot of bad…bad decisions.

1069
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:37,140
But sort of like having no…well, Charles Lim, you guys may know about his work, he

1070
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:42,940
did MRIs, FMRI's of people improvising, which is a very strange thing.

1071
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:48,220
I mean, they were lying down on their backs with a keyboard strapped to them.

1072
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:52,660
And he had that one control condition where they played a memorized piece, another controlled

1073
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:58,820
another condition, the test trial where they were asked to improvise on a blues or something

1074
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:00,940
like that, on a keyboard.

1075
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:15,220
So then he found that certain cognitive functions are relaxed, like the self-guiding kind of

1076
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:22,300
the self-consciousness is basically relaxed, and then you find yourself just acting.

1077
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:27,420
So when there's a sort of unity of thought and action, I guess that's sort of the

1078
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:31,660
thing that to me is kind of like…I guess it's also been described as a flow state

1079
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,620
and that kind of thing.

1080
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:43,060
I wonder if that pursuit of that moment and improvisation, that sort of threshold, to

1081
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:49,300
me I see that as the pursuit of the live experience, like the total live-ness, like being in

1082
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:53,140
the moment where the future is in the future and the past is in the past and you're sort

1083
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:56,020
of like right there between them.

1084
01:21:56,020 --> 01:22:03,660
And I 100% agree with you in the improvisational context, but I think that that actually is

1085
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:08,580
part of all of our experience, even if we're playing a piece of music that we've rehearsed

1086
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:14,980
a thousand times, like there's still no certainty that the next moment will be what was planned

1087
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:17,020
or it will be something different.

1088
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:20,900
And that is a fundamental bit of difference between the live experience and the recorded

1089
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,060
experience.

1090
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:30,340
And going back to the word body in the title, I think that the sort of live experience is

1091
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:35,580
the presence of our body in this space, listening to someone play music and not necessarily

1092
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:41,220
knowing what's next, which is so fundamentally different than listening to a recording.

1093
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:46,420
And it's true your CD player might die the next moment or things might interrupt the

1094
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:54,060
listening experience, but the expectation, the sort of like state of listening to a recording

1095
01:22:54,060 --> 01:23:00,100
is one of listening to something that's already been like set in a record, in a recorded

1096
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,820
form, in like a archived form.

1097
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:06,500
And that doesn't afford this uncertainty.

1098
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,500
Right.

1099
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,980
Still an important pleasure.

1100
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:09,980
Of course.

1101
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:10,980
Yes, sure.

1102
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:17,900
I mean, I recently found on YouTube a little solo of Johnny Hodges playing all of me and

1103
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,700
I played 25 times in a row.

1104
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:24,580
And then I found somebody who plays you that I am on YouTube who actually reproduced the

1105
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:26,940
solo on guitar, note per note.

1106
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:29,180
The sound of Baku's sound was exactly the same.

1107
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,180
So even something...

1108
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,180
I think I know her.

1109
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,180
You know...

1110
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:33,180
I think it's a he or she.

1111
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:34,180
I know her.

1112
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,180
I think.

1113
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:36,180
I think.

1114
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:37,740
Jack of Turban is the name of the guitar.

1115
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:43,900
But the point is even something as ossified or as frozen as a recording done in 1954 in

1116
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:47,860
Switzerland, which was the case, can be in quite a source of pleasure.

1117
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:49,020
But I'm curious to ask you this question.

1118
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:53,460
On the other end of improvisation, which is when something is superscripted, even to

1119
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:54,900
the point of taking the human out.

1120
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,740
Now John Cage tried exactly to do that.

1121
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:01,340
He took the I chain and tried to take the human completely out.

1122
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:05,060
And even the duration of the notes, the picture of the notes, everything was prescribed by

1123
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:08,060
dice and he obtained a composition.

1124
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:11,220
Of course, when you play it, you have all these uncertainties that you're talking about.

1125
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:16,820
But how can you then explain, should the opposite end of the spectrum from your improvisation?

1126
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:18,300
That's really interesting.

1127
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:23,340
How do you explain the musicality of such a thing as a musician?

1128
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:25,940
Because there is an intention.

1129
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:29,900
Before doing it, there is an intention of why I'm doing this.

1130
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:33,220
And where is my internal setting?

1131
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:34,780
And that's going to affect completely.

1132
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:38,020
The music, but most of all, the tone and the resonance of what I'm doing.

1133
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:43,020
So sometimes you can have the tone and we have the same tone or the same solo.

1134
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:47,180
But what is going to make that experience being different for you that I listen to and for

1135
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:50,580
me that I'm playing that, the intention of the player?

1136
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:53,100
That's going to shift everything.

1137
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:57,820
So it doesn't matter if it's improvisation or if it's like abstract music.

1138
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:58,820
What is this?

1139
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:00,060
For me, sound is a container.

1140
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,980
Or music is a container.

1141
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:02,980
A bakeable.

1142
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:07,220
But you put your intention there and then sounds travel and it's going to hit you.

1143
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:09,380
And what is going to hit you is not even the sound.

1144
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:13,300
It's going to hit you the intention, which is information.

1145
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,500
So maybe it does a language you were referring before.

1146
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,500
Well information is not ideas.

1147
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,060
Ideas are emotions.

1148
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:28,220
Yeah, I mean, a lot of contemporary composition and I guess people who call them, I mean,

1149
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:29,220
I'm also a composer.

1150
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:31,780
So I'll put myself in this category.

1151
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:36,700
But people who call themselves composers, they're in the business of scripting actions

1152
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:44,820
for musicians, for performers to then perform and become the vessel for the composer's intention

1153
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:46,980
or will or something like that.

1154
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:53,540
But what I find is so a friend of mine, Steve Schick, the first time I met him was about

1155
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:54,540
20 years ago.

1156
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:57,100
He was performing this piece called Bone Alphabet.

1157
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:00,220
You know this piece by Vinko Global Car?

1158
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:06,420
It's like what you were talking about but it's worse in the sense that it's extremely

1159
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:11,940
intricate polyrhythms, you know, 7 over 11 over 13, stuff like that.

1160
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:13,820
Every bar is different.

1161
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:17,900
He said he had to learn one measure a day for about five weeks.

1162
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,900
That was all he did.

1163
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:22,500
Was put himself through his thing.

1164
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:29,020
And it was like in the end though, when I saw him perform it, it wasn't about the composer.

1165
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:30,580
It was actually about him.

1166
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:35,780
It's sort of like you're saying in the sense that he so fully embodied this piece to the

1167
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:37,300
point that he owned it.

1168
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,900
I mean it was his.

1169
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:48,460
And the way he described it was that when he is really popping, when it's really popping,

1170
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:54,020
when it's really together, there's this flow that he described as like yoga.

1171
01:26:54,020 --> 01:27:01,540
Which is what yoga means is, I mean the word literally means yoke in that sense of tie

1172
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:05,820
together and it means tying together the mind and the body.

1173
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:09,180
That's basically what the meaning of that is.

1174
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:12,660
So basically what he meant is that he feels connected.

1175
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:15,860
This is really about the body.

1176
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:22,220
This is really interesting because another title of the discussion about embodied connection.

1177
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:29,740
So what I want to be united with yoga, that's the meaning of yoga, to be united in body

1178
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:30,740
and mind.

1179
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:36,300
I mean the experience of as a performer is like how I can achieve my best performance

1180
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:42,740
and also in sync and jumping to the unknown with certainty that I'm going to be safe is

1181
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:44,660
relying on the body.

1182
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:48,900
It's really getting out of my mind of what should be played now.

1183
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:49,900
What is the next part?

1184
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:55,700
How this should sound is like my intention is to jump and to jump with you and meet you

1185
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:57,580
there and I don't know what is going to happen.

1186
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:02,140
But you know what happened when the performers, even in a composition, we create from that

1187
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:08,140
place the audience jump with you because they really experience that it's a jump, jumping

1188
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:09,740
into the unknown.

1189
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:16,620
And when that synchronicity happens with the members of the ensemble, is this amazing

1190
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:23,460
feeling of unison and unity with something else that aligns your body and your mind and

1191
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:27,060
aligns the body and the mind of all the performance.

1192
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:32,980
And what happened next for me is the important thing because what I want to achieve is after

1193
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:36,340
the moment is silence.

1194
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:42,260
So what I want to promote you know with the music is silence because silence is stillness.

1195
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:48,660
After all this movement that sound and music has provoking you for you to organize and

1196
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:52,380
change in your molecular level, your psychology.

1197
01:28:52,380 --> 01:29:00,380
But just silence is that space when we can really finally be different and reinvented

1198
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:02,740
and created again.

1199
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:07,140
And on that note, we're going to open things up to the audience members.

1200
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:13,540
I would encourage you to state your name and please put your comments in the form of a

1201
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:16,300
question for the participants.

1202
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:19,940
You can line up and use the microphone there.

1203
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:27,940
Don't be shy.

1204
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:41,100
Thank you.

1205
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,020
Is this on?

1206
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:44,820
Thank you so much for your comments and all of this.

1207
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:49,100
I'd just like to, I've been tangling with these same questions for a lifetime.

1208
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:53,900
And it finally occurred to me reading here and there that music fundamentally you know

1209
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:58,820
is emotion experienced and expressed in a different way, a safe way.

1210
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:02,700
When you hear that, I'm just wondering how you respond and people like Alice Miller,

1211
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:07,540
the drama, the gifted child for your own good, she said emotion attaches meaning to experience.

1212
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:10,140
You can't take anything you've learned, studied or read.

1213
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:13,620
It will not make sense unless you attach an emotion to it.

1214
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:17,740
And so music on two levels, I'd just like to say real fast, Orpheus, when he played

1215
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:24,180
his lute 2500 years ago, Prometheus stopped having his livid torn out, Tandalus got out

1216
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:29,980
of the river and stopped with the low hanging fruit and sisyphus on his stone and all the

1217
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:33,540
spirits and Hades just stopped their torment and torture.

1218
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:35,260
And we also have a career to be hearing it.

1219
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:42,660
How many thousands of young people have died hearing the drum and the trumpets in military

1220
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:44,860
expressions for thousands of years?

1221
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:51,940
So this whole thing about emotion being expressed safely through music but very little understanding.

1222
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:56,900
And in India, they say, resonance produces light.

1223
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:59,140
We live in it.

1224
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:05,020
I would just love to hear any of your reactions to the connection between emotion learning

1225
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:06,020
and music.

1226
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:07,020
Thank you.

1227
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:12,860
You know, there's a French economist named Jacques Atali, did you ever read his book

1228
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:13,860
Noise?

1229
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:18,060
It's from the 70s, it's called Noise, the Political Economy of Music.

1230
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:22,620
It's really a landmark book.

1231
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:27,260
And he basically talks about the history of Western music but as an economist.

1232
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:35,060
So it's actually about like more social questions basically about why this sort of thing might

1233
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:38,340
have come about.

1234
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:45,260
And one thing he said was that in the beginning when society started to organize in ways that

1235
01:31:45,260 --> 01:32:02,220
had music that represented a ritual of control to combat the prevailing sense of chaos in

1236
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:03,460
the world around us.

1237
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:06,900
You know, the sense of complete unpredictability.

1238
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:15,460
There's a way where we can control ourselves, control each other and work together, do something

1239
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,740
that is organized.

1240
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:22,740
It may have been the first organized thing that humans ever did.

1241
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:27,820
And it's a way of staving off that basically the fear of the unknown, the fear of death,

1242
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:34,260
the fear of predators or the fear of whatever might befall us in the next moment.

1243
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:37,740
So it becomes this ritual of safety.

1244
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:38,740
You know.

1245
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:46,580
Yeah, I think especially the fear of unknown because historically music, we didn't touch

1246
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:55,740
on religion but historically until now to a large extent, music was enshrined in religion.

1247
01:32:55,740 --> 01:33:01,620
The secular aspect of music was until recently was a minority so it was because it was a

1248
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:02,820
narrative rarely.

1249
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:08,780
So the fear of the unknown, which is to my opinion as a non-religious person who respects

1250
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:11,740
religion, is central to religion.

1251
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:20,020
And I think in that same vein I explain the centrality of music as an experience.

1252
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:23,340
It's a spiritual way of dealing with the unknown.

1253
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:28,820
And this is the best way to express religion, religious thought, one of the best.

1254
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:33,020
And the central way of expressing religious thought has been through music.

1255
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:35,340
And emotional component of music.

1256
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:39,740
Both speech and music came from vocal production.

1257
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:43,380
When we talk we always give emotional color.

1258
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:51,500
If we start talking about emotional input, the speech would become very boring, mechanistic.

1259
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:58,740
So at some point in human evolution, the first signaling system, the expression of pleasure,

1260
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:07,220
of pride, beforcated on symbolic representation, language, and music, the melodic component

1261
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:12,900
of the first signaling system became used for emotional expressiveness.

1262
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,380
Yeah.

1263
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:25,900
And in the model of triune brain by Paul McLean, which is a model which was developed by

1264
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:34,340
Yac Bunksepp, the first layer is our reflexive reactions to the world.

1265
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:42,740
The next layer is our emotional understanding of our reactions to the world.

1266
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:46,220
And next level is thinking about thought.

1267
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:53,820
And it's clear today that there is no clinically healthy thinking without emotional impact.

1268
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:58,740
So this is what music carries on, it's emotional communication.

1269
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:05,900
And it does it in a very simple way, available for everybody, but still is able to deliver

1270
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:08,140
stunningly complex messages.

1271
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:11,140
I'm also saying this difference between life and death.

1272
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:19,060
There's always, I think, we see rituals around the world, there's always music.

1273
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:25,340
And why? Because music supports that process in funerals.

1274
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:31,180
In, for example, in India, in the nursing homes, during the process of dying, you're going

1275
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:37,820
to be surprised because about culture, which kind of music they put for when people are

1276
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:40,020
dying, they are not using hard melodies.

1277
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:43,780
There are a lot of percussive, percussive sound, really intense.

1278
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:45,620
Do you maybe believe that?

1279
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:50,540
Because we will see that emotionally we want this kind of harp and yalic sound.

1280
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:55,100
They use a lot of percussion, maybe because rhythm carries, they believe that rhythm carries

1281
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:57,380
the soul and can go there.

1282
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:59,380
And also, you know what?

1283
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:07,100
Being in Mexico also in some rituals and funerary rituals, when music is not just for the soul

1284
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:13,100
that is traveling, it's also for the family that is around to be able to handle pain,

1285
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:18,300
music we can rely on that structure that is provided through rhythm, basically, and sometimes

1286
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:23,860
through melody to really release and balance our emotions.

1287
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:30,900
And of course, if we go around the world, all the prayers, which is to connect to the

1288
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:35,700
unknown, to really communicate, are based with melodies.

1289
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:39,060
As always, we always just devoise praying, you know?

1290
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:44,460
So for me, it's really, really important that why we look a little bit back, look for

1291
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:47,100
traditions and rituals and see how they've been using music.

1292
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,660
Because it's really basic.

1293
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:54,020
Melodies, for me, has been the prayers, how the internal being, the psychology of the

1294
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:59,620
spirit, communicates with the transcendental and rhythm promotes dance and dance of the

1295
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:00,620
community.

1296
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:04,900
And that's how with that tools, we can really balance our emotions and go through daily

1297
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:09,620
life, being able to go through the challenges because there are challenges.

1298
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:17,740
And now in our ages, for me, sometimes tension is really good because tension matches the

1299
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:19,300
tension of the soul.

1300
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:22,820
So if I'm tense, I don't want to listen really like music.

1301
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:26,940
I want, I love to listen a lot of jazz, I want to compose a lot of tension because that is

1302
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:29,700
going to match my emotion.

1303
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:30,940
And you know what music does?

1304
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:36,380
And you match that emotion without judgment and you are with that naturally, with that

1305
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:42,220
tension, what music does is going to come to a flow to a new balance, which maybe is

1306
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:43,380
released.

1307
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:45,180
But sometimes balance is tension.

1308
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:51,900
Well, these ideas are also very consonant with the experience of the infant in the kind

1309
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:55,980
of call response with the mother's voice, that the mother's rhythmic touching and the

1310
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:02,980
intonations of the mother's voice also helps control, organize and provide a sense of safety

1311
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:07,420
for the infant to organize the infant's incoy experiences.

1312
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:14,380
So it's all very, I think, resonant with the earliest experiences of the individual.

1313
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:15,380
Any questions?

1314
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:19,540
I'm Christine Haderpoutus.

1315
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:22,900
I'm an English PhD student at CUNY.

1316
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:27,220
And thank you so much for this amazing talk.

1317
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:31,460
And in the interest of call and response, I'm really interested in music as a conversation

1318
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:36,780
and when you had mentioned silence, I'm really excited because I'm interested in this idea

1319
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:43,500
of regulation of breath and how in a conversation there's this desire or intention for a response

1320
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:49,540
and this like holding a breath to listen to the other side and this difference between

1321
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:56,260
listening and hearing and spirit and breath have an etymological history.

1322
01:38:56,260 --> 01:39:03,460
And I was wondering if you could talk since you were talking about time, how spirituality,

1323
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:06,900
transcendentalism, religion affects music.

1324
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:11,380
For example, the difference between someone who believes in an afterlife and someone who

1325
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:14,580
doesn't, whose time operates differently.

1326
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:21,740
If time is a construct and music is social or socially constituted, then how does our

1327
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:25,700
perception of time affect music?

1328
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:35,740
I mean, it really does really just, Christine is like when we create a cycle of measure,

1329
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:38,620
that is going to affect completely the breath.

1330
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:43,140
So that is going to completely affect you the experience of the music.

1331
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:47,260
So for example, if I have a pulse, I used to compose rhythm with my fingers.

1332
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:54,540
So it's really different if I count in five, one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three,

1333
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:57,260
four, five, one, two, three, four.

1334
01:39:57,260 --> 01:40:11,340
I'm creating a cycle and you start breathing with me.

1335
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:15,380
But if I do six, one, two, three, four, five, six.

1336
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:30,860
You see that it's completely different and everything relates in how I'm with cycle I'm

1337
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:38,200
creating and that is going to completely guide you into a breath and that breath into melody

1338
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:45,300
or harmonic rhythm if you are creating church, does that make sense?

1339
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:53,860
I guess I'm going to, in my experience in performance, you know, playing in rooms full

1340
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:59,620
of people, you know, where we can all hear each other.

1341
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,540
And in particular, we can hear each other breathing.

1342
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:12,460
I mean, as we actually can hear, if we really listen, and you know, what I've found is my

1343
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:24,060
best sense of whether, you know, I make it as a performer, my job to make sure I somehow

1344
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:28,300
reach everybody in the room, you know.

1345
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:33,340
And if I don't do that, I can tell, like I can tell when that's not happening and I

1346
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:35,500
can hear it, you know.

1347
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:40,180
And there are moments that I've experienced where you actually hear everybody breathe

1348
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:41,700
together.

1349
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:48,060
Like really everybody takes a breath for the same moment because music brought them to

1350
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:50,060
that.

1351
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:59,540
Because it's somehow, it's helping us synchronize our internal actions to that point, you know.

1352
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:05,940
So that to me is, I mean, when we talk about spirituality, it seems like we're starting

1353
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:12,460
from experiences like that, like this sort of sense of the stealth kind of expanding

1354
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:20,780
to encompass others, you know, and suddenly we have this awareness of non-singularity.

1355
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:33,340
And that to me is, anyway, that's how I'll answer you.

1356
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:41,740
I think that time and I'm not sure I'm going to put this all together, but time and spirituality

1357
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:47,500
are related in the sense of either being contained or being open-ended.

1358
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:54,620
And that is maybe grounded in our experience or grounded outside of our experience.

1359
01:42:54,620 --> 01:43:01,820
And I work a lot with electronics and my music and I program these very basic microchips

1360
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:08,060
to synthesize sound and they play alongside an ensemble.

1361
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:09,660
And so there's a communication thing there.

1362
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:17,580
But in one piece of mine, I have the music eventually settle into a chord.

1363
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:19,180
And it's sort of a musical event.

1364
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:21,900
You get to this chord that's slower and slower.

1365
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:26,580
And then that chord is programmed to play forever.

1366
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:31,420
Of course things like the battery run out or maybe, you know, it gets destroyed or something.

1367
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:36,140
So there are, you know, laws of entropy prevent it from being, from playing forever.

1368
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:39,340
But nonetheless, the gesture is towards infinity.

1369
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:43,060
And that's, I think, more like a mathematical gesture.

1370
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:45,900
And I think I'm bringing maybe too many ideas here.

1371
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:50,300
But computation is sort of this embodiment of mathematics.

1372
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:53,580
It's sort of like mathematics in the real world.

1373
01:43:53,580 --> 01:44:02,140
And through computation or even a simple instruction like play this note forever, you kind of gesture

1374
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:03,140
towards the infinite.

1375
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:06,740
Whether or not you can actually attain it.

1376
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:10,380
And I think that that gesture is a gesture towards something larger than us.

1377
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:16,100
In fact, it's a gesture towards something larger than the universe probably, we don't

1378
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:17,100
know.

1379
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:21,100
And to me, that's maybe as close as it comes.

1380
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:26,380
Yeah, you're pointing out the metaphorical power of music, which I think is, we haven't

1381
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:27,380
touched on.

1382
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:30,980
You mentioned something about silence.

1383
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:33,700
In some music traditions, silence is very important.

1384
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:37,700
In some other, for example, in Arabic and traditional, Arabic music, traditional Japanese

1385
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:40,460
music, silence can be integral part of a piece.

1386
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:45,140
While in Gaelic music, if you listen to Scottish Batpipes, there's a drone going on all the

1387
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,740
time, you're never going to stop.

1388
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:48,940
They show you that there's a flow.

1389
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:56,100
Both operate metaphorical, I think, arrows, so to speak, the point to breath, maybe to

1390
01:44:56,100 --> 01:45:02,940
the salvation, to security, and the operator may be on a very mechanistic level, but we

1391
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:04,460
find him very aesthetically pleasing.

1392
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:08,540
If you listen to a drone going on, the same thing with the continuum in Baroque music,

1393
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:11,460
it has a function of giving you sustenance.

1394
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:16,580
While note that stops can give you, you know, eerie feeling.

1395
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:23,980
If you go to Krakow, there is a bell tower, and every one hour there's a trumpet that

1396
01:45:23,980 --> 01:45:24,980
plays.

1397
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:31,580
It plays this haunting, beautiful trumpet theme, and suddenly stops.

1398
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:34,900
Every hour of the day, forever.

1399
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:45,660
Since the guy who played it was one time during the invasion at some point in the 14th century,

1400
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:49,980
I think of Poland, who was shot by an arrow in the middle of his tone.

1401
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:54,140
So to commemorate that act, there is that tone every day for one hour, and it doesn't

1402
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:56,180
matter how many times you hear it.

1403
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:59,820
The sudden stop of that tone invokes, you know, loss.

1404
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:05,260
So the metaphorical arrow towards loss that plays on a fundamental level, I think, is

1405
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:07,260
very powerful part of music.

1406
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:13,060
Ian, I'm going to give you the last question.

1407
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:17,820
And before you get to it, I'm going to ask, maybe not show, there are some things you

1408
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:20,860
haven't used yet, but we'll do that after the question.

1409
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:24,980
And I thought it would be a nice way to end the round table to maybe invoke a kind of

1410
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:31,060
communal experience with Ian Buckingham.

1411
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:37,940
Maybe appropriate in this setting to recall that Sigmund Freud was famously non-musical.

1412
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:43,300
And this is attributed to various things, including particularly perhaps that he couldn't

1413
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:49,260
stand the sound of his younger sister practicing on the piano.

1414
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:57,260
But I think this may illustrate for us is that music, obviously, is culturally determined,

1415
01:46:57,260 --> 01:47:04,420
but also psychologically determined, determined by individual and group psychology.

1416
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:12,740
And I think perhaps it ties in with what a number of speakers have said, that crucial

1417
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:20,300
aspect of music is conveying of meaning by sound, has to do with meaning.

1418
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:27,220
So I'd be interested in the views of the panel on that.

1419
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:37,540
It seems that the music is the most effective instrument of transfer of their complex information

1420
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:42,540
in a very simple way, because of the main morphological principle, perceived tension.

1421
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:46,260
And it's so primitive, so simple.

1422
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:56,340
This is how music reaches children with autism, people with very bad Alzheimer, basically

1423
01:47:56,340 --> 01:48:04,580
gives them some kind of sanity for a period of time, helps somehow people with Parkinson

1424
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:09,700
don't to restore coordinated movement for a while.

1425
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:16,620
And somehow also music helps to restore speech and people with broken zafasia, immunologic

1426
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:20,860
and tenetian therapy.

1427
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:28,820
It's a very strange way of communication, very, very powerful, that's true.

1428
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:37,020
And it also seems a very powerful way of prophylaxis for the brain, cognitive prophylaxis.

1429
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:45,580
You know that children who are trained in music, they gain a few IQ points.

1430
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:49,660
They basically relate to short-term memory, which shows.

1431
01:48:49,660 --> 01:49:02,420
Verbal included on numbers recall, but now recent studies show that music training helps

1432
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:05,420
people in their 60s, 70s, even 80s.

1433
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:16,980
Even if people start musical training in you at the material age, starting musical instrument,

1434
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:22,300
gives them cognitive advantage, creates each compensatory mechanisms.

1435
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:26,220
And it happens most likely because of multi-sensory integration.

1436
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:34,340
When people look into notation and find, write notes and listen and predict melodic future,

1437
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:36,460
it activates different parts of the brain.

1438
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:42,180
And this multi-sensory integration basically helps brain to stay in better cognitive health

1439
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:43,540
for longer time.

1440
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:49,780
I'll take this opportunity being in a house of psychoanalysis to an apropos of Freud to

1441
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:57,380
suggest that embodied cognitive science is really rediscovering and expanding Freud's

1442
01:49:57,380 --> 01:49:58,380
initial insights.

1443
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:04,820
And when he said that the first ego is the body ego, that as analysts, we're always

1444
01:50:04,820 --> 01:50:09,780
listening for the metaphorical representations of the body in the earliest experience and

1445
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:15,460
how this maps emotional connections to objects.

1446
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:16,460
Yes.

1447
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:19,860
And you see the respond to music.

1448
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:21,660
It's not intellectual response.

1449
01:50:21,660 --> 01:50:24,220
We also can have intellectual response.

1450
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:29,100
For example, if you listen to some incredible, some fugue by Bach, and if you know it very

1451
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:33,500
well, you can follow each voice and enjoy melodic transformation.

1452
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:40,260
But in general, what music gives us, it's visceral pleasure and music affects our breathing,

1453
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:48,100
our heartbeat, our hormonal system, electroconductivity of skin, gives us pill direction, the shivers.

1454
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:50,620
So it affects us so directly.

1455
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:54,380
And it gives us the sense of living through life again.

1456
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:56,380
And it stays the way.

1457
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:59,820
So natural for something else to demonstrate.

1458
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:05,500
And I have to create some sound with you.

1459
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,780
We're talking about two hours.

1460
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:10,100
I really thank you for giving me the opportunity.

1461
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:13,460
May I just say, natural gifts tonight are the concept.

1462
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:20,140
Well, it's just like a little flamenco show up with this.

1463
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:22,980
So I want to just have a little experience.

1464
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:29,500
Why I want to welcome you, if you want, is to, you want to close your eyes and just put

1465
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:34,460
your hands like that.

1466
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:36,380
Exactly.

1467
01:51:36,380 --> 01:52:06,220
And just try just to perceive with your hands.

1468
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:13,380
Thank you.

1469
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:22,740
All of our participants today.

1470
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:31,900
Thank you all.

1471
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:38,900
Thank you, everybody.

1472
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:45,900
I felt we needed something to bring us all together.

1473
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:50,900
And that was just beautiful.

1474
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:53,900
Oh, yeah.

1475
01:55:53,900 --> 01:56:03,900
Thank you.
