00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi, I'm Edward Narcissian. I'm the director of the Center.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Before we get on with today's program, I'd like to announce the next program which is

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:22,040
on April 22nd. And the subject, the title of that program is Design in Nature. It is

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:30,360
inspired by a quote from Leonardo da Vinci who said that though human ingenuity may make

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:37,440
various inventions, it will never devise any inventions more beautiful, nor more simple,

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,560
nor more to the purpose than nature does. Because in her inventions, nothing is wanting

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:52,080
and nothing is superfluous. Our round table is called Design in Nature. And Andre Bajan,

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,560
who is a professor who has invented modern thermodynamics and the construction law of

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:06,160
design and evolution in nature. Robin Collins, who is a philosopher. Caleb Scharf, who's

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,000
been with us before, who's a cosmologist. And Mark Norell, who is a paleontologist,

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:24,280
and at the museum. So about today, music to whose ears, music and healing, this is the

12
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,560
third one in the series, Music to whose ears, and it's called Music and Healing. It was

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:38,240
suggested to us by Marina Korsakova Krine, who is a professional pianist and scholar

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:48,160
in music, perception and cognition. As I call your name, please indicate who you are.

15
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,920

20
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:43,840
Function. Thank you.

21
00:02:43,840 --> 00:03:04,160
Well, who's getting us started? Marina?

22
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:13,200
I think we should start the round table with questions to practitioners. To people who

23
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:21,920
practice music therapy, and you have two practitioners, actually three practitioners. Andrea Norton,

24
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,680
she does amazing studies with people who suffer a phasor due to stroke. She practices music

25
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,600
neurologic therapy and helps people to restore their speech. And Concheta Tomeno, she works

26
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:45,760
with elderly people. She's an amazing researcher and thinker. I have tremendous respect to

27
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:55,200
her writings and her conversations. And Mr. Rossetti, he works at the Mount Sinai Hospital

28
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,560
with various patients, including Primus. So he has important experience to share with us.

29
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,400
21 started with the healing part. Yes. Okay.

30
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,320
In my work, I've been in the field of music therapy as a professional music therapist

31
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:22,080
since the late 70s. And was introduced to the power of music to affect people, especially

32
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,000
in recovery of function, or at least maintenance of function for people with neurologic diseases.

33
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,800
And it was obvious back then that there was something about music the way music could

34
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,600
arise and stimulate function and people who seemed to have lost function in such a way

35
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,760
that I really felt needed to be studied. And we know most people know how much music can

36
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,000
help them individually. And what we've been interested in as therapists is how can music

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,440
be used specifically to really help people not only maintain function, but to bring it

38
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,760
back if they've lost it. So people who've had strokes and can't speak or people who

39
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,680
have Parkinson's disease and can't walk. But they can do these things specifically with

40
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,240
music because of the way the patterns of sound, aroused and stimulate specific areas in the

41
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,840
brain into function where that person can't draw upon that by themselves. That's really

42
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,920
been the impetus for my work for the past almost 40 years.

43
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,360
And Connie, when you started, it really wasn't much.

44
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,000
Not in the near-neck.

45
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,080
The field of music therapy was established in the United States in the 1950s as a profession,

46
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,720
as an academic training program. I started actually initially working with seniors in

47
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,840
the nursing home within stage dementia. But my background before that was as a pre-med

48
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,800
biology student. So although I was trained at NYU and most of my training was in psychotherapy

49
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,280
and the psychotherapeutic aspects of music therapy, when I saw people who supposedly

50
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,720
weren't able to recognize anything in the world around them, people with end stage dementia,

51
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,480
respond to a familiar song, I had asked the question, how does that happen? How does somebody

52
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:16,200
who has no cognition or cognition that can't be measured by any other means recognize sound

53
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:23,160
in the environment as music? How does their brain recognize that melody as an old familiar

54
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,160
song? So that was 1978. And it was in 1980 that I happened to come to Bedebrim or all

55
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,120
of his sex was working. And so for the past, up until his passing, we worked together trying

56
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,880
to ask those questions. What is it about music that reaches us and helps us maintain function

57
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,040
as much as possible?

58
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:49,400
It is probably, I know we've talked about this before, and for Andrea as well, it has

59
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,120
to be targeted to the individual. You can't just say music. And I think Bach is great

60
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,600
music. But if I play it for you and you have no reason to respond to it, you won't respond.

61
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,240
Right. Well, there's some universals in the sense that auditory timing can be purely

62
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:15,120
stimulated. The motor response to rhythm can be purely produced by an auditory signal of

63
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,440
a certain beat. Most of us perceive rhythm the same way no matter which country we're

64
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,000
from or how we've developed, some have developed more sensitivity to rhythm and complex beats

65
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
depending on their culture. But when it comes to actual music, melody and song, there's

66
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,960
really no universal because how we all experience that music in our lifetime then changes our

67
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,520
emotional response and our associations to that. So from the point of birth, or even

68
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,680
before birth, because there's musical, some kind of rhythmic perception in utero, we start

69
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,920
developing these very strong associations to music from the first time, first breath we

70
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:02,400
take. And those then get encoded in neurologic responses that we can either call upon or

71
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,400
whatever. But that's what really makes music unique to us in our own special way based

72
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,840
on our life experience and associations. Can I follow up on this? I know very little

73
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,000
about music therapy. I'm more on the basic, yeah, science side. So given this point about

74
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,880
huge variability across people and what kind of things might drive them or get them around

75
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:30,720
or housed or harmed. So how does it work in practice? So is it a kind of therapy where

76
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,240
a patient plays a more active role so that they share information with you guys? Or is

77
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,640
there like some period where you're trying to find out what it is that the patient might

78
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,000
be most responsive to? Like how would a, if I come to you with a particular problem,

79
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,960
how would the whole process of therapy work?

80
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:55,800
So every patient that I work with that mostly in oncology, excuse me. The first thing we

81
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:03,360
do is an assessment. And an assessment of course has to do with medical aspects, also

82
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,720
has to do with psychosocial aspects, cultural aspects, we're looking for trauma, things

83
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:20,200
like what might be a person's song of kin, significant music. What it seems that what

84
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,920
the research is pointing towards is that what might be most effective, and I really don't

85
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:34,400
think this is rocket science, is that it needs to be music that people like. So the I will

86
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:42,320
be more effective in reaching clinical goals. It depends on what population you're working

87
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,680
with in music therapy. For myself that means working mostly with cancer patients.

88
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,480
And it also depends on what the goal, Andrew's right, and what the goals are. For people

89
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,080
who are working psychotherapeutically, they could be a very active interaction with the

90
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,080
client because you want to draw out some of the inhibitions, the hidden responses, and

91
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,440
so how they play music maybe feels something about what they're going through. I work

92
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,400
a lot with people with neurologic impairment. And in that case, it's actually knowing some

93
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,720
of the structures of music and how music affects the brain. And that could be very prescriptive

94
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,960
at times. Whereas a certain rhythm can drive motor function and somebody with Parkinson's

95
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,440
disease, it doesn't matter whether they like the rhythm or not, it's going to cause this

96
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,040
kind of motor entrainment. And the same thing with somebody who has a speech problem or

97
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:40,560
aphasia being able to use the melodic contour of sound and the rhythmic structure of speech

98
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,880
and music helps them therapeutically if that's used in a very directed way. So the field of

99
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,680
music therapy is quite broad, depending on the background and the training, just like

100
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,400
medicine. You know the field of medicine is as broad as the practitioner and the training.

101
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,000
And so the field of music therapy is there broad as well.

102
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,400
Is there like a clear ontology of the kinds of things that they do? Is there like a clear

103
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,280
set of programs or is it just really heterogeneous?

104
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,040
No, there's a standard of practice by the American Music Therapy Association that talks

105
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,600
about the different populations and the range of training within those populations. So somebody's

106
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,920
working psychotherapeutically and maybe analytical music therapy and maybe another type of music

107
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,320
therapy. If somebody's working with people with neurologic diseases, it may be neurologic

108
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,600
music therapy which is more prescriptive. And then there's more humanistic approaches

109
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:41,520
too that's dynamic. And some therapy is very passive. It could be as simple as programming

110
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:47,240
like music to help somebody relax but it's done with the music therapist's analysis and

111
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,640
carry over their work.

112
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,720
That's a good point. So I'm going to pick that up there. The thing about what sometimes

113
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,280
it's called receptive music therapy or passive listening, things like that. That's sort of

114
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:09,320
the lowest common denominator. But even so, there are situations where we cannot use live

115
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:16,280
music which is what I think most people would agree seems to be most effective. So using

116
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,240
prerecorded music is an option. For instance, in radiation oncology, there isn't a way for

117
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:31,560
me to provide live music therapy during treatment. But I can prescribe music for patients to listen

118
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,760
to. So the first thing would be an assessment of what the patients' needs are. So let's

119
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,720
say you have someone who's very anxious. Well, first they would identify the type of music

120
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:49,800
that they like to listen to. And then we would take music and music that they've identified

121
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:56,800
and analyze it and then place it in a sequence to obtain a sedation effect.

122
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:06,640
What are any effects are you aiming for as a sedation? I mean you talk about therapy.

123
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:14,080
What are the symptoms if you will that you're tackling? That's a huge question.

124
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:21,040
It is. So a good example, and Andrew, you could speak to it too, somebody who has a

125
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,600
stroke for example and loses their speech. There's still the potential of that person

126
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:33,120
recovering some form of communication by stimulating other networks in the brain that are still

127
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:41,520
intact that still help with word retrieval and the prosody of speech but they're dominant

128
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,520
in music-scented areas. So music is processed throughout the brain. It's not just a right

129
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:53,160
left situation like the thought of in the past. Somebody who loses the ability to find

130
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,400
words may have damage in the specific area in the left part of the brain but they still

131
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,280
have the ability to use those words if it's in a certain structure and that structure

132
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,920
tends to be musical in nature because that part of the brain is still intact. And so

133
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,600
people like Andrea who do melodic intonation therapy treatments are using those structures

134
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,160
in the musical way to help recover speech. So what we do is quite different from music

135
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,200
therapy in that we're using music as an intervention in a clinical trial so everybody gets exactly

136
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:34,560
the same intervention. And the people that we work with have had severe strokes. Many

137
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,320
of them have lost as much as the entire left hemisphere of their brain and what's fascinating

138
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,920
what fascinated me because I don't have a medical background or a music therapy background.

139
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:53,840
I'm a choral musician and conductor and singer myself but came to this through music education

140
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:02,000
research and seeing how music affected children's learning and then made this leap to clinical

141
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,840
research with music. And the people that have these strokes that are so massive if you ask

142
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,080
them to speak the words of happy birthday they can't do it. They can't get anything

143
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,000
out at all. And if you ask them to sing the song you wouldn't know they'd had a stroke.

144
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,760
It's a preserved function in their brain that melody. So melodic intonation therapy actually

145
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:33,760
capitalizes on that preserved brain tissue. And so what we're looking at in a neuro imaging

146
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,960
study and with behavioral testing before, during and after therapy is how does music change

147
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,360
the brain over the course of treatment. So the people that we work with are people who

148
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,960
are chronic patients. They've had a stroke at least a year ago. They've had lots of regular

149
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:59,040
speech therapy but not music therapy and we find that they make huge improvements over

150
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,600
the course of treatment. Now the treatment that we're able to give in this research setting

151
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,160
is much more intensive than anybody's insurance will pay for. So it's really a luxury on our

152
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:19,280
end that we get to see this progression of no speech at all to whatever people end up

153
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,320
with in the end. And not surprisingly what people put into it is often what they get

154
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,880
out of it. And those who practice more and use it more do better over time but there

155
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:36,760
are all sorts of other factors that we see anecdotally things like family support and

156
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,960
positive attitude that adds to this music effect. So I think there are more studies

157
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:49,720
to be done afterward that will tease this out but it's fascinating to watch people be able

158
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,000
to take this simple treatment which is no more than singing what you would speak. It's not

159
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,640
about singing a song or listening to a song or what's your favorite music. It's about

160
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:08,520
what do you want to say. So if I want to say hello nice to meet you. I'm so happy to be

161
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:15,880
here today. You use the same basic pros that speech would have any syllable that would

162
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,880
be accented in speech gets the higher note anything that's not accented gets the lower

163
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,680
note so anybody can pick it up and it's a treatment that you can over time learn to

164
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:35,040
do yourself. So I can say more about that but that's just one that's one small piece.

165
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,440
Those of us who work with patients who have chronic pain there's some good scientific

166
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,000
research that shows how there's a top down gating of the perception of pain if somebody's

167
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,480
listening to music. There's also Isabelle Parrot's at Montreal is doing some research on that

168
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:00,400
so we can gate the perception of pain if somebody's listening to pleasurable music. We can help

169
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:09,840
with early childhood development for children to develop language. Children with autism

170
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,920
doing some work with that too in the lab. Children who are pre-linguistic can learn

171
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,560
the structures of communication through music even though they can't conceptualize what

172
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:27,680
words are yet. So an idea of a happy sound or a sad sound they can start acquiring the

173
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,920
building blocks of emotional language even though their brain can put together what words

174
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,080
are. So all that comes through music. I mean it's one of the reasons why music is such

175
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,960
a... We talk about it as a powerful tool. I don't mean that casually but it really is

176
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,720
because it touches so much of it and a lot of it is neurologically based how our brains

177
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,120
perceive sound and how we organize that perception.

178
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:58,680
You know there's this old saying of music is the universal language which to me as always

179
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,160
seemed like well speech is a universal language as well doesn't mean that just because I can

180
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,080
speak I can understand somebody from Mongolia. You know there are different languages within

181
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,120
speech and it seems like it's the same thing with music but do you know Tom Fritz at the

182
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,040
Max Planck Institute in his studies with the MAFA people where he went into the Highlands

183
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:26,600
of Cameroon to a group of people who had really no contact with Western culture, Western

184
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:33,720
music and just showed them three pictures. A happy face, a sad face and a scared face

185
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,320
and then played them music and found that the MAFA people who had never heard this music

186
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,200
had never heard anything except their own regional folkloric music were consistently

187
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,000
able to identify the happy pieces as happy, the sad pieces as sad, the scary pieces as

188
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,600
scary by pointing at the appropriate face in front of them. He then took their music

189
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,080
back to Germany and did the same test there and Germans who had never heard this music

190
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,840
were able to consistently point to the happy face because it turned out all MAFA music

191
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,040
is happy. It's just the way it worked.

192
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:18,000
So I mean it seems like there's some kind of universality to music. I'm not ready to

193
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,960
say it's a universal language but there are some kind of elements of it that seem to be.

194
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:34,000
The idea that the rhythm of music is related to how we move. So a song that would sound

195
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,200
depressing or melancholic would be very slow and tempo because when we're sad we move slowly.

196
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,800
If it's very laborious in the way we move. If you're very happy, if you would play something

197
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:55,040
very upbeat and fast rhythmically, the person might say that music is very happy.

198
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,440
And so a lot of our music is related to how we as humans move and relate to the world.

199
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,520
So that could be universal. But because some of us humans are also musicians

200
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:12,520
and creative types and like to subvert expectations, you have things like Calypso which went

201
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:19,920
Calypso formed as bouncy happy music and the message it was delivering was overthrow the

202
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,800
white man, get him off our island, you know, resurrection, revolution, insurrection. You

203
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,480
know, that was the message of that was being delivered in this very kind of jaunty, carefree

204
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,040
music. So that's how they got away with it.

205
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,160
A couple of different things going on here. I think what we were talking about before

206
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:48,320
about associations, associative processes with music. All music creates associations.

207
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:55,440
We could argue that music is metaphoric in nature. So I think part of what we're looking

208
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,840
at is why I think that music is likely more culturally dependent than not is because we

209
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:12,040
have our own set of cultural metaphors for things that might differ. So associative processes

210
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,480
and metaphoric processes, why me have your last, your last statement because I lost my

211
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,000
thread of thought here.

212
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,760
About the reggae. I mean, about the Calypso. Oh yeah, yeah, just the tension between the

213
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,920
message and the kind of the music that was delivering it.

214
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,160
Right. So the multiple layers of...

215
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,640
Thanks for doing that. So the other thing that I think comes up is how when we listen to music

216
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,240
and we're looking at the emotional content of music, there are two different processes

217
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,880
going on. One is how we perceive the music to be and the others are our response to it.

218
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,960
So I can listen to a very sad piece of music and feel strangely uplifted. Right. Right.

219
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,800
So perceived versus how we identify it. Sure.

220
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:03,240
I think it's related to the fact that music is dealing with aesthetic emotions. They're

221
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:09,880
just for basic emotions according to last classification. But aesthetic emotions, it's

222
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:19,600
such a complex thing. And it just happens that music is able to talk, to deliver information

223
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,720
that no other means of communication are able to deliver the same certainty and precision.

224
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,760
And it's not my thought, it's the thought by Susan Langer, a wonderful American philosopher.

225
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:39,400
So she compared linguistic language with music. And she wrote that music is more precise.

226
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:48,080
Basically, it was your thought. And another very important idea about music, that music

227
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:58,200
delivers, gives us the logic of emotion. When we follow the flow of music, we recreate intuitively

228
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:09,040
emotion inside us, we live another life when we listen to music. And it's life we're abstract.

229
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:15,360
It's very precise and same time we're abstract because there is no objects. There is no such

230
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,240
precision as for example language has. We can take any language and translate to other

231
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,560
languages. There is nothing to translate in music, as you can do it with pictures. But

232
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:31,480
still music is so sufficient language. There is no cats, hats, houses. It's something that

233
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,240
goes directly to our system. But how it goes directly, we still don't understand. Perhaps

234
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,400
some understanding of the very fundamental things in music. And it's fun to learn them.

235
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:51,280
Because at least there are some tangibles. But on the top of that, why music makes us cry?

236
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:58,320
Why we have goosebumps? How music delivers important ideas? Philosophical ideas sometimes.

237
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:05,720
We still don't understand that. But this is the most exciting thing about music. How it

238
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:12,680
happens? Do you think it's different whether it's instrumental music or music with words?

239
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,520
Because once you do add language to music, now you've really muddied the waters at that

240
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:24,440
point. But it's not just music, it's already words. And as my friend told, sometimes better

241
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,600
not to understand words for some songs. It's so beautiful. I would challenge the claim

242
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,000
that music is more precise. I would challenge any musician to be able to express something

243
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
like my husband thinks it's raining. There's a very limited set of messages that we can

244
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,840
convey through music. And it's arguable how broad that range is. But certainly it's not

245
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,760
the kind of rich communication system that we have through language which makes our species

246
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,680
stand out for many other species in terms of the richness of meanings and the arbitrariness

247
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:06,680
of meanings we can convey. So I think the precision scale is maybe not the right end to put language

248
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,680
and music on, but rather the kinds of information that they convey.

249
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:21,800
Absolutely agree. Because linguistic language, we have cognitive constants. The certainty,

250
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:28,440
this absolute precision of delivering information in the words. Of course music has different

251
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,760
precision and delivers just the most difficult things who we are. Our psychological states,

252
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,680
our feelings that they difficult to express in words.

253
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:47,000
So that's who. I mean, I don't know. That's a hypothesis, right? I mean, some people find

254
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,400
it quite easy to express their feelings and words. I mean, I think that's that varies

255
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,560
hugely across the world.

256
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,320
We've seen many, perhaps too many examples of people who use words in very precise ways

257
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,320
and are still misunderstood. Oh, that's really true. That's certainly true.

258
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,960
And there are musicians like Meredith Monk, the great American composer and vocalist who,

259
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:18,760
despite being a singer, almost never uses words because she feels like music can be very precise

260
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,960
in getting to emotions that are, if you think of emotions not as little discrete packets

261
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:31,560
of fear and joy and sorrow or whatever, but as a spectrum, as a continuum, that music can

262
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:37,760
get to those gray areas that we feel emotionally that we don't have names for.

263
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:44,280
The Brazilians talk about saldage. We don't really have a good American word for that.

264
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,200
And nostalgia doesn't really come close. But Brazilians know it when they feel. We know

265
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:56,240
it when we feel. We just don't have an English word for it. And music can kind of emotionally

266
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,840
target those kind of areas that should...

267
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,760
Sure. But music is certainly not the only thing, right? I mean, so so language is the

268
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,280
system that we use to exchange thoughts with one another. I mean, that is our primary means

269
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,880
of communication. But sure, you can express yourself through painting. You're going to

270
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,680
express yourself through dance, through music. And one thing that I've been very interested

271
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:25,920
in whenever I've thought about all of these strands of words that use music therapy is

272
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,800
one, what aspects of music are driving? What are the shared mechanisms that, for example,

273
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,200
help you either recover speech or become less depressed or tolerate pain better? And also

274
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,960
how specific... And it's a related question. How specific is it to music? Right? And so

275
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,360
given that... Because understanding how specific effects are is kind of key to understanding

276
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,160
what the shared mechanisms might be. And some people have tried to kind of take different

277
00:28:53,160 --> 00:29:00,240
components of music therapy apart by, for example, controlling with conditions like, you know,

278
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,720
theater therapy, right? Where you also engage with other people, you find some alternative

279
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,520
ways of maybe expressing yourself through body language or facial expressions or something

280
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,840
like that. So that's trying to, you know, control for one aspect of it. But it sounds

281
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,840
like the kinds of music therapy that people use are so, so rich and there are just so

282
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,080
many things that go into that big bag. And for people who want to just help other people,

283
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,320
they may not care about taking it apart. They just want something that will make someone

284
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,800
better at, you know, whatever their problems are. But it seems like ultimately would be

285
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,920
really helpful to understand what drives these recovery effects so we can then maybe capitalize

286
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,160
on the things that work really well or whatever components are most efficient.

287
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:48,040
Sure. Well, yeah, you've bought up so many really interesting points to talk about.

288
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:56,240
On a mechanistic level, that's still a huge gray area. What you're saying about the difficulties

289
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,480
of research in music therapy, that's just a reality. I mean, it's impossible to do a

290
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:15,280
double blind with music therapy. You've bought up a point about specific mechanisms for clinical

291
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,480
practice. And Connie started talking about pain. I think we could talk a little bit about

292
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,280
that. We started mentioning gating and things like that. So what Connie was, I think what

293
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:32,560
she was starting to talk about, is Milzak and Katz, gay control neurometrics theories.

294
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:40,240
And so following that, there are areas of the pain response. It is a multidimensional

295
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:48,400
subjective response that has different domains. Some of those domains are things that we can

296
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:56,040
work with as therapists with the idea, for example, there is an emotional content always

297
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,320
to physical pain. I'm not talking about emotional pain and suffering. So emotion is something

298
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:09,320
that the music is made of, we could argue. So using music to modulate an emotional response

299
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,240
to pain is something that is very effective and relatively easy to do. There are other

300
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,560
domains. There's a cognitive discriminative domain to it as well. We can use music in

301
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:30,160
a process with that as well. I don't, because it's impossible for everybody is somebody

302
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,000
is going to know that music is happening. Does everybody know here what double blind

303
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
studies are? I mean, I just know people's background. Would you explain it? Yeah. Well,

304
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,720
I mean, it's just basically when neither the therapist nor the patient is aware of which

305
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,480
treatment group they're in. So there's no biases on the side of the patient or on the

306
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,840
side of the... Right. So it's impossible not to know. Somebody knows that somebody's getting

307
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:55,280
music. Yeah. Right. But it seems like I don't know, again, I'm sorry, I don't...

308
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:01,920
So if you had a group who had pain or were going for the same procedure and then get music,

309
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:07,680
and another group who got music, and then we found out which ones had felt less pain,

310
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,640
and was in the double blind? No. Because they know what they got. Yeah.

311
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,680
There's been studies with both groups get headphones and one might get white noise,

312
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,280
and the other one will get some music, and then you could do really a double blind study

313
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,080
in that kind of situation. Still say the patient knows. The patient knows. But then

314
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,560
that's what we're going to hear. Yeah. Yeah. So we do a double blind study where we're

315
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:35,280
doing non-invasive brain stimulation in conjunction with melodic intonation therapy.

316
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:42,480
And the TDCS or transcranial direct current stimulation unit that we use, the very small

317
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,440
thing, which is actually on a wire, which is behind the patient's back and being controlled

318
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,240
by another researcher. So you can give one of two kinds of stimulation or you can give

319
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,520
sham stimulation so that the patient doesn't know whether or not they feel the same kind

320
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:05,640
of ramp up as the current is turned on in the sham stimulation as they do in either of

321
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:13,240
the other current modes. And I, as the person doing the melodic intonation therapy with

322
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,160
them, am unaware of what they're getting. So that is a double blind study. It's not

323
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:24,280
double blind with the music part of it. But we do, just to answer your question from

324
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:31,480
earlier, our study is looking at a specific control intervention that we designed to take

325
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,280
the music part away. Everything else is the same. So we have melodic intonation therapy

326
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:42,080
and speech repetition therapy. So the stimuli are exactly the same. The way it's administered

327
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,560
is the same except for the singing and the hand tapping, which engage that same.

328
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:55,040
So even another part to further talk about studying researching music, I think one of

329
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:00,360
the challenges is that when we talk about the dynamics, interpersonal dynamics of music

330
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:06,840
therapy, that's hard to study because it's real time interactive music making. But a lot

331
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:13,760
of the research that's been done has been on the components of music, of rhythm and sound

332
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,880
and arousal mechanisms. And those can be studied on a neuroscience basis because they can be

333
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:25,640
isolated. But then you have to realize that music is so broad. So we have the sound, we

334
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:32,280
have vibration that can have an impact on function. But once it gets into song, song

335
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,720
not, song meaning music, composed music, once it gets into an organized musical sound, then

336
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:45,840
we get into a different hierarchy of processing that becomes more difficult to study, I think.

337
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:53,320
So when you do rhythmic entrainment for someone, say, with Parkinson's, could that person just

338
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,640
be using a click track? Yeah. So when the first studies were done, it was by a rhythmic

339
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:05,160
sort of metronomic type click track. And that works fine. What we did find out though is

340
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:10,240
that if the person can, if there's a melody that they can hold on to, so if that melody

341
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,640
has a rhythmic pattern to it, they can self-intrain. Because that part of the brain of imaging,

342
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,400
imagining that sound could also drive the same mode of mechanism.

343
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,760
Interesting. Because in Indian classical music, the-

344
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
The top of the play is-

345
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,680
The top of the play. Yeah, they do that. Yep.

346
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,000
They have, you know, they can go and do their own solo performances for an hour or so. But

347
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,520
usually there's a very simple repeating-

348
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,520
Happened, that keeps it together. A melody played by another instrument. And that instrument

349
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,480
is simply accompanying. You know, the melody is just there to kind of keep the ear where

350
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,680
it's supposed to be, you know, focused on them. And it's the rhythm that takes you some

351
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,040
place. One of the interesting things I think about

352
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,400
music, at least when we study it in patients who've lost cognitive function, is that the

353
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,960
components of music are processed at sub-cortical levels. So when you look at the piece of art,

354
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,640
when you listen to language, that's all high-acortical processing.

355
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,520
Not all? Not all. Okay. Sub-cortical contributions as well to some of us.

356
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,280
Yeah, yeah. But, well, maybe then maybe I'm wrong. But that this component of our motor

357
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,160
system and physiological system that can be driven purely by patterns of sound. So even

358
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,080
if somebody has severe cortical damage, there's still ways of entraining them to sound, that

359
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,560
is impossible, poo-verbal interaction. And so many times we'll work with people with

360
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,680
severe brain injury to sort of jump-start areas of the brain that still may be available to

361
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,400
them and bring it into a higher level of action. But tell me about what you were-

362
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,640
Well, I mean, I mean, it's, I was just saying that there's sub-cortical contributions to

363
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,920
three months now to many, many high-level cognitive functions. But I think also one thing to keep

364
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,880
in mind when- so when you were talking earlier, you said that music kind of engages the whole

365
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:07,120
brain. And in some ways, it's certainly true because, you know, if you're a musician listening

366
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,320
to music, you're going to activate your motor cortex to some extent, right? Because you're

367
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,080
thinking about actually playing that piece. And of course, there's huge swaths of auditory

368
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,320
cortex that are active. And then musical is all sorts of emotions. And so the emotional

369
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,400
centers are active. And there may be some kind of, you know, thoughts that get generated

370
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,040
by music, like, you know, thinking about your loved ones and so your social system may be

371
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,880
active and so on. But I think it's really important to also keep in mind- so I'm coming

372
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,080
back to this question of specificity- there are some parts of our brain that appear to

373
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,840
be really, really specifically responding to music. Okay, so there are some parts of the

374
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:47,560
auditory cortex that respond very, very robustly when we process music and all kinds of music,

375
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:52,760
including familiar and familiar, different cultural, music from different cultures. But

376
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,480
these same regions don't respond at all when we hear speech, when we hear animal noises,

377
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,480
when we hear all sorts of mechanical noises. So it's a really, really, really specific

378
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,920
response. And there's nearby regions, of course, that respond to speech, speech sounds. And

379
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,680
those regions are- this is before we get into the language domain. These just respond to

380
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,920
the acoustics of speech. They respond just as much to foreign speech as they do to familiar

381
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:25,440
speech. Anyway, so these are the kinds of regions that when damaged will lead to problems

382
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,320
which are specific to music. So you mentioned Isabelle Pirez as one of the kind of leaders

383
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,980
in that field who has documented very interesting cases of patients who appear to have really

384
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,120
quite selective deficits with some aspects of music following stroke. Now, you may have

385
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,800
damage to some aspects of your motor cortex or emotional system and may lose some ability

386
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,880
to either enjoy some aspects of music or process some aspects of music. But it's really these

387
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:58,640
parts of the auditory cortex that are music selective that seem to be- have this one-to-one

388
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,640
relationship with musical abilities and ability to perceive music. That said, I think the place

389
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,800
where a music very useful interacts with the rest of the brain is through this very extensive

390
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,080
bilateral system which people call many, many names in the literature which is never helpful.

391
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,600
But you know, it's- the network is known as task positive network because it gets engaged

392
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,280
in many, many tasks where the cognitive control network or the executive system network or

393
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,080
the attention network. The bottom line is it's a system that gets engaged in a broad,

394
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,880
broad range of goal-directed behaviors. It seems to care about prediction in general.

395
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,720
So we predict the world all the time. We try to predict, you know, what happens, what you're

396
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,000
going to say next or how you're going to move next, where if I'm listening to a piece of

397
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,280
music, you know, what kind of structure might come up, come next and so on and so forth.

398
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,040
And that system has been linked to things like fluid intelligence, flexible behaviors,

399
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:59,520
kind of another real hallmark of our species. Monkeys have like an equivalent system. It's

400
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,640
just not quite as good. Some people argue it's qualitatively different in some ways, but

401
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,560
the evidence for that is a little scan. But anyways, so we have this huge, huge system

402
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,160
that allows us to engage in all sorts of goal-directed behaviors and planning. And that's

403
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,680
a system that gets engaged very robustly by music and rhythmic stimuli. And it seems

404
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:22,000
like that's where it may actually intersect with things like some aspects of language

405
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,240
or some aspects of, you know, motor function or some aspects of kind of general emotion

406
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:33,280
attention components. But there's another kind of sort of crossover, a kind of a gray

407
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:40,920
area between speech and language and Andrea working with people with aphasia. I mean,

408
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:47,640
it's always struck me that people who grow up speaking tonal languages like Mandarin,

409
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:55,840
that line, that differentiation that we make between speech and song is less clear when

410
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,920
your language, when every word in your language can have three different meanings depending

411
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,200
on whether it's pitched high, medium or low. So it's not quite at the level of language

412
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,040
though still. It's at the level of speech perception. So there's indeed very interesting

413
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,840
words suggesting, for example, that tone deafness is a lot less common in Mandarin speakers,

414
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,840
for example. And again, there's work suggesting that in the auditory cortex, there is some

415
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,800
shared bit that responds to pitch across domains. So there it doesn't matter if it comes

416
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,720
from a, you know, train horn or music or speech, but it's this very, very sensitive to pitch

417
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,440
modulation region. And that's potentially where some of these interactions may happen

418
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,640
along with potentially brain stem areas which also have been implicated. But that's again

419
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:47,520
kind of before you get into the realm of mapping thoughts onto linguistic forms which is kind

420
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,000
of what the kind of high level language is, right? It's once you're passed with the acoustic

421
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,800
signal. And at that level, it seems like there is really, really very clear separation between

422
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,040
the regions that support language and the regions that support music, modulo this very,

423
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:07,440
very domain general system, the frontopridal system. I mentioned where every kind of engaging

424
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:15,400
task will overlap. But in terms of the processing mechanism we use for language and music, those

425
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,640
appear to be quite distinct. And there's been a lot of confusion in the literature because

426
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,240
many people have argued that there is something like an abstract hierarchical processor of

427
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,760
structure in language and music. And some people have also added math into the same bag. But

428
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,880
the evidence for those kinds of claims all came from studies where the paradigms would

429
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,200
be something like you're listening to a piece of music and then you have something that doesn't

430
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,400
fit with the preceding context, right? Like violating exactly. Exactly. And so similarly

431
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,960
in language you would get a sentence and then something will disagree in gender or number

432
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,560
or whatever language you're using, though, basically a grammatical error, right? And

433
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,400
as you can imagine, when you're processing a familiar stimulus and you get something

434
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,320
that doesn't fit with the context, a lot of things happen in your brain. You're like,

435
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,280
wow, you know, this is an error. Something is wrong. I'm going to try to fix it. Did they

436
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,000
mean this, right? And so some of the work that we've done has shown that this kind of

437
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,080
overlap, it does happen, but it doesn't happen in some abstract hierarchical processor. It

438
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,560
happens in this very domain general system that just reacts to basically unexpected events

439
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,920
in the world and it will respond just as much to, you know, a sequence of blue circles and

440
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,200
then a red circle as a would to a violation of hierarchical structure in music or grammatical

441
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:41,280
structure in language. I just want to follow an arena that language is to my understanding.

442
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:49,520
This kind of intellectual endeavor, while in music, we don't invest intellectual efforts

443
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:58,000
to receive music. This is why it's available to people with Alzheimer, to autistic children,

444
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,240
to people with tremendous cognitive problems. We are dealing with a very special way of

445
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:11,000
communication and this special way is to explain the power of music therapy, basically, because

446
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:18,440
as Kanchata wrote, that music is dealing with different pathways to accessing our memories

447
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:25,720
or whatever. It's like, let's say that music gives something like temporary winter, winter

448
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,480
of sanity to people with Alzheimer, but they suddenly recognize their relatives. They

449
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:36,040
could not recognize for months already. Or they suddenly have these flashes from their

450
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:44,880
memory or they suddenly start citing the words of the songs in their youth. We are dealing

451
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:54,040
with very special phenomenon which is very accessible. Yes, it's auditory information,

452
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,920
of course, and it goes through all the processing delays. And we know there's some difference,

453
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:06,640
like in the sense of brain hemisphere, more responsible for speech and more for music.

454
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,160
There's a lot of shared mechanisms, but altogether, in music, we are dealing with a very simple

455
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:19,600
way of encoding complex information and decoding complex information. And this simplicity explains

456
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:29,320
this kind of generosity of communication through music. You don't need to have special training

457
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,320
to get very complex messages of music. This is my point.

458
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,480
So, we are still training to get messages from language either. In fact, people with

459
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,880
severe mental disability, like some individuals with Down syndrome, who would score very poorly

460
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,160
on a lot of IQ tasks, they never the last can understand language and produce language.

461
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,800
But they need to learn words. Of course, you need to learn words. Dogs can learn. Of course,

462
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,320
you need to learn words to communicate with it.

463
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,120
It's interesting, some of our patients who had severe phasor, we forget how much our facial

464
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:07,800
expression informs communication. And so, you'll see people who stop mimicking the lip movements

465
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,440
of somebody if they're trying to understand what's being said. So, I think as a language

466
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:20,040
species, we tend to really depend on verbal communication to understand each other. But

467
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,880
when we lose the ability to express ourselves verbally, we get creative. We get creative.

468
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,640
And there's a lot of nuance that we use both through movement, through facial expression,

469
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,080
even through, you know, visceral exchanges and feelings and gut responses that are part

470
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:41,280
of communication and the way of sharing. And I think music informs some of that. I think

471
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:48,680
that's why people who have severe brain damage can still appreciate and respond emotionally

472
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:55,040
because some of those contextual elements can be accessed in lower parts of the brain.

473
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,600
The other thing, sorry, the other thing that's interesting is when somebody, you were talking

474
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:04,400
about the executive functioning and being able to plan ahead, but some of the work that

475
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,560
Charles Lim is doing now in improvisation talks about when somebody's in this super-creative

476
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,400
process, the frontal part of their brain isn't as active. They're not self-monitoring anymore.

477
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,600
And I think what happens in a lot of our music therapy sessions where we have improvisational

478
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:27,560
of music making, people who can't plan because they've had a trauma, you know, that affects

479
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:32,880
the frontal cortex or can't think through steps of doing things. In the moment of play

480
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,480
and spontaneous interaction, they are able to access function because this part of the

481
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,480
brain isn't needed anymore. They're working on some other aspects. So there's so much

482
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,480
going.

483
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,480
There's a few opposing systems.

484
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,480
Exactly, yeah.

485
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,400
The executive system has kind of its arch enemy, which is the system which people kind of

486
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:57,680
say is aimed at kind of introspecting and recalling things and thinking about others'

487
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:03,760
minds. And it's kind of known as the default mode. Some people link it to social functions

488
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,720
so they would talk about the system as a social function because a lot of what we do

489
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,200
when we are not actively pursuing a task is think about other people because we're a

490
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,840
very social species. And anyway, so how those two systems trade off in complex cognition

491
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:23,120
is a very interesting question. And the interplay between the two systems has been implicated

492
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,720
in a lot of psychiatric disorders, actually the various disbalances.

493
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:33,240
It's interesting to think of complex music making where that prefrontal area is kind

494
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,240
of needs to step out of the way. That's right to make it.

495
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:43,120
There's a musical technique called hockeying, which is you hear it in some of the music of

496
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,800
Duke Ellington, you hear it in Indonesian, Gamelan music, you hear it in the music of Steve

497
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,360
Reich, where nobody plays the whole melody. You play the first note, I play the second,

498
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:57,360
you play the third, then you play the fourth, I play the fifth, you play the sixth. And

499
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:04,680
I've asked many musicians who employ this technique what it's like to do it. And universally,

500
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:10,120
the answer is you just stop. You stop thinking and you just, and after a while you don't

501
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:16,320
remember who's doing what, it's just, it becomes its own sort of closed system. And

502
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:25,360
of course it takes training. You have to internalize the individual parts, but the idea is to

503
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:31,800
get to that point where the front of the brain shuts down and you just go on instinct.

504
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:36,800
I think it's really important to concentrate on your thing, thought that we have language,

505
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,360
we are dealing with high processing basically. Yeah, there are some other layers, but still

506
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:48,920
it's high processing. What about music? Well, there's higher processing in music. I mean

507
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:54,920
musicians do it all the time where we listen, we process with the sounders, with the key

508
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:01,360
is, with instruments of playing, with the harmonic structures. So that's very high. And

509
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:06,320
in fact the more exposed we are to music, the more we're able to appreciate complex

510
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:12,320
music. Whereas a novice musician may find some abstract music very disconcerting. Whereas

511
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:17,840
an expert musician might see the excitement in, you know, stock housing or something.

512
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:24,480
But I don't think that the expertise and so and so important. Because people basically

513
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:30,120
don't need to learn language. I mean we could use five or six words to pretty much get

514
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:36,720
around. It's not true. I mean, no, no, I'm saying that there's some universal. There's

515
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,520
certain basic things that we get out of music and we get out of language that we could survive

516
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,840
with. That's right. But to really be creative and spontaneous and be able to engage at a

517
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,920
higher level, we need all those other elements available to us.

518
00:50:52,920 --> 00:51:00,040
I'm rooting for something different. You see, music therapy can help premise. It can help

519
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:06,760
artistic children. And sometimes the artistic children can be kind of very much on the limits

520
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:12,640
of spectrum, like non-negristic kids. It can help people with various cognitive problems

521
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,200
like Parkinson's when it's already cognitive problems. And of course in that's humor.

522
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:26,640
So there's some channel in music that kind of not necessarily reaches the highest levels.

523
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:33,000
But he uses some precognitive mechanisms to deliver important information by going to

524
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:44,040
the memories and going to motor behavior, going to the feeling of well-being. And I think this

525
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:52,240
is a very important thing in the discussion about music therapy, these precognitive mechanisms.

526
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,080
Well, you were mentioning the limbic system as well. I mean, there's certainly a lot of

527
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,080
sort of...

528
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:01,240
Sure. I think one of the things is, again, the hierarchy of music development and how

529
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,520
it gets paired or how it's parallel to other aspects of functions. So something like the

530
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:12,200
structure of language is also parallel to the structure of music. So when somebody loses

531
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:18,520
the ability to verbally communicate, the structure of that sound can inform some of the linguistic

532
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:24,680
elements. I mean, there's so many... Same thing like the motor system has parallel pathways

533
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:31,920
to our processing of rhythm. So the motor system works on an on-off signaling system, right?

534
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:38,920
And so those shared pathways are very robust and shared by music as well as other kinds

535
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,960
of function. Different from other kinds of odds because...

536
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,960
Yeah, they are...

537
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,800
These are fundamental structures. But I think music arose or was developed out of the fundamental

538
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:57,360
structures that we as an animal species already had available to us. So again, movement as

539
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:04,080
representative of activity and feeling and sound as relative to feeling and emotion.

540
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:09,080
So I think music came out of our internal system.

541
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,080
So for thought.

542
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,080
Yeah.

543
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,440
For thought. Let's talk about neonates. You can put some.

544
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:22,880
So pre-verbal, you can't be any more pre-verbal than that. Neonates, while fetuses can distinguish

545
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,640
rhythm in about 16 weeks, long before they can distinguish moms, voice or anything like

546
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:40,160
that. We have a study that was done in 11 different NICUs that looked at entrainment,

547
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:49,760
which was something that you bought it before, in stabilizing and reducing O2 saturation,

548
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,720
heart rate and respiratory rate. And so these are... They couldn't be any more pre-verbal.

549
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:02,840
There's no such thing as music psychotherapy with a neonate, at least not verbally. But

550
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:11,160
through entrainment, not mechanical entrainment, we were able to stabilize and actually lower

551
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:16,240
heart rate and respiratory rate and stabilize and oxygen saturation.

552
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,480
In utero, you're saying?

553
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,480
No, these are neonates.

554
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,480
These are neonates.

555
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,480
Okay.

556
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,240
Thirty, two weeks, maybe.

557
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:27,280
Do we know if that kind of an approach would work with animals, non-human animals, at

558
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,280
least other primates?

559
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,920
I've never worked with animal babies, no.

560
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,880
I mean, that would be useful to know.

561
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,880
There weren't too many in the hospital.

562
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,880
Sorry.

563
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,520
That would be useful to know. It still wouldn't quite tell us about species specificity because

564
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:45,720
the in utero experiences might have differential exposures to music, although you can control

565
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,400
this with reared monkeys, of course. But I mean, it would be useful to understand whether

566
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,800
it's a very kind of low level physiological thing that would work on any mammal or at

567
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,480
least primates or, you know, tractors and words.

568
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,320
Yeah, this is what we're talking about, periodicity.

569
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,320
Yeah.

570
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,320
In the last four.

571
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,320
Sure.

572
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,320
Yeah.

573
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:13,880
I have a kind of hypothesis about these differences between language and music that most likely,

574
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,240
they both came from the same route, which is the vocal production.

575
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,720
So it was first signaling system in animals.

576
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,520
It's expression of well-being, expression of danger.

577
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,800
It's the vocal production.

578
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:35,800
So gradually it was development into two, like, bifurcation.

579
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:41,800
So one branch became language with precision of communication.

580
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,560
And here we come with ritzelages, et al.

581
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:49,000
The neurons that neurons were involved in creation of language.

582
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Okay.

583
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,040
So I'm just a little skeptical of the mirror.

584
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,040
Yeah.

585
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,120
But anyway, so anyway, somehow we came to those cognitive constants.

586
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:05,280
On the other side, we get emotional component of first signaling system going into music.

587
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,240
When it was discovered that sounds hips to two relationships, the hierarchy of those

588
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:16,120
relationships that allows us eventually to develop melodic thinking.

589
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:23,320
So we have rhythmic things, which are working for movement, for language, and for music,

590
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,520
but we have something very special that works only for music.

591
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,520
It's a relationship between musical sounds, tonal relationships, that allows to create

592
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,520
melodies.

593
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,120
And those relationships are very primitive.

594
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:44,800
So it doesn't matter what will listen, a simple melody or complex piece played by symphony.

595
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:52,120
It's the same very simple principle of tonal relationships that could be explained as interplay

596
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,360
between dissonant sounds and consonant sounds.

597
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,320
So we have difference in pitch.

598
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,840
And then not a lot of them.

599
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,640
We have very few elements of music.

600
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,000
The parsimonial of musical matter is fantastic.

601
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,520
There's basic seven elements, the atomic scale, plus five chromatic scales, and they repeated

602
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,440
the game cyclically.

603
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,000
But the relationship, this is what's interesting.

604
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,480
They work like phenomenal fills of gravity.

605
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,080
We have very stable tone, and we have all other tones, the difference pitch, that have

606
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,960
different level of attraction to this tone.

607
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,200
And this is how we travel in tonal space.

608
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,480
And we don't need to be trained to get it.

609
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,600
So there is no words in music.

610
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,640
We don't need to learn that this is mal or chord or chard or cad.

611
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,360
We just know, okay, this is something that's going on.

612
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,120
And we tune to that.

613
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:49,040
And there's just relationship between different musical sounds.

614
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,400
And it happens, I guess, on a very simple level.

615
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,720
We don't need to be trained to understand consonances.

616
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:02,640
So this is a little bit because we can see different responses, brain responses in newborn

617
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,880
for consonances and consonances.

618
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,680
And we can have studies, and we already have studies.

619
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:13,520
If you're two months old, you play for them consonances and they recognize it.

620
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:18,760
But at that point, they've had two months plus, you know, a few months in utero experiences

621
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,080
with Western tonal music, right?

622
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:28,280
And that's why recent work on the Tumani in Bolivia, this is led by Josh McDermott at

623
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:35,840
MIT suggesting that at least the valence aspect of consonances does not seem to be culturally

624
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,080
universal.

625
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:43,440
And even though people living right nearby in Bolivia who have had exposure to tonal

626
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:48,880
music do have a preference, albeit it's still not quite as strong as it is in MIT undergrads

627
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,600
or whatever his control group is in the US, the Tumani who have very different kind of

628
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:59,360
music, they just don't, they can tell the difference and they can do control tasks like

629
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:04,120
they will judge, you know, crying as sad and laughing as happy, but they don't have the

630
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:09,320
preference for consonant sounding as kind of happy and pleasant and the dissonant sounding.

631
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,320
Yeah, absolutely.

632
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,320
It's just interesting.

633
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,720
Recently they had a pilot study with adults, Lebacievsky.

634
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:23,320
And we, so we were looking into the variability of heart beat, heart rhythms, and we played

635
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,320
different music.

636
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:30,920
So one of the pieces which was loved every body was second movement from Mozart's concerta

637
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,160
I think when it's when it's third.

638
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,080
And everybody was just happy to listen to that.

639
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:43,880
As a contrast I took a P role there by Schoenberg which is quite dissonant.

640
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:49,320
I could imagine one of the participants was particularly attached to this space and I

641
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:56,160
was thinking how it happened, it's possible that those idioms from orthonomusic, they

642
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,720
kind of went into popular culture through films like suspensions, something good which

643
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,000
needs to happen and people like it.

644
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,280
So it's not necessarily a balance.

645
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,280
Oh yeah.

646
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:13,720
It's just different because there's a perception of dissonances, the consonances, its body

647
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:20,800
responses perceive tension and there was studies starting from 80s that demonstrated that this

648
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:26,000
perceived tonal tension actually translates into physical tension.

649
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,840
This is why I like so much your thoughts about enrollment of motor system because I believe

650
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:41,480
that when we listen to music it's not just rhythm that involves, let's say, our like

651
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:53,760
basal ganglion but it's built into system of muscle responses, fleeting responses to

652
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,360
music and this is how people memorize melody perhaps.

653
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:03,800
It's not that they remember just auditory information.

654
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,320
It's possible, it's just a hypothesis.

655
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:14,200
It's possible that it's our body, but remember those fleeting muscle responses to melodic

656
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:20,320
information and this is why music is so available because motor responses, they are the simplest

657
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,320
ones.

658
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,720
The feeling of tension is pre-meval.

659
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,640
If something not right, they are tense.

660
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,640
Is everything okay?

661
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,640
They are relaxed and this is what music exploits.

662
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:40,560
You are saying it's just a kind of thing but if you look at individuals who were either

663
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:46,800
born paralyzed or lacking limbs, they can certainly experience music in arguably as

664
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,800
richly.

665
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,960
It's not the case that the motor system is a core part of experiencing or enjoyment.

666
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,240
It's just something to keep in mind.

667
01:01:53,240 --> 01:02:02,440
I'm thinking about studies that Sandra Treehop had done about language development in newborns.

668
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:10,680
How their ability to process a range really close sounds at birth are all similar no matter

669
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,920
what part of the world they come from.

670
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:19,360
As they get exposed to their mother tongue, just being in the environment with other

671
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:25,080
adults, that window of change happens pretty rapidly.

672
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:30,960
They stop perceiving these nuances of microtones between pitch and actually start going to

673
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,560
whatever is the most constant in their native tongue.

674
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:40,760
So I think all children when they're born have a broad range of perception as long as

675
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,720
there's no damage to the auditory cortex.

676
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:48,920
So it's cultural how these other nuances.

677
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:53,280
Even the visual response, I'm thinking we were just talking about Joe Lidue's work in

678
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,200
memory and trauma.

679
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:01,680
A newborn who doesn't have the ability to understand the word around them is only developing

680
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,040
visual memory from birth.

681
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:09,080
Because they can't put things into contextual meaning because it's all experience.

682
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:14,280
And so a lot of trauma that becomes really deep seated are these visual memories that

683
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:19,720
become part of our makeup that we don't know about until somebody helps this process that

684
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,120
they're coming from.

685
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:27,160
So a lot of why early, early development is on the visual system, for sure.

686
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:30,440
Because we don't have the cognitive constructs to make sense of it yet.

687
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:34,680
You know it's interesting hearing you talk about how the brain is a very efficient mechanism

688
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:40,000
and it will pare down those pathways that it doesn't need anymore.

689
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:47,160
And Jamshed Barucha, who for many years was at Tufts and then at the new school, grew

690
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:53,080
up playing both Western and Indian classical music and did an interesting presentation

691
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:58,240
at a World Science Festival panel that we did some years ago where he just kind of drew

692
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:04,440
all of these connecting lines between, you know, it was just like a schematic diagram

693
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:11,560
of neurons and how, you know, if you'd grown up in one set or another, all of these lines

694
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:14,960
would have disappeared and you would have these 12.

695
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:21,520
But growing up in two different traditions simultaneously, he had all these neural connections

696
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:28,800
and for him the idea of the kind of the flattered sixth and seventh of certain raga scales was

697
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:35,640
as natural as the perfect fifth and, you know, the major third, which by the way, if you

698
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:41,840
hold a major third for a long time, it is crushingly dissonant.

699
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:49,320
Our major third is the Western major third is off by a tiny fraction that when held over

700
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:57,120
a long period of time becomes increasingly clear to the, whereas if you're, you know,

701
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:02,200
because we, our Western sense of harmony is a human creation.

702
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:06,840
The Bodger's, yeah, but you're this beautiful, overtone serious based skill.

703
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,960
Our third is, it should be a ratio of four to three, but our third is the twelfth root

704
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:12,960
of two.

705
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:13,960
Because we can not.

706
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:14,960
And irrational, non repeating.

707
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:20,520
Well, it makes me think when, you know, when I was talking to people at Yamaha when they

708
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:27,480
developing the digital keyboards, one of their challenges was to make the acoustic experience

709
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:32,120
rich enough because when the well-tempered clavier was developed, you know, Beethoven

710
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:40,640
was composing for the string instrument or Bach, sorry, but, but composers at that time.

711
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:46,480
And I'm thinking about Beethoven only because certain pieces that were done with violin

712
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:54,880
and piano were done in certain keys because of the acoustic response of like an E flat

713
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,320
and the key of E flat with the violin and the piano as opposed to if you were playing

714
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:04,480
by Hopsichord, you know, or something else, you know, where it wouldn't been as close.

715
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,440
Yes, fantastic, fantastic case of the simplicity.

716
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:15,080
What happened during the, during the 16th century, the temperate scale was actually discovered

717
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:20,000
mathematically in China for completely different reasons.

718
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,920
And then Europeans knew about that at the end of the 16th century.

719
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,200
And they did not want to apply it purely to the beginning of the 20th century.

720
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,400
They tried to dance around that.

721
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:37,040
So if you look at historical tuning, they all tried somehow how to salvage the naturally

722
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,400
solid scale.

723
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:44,640
And well-tempered clavier was one of the variants of temperament Bach liked that.

724
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:51,960
And the well-tempered clavity, you have penalties with, you know, modest key signature which

725
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:58,440
are closer to natural scale than the nullities with extended kisig which are like 5-6.

726
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,360
They really sound bad.

727
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,200
But most likely he used that.

728
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,560
Well, but even Bach, you know, when he sat down and composed, he had to first decide,

729
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,760
am I using Verkmeister 3 or Kurnburger 2?

730
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:15,760
I mean, he had all these positive tunings available to him.

731
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,360
And they all had different effects.

732
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,360
That was the point.

733
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:23,920
There was a famous treatise called the affect in Lara, the doctrine of effects by Johann

734
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,480
Matheson probably in the 18th century.

735
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:34,360
And Pythagoras did this, you know, 2000 years earlier, where he went through all of the

736
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:37,560
keys and said, you know, the emotional impact.

737
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,800
This is the emotion.

738
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:45,200
This is the, this is the effect of E-flat, which is why Mozart saved E-flat for certain

739
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:51,440
things and G-minor for certain other things, C-major, you know, for the coronation mass,

740
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,560
you know, because they felt those differences.

741
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:59,040
And there was a whole kind of scientific, quote unquote, you know, scientific as they

742
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:06,720
were in the 18th century, trying to figure out what each scale did to us, did to us emotionally.

743
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:11,320
So, so are the way we perceive dissonance is actually evolving?

744
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,320
Absolutely.

745
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:18,920
Oh, yeah, because E7, sharp nine is not an ending chord until you listen to Jimi Hendrix,

746
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:19,920
right?

747
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,920
That's right.

748
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:26,360
And it's evolving not just as we go along, you know, as a culture, but it evolves in each

749
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:32,880
of us individually because, you know, if I, as a kid, I would have heard Marla and just

750
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,920
thought, what's that noise, you know?

751
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:42,720
You have to grow into a, you know, you have to evolve your own sense of hearing.

752
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:46,680
Otherwise, I mean, this kind of brings us right back to where we started because if it doesn't

753
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,600
mean something to you, you can't use it.

754
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:55,000
And that's why there's no, in music therapy, why it's such a process because we don't know

755
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,960
what that person's life experiences with music.

756
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:03,560
And we don't know how we can use that music to really reach the elements or to achieve

757
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,840
the goals that we want to achieve or they want to achieve, we want to help them.

758
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:12,640
So it is this detective work, you can find out who they were, what was their life experience,

759
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,840
how does their body respond to sound, how did they mentally respond to sound, what are

760
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:20,200
the associations and feelings they have to sound.

761
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,040
So all of that comes into play.

762
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,240
I mean, it's like being a good doctor too.

763
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:28,400
I mean, somebody comes in with all these symptoms, you have a sort of a checklist of things

764
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,960
it's not, you know, and then you try to figure out and hone in where it's coming from.

765
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:39,440
You can see therapy is sort of pulling on a thread and seeing what comes along with it.

766
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:44,240
Do you remember in the 1980s, you know, at the height of the New Age music movement,

767
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:48,880
there were all these records coming out that made claims of being quote unquote healing

768
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,880
music.

769
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,320
Personally, I found this stuff to be like itching pattern.

770
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,320
I know, yes, yes.

771
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,320
It was like crazy.

772
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,320
What is this?

773
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,320
What does it heal?

774
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:04,800
I mean, this is a therapist, one of my pet peeves is this idea of the healing power of

775
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,800
music.

776
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:13,200
Well, as far as I know, there's no empirical evidence that music heals anything at all,

777
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,800
but it can certainly be used in a healing process.

778
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,280
Did I stir something up here?

779
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,280
Yes.

780
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:26,720
We still did not mention very important system, the biological reward system, that music

781
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,840
is able to activate.

782
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:34,800
It was found that extremely pleasurable music activates nuclear circumstance, which is

783
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,720
the star of our biological reward system.

784
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:44,040
So maybe it's one of the explanations to a diminishing sense of pain that's kind of

785
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,880
distracted.

786
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:53,360
I don't know if it's explanation for people who have better recovery from stroke when

787
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:59,760
they listen to music as compared to listening to books or white notes.

788
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,360
Anybody wants to talk about?

789
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,360
The pleasure.

790
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,840
And do you think that they did find an effect?

791
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,680
You're talking about the Finnish study?

792
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,000
It was studied by Zatora in 2001.

793
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
This was the chilled one.

794
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,520
There was also one that was passive listening.

795
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,520
That was the passive listening.

796
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:25,400
And basically ganglia modus system, so there's sound effects, all these different systems

797
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:29,560
in our body, and each one of them has a different effect with music.

798
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,680
It's actually strange why.

799
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,120
What is it in this language?

800
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:40,760
The biological reward system is also activated by food, sex, drugs, money, and something

801
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,760
very tangible.

802
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,880
What is it about music that it's suddenly enters the same company?

803
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:52,280
In the blood and blood and laboratory study, each they studied 15 musicians, I think it

804
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,680
was 15 professional musicians, and each one had a common with their piece of music that

805
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:00,800
gave them the chills and their very specific measure in the piece of the music so they

806
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,040
could do the imaging.

807
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:07,360
What they used as a control was each other's piece of music.

808
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:14,160
And so the person who responded to the Argentinian tango music didn't respond to the coal train

809
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,240
in the same way.

810
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,640
So again, it shows us that our emotional response is to music, a really life based on

811
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,320
life experience.

812
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:27,640
Not so much the rewards a system is developed based on our personal experience with the

813
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,640
music.

814
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,280
Or maybe it drives the emotional system first, and that's why we gravitate toward it.

815
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,480
Aesthetic emotion.

816
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,600
It's such a difficult thing to parse.

817
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,000
So it's presence of beauty.

818
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,320
It's cultural construct that you grew up.

819
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,200
Your personal memories and your psychological makeup.

820
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,680
It's all just confound.

821
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,680
That's not universal.

822
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,680
That's very subjective.

823
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,680
Yeah.

824
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,680
Very individual.

825
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:54,680
Very individual.

826
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:58,360
But this also goes back to something that you were talking about before, which is the

827
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,440
kind of the predictive.

828
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:05,520
I mean, what music does is it plays with, which is why we like repetition in music.

829
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,640
The brain is very happy to be able to predict what comes up.

830
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,800
I hear a one, four, five chord progression.

831
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,360
I'm betting it's going back to the one, and when it does, it's like the brain goes,

832
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,880
ah, I knew it.

833
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,720
But the brain also likes the surprise.

834
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,160
Yes, it's right.

835
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,160
Which is why.

836
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:28,440
When people talk about the money note in a song, it's like usually when you hit the

837
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:35,400
note that you expect to hear in the melody, but the harmony underneath it has modulated.

838
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,960
And suddenly it's like, wow, what was that?

839
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:46,600
So it's not like the cell phone interrupting the symphony, but it is, it's a very fine

840
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:51,000
balance between being able to predict and the element of surprise.

841
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
That's absolutely right.

842
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,360
I just want to also mention that there is some beautiful work in the developmental

843
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:03,080
literature suggesting that infants at various points and age have some optimal amount of

844
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,160
information that they like.

845
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,760
So the signal is, and you can imagine doing something very, very simple, like showing

846
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,480
them sequences of familiar objects.

847
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:15,040
And they get really bored if they get shown the same thing over and over again.

848
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,600
And they also get bored if they're shown completely unpredictable sequences.

849
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:23,360
But there is some optimal amount of kind of predictability and surprise, then they'll

850
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,160
pay attention for longer and longer.

851
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,520
And then of course that also changes.

852
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,920
The amount of information we can handle changes as we develop.

853
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,560
But it's certainly the case that there may be something really fundamental about repetition

854
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:40,120
and music, and that's why maybe at the very young age we get so interested.

855
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:44,040
I mean, you know, those of you who have kids know that kids like repetition, right?

856
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,360
They'll have the same book right over to them.

857
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:50,800
Like so many times in their own, it's like there's clearly not much new information.

858
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,480
But they like the fact that they know what's going to happen in the story and they can

859
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,960
kind of participate in this.

860
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,720
And so now the question of why we came up with a system like music that uses that repetition,

861
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,440
I mean that's a very interesting question that goes back to the evolutionary question.

862
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:05,360
But for the evolution, I just want to mention one thing.

863
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:10,080
So indeed there is a hypothesis that music and language somehow co-evolved through vocal

864
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,080
communication.

865
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,600
But there's also a strong alternative which is actually now perhaps the dominant hypothesis

866
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,120
for the language evolution, which has nothing to do with vocal communication, but instead

867
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,480
has to do with gesture.

868
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:25,560
And a lot of the observations basically come from the fact that in primates and vocal signals

869
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,680
are very, very constrained and very context dependent.

870
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:33,560
So they'll have a very particular signal for this kind of predator, that kind of a predator.

871
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:41,000
And a system like gesture is much more tied to the kind of social cognitive mechanisms

872
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:48,320
that are evolving over the course of the last few million years where something like trying

873
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:52,800
to get someone's attention by manipulating an object and trying to see if you get like

874
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,240
shared eye contact on something that I'm trying to do your attention or something like that.

875
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:03,240
So a few theorists have now argued that actually language may have come about through the motor

876
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,880
system through gestural and potentially no body.

877
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:14,480
But I think this is basically the erytzologist and his group ideas that it's gesture, it's

878
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,480
a moment of gesture.

879
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,880
Well, it's a full gesture.

880
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,360
A lot of people have made those arguments.

881
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,320
If you read like if you actually read the way that Rizalati talks about it, it's very,

882
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,800
very vague and underspecified.

883
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,800
It's true.

884
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,800
It's a very vague way.

885
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,800
So if that's satisfying, I do not know.

886
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,800
I do not know.

887
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,800
I do not know.

888
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,800
This is a beginning.

889
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:32,800
This is a beginning.

890
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,800
Yeah, like in everything else, it's a beginning.

891
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,720
I am not sure if you want to begin with vague things always.

892
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:39,720
But anyway, it's debatable.

893
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:45,360
But they do believe that music is basically an emotional component of vocal communication.

894
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:53,600
Well, Stephen Finker famously just considered it an offshoot of eye product, a beautiful

895
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,000
one, but just an accidental eye product.

896
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,760
Yeah, an auditory cheesecake.

897
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:04,800
And then you have someone like Gary Livingston at Yale who posits that the two grew up on

898
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:11,280
parallel tracks from a similar kind of urge to express oneself.

899
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:41,240
I would like to hear a response to a certain bias or a sum.

900
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:54,000
I think we generally have, not only in this discussion.

901
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:01,400
First is the assumption that music is about sound, but there are a lot of other aspects

902
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,400
to it.

903
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,880
I mean, there's a social aspect.

904
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:14,840
I mean, it's been mentioned a visual aspect, which I think are, you know, they're asonic

905
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:20,760
elements, but I don't think they're less important than the sonic aspect.

906
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:30,240
And the other one is the notion that music therapy is beneficial.

907
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:36,600
Well, you know, strong medicines sometimes have undesirable side effects.

908
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:40,640
And I'd like to hear if there is something like that.

909
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:47,360
In other words, I think we need something like that to fill out a picture of what the boundaries

910
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,520
of this phenomenon are.

911
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,840
Well, I could definitely speak to the negative effects of music.

912
01:18:53,840 --> 01:19:02,200
So when people talk about music can be therapeutically beneficial, some of the dangers because of

913
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:06,640
the things we spoke about are the negative effects of music.

914
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:12,400
And people, I mean, people who have epileptic seizures, for example, can be prone to seizures

915
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:18,000
if a rhythmic pattern is too strong of the volume or the frequency of the sound is too

916
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
much.

917
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,960
So, you know, the emotional memories associated with certain types of music, playing that

918
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,160
music for that person could be very traumatic.

919
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:30,520
So similar to medicine, where you have trials and you see what works and doesn't work, you

920
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:35,920
have to be really careful to not just say music is very therapeutic for everybody, because

921
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,640
each person is going to have a different response that's all.

922
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,080
So I'll speak to that piece and you guys could speak to the first part.

923
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:46,440
I'd like to say something about what your first question about or your comment about

924
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,240
other benefits of music.

925
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:54,920
One of the things that we use in our enhancement of melodic intonation therapy is the injection

926
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,600
or interjection, I should say, of musical thinking.

927
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:06,520
And so one of the ways that we empower the patient to take on the therapy themselves is

928
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:10,360
by training them to create their own target.

929
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:15,840
So people with severe nonfluidophasia can't get started when they want to say something.

930
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:22,080
They know what they want to say, it's infuriatingly frustrating for them because they have exactly

931
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,440
what they want to say in mind and no way to get it out.

932
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:30,520
So the way that the therapy actually works is that therapists would hum first what the

933
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,920
phrase is going to sound like and give the target phrase.

934
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:39,720
And once they're trained to do this, they learn how to sing on the inside before they

935
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:44,440
open their mouth because the mouth takes them down a motor path that they can't get off,

936
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:48,360
they get stuck in this loop and they keep saying the same thing over and over and over

937
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,000
what they don't mean to say.

938
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,440
So if they think first and hear it inside and then do this in a rehearsal as a musician

939
01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:00,640
would if you're going to practice something on your own.

940
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:07,400
Then they begin to learn how to not only make their own target but to begin to self-assess

941
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,600
and troubleshoot as they go.

942
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:15,960
And if you stretch these sounds out and the beauty of the singing is the connected speech

943
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:21,800
because non-tluent aphasic can get out of burst and the burst and the burst and maybe

944
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:26,760
it's just the initial consonant and they keep on repeating that like a stutter.

945
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:33,120
But if you breathe first and you make this breathing part of your inner target setting

946
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,680
and your inner rehearsal, you breathe and then you put it out in one piece, they don't

947
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,920
lose it in the middle.

948
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,360
They're able to keep their whole thought together, they're able to keep that whole piece of

949
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,360
whatever.

950
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,160
And it doesn't really matter what the music part sounds like.

951
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:52,800
It's about that thinking and that when they walk out the door they're not stuck with a

952
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,760
set of 20 phrases to practice.

953
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,840
They've got their own thoughts which they can then get out by using musical thinking

954
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:05,840
and a musical process without the music really being the important part.

955
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,600
So that's just one example.

956
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,360
I'm sure you have a ton of those.

957
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:15,680
Connie said about the dangers of indiscriminate use of music and therapy.

958
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:22,520
Let's say I'm in radiation oncology in the waiting room and I really like stairway to

959
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,520
heaven.

960
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,120
I think that's a nice song.

961
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:30,760
We're knocking on heaven's door, something I really like to listen to.

962
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:31,760
Right.

963
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,120
You get a little bit.

964
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,320
Another thing, neonates.

965
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:42,960
It is very easy to overstimulate the neonate with prerecorded music that's just left on.

966
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:50,080
Even somebody in the coma, too much arousal could be detrimental in the early stages.

967
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:54,240
Somebody who's in the vegetative state, they could still have a level of arousal but too

968
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:57,840
much sensory stimulation can actually be adverse.

969
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,880
So really being careful about what's...

970
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,840
Can I just close the whole up?

971
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,920
So there are real issues with the use of music.

972
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,120
I'm just curious if there have been any attempts.

973
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:12,000
So I'm actually very interested in the social component.

974
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,840
And it seems like even in the kind of therapy that you guys do, it's like very...

975
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,440
Well, I don't want to say easy but it may be one of the easier things to try to pull

976
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:24,040
apart and see what's the presence of you sitting there playing a guitar versus you sitting

977
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:28,200
there and talking versus hearing a recording of you but maybe having a curtain, right?

978
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,600
So that they can't actually see the person.

979
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,800
And just kind of try to pull apart and figure out which bit of it is.

980
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,400
Because I would really enjoy having you and playing guitar.

981
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,280
Having you sit here and play guitar for me, that's lovely, right?

982
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,560
I mean, who wouldn't like that?

983
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,080
But the question is, what is it that's particularly helpful?

984
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,880
Is it the social bit?

985
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,440
Yeah, so interaction.

986
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,280
Music therapy is at practice.

987
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,520
Music psychotherapy, it's about relationship with patient.

988
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,320
It's about the space that's created between two people.

989
01:23:53,320 --> 01:24:03,000
And music can be the motor or the context for that...for forwarding that relationship.

990
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,600
You know, we did a study once...

991
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:08,480
I don't want to take away from your questions but we did a study once where we did try the

992
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,840
control for the social aspect.

993
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:16,280
And so we were looking at people, homebound adults who had depression and who had medically

994
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,640
complex issues.

995
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:24,080
And so we had the music therapists go and visit them and engage them in active music

996
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,080
making.

997
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:29,680
But then we had a social worker, a recreation type person who would be the social visit

998
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:35,520
with that one-to-one contact with them and play games, maybe chess or cards or something

999
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,160
like that, right?

1000
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:41,800
What was interesting is that the psychiatrist that was the psychologist who was doing the

1001
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:46,240
testing was blinded to who was in which treatment.

1002
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:51,200
And there was one group that just had the traditional psychotherapy treatment or medication treatment

1003
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,360
that they had.

1004
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:57,560
So the person who just had the traditional treatment, actually the depression went up,

1005
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:04,360
increased the person, both the social one and the music therapy situation both had a

1006
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,960
decrease.

1007
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:09,800
But the music therapy intervention was decreased by half.

1008
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,200
So it was the music too, nice.

1009
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,200
That's an excellent...

1010
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,160
So I think that goes to your social aspect of music.

1011
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:24,640
There's a communal aspect of a shared experience that is more than just the person, but it adds

1012
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,640
to the person.

1013
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:29,800
So there's something therapeutic about people moving and being together.

1014
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,440
But the music adds another level to that.

1015
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:45,160
Actually, what I was thinking of was a particular piece of music, which is, I forget the title,

1016
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,160
the John Cage.

1017
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,160
Oh, the silence is the other.

1018
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,160
It's that, right?

1019
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,160
What 33?

1020
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,160
The silent piece?

1021
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,160
433?

1022
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,160
Yes.

1023
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,160
What 33?

1024
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,160
Right.

1025
01:25:56,160 --> 01:26:05,920
And I think that's a music without any kind of sound which is prescribed.

1026
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:14,920
And certainly it has very big social aspects that no recording can come even close to.

1027
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:21,080
Which brings us to the challenges of music experience because all those other nuances

1028
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:26,920
of the experience itself adds to the perception of music.

1029
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:30,280
There is a recording of the first performance of 433.

1030
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,760
That's true.

1031
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:36,360
It took place in an open air shed in upstate New York.

1032
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,200
It is utterly beautiful.

1033
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:43,240
There's no quote unquote music, but it was gently raining.

1034
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:47,240
And the birds, there are no walls, so you hear the birds.

1035
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:51,640
I mean, it's a beautiful way to spend 4 minutes and 33 seconds.

1036
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,240
The piano was never touched.

1037
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:57,160
The pianist turns the page at the end of the first movement, turns the page at the end

1038
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:02,480
of the second movement, and the rest is the music of the world around.

1039
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,480
Yes.

1040
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:06,280
Okay, go ahead.

1041
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:09,880
First of all, this is fascinating.

1042
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,280
So thank you for this.

1043
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,280
I wanted to ask.

1044
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:16,480
Well, first, I wanted to just talk about when you're talking about the evolution of music

1045
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,480
and language.

1046
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:23,440
I've often heard it theorized that the baby's hearing the heartbeat for weeks at a time.

1047
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:26,800
And so the rhythm is just entrained.

1048
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,280
I don't know how you would ever actually prove that.

1049
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:39,240
Also, in the early days, the importance of timing and rhythm as far as hunting and surviving.

1050
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:44,600
My question is, sorry, let me just get my breath.

1051
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:50,400
My question is, we're talking about with music therapy often.

1052
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:56,760
I don't know what diseases, but when there's some sign of recognition to music, I'm just

1053
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,840
curious why there wouldn't be also maybe a hint of recognition from a relative's voice.

1054
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:10,120
I'm curious, what is it that you're not my own language to help?

1055
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,120
I think the comparison.

1056
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:18,400
One of the rationales for why music is more resilient than just simple voice is because

1057
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,920
of the other dynamic elements involved in music.

1058
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:31,320
Then the voice, although it has tone, is very linear or not as dimensional as music.

1059
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:36,240
Whereas music has rhythm, harmony, speechless too.

1060
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:41,480
The emotional aspect, a lot of the recognition, you would think that somebody's voice would

1061
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:47,720
have the same emotional response or arousal.

1062
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:54,600
It seems that the complexity of music is, which is a lot more recruits so many more networks

1063
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:58,480
in the brain than the actual sound of somebody's voice.

1064
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:03,120
Some smells have also this very powerful ability to bring this back.

1065
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:08,880
Dementia and some diseases like Parkinson's, the olfactory cortex, that sense of smell

1066
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:15,480
is one of the first signs that there's a problem that that diminishes early on.

1067
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:19,360
Thank you.

1068
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,120
This has been fascinating.

1069
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:29,360
Now, you're talking primarily about the most complex organ and progress and understanding

1070
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,560
it has been very, very slow.

1071
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:35,840
I've been watching some of it, but not all of it.

1072
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:43,600
Nancy Kenweiser was at Rockville yesterday and outlined some of the recent research.

1073
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:50,440
We've got new tools, MRI, PET scanning, transcranial stimulation.

1074
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:54,760
How do you see research in this area going forward?

1075
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,520
Can I answer that?

1076
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,800
I'll tell you.

1077
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:07,320
Last month, I was at NIH with 20 neuroscientists, music therapists, and 12 neuroscientists at

1078
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:13,960
the invitation of Francis Collins because there's been great interest in how the brain

1079
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:18,160
works and understanding complex systems.

1080
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:24,440
But trying to understand, is there a therapeutic aspect to music?

1081
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:28,680
Can we study that in a very conservative way?

1082
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:37,400
They've made the commitment to start funding music brain research.

1083
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:41,440
The initial partnership is with the Kennedy Center and NIH, and there's actually a big

1084
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:49,040
conference on June 3, where they present some of the present research, but this is Francis

1085
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:53,960
Collins says they're going to dedicate effort to this because it really speaks to the complexity

1086
01:30:53,960 --> 01:31:00,360
of our brain and how systems integrate on very fundamental levels as well as very complex

1087
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:01,360
levels.

1088
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:05,240
So it's not so much studying music for the aesthetic aspect of music, but actually studying

1089
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:08,560
it to really understand how complex systems operate.

1090
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:15,560
That's the best news out of Washington.

1091
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:32,200
I was interested if there were any big cases from musicians or people who had interactions

1092
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:35,800
with music that were driving the research forward.

1093
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,120
I had two possible.

1094
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:45,600
There was a jazz guitarist named Pat Martino who had amnesia, and then he, I believe he

1095
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,600
taught himself to play guitar by only listening to his own records.

1096
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:56,040
And then there was Edwin Collins, who was a Scottish singer.

1097
01:31:56,040 --> 01:32:02,800
I saw him, he had a massive aneurysm, and I saw him perform after, and he had to walk

1098
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:10,880
with a cane to get to his place on the stage, and his speech was very difficult to understand

1099
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:17,680
as he was introducing his songs until he started singing, and it was like the record.

1100
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:25,800
That really speaks to the resiliency of those overlapping mechanisms that remain despite

1101
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:26,800
injury.

1102
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:32,520
So with Pat Martino, he had, my memory, needing him, he was at one of our conferences.

1103
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:37,960
He had a stroke, and actually had to play, learn to play the guitar again.

1104
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:43,600
But once he did, that mood and memory came back, and another person was Ruth Brown, the

1105
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:49,080
R&B singer, who lost his speech, totally after stroke, and actually got his speech back by

1106
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:52,320
listening to her own recordings and singing along.

1107
01:32:52,320 --> 01:33:02,320
Well, I don't know if there are big cases, but we have a stroke choir at the Lewis

1108
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:06,880
Armstrong Center for Music and Medicine that takes place every Monday afternoon at five

1109
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,480
o'clock.

1110
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:16,040
And it is related to an IRB study, which we're conducting, and we do have some stroke patients

1111
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:20,240
who are musicians who are in that.

1112
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:26,440
And what I can say, I don't have access to the data yet because the study's unfinished.

1113
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:36,480
But there is a very easily observable change in getting back some of the skills that they

1114
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:39,080
had, as well as speech.

1115
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:46,480
Are they able to recover things that, through music, that maybe non-musicians might not be

1116
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,480
able to recover?

1117
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,480
I have no answer.

1118
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,280
These kinds of comparisons are really hard to make.

1119
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:56,800
And you'd want a group that's match for IQ and all sorts of other socioeconomic things.

1120
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,800
There's some interest right now.

1121
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:03,440
In fact, some of the sciences who presented a couple of weeks ago were talking about

1122
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,400
the type of enhanced networks that get developed with music.

1123
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:11,360
I'm thinking of Nina Kraus and some of her work at Northwestern about, for example, a

1124
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:17,160
good example is a person, no matter how many music lessons you had when you were a child,

1125
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:22,200
when you're older, even if you haven't played the musical instrument, you can actually discern

1126
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:27,200
sound to noise better than a person who was a non-musician, who had never had musical

1127
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,200
training.

1128
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:33,480
So the idea that you can process complex sound or separate meaningful sound in the noisy

1129
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:38,320
environment is enhanced through purely having music lessons as a child.

1130
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:43,520
We had a patient who was a percussionist who had a stroke and they had a right-side paralysis

1131
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,160
and a pericis.

1132
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:50,760
And the traditional rehab therapy is to really focus on the good side and really allow that

1133
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:53,240
side to sort of take over function.

1134
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:56,880
But because he was a percussionist, he already had bilateral representation of the motor

1135
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:57,880
system.

1136
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:05,000
So he already had another representation of his right hand to work on, even though he

1137
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,680
had lost that motorability after the stroke.

1138
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:13,000
So what they started doing is having them do bilateral exercises where he actually gained

1139
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,920
the right side back.

1140
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:16,920
Thank you.

1141
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:20,600
Hi, everyone.

1142
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,600
My name is Ann.

1143
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:25,120
I want to just thank you so much for being here.

1144
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:29,480
I have a background in jazz as a jazz musician.

1145
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:34,720
And I also just recently finished my master's in speech pathology at the BU.

1146
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:40,440
And we got to, I got to be a co-founder of the Phasia community choir up there.

1147
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,840
I'm sorry, I'm so excited.

1148
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,840
I'm so excited.

1149
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:50,560
This whole talk and everything I've learned in the past three years has me excited to

1150
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,560
tears.

1151
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:55,440
And I just am so happy to now bring this back into my practice.

1152
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,440
And my question is very practical.

1153
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:04,920
I'm living out in New Jersey now and getting ready to go into practice.

1154
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:11,280
And even though we all embrace these benefits and we also want to be very careful about

1155
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:15,760
how we talk about the research and be very balanced.

1156
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:21,600
And there's a lot of clinics and places, you know, even in this area in this day and age

1157
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:26,120
that are still surprised to hear, oh my gosh, a stroke patient could sing and he couldn't

1158
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:27,120
talk.

1159
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,760
And it's a very new concept.

1160
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:37,200
And I want to be able to talk about bringing my experience and my clinic practice into

1161
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:41,600
these facilities, whether it's a sniff or a private clinic.

1162
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:47,400
And I'm having a hard time starting the conversation when people kind of have this idea that,

1163
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:48,600
oh, isn't that nice?

1164
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:53,120
Some music therapy in the speech clinic room, isn't that nice?

1165
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:55,920
It's a nice quality of life thing.

1166
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:00,480
But is it really clinically, like some of the other questions have been asked, clinically

1167
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,480
valid?

1168
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:07,200
And how to get that conversation going and maintain it and keep it going?

1169
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,640
I would love to hear your discussion about that.

1170
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:13,000
That challenge has been going on for a very long time.

1171
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,760
I think the challenge, and we talk about this in the field of music therapy all the time,

1172
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:23,960
is that music is so much a part of our experience, everybody's experience, that we sort of devalue

1173
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:26,240
the therapeutic aspects of it.

1174
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:31,960
And so you think of music as an art form, you don't think of it as a treatment.

1175
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:36,480
And I think that's both the American Music Therapy Association and other organizations

1176
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:43,680
have been doing a lot of advocacy at the state level and at the federal level to inform people

1177
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:47,200
about the therapeutic, the real research.

1178
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:52,800
One of my institute, the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function, was founded back

1179
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:58,480
in the 20-something years ago to really bridge the field of emerging neuroscience at that

1180
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,600
time and clinical music therapy.

1181
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,000
So both could inform each other in advanced practice.

1182
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:09,160
I think doctors and people in the medical profession no longer just say that's really

1183
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:15,160
nice and sweet because they understand that there's other mechanisms at work in recovery

1184
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:19,040
and it's not just one treatment fits for all.

1185
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:23,320
Because we're starting to understand the complexity of neurologic function that we can start

1186
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:25,520
to appreciate what music does.

1187
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,720
And so I think people are more receptive.

1188
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:32,920
What's going to drive it, I think, is, I won't say money because that's not going to help

1189
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:38,080
but somebody had made a comment, if you could make money off of this, there'd be a lot more

1190
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:41,120
people behind it.

1191
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:44,120
And like the pharmaceuticals is something like that.

1192
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:50,520
So I think the other thing is that if consumers, if there was enough consumer experience that

1193
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:58,440
they demanded it, the Centers for Alternative Medicine at NIH were formed because consumers

1194
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:03,640
started asking for certain kinds of alternative medicines and the government was challenged

1195
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:07,280
with the need to research it.

1196
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,560
Nine billion dollars out of pocket in 2000.

1197
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:10,560
Right.

1198
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:11,560
And that's what was happening.

1199
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:16,840
And what if as parents of kids with autism or people who've had strokes who are learning

1200
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:22,160
to recover speech as they learn and hear about what music therapy can do, they're going to

1201
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:23,720
start asking for it.

1202
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:27,960
And the more people are informed, it's like we have to do this major P or marketing campaign

1203
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,200
and educate the general public.

1204
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,560
But there's good research now.

1205
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:35,720
There's good scientific research because we can understand and see these brain make that

1206
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:36,960
we couldn't see.

1207
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,960
And all of our doctors, Saks and I back in the 80s, early 80s, actually met with a group

1208
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:45,560
of neuroscientists and said, can you help us study music in the brain?

1209
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:47,680
And they said, no, you can't study music.

1210
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:48,680
Look how complex it is.

1211
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,680
It's so many different things.

1212
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,680
But now we are.

1213
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:55,240
Now we're able to piece a plot of different elements of it.

1214
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:59,040
One thing that, again, I don't have a sense of how big the field of music therapy is.

1215
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:01,480
And I realized that there's many different kinds of disorders.

1216
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:06,960
But one thing that I would find helpful is as a basic scientist, I'm sure patients would

1217
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:07,960
find that helpful.

1218
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:12,600
It's often to have a unified website that would have links to all of the good research.

1219
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,200
Because there's such a wealth of research.

1220
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:18,240
And it's often really hard to evaluate the qualities of maybe some kind of studies that

1221
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,200
at least have been maybe replicated once.

1222
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:22,800
There's actually some white papers.

1223
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,760
There's a couple of white papers on the American music therapy.

1224
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,640
So musictherapy.org.

1225
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:33,560
And if you go to conditions, there's actually pieces on PTSD and early childhood development

1226
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:34,560
in the learning.

1227
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,040
You'd be nice to have it all in one place.

1228
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:39,680
Like climate change people now have really nice websites with a lot of needs.

1229
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:40,680
And to have it categorized.

1230
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:41,680
Exactly.

1231
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:42,680
So that's a good idea.

1232
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:48,520
So some of the places where you can have people look are clinicaltrials.gov.

1233
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:55,360
So anything that's ongoing now or has been finished, that they can then look up the research,

1234
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,600
that's a good place for people to look.

1235
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:02,240
And the other thing is one of the things that I find or we have found over the years is

1236
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,080
people are concerned.

1237
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,560
I'm not a singer, they'll say.

1238
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,560
I can't do that.

1239
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:07,720
I'm not a singer.

1240
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:11,760
And the important thing to let people know is it's not about being a singer.

1241
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:18,040
It's about being a person who has this preserved area in their brain if it's a stroke person

1242
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,360
or somebody that's had a traumatic brain injury.

1243
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:23,200
They've got a part of their brain that works.

1244
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,680
And there's a very nice, there are a couple of very nice apps.

1245
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:30,360
I don't know if you know about these brain apps that you can show a 3D brain to people.

1246
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:34,200
You can turn it around and show them this is the part of your brain that's not working

1247
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:35,480
the way it used to.

1248
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:37,680
We're going to train this part over here.

1249
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:42,040
And so they feel like I have this healthy thing that I can work with now.

1250
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:46,640
And you can assure people that this part of your brain is just fine.

1251
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:50,080
And that's the part we're going to use to help you get better.

1252
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:55,960
So I think to allay people's fears about the singing not matter, not mattering at all,

1253
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:58,840
I've actually worked with several people who are tone deaf.

1254
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:03,640
And it's not so much as I said before about the musical thinking that it is about the

1255
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,840
way it sounds when it comes out.

1256
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,520
It's really not that important how it sounds.

1257
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,720
It's about getting out your thought.

1258
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:18,920
Just a final question if I may regarding basically inversion to what extent we can turn our

1259
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:25,520
attention to doctors as musicians themselves and what distinctions you might notice between

1260
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:33,240
colleagues who approach the medical application of music from a training of musical, either

1261
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:36,160
professionalism, musical theory, et cetera.

1262
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:42,040
And then how would you characterize that kind of training as a fusion of music and medicine

1263
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,880
or as a bridge between the two.

1264
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:49,040
And in particular even though I realized the panel isn't approaching this from the perspective

1265
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:55,680
of the musical industry itself, if you can offer any reflections on doctors as practicing

1266
01:42:55,680 --> 01:43:00,960
musicians or doctors entering musical performance.

1267
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:01,960
Okay.

1268
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:05,320
Take a question.

1269
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:13,800
Doctors as using music and medicine in a clinical context, all the doctors that I work

1270
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,520
with see many patients every day.

1271
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:24,480
I don't see them being really enthusiastic about providing therapy with music or any

1272
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:28,560
other sort.

1273
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:31,880
Music and medicine is a very interesting topic.

1274
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:34,840
It is a growing field as well.

1275
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:40,280
I'm trying to think of how many doctors I work with or musicians.

1276
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,640
Actually quite a few.

1277
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:48,520
But they haven't ever expressed a need to participate in the music therapy sessions.

1278
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:55,000
But they have been very enthusiastic about these music therapy with their patients.

1279
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,720
One of the things I think, and I don't know if this is also what you were asking, that

1280
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:07,360
the creative approach to problem solving may be something that is more apt to happen with

1281
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:14,160
a musically trained doctor than someone who is purely scientifically trained.

1282
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:19,200
And so I think in a lot of the medical schools now they're actually encouraging the physicians

1283
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:24,520
as part of the medical school training to do the creative arts in some way, to really

1284
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:29,520
get into those nonverbal type, also their own personal feelings in certain situations

1285
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:34,080
so they can be more empathetic and open to the nuances of where the patient presents

1286
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:37,840
them because nothing is ever really just clear clear, clear, black or white.

1287
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:42,920
So I think that way of creative thinking that's part of the music training is something that

1288
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:45,640
they're trying, some medical schools around here actually try and impute.

1289
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:46,640
I think Wile Kornell.

1290
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,040
Yeah, the ICON school has it.

1291
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:49,040
And Wile Kornell.

1292
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:55,720
And the jazz pianist Fred Hirsch put out that record a couple of years ago about his experience

1293
01:44:55,720 --> 01:45:03,000
of almost dying and the medical profession and this kind of coming together of musical

1294
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:08,400
practice as part of the training of these doctors who were able to kind of help him,

1295
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:15,040
you know, that's the substance of what his album of, I guess, three years ago was about.

1296
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:21,760
There's a very vibrant community of medical professionals in Boston that the law was

1297
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:26,200
something the orchestra actually, which is all medical professionals.

1298
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:33,480
And every concert they do is actually benefiting some area of research that needs to be done.

1299
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:37,920
So they're trying to raise awareness in that way and perhaps what you suggest will come

1300
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:38,920
next.

1301
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:39,920
I don't know.

1302
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:40,920
Or maybe you know of something like that.

1303
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:46,600
Even something like listening, you know, being able to listen to a patient and the nuances

1304
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:53,200
of their verbal expression is something that a musician is more apt to be able to do.

1305
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:58,600
So some doctors actually encourage to listen to music as a way of understanding the nuances

1306
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:01,520
of speech when a patient comes to them.

1307
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:02,520
Okay.

1308
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,520
Thank you.

1309
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:04,520
Thank you.

1310
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:05,520
Thank you.

1311
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,520
Thank you.

1312
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:07,520
Thank you.

1313
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:08,520
Thanks.

1314
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:38,480
Thank you.
