00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Our roundtable today is composed of an intriguing mixture of musicians, producers, and theorists,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
all of whom from their unique perspectives have thought deeply about how we might understand the emotional impact of music.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Where do these emotional experiences arise?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And are these experiences unique to each listener?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Or is there some universal quality to the way we all react to music?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In the Helix tradition, we encourage the participants to discuss first by themselves and then among themselves whatever they think is relevant to these issues.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And we'll see where the conversation takes us.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let me introduce today's participants.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let me start off with Greg Calby is a partner and senior managing engineer at Sterling Sound in New York,

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000

As a solo artist, Mr. Harris has released over 10 albums, including his forthcoming release entitled Born Away.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Marina Corsakov Crane is a professional pianist and scholar in music cognition.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Her research is focused on emotional responses to music and on perception of melodic transformation.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Her recent work on music in the brain addresses musicianship-related brain plasticity from the point of view of a music cognivist

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and practicing musician. She was trained initially as a pianist.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Currently, Dr. Corsakov Crane collaborates with researchers on imaging studies in perception of motion-internal space.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She is the author of two books, The Universe of Music and Music. She is the only one to talk with me.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Dr. Gilbert Rose served for many years on the faculties of Yale University Medical School

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and the Western New England Institute for Psychoanalysis.

He is also, and currently a member of the Gardener Program for Psychoanalysis and the Humanities at Yale University.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He is currently in private practice of psychiatry and psychoanalysis in Row Aiden, Connecticut.

32

Dr. Rose is the author of several books, including Trauma and Mastery in Life and Art,

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Necessary Illusion, Art as Witness, and Between Couch and Piano, Psychoanalysis, Music, Art, Neuroscience.

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And the power of form.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And the power of form, a psychoanalytic approach to aesthetic form.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
First book?

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
First book.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
First book.

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Finally, Alina Rubenstein is a psychoanalysts in private practice in New York City.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,000
She is on the faculty of the Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with the New York University Medical Center.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Dr. Rubenstein was raised in a family of musicians and has played the piano for all her life.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
She has served as a juror for the first four piano competitions for outstanding amateurs,

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
established in 1999 by the Van Kleibern Foundation in Fort Worth.

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
An avid chamber of music participant, she performs in concert several times a year.

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Seven years ago, Dr. Rubenstein also began studying the cello, wishing to explore non-percussive techniques

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
of producing musical sounds.

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is our panel.

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And we'll go around and each person will start and talk a little bit, and then we'll talk among ourselves, Dr. Rose.

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, let me tell you how it all started.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I was between 10 and 12, something like that.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And browsing among my parents, 78s, I came across something which knocked me out.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It was Jiekovsky's fifth and sixth symphonies.

53
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And I didn't know what hit me.

54
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, I got in touch with my best friend Eddie, Eddie Danziger, who was all my traitors, damps, other stuff like that.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And I said, listen, you got to hear this.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I put on the fifth or the sixth.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And he looked, he listened, and he looked very puzzled.

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I said, what do you think? What do you feel? He said, is it a steam engine?

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, from then I learned that music does not necessarily carry a message.

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, the same message to everyone.

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, it was sometime after that, that when I got acquainted with more sophisticated things, let's say at age 14,

62
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I discovered that when my elder sister, who later became a disciple of Landowska, was playing the Beethoven sonatas,

63
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I discovered that the best possible place to listen to Irma playing the Beethoven sonatas was lying under the piano.

64
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The sound was fantastic.

65
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, it was a third discovery, and that was probably around the same time.

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I discovered that if when I listened to music, I would conduct at the same time with the record, it was so much more satisfying.

67
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And so I marched around the house, conducting the music along with whoever, and I found it very, very gratifying.

68
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Now, in a deeper sense, what I found was that it's all about motion.

69
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And later on I found out that motion and emotion are inseparable.

70
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So let's put me on to another thing.

71
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And what did it lead to? I have some notes here.

72
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah.

73
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, that was...

74
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll skip what I have here and say something else.

75
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Later on I found some literature that music was capable of releasing jump-starting, in a better word,

76
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
jump-starting people from devastating neurological conditions, temporarily, of course.

77
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There was something about music that went straight through.

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And now I'm not going to read all of this, don't worry.

79
00:08:43,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I want to read something to you.

80
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Anne was in a late stage of vascular dementia.

81
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
At earlier point, she would succumb nightly to escalating panic and agitation, uncontrolled by drugs.

82
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Music, however, could restore a degree of calm.

83
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Now she was no longer subject to panic.

84
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
She was mostly withdrawn and indifferent to music, as well as the presence of intimates,

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
whom she may or may not have still recognized.

86
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:46,000
She really spoke. When she did utter a word or two, it was without any affect or any obvious referential content.

87
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What about art? And whenever I have to say about music goes also for what I think about art,

88
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I think they go through the same way.

89
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
She had been an avid painter in a twice-run around the gallery.

90
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The painters had been among her closest friends.

91
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
One day she was shown color illustrations of Monet and abstract paintings of Jim Eurenst, an old friend.

92
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
She looked them all intently for many minutes and went unswerving attention,

93
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:31,000
asked what she thought. She replied immediately and with the intensity that had once been so characteristic.

94
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
This is really beautiful.

95
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Then, more astonishing still, it goes straight through.

96
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So, what goes straight through?

97
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Shall I tell you briefly or shall I tell you?

98
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What goes straight through is the implicit motion, which is what music and painting is all about, not actual motion, virtual motion.

99
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And the internal motion of affect.

100
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I have theories which I won't go into about what is it about each of these in terms of tension and release.

101
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But I can say this, that when the external tension and release buried in the music or the art goes through to the internal tension and release of affect,

102
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
there is an at-wanness.

103
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There is a unity. And this unity is at least for some of us, part of the experience of music.

104
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There is a oneness. In more technical language, there is an increased permeability of the ego boundaries of the person.

105
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So, there was. I think William James put it best when he said the arts, among other things, and we didn't say about the arts.

106
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He said it about varieties of religious experience. He said they alleviate the solitude of individuation.

107
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Not only, it's not limited to music or to art in an aesthetic moment.

108
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's certainly characteristic of times of being in love.

109
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And as William James knew better than anybody, he was also characteristic of some varieties of religious experience.

110
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And at-wanness.

111
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So, what kind of a contribution does this experience make, if any, beside the moment?

112
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I think it makes a contribution to one's affect regulation and also a sense of one's relationship between itself and world.

113
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And I think I'll shut up now.

114
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, his reaction to Tchaikovsky seems really pure.

115
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And I keep thinking about how today music is much more tied to popular culture

116
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and has a lot to do with marketing.

117
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And so it's interesting to see how music is marketed and people respond to it based on how it's marketed to them.

118
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And it seems to me like a less pure connection to it.

119
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And I feel that music more than ever is marketed for the listener as opposed to being a pure expression.

120
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And I even think that popular music in the past seemed more pure, at least emotionally, than it does now.

121
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And I think that the end result is exactly what he said about it alleviates individuation

122
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:47,000
because I think it's exciting for people to feel connected to a hit song.

123
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But sometimes I listen, I think, are they actually listening to the music?

124
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But sometimes I listen to pop radio, not because I like it, because I want to see what's happening.

125
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And you notice a lot of songs that are about going to clubs and stuff like that.

126
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But I think that music makes people feel really excited.

127
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And for me personally, the way I listen to music is sometimes based on wanting to feel a certain way.

128
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, I guess less alone in a moment, but also maybe happy or maybe not necessarily sad, but understood by another artist.

129
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I also think a lot about how I listen to music.

130
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I prefer to listen to vinyl records.

131
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
For some reason, the sound connects to me more.

132
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And I don't know, it just feels warmer and more human.

133
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I've talked to Greg about this a lot.

134
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But in terms of my own writing, that's something that is more of like a habit, I guess.

135
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And I don't think so much about how it necessarily connects, but it's strange when some songs connect to people and others don't.

136
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And that's hard to identify.

137
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But I feel like I could just keep rambling and talking in different directions.

138
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yes, I would like to make a small remark about your friend for whom...

139
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Is it your microphone?

140
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's about your friend who did not recognize music in the fifth and sixth symphonies of Chikovsky.

141
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
There is a very small percentage of listeners for whom music is not available.

142
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's a very interesting condition. It's called Amusea.

143
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And people just don't recognize anything.

144
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
They don't have...

145
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Maybe a little closer to...

146
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I mean, melodies because they are not able to recognize patterns of music.

147
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Because when we listen to music, we actually listen to musical sounds, which have very interesting relationships.

148
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
They differ and they perceive tension. It was another very important word mentioned today.

149
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So when we listen to music, we listen to patterns of tones. It's like listening...

150
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
In distribution of different levels of energy and tonal felt.

151
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't want to talk too much about it. I want to go back to Amusea.

152
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So there is a small percentage of people. They are not able to recognize music.

153
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But everybody else is gifted from birth. We all are experts at birth.

154
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Because our auditory system is ready before they are born.

155
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We already listen to music before they are born.

156
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And even two four months old babies recognize the basic, the most important melodic element of music.

157
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Consonant intervals and dissonant intervals.

158
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Moreover, they are very...

159
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The way music...

160
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Convey information is very simple.

161
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
People can say it's primitive, it's perceived tension.

162
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This is why music is available for everybody, even for people with very serious cognitive problems.

163
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We are all able to recognize music. It's incredibly generous art.

164
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
By my vacation right now, I am applied philosopher.

165
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I am post-trained as a classical pianist in Russia.

166
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But then I became a cognitive scientist.

167
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It happened to study emotion. This is the last area I wanted to study.

168
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Because it's very difficult and it's very difficult to talk about emotion and music.

169
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But we still can measure something which would help us recognize some of the aspects of this magic which we call music.

170
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The experience of listening to Tchaikovsky for the first time.

171
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The first thing I thought about was when I was a kid, my dad was a real blue collar guy.

172
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
He had a bread-rout delivery guy.

173
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And if classical music ever came on his radio, he would always turn and say,

174
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I hate that suicide music. He would always call classical music suicide music.

175
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So growing up, the experience I had besides the suicide music was the classical music that he used to play on the morning cartoons.

176
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But I don't know if any people who made those cartoons have produced them understand that that was extremely valuable to somebody who grew up in a house where there was no such thing as classical music.

177
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So the first time that I went to a classical concert was a Leonard Bernstein, a young people's concert.

178
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And it was an experience which affected me for the rest of my life because the beauty of it and the intensity of that point it was Carnegie Hall.

179
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But I'm not 100% sure I was somewhere at eight or nine years old.

180
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But I remember the sound of the orchestra along with the fact that it was a music that it found very exotic to me.

181
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It really carried me into the field that I'm in right now and have been for 40 years, which is audio engineering.

182
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But as far as emotion goes funny, in the last few weeks I had an experience which really spoke to what we're talking about here.

183
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I had the opportunity to see this new show on Broadway opening up called Motown. And it's just a history of Barry Gordy who founded Motown Records.

184
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And in the beginning of the show, the first scene is the temptations and the four tops.

185
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The guys playing those groups have kind of like a competition with each other.

186
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And it just literally plays these songs from really my teenage years.

187
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You know, people on this panel are all different ages, but this is a very musically such a formative time when your emotions and your connection to music happen.

188
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I found myself three or four different times completely tearing up.

189
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I wasn't sobbing, but my eyes were watering. I was getting the chills and I was feeling something I just didn't understand.

190
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So after the show, my wife and I went out to dinner with another couple good friends of ours.

191
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And I said to the woman who's a, her name is Suzzy Road. She's a really great musician on her own right.

192
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And I said to everybody, I said, did anybody find themselves crying? And Suzzy said to me, yeah, a couple of times also.

193
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And we do not know what the trigger was. I mean, nostalgia is one thing.

194
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And I know that if someone grew up in a different time and never heard that music before and listened to it, I don't think they would be crying.

195
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And it also led me back to another situation that happened to me about 15 or 20 years ago in my studio.

196
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
A guy that I grew up with had really close friends with him in the eighth grade. He became a Franciscan monk.

197
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And still he's a Franciscan priest. And we hadn't seen each other for years.

198
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And we connected on the phone and he came to the studio and he brought a cassette with him in the cassette days.

199
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And was an artist, yes. Okay, great.

200
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Why, I called him the mic, though.

201
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It felt so professional.

202
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So, it felt much better.

203
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So Kevin brings this cassette of Yani. And no offense to anyone here. Yani is what I would...

204
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
When my way of thinking is kind of an insipid form of kind of new age-y kind of music.

205
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And he put this cassette in and the sound quality of the cassette was...

206
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It sounded like he probably had dipped it in a cup of coffee before he came in and then put it in the machine.

207
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It was horrendous.

208
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And I was listening to this. I was looking at my speakers which was professional studios.

209
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And I'm just going, oh, this is unbelievably horrible. And I turned to Kevin.

210
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And he's got the conducting things in his hands, pencils.

211
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And he's doing this and he's crying. He is coming out of his eyes.

212
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And internally, I'm laughing. Because it's the worst thing I've ever heard. And to him, what he said to me was over.

213
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
He just said, I can't thank you enough. That's the most beautiful I've ever heard that.

214
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Now, I'm not criticizing Kevin, but I'm just saying that this is the kind of thing when we talk about music and emotion.

215
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It speaks to so much of what music is about. The personal nature of it, the emotional nature of it.

216
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
What we bring to this, you know, in my day-to-day work, I frequently get music sent to me from Asia.

217
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
More and more recently, China, Korea, and Japan.

218
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And the other engineers, and I always kind of have an internal laugh we have with each other.

219
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But the Japanese rock is completely like another language.

220
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I mean, it's like, you don't understand the words, but you really don't understand what they're doing musically.

221
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So there's no emotion. So yesterday, just yesterday, in my studio, I had a Japanese jazz artist, a very, very talented woman plays marimba, like this giant marimba.

222
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And she saw one of these CDs that I had done that was, in my mind, was awful.

223
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And she looked at it, she went, oh, why is this great? This is great.

224
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And she really had to have this. And she's a very sophisticated musician.

225
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So the relative nature of all this stuff and the emotional connection to me is really fascinating.

226
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And, you know, I think with the group that we have here, we really have all different generations.

227
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
We have different, somewhere we bring into this. So I'm happy to be here talking about it and see what we come up with, you know?

228
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Thank you.

229
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Well, I grew up in, I would say, bathed in classical music. My father was a concert pianist. So I...

230
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I also started out under the piano. An excellent place to start.

231
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And also trying to manipulate the pedals and competing with a younger brother for the pedals.

232
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And don't remember, actually, when I started to play the piano, but it just seems like I always did.

233
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But that's, I think, probably a very common experience that you just feel like you all.

234
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You don't remember when you couldn't play. But it was never enforced. It was never forced on me.

235
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
But I just loved it from day one. I played with four hands with my brother. Can you not hear me?

236
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Not too well. Not too well?

237
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And, well, anyway, I was sort of considering, I wasn't really considering having a career as a pianist because I knew only too well the downside of it, which is, you know, traveling all the time.

238
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And some people love that, some people don't. It doesn't make for a very stable life, really.

239
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And the other part of it was my generation was the one, when I was a teenager Elvis Presley, erupted on the scene.

240
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And so you can figure out where I fit into the scheme of things.

241
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And it was also a period of time, though, in certainly in classical music, women were very little represented at that time.

242
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And the thought of being, you know, the reviews would say things like, for a woman, you know, she played pretty, and you basically were sort of restricted to, you know, most women to Mozart and stuff like that.

243
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And, well, something just happened.

244
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
To where Mozart.

245
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Mozart, right.

246
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But I was, and after a few starts in other areas, I was briefly a graduate student in comparative literature.

247
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And I really wanted to go to medical school, but as I was saying before, it was also a period of time where not too many women thought, especially who came from families that didn't have, you know, doctors or scientists in the background, they didn't really think of that.

248
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But that's what I ended up doing.

249
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And I always sort of was gravitated towards psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, I think in part because I think I'm a reasonably good listener.

250
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And I think there was some, I can't think of the right word, correlation there between listening to music, you know, as I did.

251
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And listening to people various, you know, carefully.

252
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But I've become even more, I mean, the other part of it was that since my father was a musician, my grandfather, my brother, and my mother and sister were both dancers.

253
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So, I mean, we were really surrounded by music in motion.

254
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And the conducting went on a lot at home too.

255
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But I've always been just so passionate about it and about hearing it, the emotions that it evokes in me.

256
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And I'm connecting to what you said, I think that those are very subjective and that the form, the formal aspects of music lend themselves because they can't be translated into words.

257
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I don't think this is working.

258
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Okay.

259
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It lends itself to projecting whatever emotion and or meaning if we can try to define that, that one wants to.

260
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
If you want to feel a certain way, you may know that certain music will evoke that kind of feeling.

261
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You'll put it on and kind of enjoy having the feeling, including sad feelings, including, you know, some of the negative feelings.

262
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:03,000
But I think the main thing that I really find my connection to music is in actually playing it, making the sounds myself.

263
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And I've always played the piano and as I think you said, I took up the cello about six years ago, which was a little bit risky given my advanced stage.

264
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But I thought maybe it would stave off dementia among others.

265
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But that wasn't really the reason.

266
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Because it's not that easy.

267
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But I always love the sound of the cello specifically.

268
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And I'm always very interested in why people are attracted to certain kinds, certain particular sounds.

269
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And I think they are.

270
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And also, I wanted to be able to sustain a tone, which you can't do on the piano.

271
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And I could go on.

272
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And I had a religious, I'm not religious, but music is a religion for me.

273
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And playing the Bach Suites was another goal that made me take up the cello.

274
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And I could go on and on.

275
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
But I won't at the moment.

276
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Can I ask you a question?

277
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So, I mean, obviously playing piano your whole life and now cello is a new thing.

278
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But is there a way to figure how you feel?

279
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I mean, asking to shrink how you feel is funny.

280
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I mean, is there a different emotion that you get from yourself when you play cello?

281
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Are you at that level where you can actually feel like you're pretty?

282
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Well, one of the other things that you're reminding me of is the piano is a giant piece of machinery.

283
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And you're not going to be able to play with wood and metal.

284
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And when you play with other people, you're still not sort of in the music in the same way as if you play a string quartet or whatever.

285
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Because the thing that has to be away from everybody else.

286
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And you're usually making the most noise and often in classical chamber music.

287
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You never get a break.

288
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The melody instrumentalists usually have to breathe or their arm gets tired.

289
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So, one turn our pages in between the, you know, the, you know, sixteenth rest that they give us.

290
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And I wanted to be able to play in like a quartet or in a group where I vibrate the strings along with the other people vibrating their strings literally.

291
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I mean, you want to be on the same wavelength to use all the slightly corny metaphors.

292
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But the other thing about the cello, obviously, is you can wrap yourself around it. It's a very sensual instrument.

293
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's not as big as the bass, which is a little too big, especially for somebody like me.

294
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But the cello is just perfect. It has that shape that allows you to embrace it.

295
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You feel it the whole instrument vibrating when you play it.

296
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And, you know, you can't be more in the music for me than that.

297
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm sure singers would say that they, because their instrument is actually their body, literally.

298
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But the cello is as close as I felt I could do.

299
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Have you found other players?

300
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Oh, yeah.

301
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Now, now I have, it took me about two or three years to make a sound that I didn't want to run away from while I was making it, but I'm past that.

302
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yes.

303
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I want to infuse a little bit of science in this conversation.

304
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You mentioned dimension.

305
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I want to go first to children. The recent studies showed that already after six months of studying, children show advantage in memorization on tasks which are related to IQ.

306
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We also know today that people who studied music in their childhood, they showed certain kind of age defiance and their cognitive functions at all the age.

307
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And as a music educator, I would say everybody, don't put aside your desire to study music. It's never late.

308
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
One of the best cases in my practice as a piano teacher was a 63-year-old beginner.

309
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I registered Newers who became a wonderful pianist just in couple years, but she was very disciplined.

310
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You were person.

311
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Did you want to say something?

312
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm sorry?

313
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Then you want to say something?

314
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, it wasn't direct.

315
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'll say something.

316
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
But I'll raise it now anyway.

317
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:39,000
To my colleague here especially, I read a PhD thesis recently for an institution.

318
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It was about, well, one specific thing about it.

319
00:34:46,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It talked at the end about musical listening and made the point that for a therapist to listen musically was a very big asset.

320
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And what the point that she made was that you're listening both globally to the overall and at the same time for details.

321
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And it struck me that this is, I think, that I recognize something in that.

322
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And I wanted to, from you and your experience as a therapist, analyst as well as a musician, this thought makes any sense to you.

323
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It makes sense, but I don't know that I would necessarily be aware of doing it at the time.

324
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And I suspect that most analysts listen, you know, and they hear repetitions, they hear themes, they hear variations on the themes, all of which are musical concepts.

325
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But I think I enjoy listening in general.

326
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So I think that's one of the attractions.

327
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But I also, I think I'm, I like to be aware of the nonverbal aspects of the treatment too, which I think music is more in some ways connected to.

328
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And I think also connected to the earliest mother-child matrix.

329
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And I think you raised that point.

330
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And I feel like that's something that I'm more aware of attending to as an analyst.

331
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
The silence is especially.

332
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Somebody said that the most important part about music are the rests.

333
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
The space is between the notes. Who said that?

334
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
The notes are on.

335
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Only Mozart.

336
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But also the silence before and after, which I think are not really necessarily thought about.

337
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So you listen to music in order to restore the silence and listen to the silence.

338
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I think that's a very, for me that's a very important idea.

339
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
This is a conversation.

340
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Can you hear me?

341
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Yes.

342
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
This is a conversation about emotion.

343
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And as a educator, I just cannot help myself, but try to understand where they begin.

344
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's kind of ambitious task.

345
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But my doctor will study, actually, address this task.

346
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Music psychologists, when they talk about music, they say,

347
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
tonal space.

348
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So when we listen to music, we travel internal space.

349
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And you mentioned motion, most important thing.

350
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And actually my lectures were called,

351
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
motion internal space and emotion.

352
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's produced by motion internal space.

353
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I want to just say just a few little things about the origin of tonal space.

354
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And for this I will need this piano and I'm sorry to bother you,

355
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
but I don't need to touch the piano.

356
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah.

357
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Yeah.

358
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Okay.

359
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Oh, yeah.

360
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'll just take the phone.

361
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's in two.

362
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So when we listen to music, we listen musical sounds, which actually have a status in this tonal space.

363
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Imagine that in music, the relationship between sounds, like relationship within a society.

364
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:03,000
When I play a simple scale, the tones of the scale they differ in their frequency

365
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:11,000
and pitch, but most importantly, differ in their attraction to first note.

366
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
This is very unstable.

367
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And this is very stable.

368
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And I want to play two very short samples to explain why music is something like tonal force field.

369
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It's going to be the beginning of a prelude from Will Tempered Clavier by Jürgen Sibachinbach.

370
00:39:35,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And it sounds very peaceful now with...

371
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So what happened that in the tonal space we suddenly found ourselves very far away from stability.

372
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And this is how we perceive music as a pattern of stability and instability.

373
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
When it's unstable, it gives us feeling of tension.

374
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
When it's still feeling of release.

375
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And this is what we listen to music.

376
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:35,000
This is why music talks to everybody because the morphological principle in music,

377
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
the way the message, the communication structure, is very simple.

378
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's understood by everybody.

379
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's either sound harmonious or not.

380
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:57,000
This is what four months, months they do not like.

381
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
They like this.

382
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
They like this and people don't like this.

383
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So the music is made from tense and relaxed elements.

384
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:21,000
But the magic begins when those sensations of tension and relaxation are sequenced in time.

385
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And the best explanation of this was done by Susan Langer, a wonderful American philosopher.

386
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
She told that in music we have logical emotion.

387
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Not just emotion, but logical emotion.

388
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It's not something we suddenly frightened of.

389
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Or we are hungry.

390
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
No, in music what is given to us by music is a complex aesthetic emotion.

391
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It's like living through life again.

392
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
We live through life again.

393
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
In time, this is the only little art which is so tightly connected to time.

394
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's humanized time.

395
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So when we listen to music, we listen to those sequences of

396
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
tension and releases, they work like triggers for our neurophysiological system.

397
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And somehow those triggers, they create emotion in us.

398
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Now think how we all react to the outside world.

399
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And not only will, let's say some little animal.

400
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
If something frightening, it would be tension.

401
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
If we have a nice dinner, a nice friend, a tuck in his friend,

402
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
they are relaxed.

403
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
This is the simplest reaction of the living organism.

404
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Tension and relaxation.

405
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And this is what music imitates.

406
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Tension and relaxation.

407
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And those sequences of tension and relaxation, they create emotional state.

408
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Very strange thing.

409
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I think it's really magic.

410
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
What about music that's all distance or all tension?

411
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Because some people don't like to hear consonants.

412
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
They like to hear noise.

413
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I think that's all right.

414
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And it was actually a moment, kind of a gracism moment in 20th century

415
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
against the dictatorship of the analysis.

416
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But the first is, it kind of coincided with changes in societal structures.

417
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,000
That would happen when Schoenberg, who was called a tanales to his great tradition,

418
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
introduced a new system which defined the role of the analogy, the tension and the release.

419
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
The system was quite strict.

420
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
But it's interesting that musicians listened to autonomous music.

421
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:59,000
They still are trying to find some points to tie,

422
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
and find some system of reference because when we perceive this world,

423
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
we always perceive it in some system of reference.

424
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
If it's a real world, it's a Cartesian coordinates.

425
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
If it's music, it's a scale, just simple scale.

426
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
But this analysis is a wonderful, expressive element.

427
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And if you look into, if you hear to music by Bach,

428
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
he predicted a lot of things.

429
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
He predicted autonomous music, polytronome music, and whole tone scale.

430
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You can find everything. But of course, then we had Liszt,

431
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:39,000
who was a tremendous revolutionary Wagner, and then in 20th century Schoenberg and Bergh,

432
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,000
and then kind of extreme, it was Carl Haus and Sinoquez,

433
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
who used acoustic music, just random numbers.

434
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And he created some sounds, some masses of sounds, but not tonal sounds.

435
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So in music today, we basically talk about tonal music, about melodies and harmonies,

436
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
and this music lives in this simple, simple scale.

437
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm just wondering with Jesse and Greg, in terms of popular music,

438
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
in terms of, let's say, post-punk music, which seems to have no

439
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
integrative, which has no restfulness to it, which has no scale to it, as I understand it,

440
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
how you would see this fitting in with the kind of classical music.

441
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,000
As we were going through the different composers and the different elements in the classical form,

442
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I was trying to kind of equate that with my world.

443
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And Jesse's world, and the people who are involved in popular music,

444
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I would say all the way from early 60s up to now, which is a huge buy-up work now,

445
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and actually being studied academically.

446
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And people bring so much emotion to what they expect from their music,

447
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and as far as dissonance, I mean, there are people that go to rock shows

448
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
specifically to feel aggressive, to feel more aggressive than they are,

449
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
to find a safe place for their aggression.

450
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I've always been amazed by the people that come into the studio

451
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
when I'm working on a heavy metal album.

452
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
You might have noticed this too from the people that, you know,

453
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
these are the gentlest souls that I've met.

454
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
For the most part, the gentlest people that I meet,

455
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
the most aggressive people that I meet in my business

456
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
are the hyper-intellectual kind of new music people.

457
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Well, the poets and the people who are searching to be unique are the hardest people.

458
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
For me, those are the hardest people to deal with.

459
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Those are the people with the edge. Those are the most insecure people.

460
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
They're looking for a special place in the music.

461
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But the people who, like for example, are into heavy metal,

462
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
there's a sense of community. I was thinking about this before.

463
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
There was a film that many of you I'm sure saw recently called Amour

464
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
about. It was a fantastic film.

465
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
You remember the opening of the film from the stage out into the audience?

466
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It's a classical piano. Did you see the film?

467
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Fabulous. Fabulous film.

468
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But the beginning is a classical pianist gets on stage.

469
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You don't watch him. You watch the audience reaction.

470
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I swear it's about five minutes of just watching people in stillness.

471
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You're looking at this and you're wondering, what is everybody thinking?

472
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
What is each of these individuals doing there?

473
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
When I go to a concert, and my wife and I go to maybe two or three

474
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
a year and done frequent concert, goers.

475
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
To me, there's a sense of isolation.

476
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You're listening and you're emoting to the music internally.

477
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Rock music is not like that. Rock music is like a celebration of the artist

478
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
and in community with the people who are there, who've also decided to come

479
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and enjoy it together. This type of music will fuse people together.

480
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
This is across many genres, I think.

481
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It's an appreciation. It's a support for the artist as an individual,

482
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
which I'm sure in a classical show if you really know the performers

483
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
and you know the cellists, for example, and you go and watch this fantastic

484
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
house and there's that feeling. But for the most part, I think people go

485
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
to internalize the feelings of the music.

486
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
This is not, Jesse, maybe you can speak to this as well.

487
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I find that the communal, especially in the 60s, there were groups in the 60s

488
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
where if you went to see, for example, the incredible string band in 1969,

489
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
everybody in the show was on LSD.

490
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And you knew that.

491
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And you knew that they were and they knew you were.

492
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
There's a community based around this. And this, to me, is the same thing.

493
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And exactly the same thing is if you go to the Abyssinian Baptist Church

494
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
on a Sunday and everybody's singing, it's a religious type experience.

495
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And I think that communion, exactly.

496
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And I see this when I go out, I see this, it shows.

497
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And to me, it's a very, very interesting thing.

498
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And because when you speak to someone else's music

499
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
or they speak to the music that you don't understand, you tend to kind of drift back.

500
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
They mentioned downstairs, Justin and I were speaking and talking about a couple of artists

501
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
that maybe some of the folks never heard this.

502
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Everybody kind of gets in their little corner.

503
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Well, I don't know what they're talking about. I don't know what they're talking about.

504
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
That's what's great about the classics is that we all have at least some knowledge of that,

505
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
whereas Passion Pit, most of the people in this room probably haven't heard.

506
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
You know what I mean, though.

507
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I totally agree.

508
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Sometimes it makes me uncomfortable when I go to concerts because it seems sort of like

509
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I don't know, like some sort of hero worship or something.

510
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And sometimes I feel the people think they have to act a certain way,

511
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
especially these days.

512
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And even the way that they cheer the music is a certain type of sound that they make.

513
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And it makes me uncomfortable.

514
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And sometimes I don't even think they're listening to the music.

515
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,000
They're just going to live out the experience that they think they're supposed to, you know.

516
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
They act the way they think they're supposed to act.

517
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I'm being cynical, I think.

518
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But I do feel...

519
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
We've been around it a lot.

520
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
On the other hand, this is something that's come to mind for some reason,

521
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
but I went to see Randy Newman perform in Central Park once, maybe ten years ago.

522
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And he just played the opening chords of, I think it's going to rain today on the piano.

523
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And the woman sitting next to me burst into tears.

524
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And literally just burst into tears and shrieked and put her face in her hands.

525
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So, I mean, popular music can have an incredible impact like that.

526
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I keep thinking about how it is today.

527
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And again, a friend of mine said to me once, it was John Zorn actually.

528
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
He said, I think people, and he's someone who makes all kinds of music.

529
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And for him to say this is pretty interesting.

530
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
But he said, I think people just listen to music that makes them feel cool.

531
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
He said, they just want to hear, you know, they just want to feel cool.

532
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And so they're like, cool is, I don't know, maybe, maybe, I mean, this would be really reductionist,

533
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
but maybe you put on classical music because it makes you feel cultured, you know.

534
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Or you feel like, I'm being, I'm sorry, I know that there's more to it than that.

535
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:25,000
But maybe you feel like you can create your own world when you put on that music and you listen to it or you play it.

536
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And you know, you can shut out the rest of the noise maybe, you know.

537
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And for people who like rock, they put on the band, they like, and they feel like, I'm cool too, you know.

538
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I practice.

539
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeah, I practice, first of all, classical music grew up from popular music.

540
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:56,000
You know, when Luther in Protestant Germany was working on creating, you know, vocabulary of hymns at the churches.

541
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Some of his songs he used had very questionable content, just obscene content.

542
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And he would say, we should save it from the clutches of devil.

543
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,000
When you think about the best melodies like Schrubert, he wrote 600 songs.

544
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And the main formula that popular music uses, it's the same.

545
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
It's the main formula of melodic motion.

546
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And this is what the box, uh, uh, uh, period starts with.

547
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:41,000
This is all. It's like the law of notion in Newtonian physics is three chords in classical music.

548
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Three chords, everything as is derivative.

549
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
So, uh, there is not huge difference.

550
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
It's just some classical music, like, same altered.

551
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Orchistakovich, ochigoski, it's just somewhat more structured and carries a lot of information,

552
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
which is not perhaps easy.

553
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It's easy, but it's just different kind of information that, um, that, um, let's say heavy metal of, uh, popular music and carry.

554
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
It's just different levels.

555
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
But the matter is the same.

556
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Now, if you were talking before, you were mentioning the importance of tension.

557
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And right after that, you were speaking about the importance of release.

558
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
But that's the whole story.

559
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Tension and release.

560
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Patterns of tension and release.

561
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Certain ones will correspond with patterns of tension and release in different emotions.

562
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And I think that's what goes straight through.

563
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
The correspondence between patterns of tension and release in the music.

564
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And internally, with certain effects, makes a click.

565
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It goes straight through.

566
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I also think that popular music perhaps uses reasons more aggressively and more aggressively.

567
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And it actually just kind of minds on our physiology because we do have this regularity in our lives.

568
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
So it's rather on the side of our ethnicity, than on the side of militarism.

569
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
But I don't see any chosen between them, frankly.

570
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
There's a record I was just listening to this morning.

571
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I just think people might find it interesting.

572
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It's popular music.

573
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It's a young artist named James Blake.

574
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And it's an interesting record because it has all the elements that you're talking about.

575
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
There are these long moments of silence where you think the song is over.

576
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And then all of a sudden the song keeps going.

577
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And then it seems to stop again and then a beat comes in.

578
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Some of it is acoustic piano, some of it's electronic.

579
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I think it's worth checking out.

580
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I just wanted to say, get back to something you said before about you put music and other arts together.

581
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And I'm not sure if I totally agree with that.

582
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Of course I'm biased, I'm sure.

583
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I think music is different in the sense that first of all it's invisible really.

584
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
When it's being played, where is it?

585
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It's not like something you can touch or look at or anything like that.

586
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And it starts and ends in time and therefore uses uptime in a certain way, sort of mimics what happens to us over time too.

587
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So I really don't like to lump it in with the other arts, although I'm certainly not as knowledgeable about it.

588
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I'm talking about the aesthetic of aesthetics.

589
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
The aesthetic of aesthetics.

590
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And the theory of aesthetics.

591
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And in my theory of aesthetics, patterns of tension and release exist in music in their own ways, in their own language.

592
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And as they exist in, let's say, painting.

593
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Matisse says, a line is not just a line.

594
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:37,000
A line is a stroke against the indifference of the background.

595
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:45,000
He said to his students, try to find out where that line is driving to go.

596
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
He's talking about the dynamics of visual aesthetics.

597
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Just as you were talking about the dynamics of the piano, when you play the scale, you can't leave it at the seventh.

598
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It has to go to the eighth.

599
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It has to resolve.

600
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
That's tension and release.

601
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Now it's in that sense that I'm putting the work together.

602
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I just have always felt that music is much more embodied in a certain way.

603
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:24,000
It's just because it picks up on our body rhythms and because it's not visible, you know, and it vibrates in you.

604
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And I guess to me that makes it, I mean, and then how do we talk about what it means?

605
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
There are no words.

606
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And even with painting, it seems to, or the plastic arts in general, it seems as if it might be easier to talk about them in words.

607
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
But music is such a challenge.

608
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And this is an aside, but I have to say in spite of my great love for psychoanalysis, I never have really forgiven Freud for being a Viennese Jew who had really little interest in music.

609
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I'm sure there was an issue there.

610
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And he also got rid of his older sister's piano because it was annoying him.

611
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So I just wanted to get that on the table.

612
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Well, he also confessed that he could not bear to stand any odd unless he knew what the meaning of it was.

613
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And that's beside the point.

614
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
The meaning of it is the reaction you have spontaneously when you first hear it.

615
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And then all the other meanings that have come in the course of time and the stages of life go through different meanings.

616
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
They're attributed.

617
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I'm talking about this spontaneous reaction, which I think has to do with patterns of tension and release in one language of music and in another language in visual art, but still tension and release.

618
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I have very important things to add because we talk about pleasure of music.

619
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
So I have to talk about neurophysiology of perception of music.

620
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:13,000
It activates biological reward center, which is also involved in our pleasure of food and sex.

621
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And another thing about the...

622
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Does all music do that to certain...

623
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Pleasureable music.

624
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But that's somewhat subjective.

625
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
No, no, no, this is what they found. It could be a music designer, actually.

626
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It still activates biological reward center, pleasure center.

627
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And just a very minor addition to conversation about these communions when music is very loud.

628
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:47,000
It could actually be dangerous for our auditory system when I see cars with small children and there's very loud music.

629
00:59:47,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It also hurts me because I know that the poor child and his parents could suffer a loss of hearing in our very delicate organ of courty in our cochlea.

630
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
They have outer inner cells and outer cells like Celia.

631
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
They work as amplifiers.

632
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And if they're destroyed and they can't be destroyed, if there is a consistently loud sound, they cannot be restored.

633
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
This is why people can start losing their hearing, their theories.

634
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
If they work in a very loud band.

635
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Well, we could have an entire seminar about hearing loss and loud.

636
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I mean, loud is part of the world right now.

637
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I mean, I have the audiologist that I go to says when he started, he's in his 60s now.

638
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
He says when he started all his patients, he was in his 30s, most of them were in their 60s,

639
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
he says he routinely gets people in their 30s now, have severe hearing loss.

640
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:50,000
People are using the in ear headphones and running and spending hours and hours with that pressure on their ears.

641
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Cars, I mean, I'm sure everybody in this room has left at least one restaurant.

642
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I've left maybe 10 restaurants a dish in the last two years because you couldn't hear the people on the other side of the table.

643
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I mean, that's another, you know, that's another whole thing.

644
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
But, you know, it really makes you wonder, like, why is this?

645
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Why do people like loud?

646
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
There's some stimulation from loud.

647
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Otherwise, people would shy away from it, but so many people, I'm not one of them, but so many people need loud.

648
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
They need the distraction of loud. They need the physicality.

649
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I mean, the guy who comes next to you in the SUV where you hear everything and your car is moving like this and his car is shaking like this,

650
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
he's getting something from that. He likes moving. He likes his ass moving in that seat.

651
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:38,000
And there's something really important about the physical nature of music for people, but, you know, the body is not really adapted to this.

652
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I don't think it was always like that. I think that's what it's about.

653
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:47,000
The technology has developed to the point where you can drive around and you can have, you know, 250 dB in your car.

654
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And the restaurants now have, you know, the ability to have speakers everywhere coming down from the top and the sides.

655
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
You know, in the 50s and 60s, when we grew up, we didn't have that.

656
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
So I feel sorry for the kids.

657
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:06,000
What it indicates with a kind of music which is both loud and where tension predominates over relaxation.

658
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I'm talking about kind of music that you would know, which is very different than Schoenberg, you know,

659
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:24,000
and what is it about the times that we live in, the period that we live in, where this seems to be how people are recognizing themselves in painful music almost.

660
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And a kind of addiction to tension.

661
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Well, what Greg does dictates a lot of how music is heard, you know, in the mediums that we have today,

662
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
because when people go to have their albums mastered, what Greg does is the final stage of that,

663
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and he can change the way the music sounds, depending on what people want,

664
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:57,000
but most people go to Greg because they like his aesthetic, but at that final stage, you can make music more aggressive.

665
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
You can make it louder or you can make it softer, you can make it brighter, or you can have more bass,

666
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
and that has so much influence on your perception of the music.

667
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And I've had certain albums of mine that I had to have remastered completely because the first take that the mastering engineer, not Greg, by the way,

668
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:26,000
that the mastering engineer had did was too aggressive, and he just figured, well, I wanted to make your music like other people's,

669
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
and bring out that sound and bring the volume up.

670
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
When you bring the volume up, you bring up an aggressive feeling.

671
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,000
If you let the volume go down, you know, stay in a little bit of a lower point, then you can have music that breathes more.

672
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:48,000
But most of the records that are made these days, I think they go for the highest level that they can get.

673
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
They go for sound, they kind of push his forward, every element kind of becomes equal,

674
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,000
so that the feeling is kind of like listening and being like pushed into a wall,

675
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
where, I mean, Jesse creates music different than this, and the opportunity that I had to work with him a few times,

676
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:11,000
and he'll be part of create music that has, when you say dynamics, it means you can feel the variation in the amplitude of the different instruments.

677
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So you have much more of a rhythmic, you have much more of this rather than this, and people, musicians, I think a lot of musicians have been around music so much,

678
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:28,000
and I think that they almost like, it's like I have one sugar, I have two sugars in my coffee, I have six sugars, I have six sugars,

679
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:37,000
and I'll have a little bit of a five hour energy, and it's almost like an addiction for excitement, but you kind of lose the perspective.

680
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:45,000
So, you know, I deal with people in a way that I have to understand what is going to, I have to do something that they're going to approve.

681
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,000
My work is for the artist to get something that he wants, and a lot of these artists need that feeling of excitement,

682
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:58,000
and they also need the feeling that when they play something compared to someone else's music that it has as much intensity.

683
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So, in that way, that intensity to that person could read forwardness, and I've worked with a lot of musicians lately,

684
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
who are almost deaf in their 40s. I mean, it's really unbelievable. I'll do things, and I go like, I can't hear what you're doing.

685
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:22,000
It's like I've been on stage two long, or, you know, it's, the thing that strikes me about this conversation that we're having is how, you know,

686
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
all our different experiences depend on the types of music that we listen to or involved in,

687
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:35,000
but you know, you keep pointing up the universal nature of the experience, and I think that's a good combination of what is it about the music,

688
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,000
and different kinds of music, and then I'm sure everybody in this room at times today has kind of like zoned out,

689
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
and then other people are like, oh yeah, I understand that.

690
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,000
It's a very, very personal thing, our feelings about our music.

691
01:05:50,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Well, I think one thing a psychoanalyst, you may not agree about the need for intensity and volume is in order not to listen to what's inside.

692
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Inside your own head. Yes.

693
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
To get away, escape.

694
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Exactly.

695
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Mm-hmm.

696
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I agree.

697
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
We've decided.

698
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
To listen.

699
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I have a number of hats.

700
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Consider it settled.

701
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Well, music is an escape into another world.

702
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,000
And, you know, when I was a kid, my father's Sinatra records, that was a visit to, you know,

703
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
52nd Street in the 1940s. I had never been to 52nd Street. I wasn't born until 1949.

704
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I never went to jazz clubs, but, you know, to read, to hear Sinatra's world, and to hear the horns,

705
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
and everybody just creates a visual, you know, like an imagination.

706
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
True.

707
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And these are little climates, little rooms that we walk into with the different music,

708
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,000
and it's, Jesse is fascinating because you've been doing a lot of international recording,

709
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:59,000
and you've been in Brazilian, and you write in different genres. Maybe you can discuss a little bit of how you, you know, you kind of write folk genres

710
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
and, you know, in more rhythmic Latin America and South American.

711
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Well, I mean, what I was thinking of actually was, because we've been talking so much either about classical music or popular music,

712
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:18,000
but just about, I don't know, maybe more indigenous music or folk music and have had functions,

713
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:25,000
and also tonally have that functions because a lot of that music has nothing to do with the scale that we've been talking about at all.

714
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:38,000
And yet, it can reach a level of sophistication equal, if not more, to the Western scale.

715
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And those tensions and releases are completely different.

716
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And so that sort of calls on the question that basic feeling of what, you know, the human, the universal human response to sound,

717
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
because actually in other places it's not the same.

718
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
But it seems to me that it's culturally determined all over the world.

719
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
It did.

720
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It did.

721
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
It was a study recently with people listening to music from different cultures.

722
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Exactly what you just have.

723
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,000
And they found that there are, there are non-anounce people respond to it, just tiny differences.

724
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Yeah, the cultural differences again, but still the most important things are captured.

725
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So something about music, it's really universal language, somehow it reaches everybody.

726
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Even if it's kind of a very distant culture, it still arrives to us.

727
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,600
But I think what you're suggesting is that the patterns of tension and release are very

728
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,640
different and there are all kinds of cultural things.

729
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:53,200
But the basics that must be there in every culture, that is a way of kind of integration

730
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,800
which human beings can't live without.

731
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,800
Absolutely.

732
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,800
Very different.

733
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,320
Because we listen to, we're very used to a pretty even meter.

734
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,960
But if you listen to music from other parts of the world you can't even tell where it

735
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,320
begins and where it ends.

736
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,280
It doesn't seem to have a meter, some of it.

737
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:17,720
And furthermore it seems at times to be speeding up and slowing down at the same time.

738
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:22,080
And people can, they do this just naturally, that's how they play and that's how they

739
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,720
hear things.

740
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:32,120
But yeah, I mean, sure the response to music, whether no matter what kind of music is universal.

741
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,400
Yes, people are moved by it.

742
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:40,080
In fact, I would even say perhaps they're more moved by some indigenous cultures because

743
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:45,240
it is in fact religious.

744
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,240
It's ritualistic.

745
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:57,880
I think you have to be exposed from a very young age to whatever kind of music, to really

746
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:01,680
appreciate it and have emotions in response to it.

747
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:09,520
I mean, I think if you haven't grown up hearing classical music, with people who love it,

748
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,080
in that setting, why would you?

749
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,080
Maybe even more.

750
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,880
Or any other kind of music.

751
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,360
More mysterious in that because I keep thinking of what you were saying before about you and

752
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,440
your father.

753
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,240
He couldn't listen to something and couldn't hear it at all.

754
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:26,440
You listened to something and it moved you very, very much.

755
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:32,080
And it's a kind of mystery as to what it is that even with you that allowed you to hear

756
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:38,400
something and know that it spoke to you and that those rhythms were responding to some

757
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:43,920
difference probably between people, between effective organizations that people have.

758
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,240
What that has to do with education and class is very complicated.

759
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,240
It is complex.

760
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,960
I mean, I remember in the 60s when you meet somebody, and I was in my 20s, and you meet

761
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,120
somebody 60 years old.

762
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:58,120
They're like, I love the Beatles, they would say, I said, wow, how does this person who

763
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,320
is 60 years old like the Beatles, when this is like in the 60s?

764
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,840
You very rarely meet someone.

765
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:07,640
And then they would say, I love that song, Michelle, or one of the real melodic ones.

766
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,640
But there's a cultural barrier to cross.

767
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:14,280
And I'd be curious in this room how many people have listened to hip hop, then all of a sudden

768
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,280
it's like, you know what I have to do?

769
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,280
They want hip hop song.

770
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,280
I really like that one.

771
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,440
You know, I mean, how many people are open to that?

772
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,000
Or how many people just as soon as they hear the genre, they hear the style just, whoop,

773
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,520
it's not mine, it's not mine.

774
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,520
Just close right up.

775
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,040
And you know, no matter what the lyrics are, no matter how socially relevant they are,

776
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,080
melodically just like, that's not my music, I'm not going there.

777
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,400
There's a certain music that we can't hear.

778
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,880
We literally can't hear.

779
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,880
Yeah.

780
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:43,640
So I wanted to take some, if there are questions that people would like to ask, the participants,

781
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:52,840
please go over to the mic and you could just say who you are.

782
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:59,840
If you want to name, is that it?

783
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,840
Sure.

784
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,840
That's Roger's.

785
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:10,320
I appreciated hearing that Freud had no experience of music.

786
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,400
I think it's an experience.

787
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,240
Well, he rejected it.

788
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:18,360
And I find that it's a mystery, is anyone writing about it?

789
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,360
I think that's phenomenal.

790
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:26,640
Do you know if anyone is writing about it?

791
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,840
I think it's been, I mean, I must have read it so.

792
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:34,360
Do I have something Google for that something?

793
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:44,840
Well, what we're talking about was people being locked in to look with, with genres that

794
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:49,280
they wouldn't listen to, wouldn't listen to us thinking of the movie Mr. Holmes Opus,

795
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,880
where he played a classical theme.

796
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:58,320
It was the mid-Yewen G, but they knew it as a toy, as a Motown song lovers could cheer

797
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,320
it up.

798
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,360
And sometimes it can, and sometimes it's like, it's like that, sometimes you can just

799
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:06,960
take one song sometime to one little piece that's just a little bit different when somebody

800
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:13,600
might start to embrace it when they didn't embrace before because it just touches them.

801
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:19,240
And I know that also, well, I mean, a lot of British rock and 60s did borrow.

802
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:25,520
They were magical classical music from American blues.

803
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,360
It was like a hybrid, this is the thing going on.

804
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:38,160
It's just like this playing, this is a thing, music is taking grove over time.

805
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:43,080
And I guess this really is that whether there's some extent that any particular genre is

806
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:48,360
being monolithic and it's not really not, it's always been some variation within any type

807
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,360
of music.

808
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:54,560
And there could be one particular song that somebody heard that from either a group,

809
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:01,800
and they might want to give them, they would consider giving a lot of their kind of music,

810
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:07,080
another listen, just give it another chance.

811
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:12,640
The modern hip hop music uses samples from all different sources, from classical sources,

812
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,640
jazz sources.

813
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,480
You hear it all because the technology now allows you to kind of construct, the music

814
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,920
is not performed as much as constructed.

815
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,720
So now it's being constructed from all different...

816
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,640
Yeah, it's the kind of... in a way, it's kind of a sad thing when we're talking about

817
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:29,640
tation and release, how the only variation in volume is that it just keeps increasing,

818
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,440
but there's no decreases, no in and out.

819
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,760
It just increases louder and louder and louder.

820
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,640
And that's the tension part, but where's the release part coming in?

821
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,160
Like, something like that.

822
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,360
I mean, how do you get beyond it?

823
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:47,520
When does the release come in when you're hearing throbbing new in clubs, like, that's

824
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:53,480
right, don't go to the clubs because only I can handle all the throbbing, pulsating,

825
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,240
I think, to throw me off.

826
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,640
Take out the chromium for about four measures.

827
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:02,160
Thank you.

828
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:11,960
I've never been raised on classical music, just like there was never a book in my house,

829
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:17,400
but anyway, I was raised, if anything, on popular music.

830
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,480
So my question is this.

831
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:25,120
Don't you think it's easier to like popular music than classical music?

832
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:31,960
I'd like, especially direct this to you because you are just opposite of my background, and

833
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:38,840
because the words give you direction, and I think would help also in some of the things

834
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,440
you've been talking about.

835
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:48,040
The words themselves forget the emotion of the words, which I think are terrific often.

836
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:55,840
But don't you think it's easier to like popular music because it comes with words?

837
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:02,880
I think most of the music in the world, I think, does come with words, actually, and

838
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:12,520
I think that may be true, but I've always particularly been fascinated by non-music

839
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:18,520
that doesn't have words just because it's so mystifying what it is.

840
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:27,280
It's so eloquent, and yet with no words and how do we understand the impact on us?

841
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:37,880
I mean, to my knowledge of speaking about Freud again, the only two references I recall

842
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:44,840
in his work about two music were both operas because one was an often-ba-one and another

843
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:49,800
was done Giovanni by Mozart because there was a plot and words and everything else that

844
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,680
he could talk about.

845
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,080
I'm Jim Rubens.

846
01:16:54,080 --> 01:17:00,400
I'm a member of a group that works with people with brain damage.

847
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:08,320
We work psychotherapeutically and psychoanalytically, and we have been in touch with the man who

848
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:13,400
is both a psychotherapist and suffers from the phasor.

849
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,400
He had a stroke.

850
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:19,360
His name is Harvey Alter, and he runs support groups for phasics.

851
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:27,680
I've heard him speak, he mastered much of his phasia by singing to himself, and he could

852
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:32,120
retrieve the word with the help of the music.

853
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:37,240
I had a little bit, there are groups right now in melodic therapy.

854
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:41,760
They actually work with people with damage to their speech center.

855
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:48,000
First they start with just a couple notes around and teach them to say their names, then simple

856
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,320
phrases, and gradually they restore speech and what's interesting, they restore speech

857
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:59,480
center in opposite hemisphere, which was not damaged.

858
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,640
I'm Henry Earl.

859
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,640
Thank you for a very interesting discussion.

860
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,320
Rubensstein, Corsakov.

861
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,480
What about genetics?

862
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:17,680
What about studies in people who are humans who are either pre-verbal or post-verbal?

863
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:25,720
You may have noticed it, but from Kyoto, a group of researchers recently reported three

864
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:32,280
subjects in which they studied sleep and what they regard as dreaming.

865
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:39,400
In the first stage of sleep, they would awaken these subjects and compare the functional

866
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:46,560
MRI to the objects that they'd dreamt about, that they recalled.

867
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:53,040
They got to the point where they could find a 60% correspondence between the functional

868
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:57,720
MRI images and the objects that these subjects recalled.

869
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:04,640
Now it's three subjects and it's early days, but I suspect there are genetic factors in

870
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,640
this.

871
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:15,920
One possibility is that Vienna was burned out after Beethoven and Mozart.

872
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:21,440
That was their left for poor Freud.

873
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:28,560
The other possibility is that there are strong genetic variations in the response to music.

874
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:33,960
I just wondered whether there have been some studies or there are being some studies under

875
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:39,640
way to study this, especially in very young and very old.

876
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:45,680
I'm not going to give you a direct answer, but kind of indirect.

877
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:50,600
First of all, we know that Bach family was so huge and they were so successful that very

878
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,000
broad Bach became a synonym for musician during his time.

879
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,400
And on QXR, 11 days on stop.

880
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:06,680
Yes, another thing, some 15 years ago, there was a great discussion if there is differences

881
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:12,080
in brain structures and musicians as compared to non-musicians are related to genetic component.

882
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:18,680
However, during the last few years, when there were around several longitudinal studies with

883
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:25,320
children, it showed that the brain changes are related to music experience.

884
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:32,360
They are related to greater thickness of corpus callosumonterepart, which means greater

885
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:40,560
bilaterality, which perhaps means better cognitive functions at old age, their compensation.

886
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,160
Other changes, for example, in acute ci-

887
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:52,720
chills that connects auditory areas with modern areas and so on.

888
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:59,880
So when- what I want to emphasize, please start making music.

889
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:06,360
Every day, literally every day, new studies arrive, which say it's very beneficial.

890
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:12,280
Just the data that was published this year, the people who studied music, they are better

891
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:18,000
on motor tasks, not only like a memory task, but on motor tasks, compared with people who

892
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
never studied music.

893
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,440
Would that be true if someone took a drawing or painting at an older age?

894
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,440
No, music.

895
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,440
Just a question.

896
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:32,560
And my explanation to it is that we are seeing such an integration of different modalities.

897
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:41,280
We have vision, hearing, motor, material, everything.

898
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,040
Thank you for coming today.

899
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:49,360
Not in your field, so the terms I use may be the wrong ones, but perhaps you can help.

900
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,800
My name is Joseph Cadu.

901
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:59,240
I read a review of a recent book by Oliver Sacks that had to do with hallucinations.

902
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:06,440
And the point was made that with advances in recent brain imagery, they found that people

903
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:11,800
having hallucinations, that the part of the brain that was activated, was quite different

904
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:16,400
than the part of the brain that's activated during dreams.

905
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:22,160
And the part of the brain that's activated during dreams is that part which has memories

906
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,160
its function.

907
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:28,960
And the part that's motivated for hallucinations is that part that not being in your field,

908
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:34,920
a call, pre-perceptual, or before there's the naming of something, but distinguishes

909
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:38,160
us from other species, our capacity to name things.

910
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:42,400
But the moment we do, we eliminate all the possibilities for what it could be otherwise.

911
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,360
And there's a distancing.

912
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,960
And so here's my question.

913
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:53,040
And also as a musician, I mean just someone who's played music, I found that once I mastered

914
01:22:53,040 --> 01:23:00,040
the notation of something, I can go back to that pre-notation state of a mode of, or

915
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:08,560
what I'm doing in improvisation, that there's a return to something more basic, not something

916
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,640
more advanced.

917
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,360
So here's my question.

918
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:18,000
Is there anything in brain imaging or neuroscience that suggests that musicians, that the part

919
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:24,280
of the brain that is employed for a musician playing is different for a musician listening

920
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,440
or for a regular person listening?

921
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:36,080
They are not as kind of, you know, you're talking about dreams and hallucinations, what

922
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,440
I'm going to talk is much more mundane.

923
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:47,680
For example, in musicians, the auditory areas, like recognition of sounds, they do little

924
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,000
bit different to the non-musicians.

925
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:56,880
And also their perception of music is more left, side-activated because it's more analytical

926
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:57,880
in musicians.

927
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,440
They're more related to musical structures.

928
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:08,480
But what is interesting, that responses per se, they're about the same.

929
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:15,440
Yes, the differences in white and gray matter, musicians are related.

930
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:22,880
But responses, emotional responses are not differentiated in musicians and non-musicians.

931
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:28,680
A couple of little anecdotes and then a question.

932
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:33,440
I used to hate hip-hop music and then I started taking hip-hop dance classes and now I really

933
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,440
like hip-hop music.

934
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,360
I mean, not quite seriously.

935
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:39,960
I wasn't able to access any of the emotion of it or any of the music of it until I tried

936
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:44,560
to do it and then I could understand the vocabulary and the feeling that they were using.

937
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:50,600
And similarly, I went recently to an Icelandic music performance where somebody was really,

938
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:54,760
the performance was this on the computer and there was this kind of wall of sound that

939
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,600
was produced that was the concert that we were at.

940
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,280
And so there was very little emotion involved in that.

941
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:03,880
And so I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on emotion and its relationship

942
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,240
with music, both in terms of how you take things in and out of the music to create those

943
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:12,640
feelings but also in terms of the neuroscience systems, in terms of overlap of perceptual

944
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,080
modalities.

945
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:22,120
I can't speak to neuroscience because I don't know much about it but I do know that in my

946
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:32,720
work I do find that my body is always moving in the work.

947
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:40,240
People comment sometime and my foot is either tapping or I'm just kind of reacting to it.

948
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:45,960
I can totally understand that the reaction to the hip hop because you're really connecting

949
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:49,160
with it at that point.

950
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,760
It's obvious that the music is a physical music.

951
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:58,200
I haven't been to some of these big gigantic raves that you see the people are having now

952
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:04,000
but sometimes you have thousands and tens of thousands of kids and the music is just a

953
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,200
pulse of physical movement.

954
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:12,480
And again you don't see much movement when you go to Carnegie Hall and you go to a classical

955
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:17,280
concert but there's a different thing going on there.

956
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:22,760
I personally in my work, and I only do the end product of the work.

957
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,080
I don't create the work.

958
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,160
Jesse is a record producer.

959
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:30,080
He creates the work from and also a songwriter so he comes up with the idea for the song and

960
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:33,800
then creates an environment for the song to exist.

961
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:39,120
And then in my work I kind of take that and I try to enhance whatever emotion that I'm

962
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:44,600
feeling and over doing it for 40 years I kind of can connect with the other creative person

963
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,600
who's come up with something.

964
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,120
I can enhance what he's trying to do.

965
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:54,040
But I think physical is a big part of what you come up with when you produce a record.

966
01:26:54,040 --> 01:27:00,680
I think the classical audiences have been sort of tamed over the century because they

967
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:04,080
didn't used to be so passive and I certainly am not.

968
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:09,080
I always sit in the back row because I can't sit still.

969
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:16,520
I didn't actually kicked out once.

970
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:19,480
I wasn't making any sound but I was.

971
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,160
What were you doing when you got kicked out?

972
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,160
What exactly were you doing when you got kicked out?

973
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,160
Well I was just asked to.

974
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:31,320
I was just rushed and asked to leave if I couldn't contain myself.

975
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:32,880
It's a little less.

976
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,880
I feel exactly.

977
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,320
I feel exactly the same way.

978
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:42,600
I think it's barbaric that you have to sit at the concert and not move.

979
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,600
It's ridiculous.

980
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:49,840
And I have a private theory that one function of the conductor, aside from his relationship

981
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:58,440
to his orchestra, is that he is the symbol for all the motions that you want to make.

982
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:06,400
And your clap is much for having allowed him by proxy to express for you.

983
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:11,000
I cannot say anything about from the point of view, new to science, but I want to say

984
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:19,440
something from point of view of social culture that society culture, music does express gesture.

985
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,040
And if time just change.

986
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:29,360
So when you think about the Mozart, it's very easy to imagine ladies at Crinaleen.

987
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,960
It's very different today.

988
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:42,840
I think it's wonderful that you've found a hookup.

989
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:45,800
My name is Herb Klitzner.

990
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:49,640
I found probably the most satisfaction in listening over the last 30 years has been to

991
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:53,200
what's brought them called alternative music.

992
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:57,000
And within that you have ambient music.

993
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,280
And that is peaceful.

994
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,600
And it doesn't go very far.

995
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:04,800
And yet it's very rich and it's shifting and changing.

996
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,720
And I just thought it should be mentioned here and I just wanted any reaction to either

997
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:16,640
that or alternative music more broadly as trends that have been in the society that

998
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:20,080
are meeting points that anyone can listen to and yet have substance.

999
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:24,600
So that's for the most part is your ambient music is without lyrics.

1000
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,640
This is or maybe Gregorian chant kind of music or the.

1001
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:30,280
And then without lyrics.

1002
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,080
Brian, you know, kind of things to follow there.

1003
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,680
Well, again, there's so many individuals.

1004
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:39,680
I mean, that's an excellent example for a music which is very important.

1005
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:45,800
It brings another whole set of emotions and this is very meditative.

1006
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:46,800
I mean, that's meditation.

1007
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:51,440
I mean, I think we've all had the experience of going to a massage or whatever and somebody

1008
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,400
puts something on and is like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1009
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:59,600
And you go, well, no, that's not going to work for me because I know, you know, and could

1010
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,600
you put some of that?

1011
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:05,360
So, you know, that brings you emotionally when you listen to that kind of music.

1012
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,320
Where do you get with that emotionally when you listen to your ambient music?

1013
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,320
And it opens me up and it relaxes me.

1014
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:17,800
And then I mean, in making music mixes which have done, have been broadcast on a stony

1015
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:26,880
radio, I alternate in a larger scale tension and release using, let's say, an ambient piece

1016
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,400
and then something that's very different.

1017
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:32,160
And I get a reaction from listeners that way that keeps things fresh and moving in their

1018
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,480
alert.

1019
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:37,960
And so everything I do is eclectic with four or five genres, you know, within an hour and

1020
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:40,120
a half music mix.

1021
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:44,480
So listening can be rich.

1022
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,320
Richer than it really is on radio ordinarily.

1023
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,720
So you have a show you have a...

1024
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,960
I did 10 years ago.

1025
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:57,760
It was periodic, special occasions, but about 12 of them, about 2001 to 2003.

1026
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:03,160
And I was challenged and very constructive by taking the 9-11 experience, which happened

1027
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,360
in the middle of it.

1028
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,680
And so I was known already to the audience.

1029
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:12,280
And finding this kind of thing that would, from Estonian culture and from American culture,

1030
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:19,800
would represent tensions and releases that you're in a safe place, ultimately.

1031
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:23,520
And the program was repeated after a couple of weeks from the response.

1032
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,520
So...

1033
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,520
That's great.

1034
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,520
Yeah.

1035
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:27,520
Thank you.

1036
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,520
What kind of music was it referred to with the Estonian music?

1037
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:34,000
Well, there's music in Estonia.

1038
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,200
It's classical.

1039
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:40,200
It's a vocal by Valleo Tarmis, especially in other composers.

1040
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:43,120
He had a piece called Curse Upon Iron.

1041
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,120
And I played that...

1042
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,960
There was a destruction that takes place in that.

1043
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:50,080
And that represented me, the Tower Falling, which I witnessed myself from some blocks

1044
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,080
away.

1045
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:56,240
And I helped work on the foundations for the center I had helped to design.

1046
01:31:56,240 --> 01:32:00,560
It made a computer model of a 1966 at work at the Port Authority.

1047
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,560
And then it was a life cycle of a building that I was in saying now it was coming down.

1048
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:09,880
Actually, the one thing that remained that was not damaged was that foundation wall.

1049
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:14,760
But it was waiting for a new building to fill it and connect.

1050
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,920
So I did a program on that.

1051
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:17,920
Sure.

1052
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:18,920
What's up?

1053
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:24,120
I'm Alexi Calatrak, a summit analyst.

1054
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:29,120
I think everybody's doing a great job doing something that Elvis Costello said was like

1055
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:33,280
writing, talking about music is like dancing about architecture.

1056
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,360
It's very difficult to do.

1057
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:42,600
But I have a developmental question about music, both for the analysts, the musicians, and

1058
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:46,080
the cognitive scientists.

1059
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:51,640
I think we've all alluded to and seen how musical taste changes over time.

1060
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:57,760
The song that moved us when we were five, a different song would do that at 15.

1061
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:04,680
And if I go to the opera and I look around at the median age, I know that all those people

1062
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:07,520
there were not at the opera when they were 30.

1063
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,400
So it tastes changed over time.

1064
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:17,080
I'm curious, in other fields, in psychoanalysis, we sort of privileged the first five years

1065
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:23,800
of life as determining so much that happens afterwards, in language so much we believe

1066
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:28,480
that happens, needs to happen in the first years of life.

1067
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:36,720
Is there a science of music development which would take into account both the cognitive

1068
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:44,400
changes and receptivity at different ages that we have, also take into account the aspect

1069
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:49,520
of community and mass experience, concerts and so on.

1070
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:55,320
And other things like when we're older, I used to listen to the clashes first album

1071
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:59,920
ad nauseam loud and I can't do that anymore.

1072
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,080
And I listened to other things now that I never would have listened to because they were too

1073
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:05,480
wimpy when I was 20.

1074
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:13,800
So what are the kinds of things, is it possible to put together some developmental idea of

1075
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,800
how we experience music?

1076
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:23,800
One of the roles I was to take it.

1077
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:31,720
Okay, you know, I can talk from a perspective of a piano teacher.

1078
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:36,240
So you have children, they are coming to study piano.

1079
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:39,640
And some of them are so incredibly perceptive.

1080
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:45,920
A child at seven at eight seems to understand everything about music.

1081
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,320
It's universal language.

1082
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:53,440
The universal, melodic universal are very simple and they are given to us by nature.

1083
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:59,880
But they understand the emotional content in an incredible form, in a great way.

1084
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:08,600
I find it very difficult to discuss how it's related to age and to development of taste.

1085
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:14,560
I only can tell you that we are all very sensitive to music.

1086
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:21,520
For example, in my study I found that people, non-usicians, and I did the study in the heart

1087
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,520
of Texas.

1088
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:27,440
And it was multi-ethnic group, people from around the world.

1089
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:32,640
And they recognized differences between romantic and the first unique school.

1090
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,680
When I saw the results, I could not believe my eyes.

1091
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:40,480
I had melodic, similar, short musical phrases.

1092
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:44,240
I selected them from musical compositions, played them, and they listened.

1093
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,920
I had very different tasks for them.

1094
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:53,760
But one of the byproducts of this study was the discovery that people, basically, know

1095
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:54,760
training in music.

1096
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:59,480
They are very sensitive to the finest details of music.

1097
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:06,000
They recognized, like for example, they put Schubert with romantic and with classics.

1098
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:12,960
And this is the esoteric knowledge, which is, for example, it's known by people studying

1099
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:19,200
piano at Moscow Conservatory that you can take Schubert as a classical composer or a romantic

1100
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:23,720
composer, depending on the structure of your performance.

1101
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:30,120
But it's not common knowledge, so when I saw the loading plot with these results, it was

1102
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,120
striking.

1103
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:34,280
We all give it from music.

1104
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,280
Just listen.

1105
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,280
Just listen.

1106
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,280
Just enjoy.

1107
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:44,160
I think, though, the thing that you're speaking about specifically of getting older and having

1108
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:52,280
different tastes in music, it seems more like that your personal needs for music change

1109
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,120
more than your taste changes.

1110
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:58,720
Because I know for myself that the records that I, usually the records that I didn't

1111
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:02,000
like as a kid I still don't like, because I go back sometimes.

1112
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,320
I think, excuse me, was I wrong about that record?

1113
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:08,040
Because people really still talk about this one record.

1114
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:12,400
And I know when I was 16 I didn't like it and I returned it or I sold it or whatever.

1115
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:16,600
And I'll go back and listen again and think, nope, I didn't like that.

1116
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:19,280
I still didn't like it.

1117
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,160
Sometimes I go back and I realize I was wrong about things.

1118
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:30,520
But I think it's more that, as you said specifically, instead of wanting to go to say a clash concert,

1119
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,800
you would want to go here a symphony.

1120
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:37,320
I think that's more cultural and more about just where you are in your life.

1121
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:44,880
It's more just to simplify more of a pleasant evening to go and go to a beautiful concert

1122
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:50,520
homeless and just some beautiful music and have dinner rather than go to a crowded club

1123
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:56,320
and get knocked around by a club and have your ears blown out.

1124
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:00,480
But in terms of the actual music, I wonder how much actually it changes.

1125
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:05,960
I know that people who are young, when they hear things for the first time that they were

1126
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:11,600
never exposed to, someone who may, like Beyonce, but never heard, read the Franklin, suddenly

1127
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:16,840
hears her read the Franklin's, wow, that's amazing.

1128
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:21,160
I think people can like music at any age, it's just more about what their personal needs

1129
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:24,320
are maybe or what they want from it.

1130
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,960
And what they're exposed to.

1131
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:33,200
Hi, I'm Rina Kuzerski.

1132
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:37,200
I'm a music supervisor for documentaries.

1133
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:40,560
And what I've been hearing today is two parts.

1134
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,680
It's mostly Western music.

1135
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:45,640
It's mostly classical or popular.

1136
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:49,960
A few people have spoken about indigenous music and I think it's important to stress

1137
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:58,480
that in much of indigenous music, both dance and the sound of music go together.

1138
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:06,160
And that tension and release that you spoke about earlier today really has to do with

1139
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:11,800
the tension and release of physical embodiment and physical action.

1140
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:18,960
And when we sit in a concert hall, some people may sit in the back and get rhythmically excited,

1141
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:25,760
but most of us are not allowed to dance or don't, wouldn't even think of it in Carnegie

1142
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,160
Hall.

1143
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:34,240
But going to a jazz concert or a rock concert somehow permits you to release that and get

1144
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:37,520
out in the aisle and dance around.

1145
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:46,080
And I think we need to reflect a little bit about how important it is necessary for bodily,

1146
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,880
physically to feel the excitement about music.

1147
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:58,840
Hi, very interesting conversation.

1148
01:39:58,840 --> 01:39:59,840
My name is Raul Rafael.

1149
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:03,400
I'm an artist, visual artist and also musician.

1150
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:09,680
And music has a very deep scientific basis.

1151
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:15,720
Sematix, which is the study of the patterns that are made through music frequencies, has

1152
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:20,520
shown that sound has an organizing power.

1153
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:24,480
And also there's a very deep metaphysical aspect to music.

1154
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:27,440
We see that in religions throughout the world, throughout history.

1155
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:34,480
Now Dr. Rose, you touched upon, you said the music alleviates the solitude of individuation,

1156
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:41,960
which I think goes to the very core of what communication coming together as one that music

1157
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:43,280
allows.

1158
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:50,480
And I think that has to do a lot with the, I think that Ms. Kren has mentioned the neurophysiological

1159
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,360
nature of music.

1160
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:59,080
But also to you mentioned the fact that music creates emotion and emotion in total space,

1161
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:05,400
which is I think at the heart of communication and of the believing of this alienation, this

1162
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:09,400
wanting to come as one, as actually we're doing right now.

1163
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:15,280
I think that human beings want to come together, communicate, commune.

1164
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:20,560
And so could you talk a little bit more about this and possibly this connection between

1165
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:27,520
creating emotion and emotion in total space and the alleviation of the, what did you

1166
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:30,760
say, the alleviation of the solitude of individuation?

1167
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,920
Yeah.

1168
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:37,440
I was quoting William James, so I wish I had said it, but he said, I'm old but not that

1169
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,680
old.

1170
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:45,120
I want to say only, I thought I wanted to say one thing about it.

1171
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:50,400
No, it just escaped me.

1172
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:54,760
I'm having a senior moment.

1173
01:41:54,760 --> 01:42:01,960
Yes.

1174
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:07,280
One thing I could say is that as an analyst, one of the first things an analyst would think

1175
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:17,560
about this is that this at oneness that's created by music, self and other merge, probably

1176
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:25,280
in some very, very dim way, recalls the very earliest moments of life, the very earliest

1177
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:31,960
years of life, which were wordless because language does not yet come.

1178
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:40,600
And this would be the symbiosis of the mother nowadays could be a child relationship.

1179
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:47,200
So on some very, very deep level, now one difference between present analysis and the

1180
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:57,000
analysis that I was brought up on is that we would find far more significance in the present

1181
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:04,400
and recent and cultural contributions rather than me they go back to what do you remember

1182
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,760
about being in your mother's arms.

1183
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:09,320
But that doesn't mean that isn't important.

1184
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:17,240
That's the earliest basis of wordless understanding and security and the loss of the sense of

1185
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:23,320
self because you are safe in this what we call holding environment where you're being

1186
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:24,560
held.

1187
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:29,720
I would like to come close to answer your question.

1188
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:56,160
I think that this power of sound, power of frequency and the in sound that in a sense

1189
01:43:56,160 --> 01:44:02,200
is not a matter of the formation of matter.

1190
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:11,120
In some early poetry I read someplace that the love song in some culture which I've forgotten

1191
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:19,920
about, the words, the highest form of love you could express would be to say to your

1192
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:26,520
partner, oh I, there is no difference between self and other.

1193
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:34,360
Oh I, it's like pretty narcissistic, but it's the fusion, I'm talking about the fusion,

1194
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:35,360
the oneness.

1195
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:43,800
Hi, my name is Amalia and I have a question about laughter and recorded music.

1196
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:50,640
I was a kid always amused by singers who would just burst out to laughter and as I've gotten

1197
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:56,400
older I realized it wasn't always that funny but more ironic or commentary I'm thinking

1198
01:44:56,400 --> 01:45:02,320
of Bill Withers, Hellep and Harlem and he ends the song, ha ha ha, Harlem, you know,

1199
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,880
Hellep and Harlem.

1200
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:06,840
So commentary about Harlem and thinking about that.

1201
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:11,600
I haven't fully come up with a conclusion about this laughter and that's why I'm here

1202
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:15,760
to get some thought about what kind of emotion might be, well there's all kind of theories

1203
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:20,840
about why we laugh in general but I'm wondering about unrequarded music and some of your thoughts

1204
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:21,840
about that.

1205
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:28,840
Well I don't know, I just think of this at least, Regina, she's a Brazilian singer, there's

1206
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:34,160
a song where she bursts into laughter in the middle of a line and there's Bob Dylan's

1207
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:40,080
songs, early recordings where he starts laughing and he's responding to his own lyrics laughing

1208
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:41,080
at them.

1209
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:47,480
I mean to me it just always reflects a very natural moment in the music from artists who

1210
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:53,520
are so good that they're so inside the moment of the song and inside the meaning of the

1211
01:45:53,520 --> 01:46:02,720
song that it's almost as if they're not singing it themselves and they have almost an objective

1212
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:10,360
sort of reaction to the music but otherwise I never really thought about it that much.

1213
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:13,600
But I have noticed it and I always like it when I hear it.

1214
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:19,960
And the only thing I can say is that the few times I've seen live performances where somebody

1215
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:24,760
has a laugh, that laugh better be good because if it's not good it just destroys the whole

1216
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:25,760
song.

1217
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:30,000
It's got to really be sincere.

1218
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:35,040
So it's a hard thing, that's a very difficult, you know, only a really, I'm sure Bill Weathers

1219
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,200
could do it but it's not too many Bill Weathers around.

1220
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:41,480
I'd like to thank the whole panel.

1221
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:42,480
Thank you.

1222
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,480
Thank you.

1223
01:46:43,480 --> 01:47:13,440
Thank you.
