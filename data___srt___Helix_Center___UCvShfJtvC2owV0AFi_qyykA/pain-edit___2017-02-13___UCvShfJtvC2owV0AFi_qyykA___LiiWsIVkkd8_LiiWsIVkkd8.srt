00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi, I'm Edner Sessin, Director of the Helix Center.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,320
Before I get going on the subject of pain, which is today's subject, I'd like to make

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,480
a couple of announcements about future programs.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,480
On February 25th, we have a program on the displaced and the other.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,960
This seems to be a popular subject.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,000
The European Federation of Psychoanalysis, in fact, have a yearly meeting, and this year

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,160
the subject of their whole meeting is the notion of the other.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:49,240
I think the refugee problem seems to have increased the interest in our reaction to other people.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:56,960
And so that will be on February 25th, and Bevel is a brisket who is sitting there responsible

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,480
and has done a lot of work to organize this.

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:10,120
Then on March 11th, we have the third in the series that we've been doing on music, and

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,160
this one is about music and healing.

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:22,040
And then on April 22nd, we will have a program on design in nature.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:29,320
Today's participants are Abka or Abkarian, who is Professor of Physiology at Northwestern

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:38,520
University Feinberg School of Medicine, Ina Belfer, who is Health Scientist Administrator,

16
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,080
Project Officer at the Office of Research on Women's Health.

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:52,640
Anisth Dostarevic, correct, is the Assistant Clinical Professor of Anisthesiology and

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
Pain Medicine at Columbia University.

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:04,480
Alan Fein, sitting here, is the Professor Department of Cell Biology University of Connecticut,

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:12,120
and Rebecca Seil is Assistant Professor of Department of Neurobiology and Otterology and

21
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,280
Center of Pain Research at the University of Pittsburgh.

22
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Thank you.

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:32,480
I told the professor that there's no more waiting, so they just think you start speaking.

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
Okay.

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,480
So we'll start then.

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Well, I could start.

27
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,480
Okay.

28
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,000
So I'll just tell you a little bit about myself.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,840
So I'm in the Department of Neurobiology at the University of Pittsburgh, and I'm part

30
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,960
of the Pittsburgh Pain Center, which is one of the few places around the country where

31
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:05,440
there are a number of both clinicians and basic scientists that come together to interact

32
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,600
about pain in the form of seminars and journal clubs and that kind of thing.

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,320
And I really enjoy being at Pittsburgh for that reason, because my background actually

34
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,120
isn't in pain.

35
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,760
I came into pain because I found out something through my research that I thought would have

36
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,400
a huge impact on how we understand pain.

37
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,880
And so that's what I've been following in my lab.

38
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,080
And so most of my focus is on pain circuits.

39
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,360
And while we do have integration with clinical people, I'm really excited to be here today

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:54,480
because any opportunity that I have to learn from other people, clinicians, Dr. Apakaran

41
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,720
who studies the brain.

42
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,040
I'm in this spinal cord mostly, and Ina.

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,440
We were colleagues at Pittsburgh who studies the genetics of pain, so I'm really excited

44
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,400
to be here today to learn from them.

45
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,240
Good.

46
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,720
I'll start with an issue.

47
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,120
I will discuss the subjectivity of pain.

48
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a classic idea that's been drawn around since Aristotle probably, and Plato.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,440
And it's something we actually are doing some studies on the subject.

50
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,240
And the issue of even how to define pain is the starting point, right?

51
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,200
And the distinction between pain and no-siception and subjectivity of pain and the experience

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,160
of pain is something that maybe we can begin with.

53
00:04:51,160 --> 00:05:02,400
And okay, to put some context on the issue, in a recent review article, we have made the

54
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,680
statement that for the most part, all of the research that's been done over the last some

55
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:17,480
50 or 100 years about pain has concentrated about pain mechanisms, but not properly dissociating

56
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,960
what is no-siception from what is pain.

57
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,040
In fact, there is this continuous mishmash of ideas of if you study the spinal cord,

58
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
you're studying pain.

59
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,440
No, I don't think you're studying pain at all.

60
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,440
You're studying some neural phenomena that eventually gives your eyes to pain.

61
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:45,680
The pain is a subjective state that only the human person can report to me having the pain,

62
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
right?

63
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,160
So that's one level of the discussion.

64
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,520
The other half of the discussion is our recent psychophysical experience.

65
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,960
These are classic 18th century psychophysical studies where we, in fact, now look at the

66
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,520
time evolution of humans reporting their pain for thermal stimuli that we put on their skin.

67
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,040
And then from those reports, we actually can generate psychophysical curves.

68
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,560
This is a stimulus response properties.

69
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,920
But from those curves, we can actually derive mathematical models, which now can generalize

70
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,880
the perception of pain to the population in general.

71
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:40,120
So yes, pain is subjective, but it can be objectified by precise mathematical rules.

72
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,440
So I'll throw that out.

73
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,840
I will take it from here.

74
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
There you go.

75
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,760
That's exactly what pain tinnituses do.

76
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:54,200
So we take something that we call pain that is in the middle from pleasure and suffering

77
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,920
from both hands.

78
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,240
And we know that it is subjective.

79
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,800
We know that it can be somehow object, how you call it?

80
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Make it more objective.

81
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,280
Yes, make it more objective.

82
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,360
And we want to go a little further and see, do we have something that we're born with,

83
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:21,000
that we can objectively evaluate and then predict the amount of pain after injury or

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,840
surgery.

85
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,160
The course of pain doesn't become chronic.

86
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,720
The response to anardisia, the response to surgery if another surgery is needed.

87
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:41,320
So 15 years ago, when we started the whole field, the idea was it sounded a little crazy,

88
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:47,720
like how can you genetically approach something that's subjective?

89
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:56,280
And now 15 years later, we have genetic testing, the test that can objectively evaluate subjective

90
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,720
thing as pain.

91
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:07,200
So I say that it's all multidisciplinary, interactive, and both subjective, objective.

92
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:13,720
That's too elastic in a sense.

93
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,600
That's too easy to win.

94
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Go ahead.

95
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,720
To me, it's the difference between sensation and perception.

97
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:29,560
When you talk about notes, like Dr. Seale's studying, you're looking at the sensation

98
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,600
and how that sensation is transmitted through the nervous system to the brain.

99
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,280
Your perception, which has this emotional component, is taking place up here in the

100
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,040
cortical regions.

101
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:50,120
And so you can study the process as it goes into the nervous system.

102
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,560
And then you need other techniques when you start to talk about perception.

103
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:02,760
I mean, for me, the perfect example is my grandson, who thinks the music that I listened to is

104
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
terrible.

105
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,920
He can't stand opera.

106
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,640
I can't stand what he listens to.

107
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,480
We both, presumably, are hearing the same thing coming into our ears, but each of us

108
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,960
has a completely different perception of what that is.

109
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:27,880
And so I think the problem gets when you get up here and you get to the perception of pain.

110
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:35,480
I would just like to defend the idea that the spinal cord is an important for pain in the

111
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,680
sense that I like to think about the pain circuits as being something that's there to

112
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,480
actually help us.

113
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,640
A cute pain everybody knows is required in order to stay healthy.

114
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,720
And I even think some forms of persistent pain, I mean, a lot of people do, are also

115
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,680
there on purpose to help us heal and protect ourselves.

116
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,960
It's only when things become chronic.

117
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,520
I think, you know, it's a problem and also there are good medications for some acute forms

118
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,080
of pain.

119
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:13,680
So I would like to argue that the neural circuits are there to sense pain and it's a good thing.

120
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,400
The brain is there to modify that and to facilitate it so you can get a lot of changes in the

121
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:27,360
way that these neural circuits are transmitting the pain through higher cortical function.

122
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,840
That's our new definition.

123
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:38,040
And I disagree with this position specifically.

124
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,160
That's why we're here to have fun with this discussion.

125
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:50,760
In a sense, I think we have confused the two issues with each other.

126
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,960
There is no deception, which is always present.

127
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,760
And no deception is how you protect the body from injury.

128
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,080
You don't protect you behind right now because you're feeling pain, but you're protecting

129
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:13,120
it because no deception naturally evokes behaviors with which before feeling pain you're

130
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,800
not injury your body.

131
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,480
We don't go around injuring our bodies to learn how to not injure our bodies.

132
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,920
So that concept is not correct.

133
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:29,080
Instead, we have no susceptible signals that intrinsically, subconsciously, are already

134
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,160
protecting the body from injury.

135
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,880
So what is pain then?

136
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,200
Pain is in fact not the protection, but it's the failure of protection.

137
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,640
So that's why it has a negative affective component.

138
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:49,080
It has a negative component because it's failed behavior and you have to modify behavior

139
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,160
to protect the body once the injury happens.

140
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,520
So there's a subtle difference.

141
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,960
And yes, the classic idea mixes those things together and it's not tenable.

142
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,520
It doesn't make sense.

143
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:11,120
You don't, again, a very simple idea is that we go around in life most of the time not

144
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,240
having pain and yet our bodies are not injured.

145
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,880
So it's not pain that's protecting us.

146
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,920
It's the nociceptus that are protecting us.

147
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,880
So the pain, in fact, is a cognitive state.

148
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,200
We, I think, all agree on that.

149
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,200
And in fact, you can have pain without spinal cord, you can have pain without a thalamus,

150
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,240
you can have pain without a hemispheres of your brain.

151
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,800
You still have pain.

152
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,120
Pain is a cognitive, emotional, psychological construct that leads consciousness.

153
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,360
Does not necessarily, a priori, it's not, there's no one to one relationship between

154
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,760
nociception and pain.

155
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,920
We should agree on that.

156
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,080
Patients who have pain asymbolia, they indicate that your argument is incorrect.

157
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,560
If you test these patients and they stick their hand out and you give them a painful

158
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,200
stimulus, they go, oh.

159
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
That was painful.

160
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
They don't do this.

161
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,000
They, you want, can you do it again?

162
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh, sure.

163
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Go ahead.

164
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Do it again.

165
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You want to do it again?

166
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Go ahead.

167
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Do it again.

168
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,480
They know it's painful, but there's no emotional component because the part of the brain that

169
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,160
gives them their emotional response has been damaged due to a stroke.

170
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,520
Well, we don't know exactly what's been damaged.

171
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:33,520
First of all, these asymbolia patients are so few in the literature that, you know, they

172
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
exact.

173
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,480
No, I mean, it's an important issue.

174
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,640
What is the exact damage?

175
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:46,520
And conceptually, we know there's a painful stimulus, but not responding to it and not

176
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,960
calling it pain.

177
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,440
In fact, it's not, it's simply a damage of the brain, right?

178
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,720
The same response can never happen if the damage is in the spinal cord.

179
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,600
So it's not the North's deceptive signal that's necessary for pain.

180
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,360
It's a brain system that can be disrupted, of course, with brain damage.

181
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,520
Its properties will be disrupted.

182
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,120
And depending on the type of disruption, you will get different types of pain asymbolia

183
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,920
or pain abnormalities.

184
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,160
But then to link up with that, how do you explain going from acute pain to chronic or chronic

185
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
pain?

186
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,920
And you can't explain it at some point.

187
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,000
What happens with your nociceptive pathways when pain is chronic, but there is no ongoing

188
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,400
injury or trauma or any kind of...

189
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,680
Well, you tell me exactly.

190
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,160
Again, the nociceptive is the one that's falling off.

191
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,680
Your explanation cannot be due to the nociceptive.

192
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,320
The nociceptive does not explain chronic pain.

193
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,040
In fact, our research shows that chronic pain is fundamentally a risk factor of the brain,

194
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,360
not of the nociceptus.

195
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,200
And brain anatomy, brain physiology predicts who's going to develop chronic pain, which

196
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,560
is not.

197
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,240
And in fact, the limbic brain properties are what defines those risk factors.

198
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,160
And the reorganization in time is what creates a chronic pain state.

199
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,320
None of this is a nociceptive explanation.

200
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,000
And this data is quite solid in a sense that we can explain a large amount of the variance

201
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
of chronic pain with these parameters.

202
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,120
So if you go back to Ena, then how do we do the genetic testing and predict?

203
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
No, absolutely.

204
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,880
We need Ena because all of this has genetic components.

205
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,280
The brain obviously is defined by genes.

206
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,760
The genes and the brain go very much hand in hand.

207
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,080
And we definitely need the genetic component underlying this.

208
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,520
And in fact, we've done a little bit of those trying to link the brain risk factors to

209
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,520
the gene factors and how there's a lot more to be done.

210
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,520
We're at the beginning of that game, in a sense.

211
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:08,520
So basically what Vanya said, yes, you have to have brain to feel pain.

212
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:15,520
On the other hand, there are basic mechanisms, including genetic mechanisms, that can predict,

213
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:24,520
explain, and predispose to more or less of the component inside this experience of pain.

214
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Of course, the brain is at the end of the day has a big genetic component, right?

215
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
And it defines those properties.

216
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
How much of it is genetic?

217
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
How much of it is that?

218
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
We don't know.

219
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,520
We haven't done the studies yet.

220
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
So what is genetic?

221
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:50,520
I mean, everything is genetic, but I mean in terms of pain, what is it that you are qualified?

222
00:16:50,520 --> 00:17:00,520
So right now we say that there are common genetic factors that contribute to pain in different

223
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,520
conditions across the diseases.

224
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,520
And possibly this is what you call nociception or what you call the circuses.

225
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,520
And then there is disease or condition specific genetics.

226
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,520
And what is interesting with the chronic pain specifically, now we come to this new era

227
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,520
when you can have unbiased approach to study genetics.

228
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:35,520
And the more genetic factors you consider within the disease, the more variability can

229
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,520
be predicted or explained with genetics.

230
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,520
And one of the, it's still unpublished data, but one of the examples was this exercise

231
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:53,520
that was done with the orophacial pain in the patients with TMJ disorder.

232
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:01,520
When the data was analyzed in the certain experiment with under 2,000 people, so this

233
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
is not a huge genetic experience.

234
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,520
For the clinical trials, it's huge for genetic studies.

235
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,520
It's modest size.

236
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:19,520
When we got the genetic data and we had the statistical value of specific genetic polymorphisms,

237
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:28,520
and we took 10 top genetic factors, almost nothing could be explained in terms of overall

238
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:35,520
variability in pain within these under 2,000 people with the certain condition.

239
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:44,520
If, besides genetic, we consider only one non-genetic thing such as sex.

240
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,520
All of a sudden we can explain 8% of variability in this particular condition, in this particular

241
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,520
sample, 8%.

242
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,520
But then we started adding more and more genetic factors, taking more and more polymorphisms

243
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:10,520
with p-values or significant levels, not very impressive, but still top all of the sudden

244
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,520
we could explain more and more of this variability.

245
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:24,520
And the exercise stopped when 3,000 individual polymorphisms from millions of other factors

246
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:35,520
considered, all of the sudden the overall variability was 42%, from 8% with sex only, to 42 where

247
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
sex was considered with genetic factors.

248
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Do we know what does that mean?

249
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
Not yet.

250
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,520
This is only the first step.

251
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:49,520
Now we can go back and then we will need all your studies because then we need to go from

252
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,520
genetic polymorphism to the molecular to the pathway to the specific things that were different

253
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,520
in this patient compared to other patients.

254
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:04,520
So if I understood correctly, is it talking about genetic predisposition to have chronic pain?

255
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Chronic pain.

256
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Right.

257
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,520
And that's just a pure genetic makeup.

258
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
Is it genetic or versus epigenetic?

259
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,520
Or how do you take it from there?

260
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
Not versus.

261
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:25,520
So the beauty of the genetic, pure genetic without AP component is that we can evaluate

262
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,520
it at any time point because we've born that and it doesn't change.

263
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:37,520
And if we have a big sample we can do it instead of candidate genes, we can do all genes together.

264
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:47,520
So the genetic, study genetic makeup of the condition using big samples of patients is a

265
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,520
great step forward, but not the only step.

266
00:20:51,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Then we go to what was done just in addition to the genetics and then we can take other

267
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:08,520
stuff like epigenetic, what a certain pollution was it, toxic environments.

268
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:18,520
We can study the environment around those populations and those that can bring those changes that

269
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:25,520
in the epigenome, something that regulates expression of the genes besides the genetic makeup.

270
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,520
So the sequence of the DNA the same, the expression of the genes is different.

271
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Then we come to the lifestyle, this is pure psychology, lifestyle and beliefs and cultural

272
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,520
and religious and all other habits.

273
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:48,520
Then we come to demographic and it's not only sex or gender, it's also race and ethnic background.

274
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:54,520
It's also age and huge differences that come with age across the lifespan.

275
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Then we come to body mass index, then we come to the smoking and alcoholism and all those

276
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,520
factors and they're all on the border of how much they were genetically predicted in this

277
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,520
particular individual or how much it was already nurtured by the environment.

278
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:23,520
One question for you, how do you deal with chronic pain caused by different

279
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,520
conditions that people may have experienced, like chronic pain of different ideologies?

280
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,520
The idea is that chronic pain itself is a disease.

281
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,520
It can be triggered by different factors, it can be triggered by different, but this is

282
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
the disease, this is the condition.

283
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,520
So the genetic makeup or epigenetic changes may be uniform across the conditions.

284
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,520
So you're assuming that it doesn't matter what caused the chronic pain?

285
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Let me actually give you a concrete study that we actually have done.

286
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:06,520
This is studying subjects, we recruited about 100 patients who had acute back pain and then

287
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:12,520
we followed these patients for three years until they become either chronic pain patients

288
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:20,520
or they become healthy subjects and there is only one study of the sorts and this was

289
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,520
we spent about six, seven years doing this study.

290
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,520
All of these patients were studied with brain imaging from weeks after they developed

291
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,520
an acute back pain and continue to study them for over three years.

292
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,520
By design, they all entered the study essentially with the same duration and the same intensity

293
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,520
of pain and the same etiology, they all have back pain, acute back pain essentially.

294
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:55,520
And by luck, a year or three years later, 50% of them continue to have exactly the same

295
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,520
pain that they started with while the other 50% don't have pain, they recover, they're

296
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
healthy, they're happy.

297
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,520
And then the question is what happened to these subjects?

298
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,520
What we can see first of all is that their brain anatomy and their brain physiology only

299
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,520
of the people who persist in having pain is continuously changing.

300
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:24,520
Moreover, their brain anatomy and brain physiology at time zero, just at the time when they

301
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:32,520
enroll into the study, predicts by about somewhere between 60 to 90% corrects who will develop

302
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,520
chronic pain versus who will not.

303
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,520
One year or up to three years later and these are the limbic brain properties.

304
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,520
Basically, if we simply take the volume of the hippocampus and their amygdala, the connectivity

305
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,520
of the hippocampus and their amygdala to the frontal cortex, to the nucleus accumbens,

306
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:59,520
all of these parameters simply predict one year later who will have chronic pain and who will not.

307
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,520
So you are saying, if I understand you, then I guess it's connected to your comments about

308
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:16,520
no reception, that the chronic pain has no connection to any etiologic factors.

309
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
No, no, no, I didn't say that.

310
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:24,520
But they all end up with some injury that provokes the condition.

311
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:32,520
But some people are at risk, at a priori or at risk to becoming chronic pain patients

312
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
and others are not.

313
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:39,520
They all have the same injury approximately, they all have the same duration and location

314
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,520
and intensity of pain at time zero.

315
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,520
And yet, half of them recover, the other half don't.

316
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,520
And that difference is a brain phenomena.

317
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:56,520
And that brain phenomena also has to be a genetic phenomena, at least in parts.

318
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:07,520
So if you were to examine these patients who continue to have chronic pain

319
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:18,520
and compare their MRIs with MRIs and patients who don't have chronic pain, the MRIs are the same.

320
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,520
Not a few years later, they have changed.

321
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,520
The brain of the person who is developing chronic pain is continuously changing.

322
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,520
I'm not talking about the brain, I'm talking about the back.

323
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,520
The back?

324
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and the back is going to be, we haven't even bothered looking at the back.

325
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,520
The MRI of the back has been done for 50 years.

326
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,520
It explains 1% of the variance of chronic pain.

327
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,520
It has no explanatory value, it has never worked.

328
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
That's what I was asking.

329
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:56,520
What you are saying is that the actual condition of the back has nothing to do with chronic pain.

330
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:02,520
Well, it has not so far, no one has been able to come up with any serious variance being explained

331
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,520
by any of the millions of MRIs that have been done on the back.

332
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
They don't explain the condition.

333
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,520
And yet, we keep doing it, but that's another issue, I guess.

334
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:20,520
The surgery is not the big factor in any chronic pain condition that after surgery.

335
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,520
We did experience with little surgeries such as hernia repair.

336
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,520
Such a tiny thing, and still there is hernia repair.

337
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:42,520
So, it's not the major surgery, but still there are certain, at least 10 to 20% who end up with chronic pain

338
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:50,520
after this tiny surgery, but also more uniform techniques in big surgery such as breast surgery

339
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,520
where the protocols are well-defined.

340
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,520
And the surgical experience is pretty much uniform.

341
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:10,520
And yet, 47% of women have chronic pain after mastectomy at some degree, at some kind or type.

342
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:19,520
And so the surgery itself, this is something that we have, but it's not explaining a big part of variability

343
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,520
and cannot predict who is going to develop what.

344
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:33,520
As a doctor, if I saw somebody who had hernia surgery and who continued to have pain,

345
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:41,520
I would be automatically assuming, based on my ancient training of 50 years ago or 40 years ago,

346
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,520
that there must be something locally present that is continuing to cause that pain.

347
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,520
The same thing would apply if I were talking about someone with back pain.

348
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,520
I think what you are saying is that's not the case.

349
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
That's not the case.

350
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,520
I mean, a little bit on the clinical aspect, it is, and it's not the case from what I can tell you

351
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
from what I've been observing.

352
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,520
There are no risk factors for pain after surgery.

353
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,520
And apparently, surgery can contribute 20-something percent as a cause of chronic pain.

354
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
And the top major...

355
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,520
But that number keeps decreasing, or it increases.

356
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Not really, it's been...

357
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,520
At least according to the studies, they've been looking into the last 25 years or so.

358
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,520
It's been steady, must act to me, hernia repair, thoracic surgeries, amputation surgeries.

359
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,520
Those are like, you know, big offenders as opposed to like other surgeries.

360
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
So those are one of the risk factors.

361
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,520
The other big risk factor is how much pain somebody has right after surgery.

362
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,520
So it's the response to surgery and the acute surgical pain.

363
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,520
The worse surgical pain is, or lasting longer, there's a higher risk factors for chronic pain.

364
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Having pain before surgery is another risk factor, known risk factor at the place of surgery or elsewhere.

365
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:05,520
Somebody who has chronic headache, severe chronic headache, going into surgery as a high risk of having pain after surgery,

366
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
and is somebody who doesn't.

367
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Type of surgery, it does contribute.

368
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,520
Failback surgery syndrome is one of the main contributors to chronic pain after surgery.

369
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,520
It has to do with how many surgeries somebody has had.

370
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:23,520
If somebody has five back surgeries, they're high risk of having chronic pain, then somebody who just had one surgery.

371
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,520
So those factors are known.

372
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,520
But those factors, in fact, if you actually look how much they really contribute to the outcome,

373
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,520
then each one of them is a tiny amount of variance.

374
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
But how do you know that?

375
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,520
From the literature, that's what I know.

376
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
That's really what the numbers show.

377
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,520
Every one of these factors is a tiny amount.

378
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:50,520
What I'm saying is, if I simply look at the volume of the amygdala, I can explain 50% of the variance.

379
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
50%.

380
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
That's a massive number.

381
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:01,520
That's not something to sort of ignore and say, well, you know, I have another 2% here and another, I have 5% there.

382
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
And if I add them up, maybe I can...

383
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,520
So, yes, I don't...

384
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Of course, no seception is part of pain perception.

385
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,520
I'm not going to sit here and say there is no no seception.

386
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,520
Of course, no seceptive drive is part of the system.

387
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:32,520
But the critical part that at least what I believe nowadays is that how that no seception is transferred into pain by the brain is the critical transformation which changes the formula.

388
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:42,520
So, the same no seceptor may be painful or maybe not painful and that difference by and large, at least in our hands, is driven by the brain.

389
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,520
That's all I'm saying.

390
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,520
You need to replicate that in a whole bunch of different chronic pain states.

391
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
Oh, absolutely.

392
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:54,520
And in fact, NIH has multiple studies ongoing to replicate those results.

393
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:01,520
So, then if somebody has a, let's say, brain predisposition to have chronic pain, you can remove all these other factors and the naked still develop chronic pain.

394
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,520
More so than other folks, you know, that...

395
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
Absolutely.

396
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,520
We have not, in fact, we use all of those factors as confounds.

397
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,520
We take them away before we create the model.

398
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:21,520
So, we've in fact, you know, taken those variables out and then, looking at what the brain is contributing to these effects.

399
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,520
We're going to deal with causal versus correlation.

400
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Aha.

401
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
Well, that's a very good question.

402
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,520
And I asked him how he deals with causal versus correlation.

403
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,520
So, that's a great question.

404
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:49,520
And causality, the strongest answer to for dissociating causality from correlation is being able to predict the future.

405
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Okay?

406
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
Future is not a correlation.

407
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
Future is causality.

408
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:04,520
So, if I can predict what you will do tomorrow, I'm already coming up with a mechanism that has...

409
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,520
That you have this simplest concept of causality is predicting the future.

410
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:21,520
So, that's why I'm discussing, you know, if I have parameters today that can tell me two years, three years down the line,

411
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:30,520
how this subject will behave, you have to give me a credit that I'm talking something having to do with causality.

412
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,520
It's not correlation anymore.

413
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:43,520
So, now that brings out a whole other bag of works that we can discuss, like free will and, you know,

414
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:53,520
having determining your own destiny and who I am as a self, but the data in a sense is still...

415
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Maybe it would be interesting to hear from you about...

416
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,520
I don't know, I'm having trouble with this, but thank you.

417
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:11,520
Maybe it would be interesting for people to hear from you about the current thoughts on, you know, these brain signatures of pain that you're talking about.

418
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:19,520
I won't argue that the pain, that, you know, brain is important for the pain and you can't feel pain without the brain and that kind of thing.

419
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:27,520
So, I don't want people to get confused with my view here on just, you know, just to restate my point is that, you know,

420
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:36,520
you take information in from the environment, from internal organs that is no-susceptive and it gets transferred into pain.

421
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,520
I consider that whole process to be pain. I mean, just to be simple about it.

422
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
But in the brain...

423
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
No, not simple. Let's be complex, please.

424
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:55,520
In the brain, all of these regions that he's talking about that are involved in pain, people have considered this the pain matrix.

425
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:05,520
And what it turns out is that, you know, these, I mean, of course, it's obvious many of these brain areas are used for other things.

426
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,520
Like, you know, anxiety and, you know, various emotions.

427
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,520
And anyway, maybe you could talk a little bit about, you know, when you're talking about...

428
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,520
The specificity of the way it's signatures, is that what...

429
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Of course, maybe you can just explain when you're talking about the amygdala and this and how those are interacting.

430
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,520
And that gives you the ability to predict the future.

431
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Yeah, so that's far into... So, there is pure experimental observation, which is, I have a parameter that predicts outcome.

432
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,520
Then the question is, what is pain perception in the brain? That's a much more complex question.

433
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,520
I don't pretend to have answered that question.

434
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,520
What I'm saying is I can find mechanisms predicting of outcome.

435
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,520
I did not explain what perception of pain is.

436
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:02,520
The perception of pain is a complex brain state, which we are all working on.

437
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:10,520
And there is a lot of excitement in the field and lots of people throwing mud at each other, which is great, which is how you work progress.

438
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:21,520
But that fact does not have any other bearing to the fact that if I simply measure the amygdala or the hippocampus volume,

439
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,520
and I use that as a risk factor, it predicts the long term outcome of the pain state.

440
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,520
I did not explain the pain by this. This is simply a risk factor.

441
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:39,520
In a sense, these circuitry are involved in the process of transition from acute to chronic pain.

442
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:47,520
And this is exactly what we and now multiple other groups are doing, looking at the brain circuitry,

443
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:57,520
organizing in time in animal models, following an injury, the synaptic reorganization,

444
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:08,520
there is cellular reorganization across many brain areas, including the nucleus accumbens, the medial prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the amygdala,

445
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
and the vector segmental area.

446
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:20,520
These are all brain areas that we now have animal data, showing that they are changing in time, their synaptic properties, their information exchange across them,

447
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:30,520
within days after a peripheral injury. And in a sense, it would be very hard for me to say that all of these things are because of the nociceptor.

448
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:38,520
That's the only thing I'm saying. There is a whole brain reorganization that happens in the transition of chronic pain.

449
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,520
The details remain... Well, what causes the brain?

450
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Well, again, the details we don't know. Of course, the injury is part of it. We have to have the injury.

451
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,520
And the most deceptive signal has to be in there. I'm not denying that the most deceptive signal has to be there.

452
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:05,520
But that's an initial drive. But these regions, by changing in their properties, they shift the organism into a new state.

453
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,520
And I think that's the chronic pain state.

454
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:16,520
There are a number of European studies where they can actually go in and do experiments on patients.

455
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:31,520
And what they've shown is that a number of these patients who are experiencing neuropathic pain, if they go in and they selectively anesthetize the nerves that would be sending signals, say, from the leg back to the brain,

456
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:37,520
they anesthetize those nerves. The patient's pain goes away.

457
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:44,520
So the evidence is that there is an ongoing signal coming along from the nociceptors up to the brain.

458
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:52,520
And these people are experiencing chronic pain patients for a number of different mechanisms for how they develop that chronic pain.

459
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,520
I agree. I don't have any problems with this.

460
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,520
But that signal is going, it's not that it came at the beginning and they became chronic pain. They still have a signal coming.

461
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,520
So there's a signal coming to their brain and that's what's causing them to have the pain.

462
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,520
I don't know. The last sentence is not necessary.

463
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,520
The anesthetize. The causality that you created was not necessarily two.

464
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,520
So the better test of causality is block the signal.

465
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:29,520
You block the signal with Novocaine, whatever they're using to block the nerve from conducting action potentials to the brain.

466
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,520
They stop conducting. The pain goes away. The patients are awake.

467
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:46,520
They ask them, the pain goes away. And then as the medication wears off, the patient recovers and the pain comes back.

468
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,520
These experiments are on live functioning human beings.

469
00:39:50,520 --> 00:40:00,520
In a number of situations, there are a number of chronic pain situations that are treated by Novocaine patches.

470
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:07,520
And they're probably working the exact same way. They're blocking the nerve from sending a signal back to the brain and causing pain.

471
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,520
So there's a few theories for that. The theory is partially, I believe, clinically true.

472
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:23,520
But the problem is if we can maintain this block for a long period of time, perhaps we would be able to block the transition from acute to chronic pain.

473
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,520
But that's just practically not really feasible. And why is that?

474
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Because the healing process takes days. Takes a long, long, long time.

475
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,520
And any point during this healing process, sensitization can occur.

476
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:46,520
And I'm talking about this concept of sensual sensitization, which is responsible to some extent to development of chronic pain.

477
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:55,520
So it means we have an injury. There's inflammatory processes going on the side of injury, which triggers peripheral sensitization.

478
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,520
So the area is red. It's swollen. It hurts. And whatnot.

479
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:09,520
There's some signals going to the spinal cord and to the brain. But eventually the brain and the organism kicks in and fights the pain and inflammation process.

480
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,520
And eventually things calm down and the pain goes away. That's part of the healing process.

481
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:20,520
But because of various risk factors, maybe limbic system and in a previous position could be one of those.

482
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Or if there's an ongoing barrage of painful signals coming from the periphery, we end up sensitizing the spinal cord.

483
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:39,520
And then there's a whole bunch of other processes happening. And this can happen a day after surgery, two days after injury, three, four, five, ten days, fifteen days even.

484
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,520
And the reason why this is a hypothesis is that we can do these blocks.

485
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:54,520
We can apply local anesthetic blocks and keep the area numb for two, three days. And people can still develop chronic pain five months later.

486
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:02,520
So there's something else that we're not quite catching there. Some moment of time could be ten days perhaps up to surgery.

487
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:12,520
Hence we have this concept of preventive analgesia where we try to cover from before the surgery or impact or injury to some period of time afterwards

488
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:20,520
and see if we can capture the entire process of sensitization and then prevent this chronic pain from happening.

489
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:32,520
So, I mean, I take the point very seriously. This is an issue that is due to my work. And it's an important question.

490
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:39,520
And I absolutely believe that data that's been published. And I know the people who have published the papers are their good friends.

491
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:49,520
And I think that's the question. The question is what is really happening? And in a sense that you have a noreceptive signal

492
00:42:49,520 --> 00:43:07,520
and when you stop the noreceptive signal, yes, it looks like the pain goes away. The question is, where did the switch happen from that noreceptive signal being a transient event to being a long-term event?

493
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:17,520
And the idea, the simple idea that we have put forward is that the limbic brain is interpreting the noreceptive signal

494
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:35,520
so that its properties are changing in a sense that a single action potential of noreceptive action potential, which in a healthy subject you would simply ignore and not feel pain with it, now is interpreted as pain.

495
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:43,520
So, yes, the noreceptive signal is there. The question is, how is that noreceptive signal being interpreted?

496
00:43:43,520 --> 00:44:01,520
Was it subconscious? Was it conscious? Or how much of it has invaded by consciousness? Is in a sense, you know, my hand-waving interpretation of our data given the role of noreceptive, they have to play within it?

497
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:18,520
I don't know, is that? I'm curious. That's your work. I mean, there's a whole slew of people, Dr. Seel, who are studying, but they're not looking up here in the cortical regions, they're looking in the spinal cord for where this occurs.

498
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:27,520
And there's a lot of evidence that it occurs in the spinal cord. Yes and no. I mean, yes, there is evidence, of course, there's central sensitization.

499
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:35,520
Max classic Clifford Wolf has done it. We have 30 years of data on the subject. But central sensitization happens with a sunburn.

500
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:54,520
No one develops chronic pain from sunburn. So, and it's, you know, and in fact, if you look at the noreceptive signal coming into the spinal cord, recent data from Cheryl Stokke, looking at arthritis models of pain, in fact, the noreceptive signal seems to go down after the injury,

501
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:11,520
while the animal is now exhibiting more pain. So, the correlation, even the correlation between the noreceptive signal and chronic pain has remained mostly fate, and it has, that the evidence is not very clean.

502
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,520
Although there's a huge amount of work on the subject. Yes, please.

503
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:35,520
At this point in time, the way that I view it is, you know, what he's talking about essentially is you have an injury, and then it goes through different stages like you guys were talking about where there's sensitization at the periphery, sensitization in the spinal cord.

504
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:49,520
And then ultimately, you know, I think what he's referring to is in a chronic pain state, you could end up with a situation where the pain is mainly, you know, the plasticity has happened in the brain.

505
00:45:49,520 --> 00:46:09,520
And so, what I think he's talking about is, and what we've been talking about is really the time course of the pain, and how the pain moves, so to speak, through the system. And so, you know, is the spinal cord important for pain becoming chronic?

506
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Probably. I mean, it's hard to imagine that it wouldn't be. It's, you know, the pathway that it takes.

507
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:37,520
But at some point, does it become independent of that? You know, that's possible in some conditions. I mean, the other thing is not, you know, you can't really, this is something that my lab is really interested in, that I was telling them before, is you can't, my belief is you can't equate different kinds of pain.

508
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:50,520
You know, if you have diabetic neuropathy, if you have, you know, post-surgical pain, if you have cancer pain, these are all, you know, inflammatory pain like arthritis.

509
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:59,520
These are all different pains that manifest differently, and have different neural circuits, and need to be treated differently.

510
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:16,520
And whether they all end up in one place in the brain, if they remain chronic, I can't actually speak to that. But I know that in our studies, we don't see the same circuits involved in these different types of pain. They're different circuits.

511
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,520
I agree with you.

512
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:27,520
And that comes to treatment. And if you're going to get treated, you need to be treated for the kind of pain that you have. And I think a lot of people do take that into account.

513
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,520
But, you know, that's the direction that we're interested in.

514
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:40,520
No, I agree. We've published a whole series of studies looking at brain activity for different chronic pain conditions. And each one of them, we show its own signature.

515
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:54,520
The signatures are unique. But of course, there's also a lot of overlap between them. And exactly what that shows us, I'm not quite sure, in a sense that, you know, behaviorally, these patients have different behaviors.

516
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:07,520
You know, an archdiast patient is not the same as a headache patient. Obviously, even their daily behavior is different. So living with these conditions will end up with a different unique brain signature to start with.

517
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:20,520
And yet also, they have a lot of overlap between them, too. So I don't have the answer about the uniqueness versus the convergence of representation of perception.

518
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:40,520
I'm just talking more about the risk factors of getting into that state. And also, there's really nice new data showing how many brain circuitry are reorganizing in these animal models, which we did not know a few years ago.

519
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:50,520
So if I may just add a little bit to that, to expand. And what we're talking about is very interesting concept. There's a concept also of condition pain modulation.

520
00:48:50,520 --> 00:49:01,520
So there's a setup in the brain to begin with that helps our body and our organism deal with pain. And everybody has a different condition pain modulation.

521
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:10,520
That's how much you can tolerate pain. And genetics can also, I'm sure, reveal that. And what's your threshold for pain? What's your pain sensitivity?

522
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:19,520
Suddenly, that kind of ties into the limbic system. But certainly, there's also a change that happened after we exposed to acute to chronic pain as well.

523
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:28,520
But there is a predisposition from the get-go, from the higher brain centers that regulate the response to pain through this condition pain modulation.

524
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:39,520
But I think they also involved all the other downstream pathways, because one of the mechanisms, or one of the therapies that we use for chronic pain, is spinal cord stimulation.

525
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:46,520
Which is basically applying the electrical stimulation, the spinal cord area, triggering...

526
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,520
Is that the perspective of the ecology of the pain?

527
00:49:50,520 --> 00:50:09,520
Well, there are some differences. I mean, it's not really used for any chronic pain state, but the neuralgia, chronic nerve type of pain, or other types of more complex pain states have been managed with the spinal cord stimulation.

528
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:24,520
Or even peripheral nerve stimulation. But the theory is that we're activating certain pathways in the spinal cord area, which then travel to the brain and cause reorganization in the brain structures, based on certainans and norepinephrine.

529
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:39,520
Because as we know, depression, anxiety, catastrophizing, those are risk factors for developing chronic pain. And they have to do with levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, how much we can make and how much we can use them.

530
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:48,520
So there's definitely that aspect as well. So I don't know how that ties into the limbic system from the get-go and then development of these changes, corticone.

531
00:50:48,520 --> 00:51:01,520
We really don't know what spinal cord stimulation is really doing. And for many, many years, you know, evidence keeps accumulating for spinal cord stimulation for its efficacy.

532
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:17,520
On the other hand, its efficacy is amazingly counterbalanced with the lack of any new therapeutic drugs, for example, that we have not been able to develop from 50 years of studying peripheral neurosis,

533
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:28,520
peripheral neurosusceptors, and spinal cord circuitry. We know that circuitry probably better than any other circuitry in the brain. We know every neurotransmitter and every synapse in that spinal cord.

534
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:39,520
And yet, we don't have a single drug that has come out of it successfully. So there is a real gap in that approach that has not paid off.

535
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:50,520
You know, I'm waiting for you. It's not quite true that they have developed drugs.

536
00:51:50,520 --> 00:52:00,520
And the problem is when you bring those drugs to humans, you discover that they have significant side effects, and therefore they can't be used.

537
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:11,520
But that doesn't mean that they haven't, from the basic science, gone and developed drugs that are analgesic, but they can't use them because they have significant side effects.

538
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,520
Well, I mean, the classic example is T-V-1, right? That's that.

539
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:24,520
That's exactly one. There are numerous pharmaceutical companies that have developed drugs to give analgesia. Those drugs work.

540
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:33,520
And in humans, they call it hyper... They only do that. They cause hypothermia, and that's a serious side effect, and that's stopped them from being used clinically.

541
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:46,520
That's a perfect example. There are drugs, there are antibodies that are used for treating chronic arthritis in the knee, and those drugs work.

542
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:55,520
But they also cause significant side effects. A significant fraction of the people getting them have to go out and have complete knee replacement.

543
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:01,520
Well, the anti-NGF looks like it's going to be a successful drug, which will be the first one.

544
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:08,520
But the thing that keeps these drugs from being used are the side effects.

545
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:24,520
Yeah, they're cool. I think exciting developments on that front. One of them is this new concept. I don't know how new it is, but there's some recent data that suggests that you can get synergy by combining some of the opioids for the door.

546
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:34,520
Delta opioid receptor and new opioid receptor. So you can use 100-fold less drug than you would have before, and that seems promising.

547
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:39,520
And the other thing that's happening is people are starting to understand better.

548
00:53:39,520 --> 00:54:03,520
When you take opioids, you have these side effects like constipation, or the obvious problem with drug addiction, and people are starting to take apart these different, let's say, pathways that the opioids, when they activate the receptors, there's the anti-nosticeptive aspect, and then there's these side effects, and they're starting to be able to break that down so they can just target

549
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,520
one without getting the others. So I think that's an exciting development.

550
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:17,520
Yeah, I don't know if it's validated or not, that opioids over a period of time, in fact, increase pain.

551
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,520
Yeah, fractional.

552
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:28,520
And so is that something like that would support your position?

553
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:35,520
No, in fact, we have a very large grant proposal that's sitting at NIH to specifically answer that question.

554
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:42,520
We will know the whether we will get funded in the next few months or so, and then we have a five-year project along those lines.

555
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:54,520
So the data is not really there, but in a sense, the opiate circuitry is very much, of course, a limbic involvement.

556
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:02,520
And so given that the limbic circuitry, now we know there's plenty of data from many different labs

557
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:10,520
that within days after an injury starts reorganizing, exactly how opiates are now acting within that circuitry,

558
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,520
and its sub-components of the receptor types and all of that.

559
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,520
It's all open, we don't know the answer, the science has not been done.

560
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:27,520
But do we know when opioids are helping pain, what is the, where are they acting on?

561
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:34,520
Well, the classic assumption is that it's the mu-opiates in the peri-acro-doctorate and descending modulation in the spinal cord.

562
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:45,520
That's the standard line, but opiates act in the reward circuitry, and the reward circuitry is the main,

563
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,520
we think is a main risk factor for developing chronic pain.

564
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:56,520
So that circuitry is changing in time, and these, they are studies that are just beginning to happen,

565
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,520
but the data is still very young.

566
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:08,520
A couple of years ago with genetic studies, we found that there is a particular genetic mutation in u-opiate receptor

567
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,520
that encodes a very different type of reception, u-opiate reception,

568
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,520
and it is structurally very different. Instead of seven transmembran, it has only six transmembran.

569
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:28,520
And at least in animals, we have a hope that these may explain why certain people develop these hyperalgesia

570
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:38,520
or other side effects to the same opiates, and the variance of this particular mutation is somewhat the same range

571
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:44,520
as the proportion of people who have this atypical response to opiates.

572
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:51,520
So it's right now equal possibility that it may be explained by what one is talking about,

573
00:56:51,520 --> 00:57:02,520
or it may be a different, structurally different receptor per se, so everything is different in response to opiates

574
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:08,520
in those patients who are unfortunate to having two copies of this mutation.

575
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:16,520
So these are all very amazing concepts, but we also have to keep in mind there's different types of pain as we mentioned,

576
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,520
and opiates only work on one type of pain.

577
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,520
There's pure nociceptotype of pain.

578
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,520
As inflammatory opiates don't really tend to work great on inflammatory pain, or neuropathic pain.

579
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,520
Opiates are not great medications for neuropathic pain, visceral pain as well.

580
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,520
So what we are talking about is opiates induce hyperalgesia.

581
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,520
It's a phenomenon, it's very interesting, but we don't only have a good grasp of that.

582
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:46,520
It kind of goes along with tolerance, and some people that take opiates for a period of time develop tolerance

583
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:53,520
to the effect of opiates, which means they might require increasing dose to have the same effect.

584
00:57:53,520 --> 00:58:00,520
While people that have opiates hyperalgesia develop more pain, and adding more opiates actually makes the pain worse.

585
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:07,520
But the whole concept of what really triggers the hyperalgesia is very interesting, but it's really unknown.

586
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:16,520
But the good point is that opiates are just there, part of our pain fighting kind of therapies or strategies that we have.

587
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:22,520
And they're really good to some extent for acute pain, but not so much for chronic pain.

588
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,520
Because chronic pain is completely different, long game.

589
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:33,520
But what would they imagine with anything chronic that there would be changes in the brain?

590
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,520
So is that you are saying something more than that?

591
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:47,520
What I'm saying is there are changes, and we think the changes, in a sense, the changes differentiate subjects who become healthy,

592
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,520
where we don't see any changes.

593
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:58,520
So the unexpected result, you would think that they were diverging, they would show similar or complementary results.

594
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:03,520
No, the ones who recover and are normal don't show any changes.

595
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:13,520
Only the ones who persist on becoming, who persist with the pain, first of all, their whole brain, grey matter, volume decreases.

596
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:21,520
There's a whole brain volume decrease, not, and that volume decrease is specific to specific brain areas.

597
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:29,520
We can actually show three or four brain areas where the density of the cortical grey matter is decreasing in time.

598
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:36,520
And that decrease is in fact also directly related to the functional connectivity of those areas as well.

599
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:47,520
So functional anatomical properties of the brain are changing in time, and yes, we define that as creating the chronic pain brain in a sense,

600
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:57,520
whether how much of that is basically a consequence of living with the condition versus an actual causally, it's hard to dissociate.

601
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:08,520
But we see the effects very early on, so within six weeks after the first brain scan, six weeks later there are already specific brain changes,

602
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:13,520
and those continue to happen over, in fact, years to come.

603
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:25,520
And so that's in a sense, we think of it as the adaptation of the brain and creation of the brain of being its chronic state.

604
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:38,520
And basically the very simple idea that all of this that we have pushed forward is that the brain is becoming addicted to nociception.

605
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,520
So yes, nociception is important.

606
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:52,520
In fact, the brain is exaggerating the interpretation of that nociception into continuous pain as opposed to interwetal pain, let's say.

607
01:00:52,520 --> 01:01:00,520
So that's a simplistic idea, I don't have to prove for it, but that's a concept that we can sort of play with.

608
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,520
And the relevance of it is in terms of treatment.

609
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:10,520
Treatment mechanisms and specific circuitry, right, and in and along those lines we actually have a clinical trial,

610
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,520
specifically on with this idea.

611
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:21,520
Basically, we also have in animal models, we show that dopamine that has something to do with addiction in a sense, right,

612
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:28,520
dopamine concentration in the brain drops by 50% within days after a peripheral nerve injury.

613
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:35,520
And if we give these animals dopamine back, we show amazing pain relief.

614
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:47,520
So we actually have a clinical trial in humans trying to see if we can use this concept to stop the transition from an initial injury to long-term chronic qualification.

615
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,520
And it's an ongoing study, I don't know the results.

616
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:55,520
Just to go back to interesting, you know what you're saying with these changes that happen with chronic pain,

617
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,520
but there's also studies looking into reversal of these changes with successful management.

618
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:08,520
So it's a great concept too, so sometimes it's not really irreversible changes that...

619
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:16,520
We don't know how much of it is reversible, and certainly some of it is reversible, there's no question about that, which is nice.

620
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,520
But there's hope.

621
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,520
Absolutely, yes. Yeah, no, I think in fact, I mean, we are very excited.

622
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:32,520
I think in a sense, all of a sudden, there are many different directions with which we can actually try to come up with novel approaches to therapy.

623
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:41,520
I mean, brain regions that was never thought to be part of pain, all of a sudden they all probably helped the circuitry.

624
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,520
And so they all fail game in that sense.

625
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:50,520
I think the concept that brain is changing as a result of chronic pain, it's interesting, but it's also...

626
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:58,520
The reversal is also interesting that if we can reverse those changes and then regenerate those changes back,

627
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:05,520
and that's absolutely possible, because we do have new genes that are getting turned on in chronic pain states.

628
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,520
They were not active before.

629
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,520
So if there's a way to turn them on, there's probably a way to turn them back off.

630
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,520
Exactly.

631
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,520
And that's where new genes that can deal with that too.

632
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,520
Absolutely.

633
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:25,520
Meditation, for example, apparently it's been shown that chronic pain, meditation, brain changes, folks that do practice meditation on the radio basically.

634
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,520
Manipulation sleep is another one.

635
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,520
Or epigenetics.

636
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,520
Or it's because of that.

637
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:40,520
So epigenetics comes with things like meditation, mouthfulness, therapies, sleep manipulation, mood manipulation, all those.

638
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:50,520
And the phenotypes that you described with this condition pain evaluation, that may be a surrogate to the brain events that Vanya describes.

639
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:55,520
So you can... because you know, we know that MRI is not a very cheap technique.

640
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:06,520
So we can maybe avoid it by evaluating those phenotypes like with quantitative sensory testing.

641
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:26,520
When we assess the ability of the whole system to respond to no-susception with endogenous inhibitory mechanisms, and we can assess it without fMRI with very simple protocols.

642
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:36,520
And they may be reflecting those brain changes that are totally plastic, and we can manipulate those.

643
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,520
Are we on the same grant?

644
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,520
Do we have this experiment?

645
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,520
No, I'm not grants.

646
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,520
I'm not...

647
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,520
No, you're not.

648
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,520
You're not.

649
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:55,520
But to put this in a critical perspective while all this is important, besides being fascinating, is if we can find a way to perhaps try to track down and find folks that might be at higher risk for the whole system.

650
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:07,520
And maybe at higher risk for developing chronic pain, is there a way to kind of apply more therapies and more modalities to try to prevent that from happening?

651
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,520
Including your blocks.

652
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:24,520
The whole idea of genetic testing is, can we know a priori to the big manipulation, management, surgery, whatever, who is at risk and we have to do something specific, like additional blocks during the pandemic.

653
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:33,520
And then you have to do some of the other blocks during the surgery to try to avoid these pathological circles that goes to Vanya's changes.

654
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,520
Yes.

655
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,520
And why is this important?

656
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:41,520
Because not everybody who's having surgery ends up developing chronic pain, right?

657
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:52,520
Some people do, but we have all different sorts of analgesic, anesthetic and other kind of options to deal with pain during surgery, but not everybody needs those.

658
01:05:52,520 --> 01:06:10,520
So if we can identify who is at higher risk, and then we can apply perhaps more of something that's called multimodal, covering different pain pathways, different nociceptive pathways, perhaps a little bit better, hoping that they won't end up developing pain.

659
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:23,520
And as opposed to somebody who might have low risk for developing pain, based on genetics or testing, sensory testing, pinprick testing, people have different sensitivity to different painful sensations.

660
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:37,520
So, I mean exactly along those lines, so we actually have again, I'm sorry, I'm brain centric, and I will end up going back to the brain, but we actually have a model from our studies that calculates the risk for chronic pain.

661
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:46,520
And this clinical trial that we're doing right now, we don't treat people who are at low risk, and we only treat people who are at high risk.

662
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:58,520
In a sense, this is a validation step to just see whether our model generalizes to a new population, and we don't know, but a third of the patients who entered the study are not given anything.

663
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:11,520
We say, oh, just wait, just wait, we have to decide what to do with you, but we're hoping that their pain will just go away spontaneously without having us to do anything, based on our risk assessment on them.

664
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:19,520
So, but I thought there are no accepted ways of treating people to avoid chronic pain.

665
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:30,520
Well, so again, this is a novel drug combination that we are testing for the first time. We've shown this drug combination to be effective in animal models.

666
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:46,520
We've published this recently, and this is interesting bear with me for a second, because we actually try, we give these subjects both NSAIDs, the standard line of treatment for patients who are in pain, as well as dopamine.

667
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:53,520
And in, at least in our animal model, when we give the two together, the animals essentially, for weeks, don't show any pain behavior.

668
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:58,520
When we give either one of them by itself, they have very little effect.

669
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:07,520
So, the concept here is that we are trying to stop the brain from becoming addicted to the pain by the dopamine that we give them.

670
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:15,520
At the same time, decreasing the non-ceceptive signal from the periphery, and we don't know if it will work in humans or not,

671
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,520
you know, the study is blinded and it's ongoing.

672
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:23,520
But the whole idea is that you can't apply the same approach to everyone.

673
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,520
No, I don't.

674
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:40,520
Because this, this, what we, when we talk about individualized, personalized precision, it's all coming back from this general idea that you can't have the magic pill that will work exactly, identically, in, in every patient with pain is just drawn.

675
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:45,520
And now we know why, because of all those phenomena that we just described.

676
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:58,520
So, we try to know who is going to respond better to what, and we're talking about type of, of pain management, those of the pain killer, or whatever it is.

677
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,520
So, is this going to have an impact on anesthesia?

678
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:08,520
You're going to be able to tell ahead of time how much a person needs anesthesia before surgery?

679
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,520
Well, I think so.

680
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,520
Well, I mean, not just that.

681
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,520
They could all get anesthesia before surgery, I think.

682
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:17,520
That's a good concept.

683
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:31,520
And also to link up on that, I mean, we'll be doing testing where we can get a genetic makeup of everyone and basically figure out if they have tolerance to certain medications or sensitivity side effects.

684
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:40,520
So, typical example, not everybody likes opioids and some people have different, you know, liking on different opioids.

685
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:46,520
And, and we as, as of now, basically just go by whatever they tell us experience or trial and error.

686
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:57,520
But yeah, I mean, we will be able to tell how much somebody needs and tailor it a little bit properly, medication-wise and the amount-wise, too.

687
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:15,520
I mean, along those lines, I think there's data brought from our study and from the NIH ongoing study for pelvic pain population, at least that there's good evidence that we should be able to identify for each chronic pain patient.

688
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,520
What is maybe not today, but down the line, we have the tools to do it.

689
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,520
Who will respond to which kind of treatment?

690
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:29,520
In a sense, all the treatments that we have are effective in one third of the population and they decrease one third of their pain.

691
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:41,520
On the other hand, if we match them properly, I think we would have a much better outcome because we randomly are giving them any drug that comes to the, to the hand of the physician, not having any information.

692
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:56,520
But we and multiple other studies have now shown that there is specific subject efficacy based on brain anatomy and brain function as to what treatment a given subject will respond to.

693
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:08,520
Before we stop, I would like you just to say something because I hadn't heard of it before about phantom breast pain and nipple pain following mastectomy.

694
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:13,520
Because I had not heard of phantom, only heard of phantom limb.

695
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:28,520
Phantom pain is a mystery and is a mystery phenomenon and this is like a perfect example of how much brain is involved because phantom pain is literally everything happening in brain only.

696
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:49,520
And so we were looking at the link between neurological diseases such as epilepsy and chronic pain disorders and we tried to see the model where the pain cannot be triggered from the periphery anymore.

697
01:11:49,520 --> 01:12:03,520
And so we wanted to see this phantom pain as an example of such a pain. And everybody knows that some people develop phantom pain after amputation of their limb.

698
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,520
But apparently it's not just in the limb, it's in any organ that is amputated.

699
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:17,520
And one of the most frequent cancer surgeries in United States female population is breast cancer.

700
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:28,520
And many of post mastectomy women develop neuropathic painful conditions. One of the types of these conditions is phantom pain.

701
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,520
It could be phantom breast or phantom nipple.

702
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:42,520
And it's also the great example of how pain may be part of the phenomenon but not entirely.

703
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:52,520
So with phantom nipple for example, pain is not the major destructive thing. It's all about other sensations.

704
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:56,520
So with phantom breast pain is one of the major complaints.

705
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:11,520
And this is one of the most challenging conditions as any neuropathic pain condition for treatment where all alternative and other multi-model approaches would be the first choice

706
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:17,520
because mono model therapy just doesn't work.

707
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:28,520
And there are interesting techniques that our brain comes with. And I was telling this morning that we had a patient who had phantom limb.

708
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:35,520
And he said that pain itself, he can live with that. But there are things that drive him crazy.

709
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:44,520
One of them is that he has a feeling that one finger on his missing foot going up another finger.

710
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:56,520
And that drives him crazy. So he himself developed a technique to deal with this type of sensation by coming to the mirror with his prosthetic leg.

711
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:12,520
And putting his fingers on the phantom, yes, trying and looking at the mirror and his brain somehow accepted this manipulation.

712
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:21,520
And that gave him relief from this. So pain is a mystery thing. It's all in brain.

713
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:32,520
And we can do interesting things manipulating this brain, fighting, suffering that is the part of this pain perception.

714
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,520
Thank you. Let me give you one more. Are we done?

715
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,520
We can go on retraining the brain.

716
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,520
Retraining the brain.

717
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:48,520
To deal with the pain. Hence regenerating. Same similar concept, spinal cord injury or post stroke injury.

718
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:56,520
We are retraining the body. And the more we can retrain, we can reestablish the healthy circuits, the better off folks might be.

719
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,520
That's the mirror therapy where you're trying to basically tell your brain it's okay.

720
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:07,520
Till the brain is able on its own to kind of assume that there's no issue going on there anymore.

721
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:15,520
Like smiling when you're depressed, go and smile. And somehow it manipulates the brain. And maybe with this technique.

722
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,520
There's something also very specifically different about chronic pain.

723
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:27,520
And this is, you know, we have been looking at information sharing in the brain in these chronic pain patients.

724
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:39,520
And what is amazing is that if you look at how much information is shared in the brain, we can come up with an approximate rule of how that information is shared in healthy subjects.

725
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:47,520
When we look at chronic pain patients, there is a massive decrease of this information sharing.

726
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:53,520
And the amount of decrease seems to be proportional to the amount of pain that they have.

727
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,520
And that decrease is everywhere in the brain.

728
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:04,520
In a sense that the chronic pain affects information processing everywhere in the brain.

729
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:14,520
And we can only find this in the chronic pain patients, but if we give them an acute painful stimulus of the same intensity, nothing like this happens.

730
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:31,520
So there is an actual interference of conscious processing that subjects are doing, that they are unable to process by simply having living with this massive negative state of being, that's in a sense.

731
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,520
Okay. Any questions?

732
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:52,520
What do we know about patients who are either spontaneously improved or are cured of chronic pain?

733
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,520
I mean, I'm thinking, for example, we mentioned retraining.

734
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:03,520
What about stroke patients, right, who improved?

735
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:08,520
Those who suffer stroke after, they have chronic pain.

736
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:20,520
And what about those patients where we do not see an etiology, with therapeutic etiology?

737
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:28,520
I don't know. The clinician should answer. I don't know. I mean, it's a very, very event. I don't see them.

738
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,520
But I'm not looking for them either, right?

739
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:36,520
What I'm suggesting is that it may be worthwhile to look at that.

740
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:40,520
Yeah, but how long do I wait until they get better?

741
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,520
I'm not suggesting that what you should do.

742
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:50,520
Yeah, no, I'm suggesting that it may be worthwhile. The problem is that it's a great event, right?

743
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,520
It's the sad part of it, I think.

744
01:17:53,520 --> 01:18:02,520
Well, it depends on the definition of chronicity of the pain and whether you go from having it completely go away,

745
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:08,520
it disappears to you manage it. So it's not really as panned anymore.

746
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:13,520
It's part of living, but it's not as debilitating. Those are different concepts, too.

747
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,520
Because chronic pain by definition is something that's chronically present, kind of like arthritis,

748
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:27,520
which don't make your arthritis go away. It's either it's mild, moderate, or severe, and then we end up having a replacement surgery

749
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:34,520
and might go away, or to some extent. But chronic by definition, if it goes away, that process is gone.

750
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,520
So it's an interesting concept, but it depends really on the situation.

751
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:47,520
I mean, it could be. There are cases of people having chronic pain that goes away with effective treatment.

752
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:56,520
Hernia repair surgery, why is that so interesting because of the little small nerve in that area that gets irritated at some point,

753
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:02,520
either from the mesh that's placed or from the changes in the body over time.

754
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:10,520
Muscle versus fat versus other structures that kind of change over time, and then basically cause a chronic irritation in the area.

755
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:20,520
And chronic irritation then becomes this chronic pain, but there's some treatments, nerve injections, for example, that can make this thing go away.

756
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:28,520
Or removal of the mesh can make this chronic pain go away. You literally remove that ongoing signal.

757
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:35,520
And in this particular case, maybe we didn't really get to the point where the overwhelming changes in the brain.

758
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:42,520
And then now it's kind of almost impossible to reverse it. Yeah. To some extent it is possible.

759
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:52,520
Spinal core stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation can also, to some extent, slow down, or maybe even stop some of the chronic pain states.

760
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:55,520
And I'm not really sure what the mechanism of that is.

761
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:05,520
But does this spinal core stimulation give you, is there enough subjects who say, okay, I'm done, I don't have pain anymore?

762
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,520
And I can turn this thing off and go home and I'm happy.

763
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:16,520
Yeah, it's a matter of how many patients do you need to see so you can say that yes, it definitely stops the chronic pain.

764
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,520
But I've seen it, I mean there's reports of it, so it's possible.

765
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:28,520
But it's definitely a minority of patients who have to say it's more like a management tool rather than a cure tool.

766
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:37,520
Also stress, this is something stress. So sometimes patient has acute and very strong stress.

767
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:49,520
In some cases that can distort pain and the pain gets better versus the chronic stress that amplifies pain.

768
01:20:49,520 --> 01:21:03,520
And stress may be not only something like a stressful event, it can be something that we don't know exactly what is it, but it's other structures that are involved, brain structures that are involved.

769
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:10,520
In some cases it may stop pain, in some cases it may amplify, we don't know, we can predict it at that point.

770
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:24,520
But I guess that in those chronic patients that all of a sudden they get better, there was something that a good doctor can ask about, something that happened to this particular patient.

771
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:42,520
For example, I know myself a woman who had breast cancer after post-infected pain for years, and then it happened that she just went to some yoga class with her friend.

772
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:46,520
And that helped.

773
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,520
I don't say that yoga helps to cure the pain.

774
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:57,520
In this particular woman there was something else that happened, and we don't know always what it was.

775
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:05,520
Single event you're talking about, or maybe ongoing, full explanation, full pain going away.

776
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,520
Good concept, I mean distraction helps too.

777
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:19,520
I mean, we always want to put causality on things that they may not have anything to do with each other. Yes, exactly.

778
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:26,520
So fascinating discussion. I wanted to just add that I didn't hear discussed in anybody's thoughts that are interested.

779
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:42,520
As human beings, we seek to create meaning, and there's a dimension of the pain experience and how one's culture and spirituality and religion impact their experience of pain.

780
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:56,520
And we're discussing, I think, more of the neuropathology, physiology of managing pain, but to ignore that dimension of pain may not clinically, I work clinically with terminal pain,

781
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:02,520
allow us to achieve the best palliation we can.

782
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:16,520
Absolutely, yes, in a sense, I think at least in earlier societies pain was part of the punishment that God was giving you, and you had to live with it.

783
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:35,520
And our concepts of pain in this, at least today, is much more how best to get rid of it. So those are very different concepts.

784
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:46,520
In some countries, pain, you have to define your pain as a really critical pain to draw attention from the clinicians.

785
01:23:46,520 --> 01:24:04,520
And I know from my friends from China and my friends from Russia that, you know, whatever we have as a clean, clean, clean, painful condition here is not considered as pain there.

786
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:19,520
And you know, like labor pain till very recently was something that you have to deal with, and it's part of the life, and nobody thought about anesthesia during labor.

787
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:25,520
And now we're talking about anesthesia during the circumcision, you know, everything should be pain free.

788
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:38,520
And this is very different concepts, but interestingly that sometimes you think it is a different cultural thing when it is still something anatomical and physiological.

789
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:44,520
And the example is labor pain in different cultures.

790
01:24:44,520 --> 01:25:04,520
For example, my friend who is OB and physician, she told me that there was a perception during the clinicians that women from India, they have more pain compared to other women.

791
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:16,520
And apparently it's not that they have more pain, it's because of the anatomical differences, the course of labor should be considered very differently in these women.

792
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:23,520
And so the whole management of labor should be different, and then there will be less pain.

793
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:29,520
So it's not completely religious, cultural or ethnic things, it's all together.

794
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:37,520
Of course, at least in the monotheistic religions, hell is basically pain, right?

795
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:47,520
That's how we conceptualize, burning pain, flagellation, suffering, it's all defined by pain.

796
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,520
Expectation is very important, preparedness.

797
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:59,520
And those are very important mechanisms to deal with pain and feel the pain.

798
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:18,520
And a lot of times from what I can see that folks are prepared to have surgery or something else, that they're prepared to deal with pain, expect to have some pain, tend to perhaps deal with it better than other folks, they're very surprised by the notion that there's going to be pain, it's going to be bad, it's going to be painful.

799
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:25,520
So almost as though your defense mechanisms are to go up or go down, which help you, not help you to deal with pain.

800
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:30,520
Henry?

801
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:37,520
Thank you for a very interesting, very nuanced discussion of a very complex subject.

802
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:50,520
And I particularly want to refer back to the social and temporal setting of this and your remarks, the different kinds of pain are really very different and need to be thought of very differently.

803
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:57,520
While I was thinking about this last night, there was an ad on television for painless dentistry.

804
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,520
That was the first time I've seen a television ad for painless dentistry.

805
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:06,520
And of course, pain can be lethal, and it is.

806
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:21,520
Ten blocks from here, a very prominent performer and actress died two years ago because she was under General Anesthesia for a procedure that generally we would not have put somebody under General Anesthesia for.

807
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:28,520
She had an upper endoscopy and died of the anesthetic consequences of it, she had a cardiac arrest.

808
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:41,520
It's estimated that 70,000 Americans die of opiate overdose or fentanyl, which slips into their illicit opioids.

809
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:48,520
Would you say something about this epidemic of opioid misuse?

810
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:59,520
Well, I think one of the main issues nowadays is the overuse of opioids, epidemic of opiates, and problems that go along with opiates.

811
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:10,520
And the different ways to kind of explain it, perhaps or try to explain it, but it goes along with the concept of dealing with pain, treating pain.

812
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:20,520
And here it's a very effective medications for acute pain, but then if they're used for extended periods of time, there's all these other problems and issues that happened.

813
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:24,520
And that's basically what happened.

814
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:35,520
It's been quite a solid stop of the use of opioids for years, and people, expectations change, and people's expectations are different.

815
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:48,520
The way of dealing with pain also was different, and hence this resulted in this abundance of opioids being used around and abused around and causing problems.

816
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:49,520
And now we're going...

817
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:55,520
You know, I'm old enough to remember the history of opiate abuse coming to this country.

818
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:04,520
In a sense, about 15 years ago, there were a number of prominent papers published saying, oh, if you have chronic pain, you don't get addicted by opiate use.

819
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:11,520
So let's give everybody who has chronic pain opiates, and 10 years later, this is where we are.

820
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:17,520
Well, I think it also stemmed from a change in the directive of a lot of hospitals, right?

821
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:32,520
I mean, that pain wasn't being treated effectively in a lot of people, and so they started this system to measure it with the smiley, or the 10-faced system of how much pain you're in.

822
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:38,520
And then it became pressure, I think, to prescribe these opioids.

823
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:49,520
And now, actually, it's because of this epidemic, it's reversed, and now the concern for a lot of people that need the drugs is that they're not going to get them.

824
01:29:49,520 --> 01:30:01,520
Yeah, but there was a real scientific sort of debate on this thing about 15 years ago, and we all said, oh, yes, you know, if you have chronic pain, all your opiate receptors are upregulated, they all need opiate.

825
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:08,520
To be bound, and then your pain will go away, and why aren't we giving these patients more pain?

826
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:11,520
It's just a combination of these things.

827
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,520
I've published some of those papers.

828
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:20,520
And I've been watching this for about 65 years.

829
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:31,520
Thirty years ago, we tried to get a hospice unit started at one of the major academic centers here in New York Hospital, and we didn't succeed.

830
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:41,520
However, there are now 5,000 hospices in the United States, and they vary all the way from terrific to not so terrific.

831
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:58,520
It was addressing a different problem. It was the addressing the under treatment of people in the last six months of metastatic cancer with the kind of chronic problems that we talk about now, low back pain, migraine.

832
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:06,520
So the subject really changed, and I think that's to the point that you made that different pain has to be thought of differently.

833
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:19,520
So if we overreacted, part of the problem is it takes a lot less time to write an opiate prescription than to sit down and discuss some of these complex issues.

834
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:24,520
I have some good news. The good news coming from two different directions.

835
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:35,520
One is I spent two years out of the air, the right division, and so at least now any new formulation of opiate or any new opiate has to be abused.

836
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:46,520
This is like the new merger. So it will be difficult to abuse at least. So from this degree, from the abuse direction, there is something that we can do.

837
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:57,520
And from other direction is now there is a number of labs and companies that offer the genetic testing for opiate addiction.

838
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:12,520
So we are not talking about abuse. Abuse is different, behavioral, also, but for the addiction now we can predict those who have to be far away from opiates because they are going to develop addiction at some point.

839
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:20,520
So if we can predict, we can come up with different plans, statistical plans for pain management in those patients.

840
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:23,520
Again, not for everybody. We are going narrow now.

841
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,520
More proportion of the population is higher.

842
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:39,520
For the addiction, there is no numbers because it depends. It depends on many factors including the age and the sex of the patient.

843
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,520
So it's more complex.

844
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:56,520
So can anybody comment on the mechanism and efficacy of the use of CBD in combating or alleviating chronic pain?

845
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,520
CBD.

846
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,520
All of this behavioral...

847
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,520
Cognitive behavioral therapy.

848
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,520
No, no, no.

849
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:09,520
CBD and THC are both ingredients in marijuana. THC is like that can't graduate you.

850
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:15,520
The CBD is... when they isolate it, is the portion that can alleviate pain.

851
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,520
Yeah.

852
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,520
I'm not supportive.

853
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,520
I'm not supportive.

854
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,520
In other states, I think it's called New York now also.

855
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:34,520
So there is definitely some good science showing that in fact there are some variants of it have good efficacy at the peripheral level, the low-susceptive level.

856
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:42,520
We've guided in chronic pain models in animals and it has not shown any efficacy.

857
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:49,520
So on the other hand, there are some people obviously who swear that it's very effective with them.

858
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,520
Do they have a whole 7-cannibine system?

859
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,520
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yes.

860
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:58,520
So, I mean, they have it both in the periphery and it's too out of the way.

861
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:06,520
So cannabinoid receptors are everywhere in the way. Every neuron has cannabinoids on it, which is part of the issue.

862
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:13,520
In a sense that it's not going to be a specific effect. It will affect every synapse in the way.

863
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,520
Okay?

864
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:20,520
From the clinical data so far, we can say that there is no pure analgesic effect of marijuana or any cannabinoids.

865
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:24,520
There is some effect on, you know, and this is very close to get high.

866
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:33,520
So the patients may have better mood. They may deal better with the condition, but it's not analgesic.

867
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:39,520
And if we're talking about adverse effects, they exist and more in women.

868
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,520
Thank you.

869
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:44,520
On the other hand, it's probably just as good as a glass of wine.

870
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,520
So, you know, it's less than wine.

871
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,520
Yeah.

872
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,520
Okay.

873
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:54,520
You mentioned meditation briefly. Any thoughts about hypnosis?

874
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:58,520
I know at Stanford University for at least decades have been researching pain and hypnosis.

875
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:03,520
Hilary DeGard did it back, I think, in the 50s, 60s. Davis Spielberg is there now.

876
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:10,520
And you mentioned brain retraining. We've seen that hypnosis and visualization would be a great way to retrain the brain.

877
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:14,520
The example you gave with a foot could have done that through visualization.

878
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:17,520
So any thoughts about that?

879
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:27,520
There are, there was a famous study where they took patients who were in pain and they hypnotized them.

880
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:35,520
And they told them that the unpleasantness of their pain would go down or the unpleasantness of their pain would go up.

881
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:43,520
And then they went and tested them. And yes, the unpleasantness would either go up or down depending on the hypnosis,

882
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,520
whereas the sensory component, how painful was, that was unchanged.

883
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,520
Right.

884
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:58,520
So, yes, you can. I mean, that's, again, the part of the brain that's involved in the unpleasantness, the suffering that's associated with pain,

885
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:02,520
that's the part that was being able to manipulate it through hypnosis.

886
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:10,520
I have one thing to tell you about. It's not about hypnosis per se, but it's about virtual reality.

887
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:17,520
This is now a new phenomenon to treat pain, especially chronic, especially acute pain in pediatrics.

888
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:29,520
So this is a helmet with virtual reality. And by the end of March in Florence, there will be a sim-part conference where we have a workshop on virtual reality.

889
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:42,520
And you can see how this particular thing works tremendously in distracting the attention.

890
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:51,520
And so the children with burns and that they can't allow anybody to touch when they have this helmet.

891
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:57,520
You can do whatever you want and change everything and they don't pay any attention.

892
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:11,520
So it's not hypnosis because it's all just very temporary when the child or the doubt is in the helmet, but it works better than any of those.

893
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:16,520
Any other reasons I have hypnosis? Is that my one of being expensive?

894
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:20,520
But all the technology hypnosis would be inexpensive and you could teach everyone to do it.

895
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,520
Yeah.

896
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:22,520
You can do the same thing.

897
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,520
Okay. Last question.

898
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:29,520
This has been great. I'm a manual therapist.

899
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:36,520
And when I went in to practice, I thought I was going to touch people and have an effect on their tissues.

900
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:45,520
And what I have found that I actually do in my practice is work with people around their anxiety about sensations that they're having in their body.

901
01:37:45,520 --> 01:38:02,520
And what I try to do because I have the luxury of spending hours in a room with people is sort of develop, help them develop a personal epistemology of sensation in their body, or at least start thinking about it that way.

902
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:13,520
To me, I feel like one of the really core issues that we have in this whole conversation is a real poverty of language that we're talking about pain.

903
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:27,520
Which can mean everything from stretching a muscle into a new area for the Golgi organs, taking them to a new stretch or tearing a muscle.

904
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:32,520
It's all pain.

905
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:47,520
What I have, the other thing that I have found is that I used to think about getting people to a pain-free state. And now what I think about is getting people to a suffering-free state.

906
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:54,520
And the difference, I think, is you're never going to be pain-free.

907
01:38:54,520 --> 01:39:05,520
If somebody's telling you that, they're a charlatan. But you can feel empowered about the fact that the sensations in your body are organic, they're normal.

908
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:15,520
We don't talk, I think culturally, we just don't talk about it enough. We don't share the fact that you're going to have sensations in your body all day, every day, for the rest of your life.

909
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:25,520
Some of them will have different balances, but you don't have to be reactive to it.

910
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,520
That's great.

911
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:42,520
No, no, no. In a sense, I love the story. It's wonderful because we have published the data that in patients, in the same patients, when they had acute back pain, their brain activity was in the sensory regions of the brain.

912
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:48,520
It looked like acute pain. A year later, the ones who are still having pain, they're wearing activity.

913
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:53,520
For the same pain that they describe the same way is all in emotional areas of the brain.

914
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,520
They're in the frontal cortex, they're in the amygdala, in the acumbens, in these limbic regions.

915
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:10,520
So, in fact, the concept of their pain has shifted from being a sensory input to an emotional state that they're bearing, that they're living with, in a sense.

916
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:15,520
So, that's the explanation we've made to the data of the brain activity.

917
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:22,520
I thought what you said about the immediate reduction in dopamine right after that.

918
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:35,520
That's very interesting to me, and it immediately made me think, what if we just got in bed with a loved one right after they just gave him a nice massage?

919
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:40,520
That's like it is appealing to me.

920
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:41,520
That's good too.

921
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:46,520
How much on this? We're almost done.

922
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,520
All right, last question.

923
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:49,520
Last question.

924
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,520
Maybe two questions is one.

925
01:40:52,520 --> 01:41:04,520
Are there any other things which, there are some other things that we have some clues about affecting court brain size, and maybe a mid-lule size, I don't know enough about it.

926
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:11,520
But meditation will sometimes make the brain larger, physical exercise, perhaps.

927
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:33,520
It's interesting that people who are fibromyalgia get better with exercise, and whether there is any documentation in chronic pain states like that of changes in amygdala size, and the effect of the brain.

928
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:43,520
Of those things which may cause brain enlargement upon chronic pain, such as physical exercise and meditation.

929
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:50,520
I don't know about the evidence of exercise.

930
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:55,520
Exercise does increase brain, I don't know about size.

931
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:05,520
Exercise, at least in animals, improves adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

932
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,520
In fact, the same can be shown in humans as well.

933
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:17,520
We have data that neurogenesis in the hippocampus is in fact affected with chronic pain itself.

934
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:26,520
There is that link in fibromyalgia, there is brain, local decreases, again in grey matter density.

935
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:34,520
Again, I don't know if there is any data about recovering from fibromyalgia to see if those things reverse or not.

936
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:45,520
Some of these data are consistent, but they're too few and too little to really make a bigger, grander theory in a sense about them.

937
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,520
Okay, thank you.
