1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,180
I'm Ed Nurse, Assistant Director of the Helix Center.

2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,320
Before we begin today's program, I would like to thank our program coordinator, Alex

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,120
Herbert's service for his hard work in putting our programs together and for making sure

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,040
they run smoothly.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:37,320
Especially during the pandemic, he says required much work and Alex has been up to the challenge.

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,760
I would also like to thank Miguel Nogera of Multimine, who has made it possible for us

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,400
to continue our programs on Zoom and to reach a broader audience by posting them on YouTube

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,800
and our website.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,720
This program on placebo, NOCBO, was proposed and implemented by Beverly Zabriski, a member

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,600
of the Helix Executive Committee, and she will be moderating the discussion.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,640
For those of you who may recall, there was a program at the Filocreides Center years

12
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,520
ago on this very same topic, and it will be interesting to find out how the thinking has

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,960
evolved on this subject.

14
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,840
For turning the discussion over to Beverly, I would like to let you know about our upcoming

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,400
programs.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,240
In April, we will be taking up the topic of stress, and sometime in May, we hope to organize

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,200
the discussion on poetry, tentatively focused on early 14th century expressions of this

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
art form.

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,640
And now Beverly will introduce the party.

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,840
Thank you.

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:50,480
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Zoom iteration of the Helix round tables.

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,160
We are in little rectangular squares rather than in a circle, but the sensibility of the

23
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:03,480
program will follow that wonderful circular exchange among persons from many different

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,160
backgrounds on a specific topic.

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,080
We are missing, we will be four today rather than five, as one of the speakers was unable

26
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,880
to attend Phoebe Frisson.

27
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,360
And it's my pleasure to introduce these people.

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,080
Some of them know each other, for some it's a blind date, and I congratulate you on your

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,200
courage to negotiate such a situation.

30
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,440
I'm only going to read the titles of, and you know, just the major posts of each of

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,280
the participants, and then ask each one to reintroduce themselves and tell us what their

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,000
work has been, what led them to it, and what their focus is right now.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,920
So Luanna, Kalloka, born in Italy, we just found out.

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,680
She's on the faculty at the University of Maryland in Baltimore.

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,040
She has a master's degree in bioethics and a PhD in neuroscience and completed a post-doc

36
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,840
training in Stockholm.

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,480
And she's going to be telling us what she is now delving into.

38
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,840
Katherine Hall is the Femmen's Spirit Tree of this program.

39
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:36,080
I heard Katherine in June of 2019 at a Science of Consciousness Conference in Interlochen,

40
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,320
and I was so impressed that among the 750 participants at that conference, I swore that

41
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,680
I would find a way to bring her to heal.

42
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,240
So Katherine, I so appreciate your willingness to participate in this.

43
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,320
And she's Director of Basic and Translational Research at the Osher Center for Integrative

44
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:03,440
Medicine, an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Preventive Medicine at

45
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,040
Brigham's and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

46
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,520
She received her PhD in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics from Harvard University,

47
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:22,360
where she spent 10 years in the biotech industry, tackling problems in drug discovery and development.

48
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,560
And then she became an Associate Director of Drug Development at Millennium Pharmaceuticals

49
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,360
now to Keda.

50
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,120
And she will tell you what else she has done in her very full life.

51
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,080
Gerald Horowitz is a fellow member of the Helix Executive Committee.

52
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,600
He's Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychiatry and on the faculty at Columbia University College

53
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,280
of Physicians and Surgeons.

54
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,000
He practices the psychopharmacology and neuropsychiatry.

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And he's a Founder and Chief Medical Officer at M3 Information.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,360
An information technology company that focuses on mental health and integration into primary

57
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,040
care.

58
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,160
And Robert Kletzman is another man who is an inspiration.

59
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,400
And again, I'm very grateful.

60
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,520
He agreed to join today.

61
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,200
He's a Professor of Psychiatry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in the Mailman

62
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,640
School of Public Health and the Director of the Online and In-Person Bioethics Masters

63
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,400
and Certificate Program at Columbia University.

64
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:45,800
He's written over 150 scientific journals and concentrated on the psychiatry doctor patient,

65
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,480
relationship and other areas and some of his many books are listed on the website.

66
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,880
And he's also received numerous awards.

67
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:07,320
So I knew a bit about placebo's from myth and opera and drama, love potions and all that.

68
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:14,160
But when I looked it up, just to get a little bit more intelligent notions to express here,

69
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:22,120
I was really surprised to find out that placebo comes from the opening line of the Catholic

70
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,920
Church Vespers.

71
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,520
And on the one hand, it means I shall be pleasing.

72
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,880
And on the other hand, it means I shall please the Lord in the land of the living from the

73
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,840
Vespers for the dead.

74
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,400
I had no idea of that link and also of the different ways and the different centuries,

75
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,160
the idea of placebos went from sham to an essential aspect of cure.

76
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,120
And so I'm hoping that this discussion and I know it will address this notion of placebo

77
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,800
in many various ways.

78
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,400
So Luanna, could you tell us more about your work?

79
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,680
Thank you very much, Beverly, and everyone for the opportunity to talk about placebo.

80
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,560
My lab at University of Maryland is funded by the National Institutes of Health to study

81
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,400
the neurobiology and phenotypes of placebo responders.

82
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,920
The goal is to understand the neurobiology of placebo and it is fascinating to learn

83
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,680
now many patients experience benefits because of placebo effects.

84
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,080
Our goal is to try to understand behind the cultural aspects that is fascinating, the

85
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:49,520
anthropological component, how our brain can trigger changes in a cascade of neurobiological

86
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,840
substances to produce reduction of pain, reduction of anxiety, reduction of mood.

87
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,280
So the goal is really to trigger the mechanistic aspects of placebo effects.

88
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:10,960
And a little bit I got into this era of research because as soon as I finish my degree in medicine,

89
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,200
I decided to start a PhD in neuroscience.

90
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,720
This is which from medicine to neuroscience.

91
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,360
Always I wanted to reconcile the medical approach with the neurobiological approach and try to

92
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,600
go back and translate and bring back harness what we learned to the bed decides how to

93
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:38,960
move into patient health.

94
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,320
Catherine, would you tell us about your background and work?

95
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Sure.

96
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,760
So as you said, I'm at Brigham and Women's Hospital in the Osher Center for Integrative

97
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,040
Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital.

98
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,600
But my focus is on understanding the genetics of the placebo response, or I should say the

99
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,920
genomics of the placebo response.

100
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:12,000
We became really interested in that when we were trying to figure out if, firstly, if

101
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,240
there were actually genes that were associated with placebo response, but very soon after

102
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,400
we found several genes that we think are associated with the placebo response, we rapidly became

103
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:29,760
aware of a very interesting interaction that seems to be happening with the genes and the

104
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:38,280
drugs as if the drugs are perturbing placebo responses in a subset of patients depending

105
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
on the genotype.

106
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,440
So a very complex kind of web of interactions.

107
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,160
And so my background is as a geneticist.

108
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,480
And I, as you said, spent I think a total of 15 years in the pharmaceutical industry

109
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,480
manufacturing drugs.

110
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:08,280
And certainly the placebo response is the bane of the pharmaceutical drug developer in particular

111
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:17,480
in neurobiology and psychology, psychological conditions, developing drugs for pain, depression,

112
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:24,160
schizophrenia, irritable bowel syndrome, we're often have to deal with these high placebo

113
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,720
responses and really understanding why has been an interest of mine.

114
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,840
As Luana knows, I've spent some time over the last year writing a book on placebos called

115
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,040
the placebo paradox.

116
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,680
And I have been amazed at what I learned taking a deep dive, as you kind of mentioned, into

117
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:51,160
the history of placebos and all the way to the current times to understand why and how

118
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,960
they're influencing us in clinical medicine and in clinical trials and drug development

119
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,160
today.

120
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Maybe I can join in.

121
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:10,160
I thought I would say something about my perspective, which is from being a clinician

122
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,680
being patient, mostly through a biological treatment form, a psychopharmacology, although

123
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:23,280
I'm always mindful that patients experience and the phenomenology of their experience

124
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,600
is important to them, of course, and plays a role in their getting well or not.

125
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
It's interesting.

126
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,240
I often confronted this comment by some of my patients will say, oh, this is a chemical

127
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,160
depression, or I can tell this is not a chemical depression.

128
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm sorry that I have a little bit of a smug sense of the, I have to chuckle about that

129
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,920
because I thought I don't know how one could tell such a thing.

130
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,520
But in any case, I often come back with the following.

131
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:56,640
I say, you know, everything that you think and feel is reflected in your brain.

132
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,560
There's some biological aspect up at the question is, is it relevant in trying to get

133
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,520
you better to take a hold of your problem from a biological sort of end of things or

134
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,680
from a talk psychological end of things.

135
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,360
And of course, sometimes you need both.

136
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,520
But it's interesting to think that when we think of the placebo effect, it seems to me

137
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:20,640
even the term itself, the SIBO effect suggests almost like a bio well, anyway, for most

138
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:27,160
of us now in modern times, and kind of a biological limb, we're thinking, well, how does it impact

139
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,480
the brain?

140
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:36,560
And so, but every interaction that's not strictly speaking, pharmacological impacts the brain

141
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
physically also.

142
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,160
I mean, our thinking and our talking does that.

143
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,240
So I was wondering as I came up into this really fascinating topic, to what degrees the

144
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,920
placebo effect, just like thinking and talking anyway, how much property do they share because

145
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,000
our thinking and talking effects are biology.

146
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,960
Right.

147
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:05,680
I found one saying about it, which was, cure occasionally, relieve always, console often.

148
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,880
I thought, there's a description of what the placebo does.

149
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,720
Robert, tell us about your work and the ethical implications of this.

150
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,520
Yes, Tom, you.

151
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Yes.

152
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,960
Thank you for the invitation to be here and what a wonderful panel and a center you have

153
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,000
and I'm really pleased to meet some of you and be part of it.

154
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,560
I thought I'd talk about how I got interested in a number of areas I work on, which is closely

155
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
related to placebo.

156
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,800
And that is when I was in college, I was assigning what I wanted to do when I grew up, as many

157
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,640
of us do, when I was interested in the brain, but also the mind and the humanities and didn't

158
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
know what to do.

159
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,800
So I got a job at the NIH at the laboratory for Center Nervous System Studies for a man

160
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,440
and cotton gaitishek who just won the Nobel Prize for studying diseases and stone age

161
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,840
tribes around the world and finding a number of them, particularly one called kuru in Papua

162
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,040
New Guinea that ended up being the same as mad cow disease.

163
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,200
And so when I graduated college, he sent me to live with a stone age tribe for you in

164
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,360
Papua New Guinea studying kuru, which is caused by, we now know, a prion.

165
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,640
And the disease had wiped out two thirds of the tribe.

166
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,360
And so I would meet shamans who said that they could cure the disease.

167
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,280
It was spread by cannibalistic rituals.

168
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,160
When someone died, their loved ones would eat the person.

169
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,160
The people would say to me, this, well, always a part of my mother inside of me.

170
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,160
And so long story actors wrote a book about it called The Trembling Mountain, a personal

171
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,360
account of who cannibals and mad cow disease.

172
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,480
But when I met the shaman, he claimed that he had cured many, many people of the disease.

173
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,360
And I said, what's the treatment?

174
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,200
And at this point, the cannibalism had stopped about 20 years before, but anyone who would

175
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,040
have had a thought they had the disease.

176
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,440
And he said, I have a treatment.

177
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
What is it I asked him?

178
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,760
We had not had any treatment for this in the US and the West.

179
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,840
He said, it's very simple.

180
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,480
I tell people that for two weeks are not allowed to drink water or have salt or touch, remember,

181
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
the opposite sex.

182
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,560
I give them some herbs and I cast a spell on them.

183
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,560
And I said, well, who have you cured?

184
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,840
And he said, all these people here, and he pointed to 20, 30 people who were around me.

185
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
And he said, he cured them.

186
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,200
And I said, well, have you not cured anyone?

187
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,920
He said, yes, that one person over there who was the one person I had diagnosed with

188
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,080
the disease.

189
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,880
And I said, well, how come he didn't get better?

190
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
He said, very simple.

191
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,080
He didn't follow the treatment.

192
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,920
But what struck me is how there was no treatment available.

193
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,320
And so people out of desperation strongly believe that this disease was caused by sorcery,

194
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,560
could be cured by sorcery.

195
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,840
I should say one other anecdote on this.

196
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,040
People believe that a sorcerer would take something that belonged to you and wrap it

197
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,120
around a stone and bury it.

198
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,520
People would hide their belongings.

199
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,360
And so it was said that sorcerers could even just take food scraps and wrap it around from

200
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,600
you, wrap it around a stone.

201
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,840
And they dig up stones and say, see this stone here?

202
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,280
This is the stone that killed my mother.

203
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,800
And I'd say, no, who is caused by a little thing like an insect?

204
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,960
And they said, show it to us.

205
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,760
And I said, it's too small to see you to special machines.

206
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,200
And they'd say, well, what does it look like?

207
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,480
And I'd say, we don't know.

208
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
We hadn't identified.

209
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,680
They said, well, have you seen it?

210
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
I'd say, no.

211
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,240
And they'd say, that's just the magic.

212
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,760
It's a stone that killed my mother.

213
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,240
So I got very interested in how do we understand what is a disease?

214
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,480
How do we understand what is a treatment?

215
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,240
How do we define these things?

216
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,680
And how desperation can lead to us to think that things may or may not get better, certainly

217
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
relieve anxiety.

218
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,920
The disease had wiped out as I said 2 thirds of the tribe.

219
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,440
And from that, I ended up getting interested in ethics in a number of ways.

220
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,240
I can very briefly, my first day as an intern in the hospital, I was given a list of patients.

221
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,440
I was told, go take care of them.

222
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,760
I met the first one, a woman cutting her grapefruit, complaining the grapefruit wasn't fresh,

223
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,680
and went out in the hall, and my resident said, what have you done so far?

224
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
I said, I spoke to him.

225
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
It's so and so.

226
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
He said, she's dead.

227
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
Don't waste your time with the dead.

228
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,600
I said, what do you mean she's dead?

229
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
I just spoke with her.

230
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
He said, she's dead.

231
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,400
And in her mind, she was DNR.

232
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,080
Do not resuscitate.

233
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,680
And therefore, don't waste your time with her.

234
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,240
Just ignore her.

235
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,600
And my heart froze.

236
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,800
And I thought, gee, how are we defining?

237
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
Who we spend time with and who we don't?

238
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,360
How are we defining what is life, what's death?

239
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
Who is going to live?

240
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Who is going to die?

241
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,720
Who am I to be making these decisions?

242
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,880
So that got me interested in ethics.

243
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,520
And since then, I've done a lot of work.

244
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,640
I wrote a book called, am I my genes, confronting fate and family secrets in the age of genetic

245
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,080
testing, understanding how do we understand genes and the roles in our lives, et cetera.

246
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,120
But so I would say, overall, I take some might say anthropological perspective to try to

247
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,080
understand how patients and doctors understand what is treatment, what its effects are, et

248
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
cetera.

249
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:09,920
And I think that's in various contexts and look forward to the discussion today.

250
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,400
So please feel free just to start to engage with each other and what your thoughts and

251
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,240
after thoughts are.

252
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,440
And I'm sure this is going to be very fertile.

253
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:27,400
Gerald, I was curious to know what you understand from your patients when they tell you they

254
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,240
have a chemical, that depression is chemical.

255
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,600
Like, what does that mean?

256
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,960
Well, there's a, there's a, you know, there, it's interesting.

257
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,080
There are a wide range of people who will use that phrase.

258
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,440
I can usually size out from the be very first consultation with someone, whether they prefer

259
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,560
the notion that all of their emotional troubles derive from some, you know, quote unquote,

260
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,080
chemical imbalance, whether or not it's so, it's different from saying whether they prefer

261
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,000
that to be the case.

262
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,760
Some people really prefer that to be the case and they'll identify their troubles as

263
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,600
deriving from this underlying biology.

264
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,800
Again, to some degrees, it's very legitimate inference.

265
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,960
Another case is maybe not as much.

266
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,960
So the problem would be in a case where there's something in between where people reflect

267
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,320
some combination of some biological instability, we'll call it.

268
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:28,760
And some aspect of their, the way their brains interface with their life and their experience.

269
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,920
And we call that their psychology, right?

270
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,040
And I think, let's say it's a little bit of a way, some of these folks are motivated to

271
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:44,400
suppress some of the psychological components of psychological inputs to their distress.

272
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,640
And I'll say one other thing about this.

273
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,440
I think for me, because I don't administer, I don't say to someone, here's a placebo,

274
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,040
or I don't give out a medicine that is that I know to be a placebo.

275
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,040
But I certainly know a lot of what I provide patients is a placebo effect.

276
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,360
I like to think that the medications I give have a particular mechanism of action and

277
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,320
they'll come into effect and cure what I'm trying to help them with.

278
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,640
But in many instances, I know having a positive feeling about the drug may work well or the

279
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,320
patient might have a miraculous recovery in sort of too short a time interval.

280
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,840
You think, well, that's not, I can't be the pharmacological effect.

281
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,840
So that's one thing.

282
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,760
You're raising different aspects related to the placebo phenomenon.

283
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:40,040
Anyway, we like to think that placebo's components are part of any treatment, any active treatment.

284
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,160
If you take an antidepressant together with the action of the antidepressant, there is

285
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,280
a psychosocial component that is the shamanic component.

286
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,360
Eventually, the only patient who didn't respond was because he had a depression disease, or

287
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,680
because of some genetic asset like we will learn from catering that some patient do not

288
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,680
respond to the placebo component of active treatments do not respond to the placebo's.

289
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:14,560
So when I started to study the neurobiology of placebo, I was working with Parkinson patients.

290
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:22,040
We were in a very special setting, implantation of a deep brain stimulation to study patients

291
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:30,000
with Parkinson's who do not respond to the typical cocktail of anti-depressant Parkinson's drugs.

292
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,960
And the goal was to try to understand if during the surgical procedure, we can study the changes

293
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,520
occurring at the level of neurons when a patient expects to receive dopamine.

294
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,160
In particular, we were using a pomorfen that is a dopamine agonist.

295
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:55,680
So the goal was to try to understand if giving a placebo in a surgical room can produce a

296
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,640
change at the level of neurons.

297
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:09,600
And in a blind, counter-balance way, patient receive in a subcutaneous part of their arm

298
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,280
and injection of the placebo.

299
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,800
And we were recording from the other part of the setting without hearing the time of

300
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:25,160
injection, the neuronal changes occurring together with the injection of this placebo.

301
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:33,400
And as a neurophysiologist, together with the surgeons and colleagues that were neurologists,

302
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,000
we were recording under the cells changing the spike.

303
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,240
So when you see something changing in the brain because a patient receives an injection

304
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,800
of a placebo, you understand the power of the mind.

305
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:57,480
So there is something that is not merely philosophy or something that we read in a narrative book.

306
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:06,840
It's really a link between the neurobiology, our ability to change the response, treatment,

307
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,600
and what we call the neurobiology of the effects.

308
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,520
Importantly, we don't need to necessarily placebo to study placebo effects.

309
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,280
Today, we know that there are many different treatments that we have been using in clinical

310
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:29,320
setting to explore how this power of the mind can somehow either amplify the response to

311
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:37,040
what treatment, for example, an event, an opioid or another drug like ketamine.

312
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:45,680
And we also have either an increase of the benefit, like people experience larger analgesic

313
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,440
effects, larger antidepressant or production of unsighted.

314
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,200
But some other patients responding up paradox a way like Catherine main mentioned in her

315
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,120
book, where we see a worsening of this symptom.

316
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:08,840
So then you understand that studying the placebo phenomenon can be quite complex.

317
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,160
So we have patients that receive a placebo and they respond to the benefit.

318
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,520
Patients who receive an activity treatment like an opioid and they respond as if it was

319
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,080
a super drug magic.

320
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:28,280
I told a patient we use the same treatment, a placebo for pain therapeutic or antidepressant,

321
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,280
no matter what we do, they don't respond.

322
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:39,480
So that is a little bit to what make me interested in leading my team at the University of Maryland

323
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,480
in exploring these phenotypes of placebo effects.

324
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,960
So we are last clinicians, physicians, psychotherapists.

325
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,760
We know that there is something relevant about this interaction with our patients that trigger

326
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:02,760
the sort of interesting phenomenon for which patient improve.

327
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,360
But what are these kinds of things and why eventually they occur?

328
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,720
And the big question is why some patient do respond and some other patient respond minimally

329
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:37,540
but not told with a sort of a

330
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:53,720
fight to people on clinical extinct gestpping and a kind of modification of sleep, how

331
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,160
for which things. So is it generalizable? Are there some patients with their due or don't respond?

332
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:08,840
Or I can imagine there being sort of a variety of phenotypes of how much based on what factors

333
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:16,920
etc. I mean, I think it's so complicated because there's so many factors that drive placebo response.

334
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:24,360
For years we've focused on learning, conditioning and expectation as a key driver and certainly they

335
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:32,760
are. But now we know several genes that modify response to placebo treatment, not necessarily a

336
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:38,600
placebo effect. These genes might be associated with just the natural history of the condition.

337
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:45,400
So for instance, one of the genes we study is a gene that breaks down dopamine. And so we

338
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:51,320
hypothesize that people with high dopamine because the enzyme that the gene codes for doesn't work

339
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:57,800
as well, that the people who had more dopamine would be placebo responders. And we did indeed find

340
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:03,960
that. But is that person always a placebo responder? Can I tell them that, you know,

341
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,520
they're a placebo responder and change their placebo response? Can I tell them something

342
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,280
not harmfully negative, but something like, oh, this doesn't work very well. And can I get from

343
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:20,600
them a more powerful negative response, which we call a nocebo response? So are they just

344
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:28,440
labile, suggestible people? Or is this in the context of the condition that we studied in that

345
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,280
case, it was IBS that in the context of IBS, these people are a placebo responder. One question that

346
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,160
we like to think about is if I do a clinical trial and depression, and I find this set of people with

347
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:47,160
the responders to placebo in depression, if I put them and many people have comorbidities,

348
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:54,040
so this is not an unlikely scenario, if I put them in a hypertensive trial for an anti-hypertension

349
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,720
drug, would they be placebo responders there? And so I think there's so many questions,

350
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:06,200
and it's such a rich and fascinating field that I think we're only beginning to scratch the surface.

351
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,960
Indeed, and to start to address these questions, what we are doing,

352
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:20,040
gathering myself and many others in the era of research, bring these questions back to the lab,

353
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:29,320
and we somehow try to study each component. So we use script randomize, we create the largest

354
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:36,200
so far database of patients with temporary vulnerability disorder funded by the National

355
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:43,160
Institute of Dental Chronic Fashion Research, where data is of over 800 patients that come

356
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:51,560
and came to the lab to try to understand the ease of irritable pain related to placebo,

357
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:57,480
do sex interfere, and sex and race interfere with placebo-responsiveness.

358
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:05,240
How long a placebo response can last? And for example, what we published recently is that

359
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,960
severe irritable pain, number of years of temporary vulnerability,

360
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:16,200
Ebola pain, this electronic disease, emerging, affecting many young people, and with many other

361
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:24,200
pain comorbidities, IBS, low-back pain, fobrumia, this patient responded to placebo,

362
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:31,320
no matter how many years they had TMD, no matter how severe is their pain.

363
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:39,320
And sometimes the response to that to VC to placebo is huge, like 8 out of 100 on a scale from 0 to 100

364
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:46,680
for pain severity, but also we observe that sex make a difference. Women tend to be

365
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,840
characterized by larger placebo effects. And this is another fascinating topic where

366
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,560
the neuroscience and neurobiology of sex difference is contributing to understand

367
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,520
why eventually women show larger placebo effects, which are the mechanism.

368
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:09,000
And another aspect that we are focusing on, we published already, race.

369
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:17,560
Racial differences make a difference again. We are in a special city, Baltimore, that allow us to study

370
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:25,640
a diverse population. We have over 35% of the patients who are Afro-Americans.

371
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:33,960
So we have situations and white people. When we compare Afro-Americans with white, again,

372
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:41,320
we see that Afro-Americans have less placebo responses. We are diving into that now to try to

373
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:49,320
understand this related to genes. Is this related to the severity of the pain that somehow is larger

374
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:58,440
than white? Because we have less access to better income and health care. So it is fascinating to see

375
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:06,120
that we think about placebo as a difficult topic because as always this complexity, but at the same

376
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:13,320
time we can study part by part, the placebo response. So I would just add cultural factors also.

377
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:19,320
So there's a large literature shows that people's response to pain and their expression of pain.

378
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,480
What they feel is how much you can talk about how much pain you have are shaped by culture.

379
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,400
So friends, there were studies that showed that this was a number of years ago. You know,

380
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,920
Italians had lower quote, lower pain thresholds that given the same amount of pain to people of

381
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,480
different ethnicities. Italians would report higher levels of pain, for instance, and some

382
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,520
other groups and other groups, less like Scandinavians, less, etc. And so I think the feeling was it was

383
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:54,040
more how stoical one wants to be in, or the culture encourages one to be versus how expressive,

384
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,760
or how expressive people feel they're able to be factors like that. So I've looked at that

385
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,640
literature number of years, but I think those may be factors as well, and that may play a role in

386
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,600
some of this. Well, we had the contribution of Daniel Mormon, an anthropologist from the

387
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:14,360
University of Michigan, who has the first one to say, hey guys, here the anthropological part,

388
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:21,720
cultural part, sorry, European and Americans made the fear in the response to tablets versus

389
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:29,320
injections. And that is fascinating. And again, in this large court of patients that we are studying

390
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,480
and they're very kind because we invite them several times to the lab. And a lawyer to our

391
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:44,040
studies, we started to explore how a cultural background, if they were, you know, some of Italians,

392
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:49,640
Asians, Chinese, or Americans, how this may change the placebo effects. I can't say too much because

393
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:55,560
we are working and we didn't publish that. But the results show that there are strong cultural

394
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:02,280
components that modulate placebo effects again. Well, I was in Zurich for four years, excuse me,

395
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:08,760
Catherine, I'll just add that to that. And of course, in Switzerland, you have the French Swiss,

396
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:18,040
the German Swiss, the Italian Swiss, and the Romanish. And in the doctors, in the delivery

397
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:25,240
departments, they could tell you who was from which part of Switzerland, and they were all Swiss

398
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:32,760
by the amount of expressiveness and the arias and the laments that were coming from the different

399
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:41,800
rooms. So I wonder if it's really pain thresholds or really the cultural permission to to express

400
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,960
it and sing it all. But what felt to be appropriate? Yeah. Well, but then also as part of the complex

401
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,960
theory, there's that affective response, let's call it a primary response of the patient in the

402
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,280
face of their symptom. And then that fits into the ecology of their relationship with their

403
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,960
doctors, because their affect of expression influences their doctors responsiveness, and may

404
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,480
create a certain acceptance of the doctor's advice or not. You can imagine all sorts of

405
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,400
various things. Let's bring it back to this, Catherine, because for pain,

406
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,840
pressure to pain tolerance, we know that the genes play a role. African Americans, again, have a

407
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:26,120
lower in threshold. And we know that this difference is linked to several genetic variants and differences.

408
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:32,840
Certainly. And you do see differences in the distribution of some of those variants in

409
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:40,360
different populations by race and ethnicity. But you know, I just was reading a paper.

410
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:46,360
There are many, many studies now that are trying to predict who the placebo responder is, right?

411
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,280
Obviously, they want to do it because in clinical trials, you can either take out your placebo

412
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,400
responders or analyze your data a little bit differently. In so many clinical trials are failing,

413
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:05,320
so it's a big problem. But what's really fascinating is if you look across all the studies, and there

414
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:12,840
been several, starting with just looking at personality alone, looking in the big five for,

415
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:18,440
you know, whether extraversion or openness or agreeableness are associated with placebo response.

416
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,200
The data is all over the place. I think you could probably argue that you often see extraversion

417
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,920
and openness associated with placebo response. But it was clear that that was too blunt an

418
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:35,800
instrument to really understand who a placebo responder was. And then you have the neuroimagers

419
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,160
who did really elegant work and found, you know, either it's a right middle frontal

420
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:47,720
gyrus was associated with placebo response in, you know, in chronic knee pain. But there wasn't

421
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:53,560
a lot of crossover across all these different studies. And you would have thought that despite

422
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,440
the heterogeneity in all these studies, if there was a placebo response signature that it would,

423
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,200
you know, emerge fast forward to the last, you know, five years machine learning has

424
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:11,160
allowed us to put the kitchen sink in and to ask, you know, like, if we combine demographic,

425
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:20,200
psychological measures, neuroimaging measures, genetics, what emerges and what's amazing is

426
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,760
you get different things in different conditions and different, you know, types of cohorts.

427
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,040
As to where the computer the computer start to have a lot of pain. Is that what you mean?

428
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,640
Yeah. Or how the computers feel about it. Right. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

429
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,480
It's eventually this would be the direction to create the consortium where we would have

430
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:46,760
big data. Yeah. To integrate. Yeah. I'm sorry for interrupting. So what was the outcome of that?

431
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,640
The one that blew me away was for depression that the level of education

432
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:59,400
was the only thing that robustly predicted your placebo response. And I wonder if you can guess

433
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:08,440
which way it went. It wasn't. But educated. It would be fixed. Exactly. In fact, in fact,

434
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,640
the more educated you were, your placebo response was so strong that it was greater than your

435
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:25,480
antidepressant response. Yeah. You would be protected. This makes me go, I want to go back to this

436
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,920
idea about dopamine and dopamine metabolism and expectation because of course those two were

437
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:38,200
often linked together. Anticipation, expectation and dopamine. And I'm wondering, because I feel

438
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:47,480
strongly that those mechanisms play a large role in human consciousness and maybe distinguishes

439
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:53,560
humans from other organisms, I'm wondering, I have to think you're going to tell me what I expect

440
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,960
here. My expectation is there's not a great animal model for placebo response.

441
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,320
It's not true. I mean, I don't have to. Yes. I'm happy to hear him wrong.

442
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:11,400
There are studies of placebo in rodents. And how can we create a placebo response in mice or rats

443
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:22,840
or other animals? Well, we use conditioning. We expose animals to medication that can be, for

444
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:37,320
example, rapid action antidepressant like ketamine. And we expose mice to ketamine for three weeks,

445
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:44,440
two weeks apart. And ketamine inducing mice reduction of anhedonia, they start to move more,

446
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,720
they start to be more active after we use of course the sense of reduction of the model.

447
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,720
And when we replace ketamine, together with my correlates from psychiatry here,

448
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:02,440
in the mouse model with a placebo, we observe a ketamine like response in mice,

449
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,400
suggesting that this open up a new era of research where we can start going up to an

450
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:15,160
genetic molecular basis of a placebo response even as when we engage more people to study

451
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:21,480
animal models for placebo. I think we then can really understand more and more about

452
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:28,040
this phenomenon. The beauty is that animal responded to placebo. And of course, we can't tell them

453
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:33,880
this drug is powerfully or fully well spent just because we don't know their language is our

454
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:41,400
limitation. So, but definitely we can use learning mechanism and conditioning to create

455
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,960
a condition at the response and placebo effects. It has been known as the showing pain with both

456
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:56,280
acute pain and neuropathic pain. We are the someone in my lab who recently finished our PhD

457
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:07,160
who study fentanyl in rats with a model of trigeminal pain, again, to explore a placebo effect in rats.

458
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:15,320
And Catherine, in the studies that you were mentioning, do you tell the patients that they're

459
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:23,320
receiving a placebo? And I'm interested in what the ethic is of whether you tell a patient or not.

460
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:29,240
And Robert, you must have put a great deal of thought into this. So, could you give us a sense

461
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:34,760
of that? Yeah, there's a whole new field or of course nothing is new. If you go back in the

462
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:41,320
literature, you'll see it pretty early on where it's called open label placebo therapy,

463
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:47,720
where you tell the patient that it's a placebo and strikingly, and I think about 10 studies now,

464
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:53,240
they're small studies, we've seen pretty impressive effects when people actually get better. But the

465
00:40:53,240 --> 00:41:00,360
key thing here is think about it, right? Firstly, the assumption that if you're on the active

466
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,480
therapy that you're going to get better is what creates the biases, what creates the

467
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,440
expectation is what creates the placebo effect. So, if you change the script, so you tell the

468
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:17,640
patient what I call the truth about placebos, which is that placebos work sometimes in 33% of

469
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,280
people that some people who've taken placebos have gotten better and they've gotten better for

470
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:28,360
quite a long time. Let's try the placebo in you and let's see how you respond. That's a very different

471
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,920
thing from saying, I'm really sorry, but you might get randomized to drug or you might get

472
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:38,920
randomized to placebo. So, it's creating a realistic but positive expectation about

473
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:45,880
placebo can actually influence the outcome. And we've seen now in IBS, in depression, in chronic

474
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:53,640
low back pain, in several conditions that are functional pain syndromes, you can see this

475
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:59,160
enhanced placebo response with open label placebo. What's interesting is you don't see it in wound

476
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,960
healing and you don't see it in places where you wouldn't expect to see it. You know,

477
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:10,600
placebos don't work to fight COVID. Placebos don't work to fight cancer. I mean, they might

478
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,160
reduce your stress or they might help you feel better, but they're not going to stop the

479
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,640
cells from spreading. I would say ethically, and there's a number of interesting ethical

480
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:30,360
questions here that come up. So, the physicians, I think, should not knowingly deceive patients,

481
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:36,600
right? Patients have a right to know what they're getting, what's involved, etc. That being said,

482
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:42,440
obviously, patients may benefit simply from quote the placebo effect of, you know, here is

483
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,640
something that might help you. I think, and studies have shown that about half of doctors say that

484
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:53,240
they give placebos. Interestingly, there are variations also by geographic region in the United

485
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,600
States. So, doctors in the South are 50% more likely to say they give placebos to their patients

486
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,800
than doctors in the Northeast or the Midwest, etc. But I think what happens is my own view is that a

487
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:11,240
lot of holistic medicine draws on the placebo effect, reflexive placebo effect. Vitamins, for

488
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:17,160
instance, for the average American, I think, are largely, I would argue, in part, the placebo effect,

489
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:22,360
at least for many, many people. Why do you argue that, Robert? I'm just curious, and I hate to cut

490
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:28,200
you off, but I really just think, I want to ask you to explain the basis of thinking that vitamins

491
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,160
are placebos. Let me first finish the point that I'll answer your question like that.

492
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:41,320
So, my overall point on that is that they're over-the-counter holistic remedies that are sold

493
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:46,680
that I think work, people say they work. And I think a lot of that for many, many people is

494
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,880
like placebo effect. And so, I think what doctors can do ethically, and that's your question

495
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,280
betterly, is rather than saying, I'm going to deceive you, give you a placebo effect, and say

496
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,560
it's a real something, I think doctors can say things like, you know, many patients benefit from

497
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,200
over-the-counter remedies, from vitamins, etc. And to answer your question, Katherine,

498
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,720
data show that the percent of people who actually have vitamin deficiencies is very, very low.

499
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,600
So, not more than a handful of percent of Americans actually have vitamin deficiencies.

500
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:25,080
And so, the data, as I understand it, on the use of many men, now, when I say, I should say a few

501
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,880
things, one is they're placebos and placebos, and we mean different things like placebos, right?

502
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,680
So, that the whole discussion, what we mean by placebos. Over-the-counter holistic medicine,

503
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,080
we mean many, many things. Certainly, there are some people who have vitamin deficiencies,

504
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:44,040
but the average person who takes a multivite, my understanding of the data shows that they

505
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:49,320
don't have a vitamin deficiency. Just if you look statistically, there's certainly a huge

506
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,440
percent of people who take a multivite vitamin C, for instance. My understanding is the data shows

507
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,160
that, except for the placebo effect, vitamin C probably does not have an effect on the common

508
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:05,880
cold, but we like the placebo effect. Obviously, there is, you know, people of anemia, etc.

509
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,720
may have folate, other B12 efficiencies, etc. But I think for a lot of vitamins out,

510
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:17,080
vitamin C, a lot of things. And certainly, if you look on their various TV shows, drink raspberry

511
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,480
juice. This is going to help cure your cancer. There's a lot of over-the-counter remedies for

512
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:27,720
which I think there are, there is, I would say, it's basically a placebo effect for people who feel

513
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:33,240
that it's helpful. Obviously, St. John's War, there are acupuncture. I think there's studies that

514
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,640
show that it may have some effectives, etc. But I think there's a lot of holistic treatments out there

515
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:44,200
that where the placebo effect is, is what's going on. And I think that those are things that a lot

516
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:49,640
of doctors can have their patients take. That will or encourage that might be helpful for instance.

517
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,640
It's a different process. Something we are talking about,

518
00:45:53,640 --> 00:46:03,160
about 10 years ago, we all realized that many physicians prescribe vitamins and antibiotics

519
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:11,080
and antidepressant. And this is documented in the literature as a tool to evoke placebo responses.

520
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,280
And this is, you know, from a professional and medical point of view. Of course,

521
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:27,320
not right. So we realized that many treatments are merely suggested or prescribed to make

522
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:33,400
to placebo patients or to make patients respond because of the power of placebo effects.

523
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,520
On the other hand, we are talking about open label placebo. That is a sort of

524
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:47,080
new trend, I would say, where patients are, you know, deliberately informed you are receiving

525
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:53,560
placebo. There is a battle with a label placebo and they are told, many patients respond to

526
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:59,000
placebo, you can try to use placebo. And the reason why we started this line of research,

527
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,520
that the capture from many other people, although it was initiated in 1963 by Parske and other

528
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:12,200
people at Johns Hopkins, was to challenge the idea that we need deceptive framework, deception

529
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:19,000
to induce a placebo response. In a sort of, you know, challenging way as a scientist, we were

530
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,040
sitting on a round at a balance, a what if we tell patients that is a placebo and we tell them

531
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:31,880
please take placebo for two months. There is no deception. There are no theoretical problems

532
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:39,720
because we are not giving line to antibiotics vitamin in place of, you know, to elicit a placebo response.

533
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:44,920
The only way to try to understand the pain depression, the brain, it is ADHD,

534
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:50,120
low back pain, and a cunning rule when patients are told you're taking a placebo.

535
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:58,360
Yeah, I would say, if I may. Yeah. And that's specific, connected to what

536
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:05,080
Luana said, but more with what Catherine said, are you saying that the etiology of the disease

537
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,960
has something to do with whether there is a placebo response or not? In other words, you said for

538
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:19,160
COVID or for cancer, there will be very unlikely a placebo response, whereas for depression, for

539
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:26,040
example, and you said IBS also, there will be. Yes, I think that we you want to distinguish between

540
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:33,240
a placebo response and a placebo effect of the having a placebo response. So you can't necessarily

541
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:39,640
control the response that patient will have. The question is whether or not that response will

542
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,240
be effective to minimize or treat the disease that you have. So from what we know,

543
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:52,440
placebos can dial down the areas of your brain that are activated in pain, for instance,

544
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:57,560
and dial up the areas that are associated with expectation that can kind of

545
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,760
downward regulate the pain coming up and basically tell you you're feeling less pain.

546
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:12,280
So that I mean, I think a lot of what we're learning about placebos is very focused in the brain.

547
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,920
Number one, and number two, along the lines of what Luana just said with conditioning,

548
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:24,120
you can condition ketamine, you can immunosuppress, conditioned people to be immunosuppressed,

549
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:30,040
you can condition them to have several biological functions that you wouldn't think of or related

550
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:40,120
to the brain. So in that way, you could modify disease with conditioning and placebo, but for

551
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:46,840
the large part, we don't really think that a placebo response, whether it's autonomic,

552
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:53,240
whether it's immunologic, whether it's endocrine, or whether it's in the brain, is going to stop a

553
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:59,800
virus from replicating in your body and doing what viruses do. So I think from that,

554
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,280
perspective, we don't think that placebos are effective treatments, and we certainly saw in what

555
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:10,440
we what transpired in the last year and a half that no matter how much we wanted some drugs,

556
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,480
no matter how much we believed say that chloroquine might be effective in effective treatment for

557
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:21,960
cloning. People with high expectation might have thought like that would drive the effect of

558
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:28,040
chloroquine, but it just couldn't fight the effect of the virus.

559
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:35,640
And I would say too, I think that those conditions in which for instance stress or pain or it might

560
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:41,320
be seen as somewhat more subjective symptoms are involved. I think they have more placebo

561
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,880
response also, but that extends to I would argue even things like cancer, for instance,

562
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:51,800
placebos could have an effect. I think because we know that anxiety and depression,

563
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:59,000
right, you're affected by placebo's can in fact also exacerbate your harm,

564
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,840
immune system and heroin's immune system and exacerbate things like cancer. So it may be that

565
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:11,480
there are even you know, more medical diseases may also be affected through those kinds of mechanisms.

566
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:20,440
I think that's I think the aspects if we think about ourness of symptoms. So if we think about pain,

567
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:26,120
unless you have a genetic disease for which you can't experience pain, you know what pain can be

568
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:35,000
or good mood or a larger reaction or itching or fatigue from cancer, any symptom that we can

569
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:42,520
perceive consciously and we have ourness of we can modify with verbal suggestions and expectations.

570
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:49,640
But if I tell you your cortisol is going to increase, you don't know what is cortisol increase,

571
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:56,200
or if I tell you your interlocking six is increasing and you have information,

572
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:03,400
what IL6 increases means to us. So we can't change things that we can't access consciously

573
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:11,560
with verbal suggestion with the power of our beliefs. But if we do a conditioning like the

574
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:18,920
mouse model that I mentioned before, we can change the release of IL6 interferon and many other

575
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:26,920
circumstances in the body. I was about to say that the the it seems to me that the nervous system

576
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:33,960
on one hand and then the immune system on the other, which are both very complex,

577
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:41,320
probably the two most complex components of our our biologys are the sorts of areas where placebo

578
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:48,120
effects can make a difference and it's interesting that they do process more let's say than maybe

579
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,040
the lining of your stomach might let's say they do process I mean of course the lining of your

580
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,280
stomach also processes information in some sense, but you know not in a way that I think

581
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:03,080
information of in the immune system does speaking of the stomach and interleukins,

582
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,680
there was a really fascinating article out of nature about two weeks ago talking about IBS

583
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:15,560
and this problem of the patient who develops a lot of pain after almost every meal. And it's

584
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:20,760
interesting because I think it ties into a lot of both no SIBO and placebo issues and namely a lot

585
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:26,120
of these folks who suffer from chronic pain from meals go through the trouble of trying to isolate

586
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:31,880
what it is in their diet that might be causing the problem they'll remove gluten or they'll remove

587
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,360
meat or the you know and a lot of these folks end up in this the article reflected there some of

588
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:41,080
them end up chasing their tail because they just simply don't seem to be able to identify what it

589
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,640
is that's causing their trouble you know they'll rotate diets and so forth very carefully and

590
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:52,120
come up with nothing and in this study with which was which was in rats they found a mass cell

591
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:59,080
release that was unique in the in the rats who had their that model of sort of post-prandial after

592
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:05,720
meal pain disorders and so then along with that the release of these interleukin the inflammatory

593
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:12,280
cytokines and they found that blocking that effect reduced it and so but what what happened in the

594
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,160
fact is that speaking of the stomach having its own information processing that somehow the release

595
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:23,720
of the mass cells was in response to it was tagged almost any meal they happened to just have

596
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:29,480
so it's almost like the mass cells started to associate itself with with the meal of the day

597
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:35,400
let's say and created created a response that they could they could block with the appropriate

598
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:41,800
agents very interesting because it could have been a no seabec conditioning kind of going back

599
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:47,640
to what loana was saying you could imagine that there could have been an incidental

600
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:56,040
coupling between something somebody ate and pain something somebody ate and pain and now you get

601
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:01,000
this generalized effect and so it's almost as if cognitive behavioral therapy or some other

602
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:09,560
you know non-chemical intervention is what is this call for? I wanted to ask one more thing about

603
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:17,080
if I understand correctly in the classical placebo experiment the classical way placebo is used

604
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:24,040
the person doesn't know that there he or she's taking placebo in the open label they know they're

605
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:32,520
taking placebo the second one becomes very close to suggestion and becomes close to you know what

606
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:38,760
we're used to doing the old days hypnotic suggestion and just suggestion whereas the first one the

607
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:44,120
person is not really getting any suggestion of any kind they think they're just taking the

608
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:50,360
medication unless they consider the medication itself a suggestion so I wondered what the thought

609
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:56,040
is about that well I think the first case also has suggestion if I say this is a medication I'm

610
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:02,520
going to give you for your fill in the blank depression or Parkinson's or something else you're

611
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,760
thinking it's going to help me and ethically there is there is a literature about a concept

612
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:15,240
called therapeutic misconception which is it turns out that even when in research we tell people

613
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:21,800
look you may be on placebo of a coin is flipped you know or whatever well you ask people how is it

614
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,280
that it was decided that you're going to get this drug that you're now getting this this would

615
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,760
it kill you're taking they'll say well the doctor's side that's what's best for me so I think for

616
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,040
most people when they see someone in a white coat in a hospital give them something even if they know

617
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:43,720
it's 50 percent chance it's placebo they will think it's being chosen to make themselves better so I

618
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:51,720
think those kinds of expectations get set. Absolutely are different kinds of expectations I mean in

619
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:57,400
the context of randomized clinical trials we know that we introduce this concept of therapeutic

620
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:04,360
misconception to account for the desire to get better the desire to contribute to advanced science

621
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:15,160
and the open label placebo is something intriguing because we tell patient is a placebo and we think

622
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:22,920
that merely taking up he'll make contribute to a sort of condition and response where patient or

623
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:29,880
daughter don't have specific beliefs or I may get 50% of the patients that are in the active arm

624
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:38,920
for this trial you know with that the expectation to 0% of getting an active drug you just receive

625
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:46,760
the placebo and probably the action of taking appeal may trigger a condition at the response again

626
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:54,760
because we know what is the action of a pain therapeutic and subconsciously but I'm very

627
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:02,040
carefully using this term we may trigger body responses that we learned through our life I bet

628
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:09,000
if we provide the open placebo to children that didn't have yet the experience of being treated

629
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:19,000
may have a different meaning unless we say last sentence you know so again there is the complexity

630
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:27,800
of our cognitive functions in interacting with our body response and this connection you know at

631
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:36,360
the level of autonomic system brain system and in system that can help to understand the variety

632
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:42,280
of the benefits though I would just I would just add to that quickly that I think some of it may

633
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:48,200
also be due to the ecology people are feeling helpless and going to a doctor's office even if

634
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:53,800
they're told this is a placebo you know I went and saw the doctor he said I'm not dying of cancer

635
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:59,640
you know he seemed or she seemed hopeful I think those kind of interactions may be part of why

636
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:06,280
an open label placebo may work is you know the doctor listened to me there was a connection he

637
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:12,440
likes me or she likes me is a relationship I mean I think those elements perhaps I play a role

638
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:20,600
I also wonder about that and I'm sorry quickly in Ted Kaptrix in both of the recent studies or not

639
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:26,680
one is not so recent on IBS where people on the wait list so you're not getting any placebo at all

640
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:33,400
had a 30% improvement compared to people who got sham acupuncture who had like a you know 40%

641
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:38,840
improvement and people who got the sham acupuncture because the plus the warm caring interaction got

642
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:46,680
62% of them had an improvement so just you know signing up to be asked questions and give and

643
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:58,360
give blood can be very therapeutic I know sorry I wanted to experience being a clinical trial as

644
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:05,800
a patient myself so I signed up for a trial for insomnia and I was so excited about it I was

645
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:11,560
driving to work and I thought well when I get more sleep I'm gonna call my brother more I'm

646
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:15,800
gonna call my system more I'm gonna be such I'm gonna be such a better person and I'm thinking

647
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,600
all this and then I'm like driving you know I'm in traffic and I said wow I could I'm just gonna

648
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:28,920
call my brother right now so I called him and he was like where are you calling me I'm like oh wow

649
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:34,120
I haven't even gotten in the trial yet already I'm done with my insomnia and ironically I never

650
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:40,440
got in the trial because I was you know I had I had too many exclusion criteria but um you got

651
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:49,480
cured and tell us I'm sleeping much better I you know what you started to say Catherine was a

652
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,560
great segue when you jumped in just a second ahead of me but I was thinking about something I

653
01:00:53,560 --> 01:01:00,200
think is related this is when you mentioned that people in the wait list do better 30% of them do

654
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:05,960
better what I find in my practice because I see a lot of treatment refractory patients they've been

655
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:11,160
on a gazillion antidepressants typically and sometimes other meds but they've been on a gazillion

656
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:16,280
antidepressants one after the other after the other and they come to me and they're a wreck and I

657
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,720
typically try to in a careful way do a little bit of a washout you know take them off the meds

658
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:27,320
the as best I can and that often really helps a lot not always sometimes you have to build it back

659
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:31,480
up but my point is that I think some holistic treatments and I wonder whether this actually

660
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:38,840
occurs even in some placebo the placebo arm of some studies you know just removing people from

661
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:43,320
treatments that may have been having pernicious effects because people a lot of them are they're

662
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:48,760
they're looking for research help because they're they're refractory right so I wonder in how many

663
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:55,480
cases you've removed this I know firsthand a case that I saw of a woman with very severe depression

664
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:00,520
like I just described on lots of antidepressants for a couple of years just doing miserably and she

665
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:06,840
went away to some sort of holistic spa like place and they withdrew her from her meds and she did

666
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:12,120
really nicely and she thought it was all of the treatments they had provided to her including a

667
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,760
lot of holistic treatments and such and that may be that they helped I'm not that much of a

668
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,280
skeptic about it but I formed the idea that had to do with withdrawing her from the medicines

669
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:26,600
sure enough she had a recurrence of her depression and she went back and she didn't do very well

670
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:32,120
this time she went back taking no meds and arrived in a depressed state and she came to me and I

671
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:36,360
said look I think what happened was you got better largely because you weren't taking treatment

672
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:40,840
and they rid you of all those negative effects and now you've had a recurrence and we have to

673
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:46,360
you know get to work on it in a more active way and it worked it ended up working but so I'm wondering

674
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:51,560
how much we're moving those you know pain medicines for example when they don't work especially for

675
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:57,000
chronic pain and they typically don't very well they cause a wide range of horrible side effects

676
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,600
then that really reduces a person's body of life so I wondered about that I was going to ask my

677
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:09,800
wife Catherine Catherine your book the pain the placebo paradox Luanis I can imagine several

678
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:15,320
paradoxes we've been talking about one is the but I'd Luanna mentioned one early on in her

679
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:20,440
initial remarks about that some people placebo actually hurts them or something but is that

680
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:25,560
was I was wondering what is what is the paradox is that the paradox you're focusing on or others

681
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:31,720
or all of these there's so many what's the plural Beverly you might know the plural of paradox is

682
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:39,800
it paradox paradoxes paradoxes yeah there's so many for instance there is actually a thing called

683
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:48,760
the the placebo I think it's actually the the placebo paradox where people like if you do the

684
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:55,080
math on the difference between drug and placebo it it's supposed to be additive drugs and

685
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:03,400
placebuds are supposed to be additive but several people who don't respond to psychiatric meds

686
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:10,440
and who do respond to placebo basically mess up that math and so there's a like a formal term

687
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:16,120
called placebo paradox but I think the paradox there's so many paradoxes there is this paradox

688
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:22,200
of people who don't respond when we think they should respond there's the paradox of it should

689
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:27,560
be additive and and I apologize for jumping on you with the vitamins but that's kind of my

690
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:33,320
I'm passionate about vitamins and it's interesting I want to say why because I think of vitamins as

691
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:39,400
drugs vitamins are drugs that we were unable to demonstrate that they were better than placebo

692
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:49,880
in clinical trials but there's so many natural substances that when we purify them like you know

693
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:59,000
willow bark from the the tree that from bark from a willow tree is where we get aspirin for instance

694
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:05,240
statins are extracted from the mold like the green mold on your bread is is where we get

695
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:11,000
statin so there's so many of these natural products that are actually drugs when we purify them

696
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:16,520
and then we can demonstrate or actually a lot of them are grandfathered in but when you really try

697
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:23,000
and test you know vitamin E vitamin maybe not so much vitamin B vitamin C we can't see a difference

698
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:30,840
between drug and placebo but my work has shown that genetically there's subsets of people who respond

699
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:38,520
to vitamin E for instance and another subset that are harmed or I should say do worse with vitamin E

700
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:49,000
and then this subset that responds to vitamin E does worse on placebo and the subset that responds

701
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:57,480
to that does worse on vitamin E does worse on drugs so basically placebo basically they cancel

702
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:04,040
each other up is what I'm saying and so you never see this difference between these vitamins and

703
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:08,280
these drugs and I would argue that there's so many drugs now that if we took them back through

704
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:17,160
a modern day placebo trial they would probably fail and so you know I think that this is this

705
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:25,000
is an inherent paradox in how we understand and how we project onto what we think is real medicine

706
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:33,800
and what is actually you know holistic or is a vitamin or what we see as effective I think they're

707
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:39,640
the paradoxes everywhere if I can just respond to that great point thank you so

708
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:48,120
yeah so clearly there are strong pharmacological properties in many natural substances right so

709
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:52,840
you know lithium's assault and as you mentioned you know there is poisonous plants out there too

710
01:06:52,840 --> 01:07:01,240
and and beneficial plants etc that being said you know the the holistic medicine

711
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:06,440
industry is a multi-billion dollar industry in this country if it's 10 or 20 billion dollars

712
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:13,480
and I think that for most people and you see you know natural vitamin stores etc etc I think for

713
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:19,480
certainly for a lot I would hypothesize for most but not for all patients who go in there what

714
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:25,160
they're coming out with is going to be more placebo effect or I would hypothesize would be a lot

715
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:31,640
of placebo effect not from whatever they're buying in the GMC vitamin store the natural

716
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:37,160
you know holistic medicine store that that actually it's a physiological effect but

717
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:42,040
I think the work you're doing it's to just tease these out is extremely important and

718
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:47,560
then look forward to seeing the results I wanted to ask also your opinion about

719
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:55,880
a specifically timely thing which is over my practice for the last couple of months the major

720
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,920
thing that people talk about in relation to their bodies is the effect of the vaccine on their

721
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:09,000
bodies some have absolutely no side effects some have very violent side effects do you think there

722
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:18,840
is an expectation factor in that or do you think it's an immune system issue well they may not be

723
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:25,960
separate though remember exactly yeah you're working on this right so you

724
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:34,120
have a representation and the side effects to the vaccine and also people who may not want

725
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:39,560
the vaccine there is the huge case in Europe of AstraZeneca just now so a

726
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:46,520
definitely the immune response and the way we responded to the same trigger in particular

727
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:55,080
the vaccine justify different experience of a side effects some people may be extremely fearful

728
01:08:55,080 --> 01:09:02,680
anxious and this can amplify the perception of the side effects but also some people may

729
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:08,120
add the COVID and they may have an amplified the response to the vaccine because there is a memory

730
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:19,000
immunological memory to you know the SARC COVID-2 so it is quite complex but definitely we need to

731
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:25,560
you know be conscious to say well this is just in your mind you know many people are experiencing

732
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:35,720
severe side effects for this kind of vaccine and you know the difference in immune system genetics

733
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:42,520
and prior exposure to the virus through the disease justify a different amount of side effects

734
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:53,400
there's also a very complex statin related nocibel effect that's happening in popular culture right

735
01:09:53,400 --> 01:10:01,880
now there's a belief certainly out there that statins cause muscle pain and several other side

736
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:12,440
effects and unfortunately I think that the press certainly has picked this up but also there are

737
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:21,960
what are called statin denialists and if you google statin side effects you get 10 million hits

738
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:29,720
10 million hits now there more recently people have done researchers have done clinical trials

739
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:33,880
where people who could never take a statin they took a statin in three weeks they had to come off

740
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:38,760
of them because they had such terrible pain they've randomized them so they're blinded they don't

741
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:45,000
know they're taking a statin and they've actually there's a type of trial design called n-1 trial

742
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,880
where you kind of you spend a month on a statin you spend a month on a placebo and a month with no

743
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,960
pills but you don't know what order you're getting or what you're getting obviously you know when

744
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,160
you're not going you're taking no pills but you don't know when you're taking a statin there when

745
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:02,680
you're taking a placebo and what they found was half of the people who went to the end of the study

746
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:09,960
were able to go back to taking a statin and when they looked at the distribution of side effects

747
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,800
there was no difference between when people had negative side effects with placebo versus when they

748
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,920
had with them with the statins so there's obviously you know there are people who have muscle pain

749
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:24,680
with with statins there's no question but there are a lot of people who have probably side effects

750
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:33,240
that are more nocebos and are induced by expectation and it's so hard to control back in the day you

751
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:39,480
could kind of say you the physician could tell the patient what to expect but now the worldwide

752
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:45,000
web tells us what to expect and you know it really depends what rabbit hole you go down and lord

753
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,560
knows when you go down one of these rabbit holes you get more and more you know the holes kind of

754
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:55,720
proliferate and you get further down and you get stuck and I think this is a tremendous harm to

755
01:11:55,720 --> 01:12:01,560
so many people and very unfortunate I hope something is also for pain you know some people who

756
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:08,680
experience pain stop to most of to exercise stop to have a special life and this mechanism of fear

757
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:14,360
and anxiety becomes so dangerous and the same can be probably applied to the statin

758
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:22,280
in modern and nozibo responses where people respond with terrible muscle pain and again pain

759
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:29,480
and stop to take statins without considering that they expose themselves to the risk of heart attack

760
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:37,480
and strokes so yes definitely nozibo experience of the you know side effects like pain and

761
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:44,440
anxiety can become a sort of trigger to more negative spectators and nozibo

762
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:50,040
I would like to say this one thing because I think it's implied by almost everything that

763
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:56,280
we've said today but I think it bears emphasis I mean I know again as a clinician when I hear

764
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:01,240
and I hear a lot of complaints about a lot of symptoms and some of them even seem a little bit

765
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:08,040
hard for me to help for but I I never think of it as being I quote unquote in someone's mind I

766
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:12,840
always think there's some mechanism that's a physical mechanism that's accounting for this

767
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:21,160
whether or not it's based on their body's reaction to expectation or to some some incidental property

768
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:26,920
the drug that triggers a nozibo effect for example I'm I never think this is some sort of

769
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:32,920
mentalistic something in some mental realm alone I think of it as being something that's

770
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:37,640
triggered and I it's important to try to figure out why why why is this happening this person so

771
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:43,160
the important thing is that when we observe this negative behaviors negative expectation

772
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:52,680
negative outcomes it is much more difficult to erase and remove this kind of responses than

773
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:58,120
a placebo response positive outcome and we're studying the lab to why this happen which part

774
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:05,320
of the brain is involved but so probably from an evolutionary point of view we as human begin

775
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:14,600
tended to respond in a more aggressive way to negative events and this somehow help us to prevent

776
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:21,720
you know dangerous situations but when this become chronic of course it become part of the

777
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:27,560
disease that we have difficulty to handle at least from the symptomatology point of view

778
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:33,720
yeah there's a large literature on that of course on sort of you know Daniel Kahneman

779
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:39,560
you know won the Nobel Prize or discussing instead of you know biases when they have I just want

780
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,800
to mention two things just I first of all see there's a few questions coming from the audience

781
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:49,880
we may want to answer a bit but one thing I just want to come back to the notion something

782
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:57,240
Catherine said earlier about RCTs and the interest ethically to sort of not have people respond

783
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:02,920
up we'll see whoever placebo responders in clinical trials I think that raises some ethical concerns

784
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:08,680
so the read I think what you mentioned is and I think you're speaking about other drug companies

785
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:14,040
out there doing this there's a concern you know a lot of RCTs aren't working as you're saying

786
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:19,720
I would intend a lot of RCTs aren't working now but more did in the past not because there's

787
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,880
more placebo response in the world now that's not you were suggesting I know but because there

788
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:32,840
aren't as good drugs perhaps right and so the problem with eliminating placebo response in the

789
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:39,240
study is that in the world when the drug is in a proof there are in fact placebo responders so you

790
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:45,800
do in fact want to know how good a drug is if I say this is my new drug against placebo because

791
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,320
in the world that's what's going to happen out there so I just think that raises a few

792
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:56,440
questions in my mind is to put it out there um this I think this has a bearing it's not straight

793
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:04,440
on subject but there was just a report from Cambridge University study that LSD microdosing

794
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:10,840
is thought to have a large placebo effect do you have any opinion or knowledge about this

795
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:16,600
and I think after you're smiling I think after that we should go to the audience yes we will

796
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:23,160
briefly in the literature there is evidence that placebo responses in randomized clinical

797
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:31,480
trials are larger compared to what we observe 15 20 25 years ago and one of the reason is our

798
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:39,000
marketing we invest much more in marketing we are good in you know social media in coloring

799
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:47,560
our drug so I would be still optimistic on the drug development we do develop new drugs we do

800
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:53,720
well last physicians and scientists the problem of placebo response is becoming larger and larger

801
01:16:53,720 --> 01:17:00,440
it's also because we do better with engaging in this therapeutic doctor patient relationship

802
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:07,240
and another thing that we don't do so well yet bring in the mechanism and the knowledge of

803
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:13,400
placebo effects into the randomized clinical prior methodology why do we use still as gold

804
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:21,080
standard the additive model that Catherine mentioned a little ago we have better tools we have better

805
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:26,840
designs and from our work where colleagues like following some other people who suggest

806
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:33,960
let's change the design of clinical trials the comparison between a placebo versus active drug

807
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:42,360
cannot be enough cannot be just you know the solution to say this drug works or not so we needed to

808
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:52,440
think in a more creative and you know smarter way how we design a clinical trial for this disease

809
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:57,880
because if we study immune system it's different than studying schizophrenia so and we still

810
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:04,360
play the same clinical trial design 20 disease no matter which is the etymology what we know

811
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:12,280
that we should go ahead but I want to say about pain that is my area of interest I mean we know

812
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:17,000
that there is a huge influence of expectations and still we don't measure expectation when we do

813
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:23,800
clinical trial we know that sex race influence the therapist race and sex or trialist make

814
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:30,840
any difference we know that genetic assets change so if we know all these things why want to we

815
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:41,000
start with a collection of saliva for DNA with you know powerful assessment of social

816
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:50,280
demographic prior experience of unsexful pain therapeutics and do a better job in design a clinical trial

817
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:56,520
and the count for the body and versus that at least do we know we don't think that yeah I think it's

818
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:04,440
I mean going back to the ethics and also to build on Moana it it's a very complex and troubling problem

819
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:10,440
I think that we are stuck on the double blind randomized placebo control trial and we do need

820
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:17,480
to rethink it but in looking at what people have proposed even fathers new methodology has hit

821
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:26,600
problems with demonstrating efficacy being more effective than the typical randomized clinical

822
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:31,880
trial so it's not a simple problem to solve and I do think the ethics that that Robert can raise

823
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:37,000
is super important because think about it what are we going to give the placebo responders are we

824
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,480
not going to give them drugs are we going to say like are we going to give them placebos and I think

825
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:48,920
this is mostly disconcerting and troubling for instance in the area of surgery recently there

826
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:54,280
have been a number of clinical trials in surgery where they've actually usually surgery surgeons

827
01:19:54,280 --> 01:20:01,800
for I mean I don't even know how long you know decades scores of decades have been they haven't had

828
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:11,560
to do randomized trials but now you know whether it's it's vertebral plasty or renal derivation or

829
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:18,680
you know or otroscopic surgery like all these are having problems demonstrating efficacy beyond

830
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:25,960
placebo but here's the problem if we say yeah if we say that that this procedure that we've been

831
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:31,320
doing for you know decades does not be placebo so we're not going to do it are we going to give

832
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:37,080
people a sham surgery I mean I don't think it's it's such a complex problem I think that we really

833
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:43,720
need to think through the whole thing from whether or not the genetics to what the genetics

834
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:51,640
yeah it's not the ethical consideration of the ethics of the surgical procedure and clinical trial

835
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:57,720
with sham surgery ethics of open label placebo ethics of randomized clinical trials I would

836
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:02,520
just say they are the problem with sham surgery especially people put under anesthesia in it general

837
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:07,400
anesthesia is there's risk yeah so ideally just to put it out there brainstorm if there's some way

838
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:14,360
to give a placebo that had no risk and obviously there are some things to decide are there placebo

839
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:19,960
responders who've just responded to surgery because of the placebo effect in which case could there

840
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:25,160
be something that's risk-free etc just as a thought let's try something who are similar why don't we

841
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:31,480
explain patient there is no evidence that this treatment is better than sham do you still want

842
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:36,520
to go through the sham or do you want to go to Edwards and they will explain you more about the

843
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:43,320
placebo effect that's great moment I just want to say one thing I'm I recently had rotator cuff

844
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:49,320
surgery and that was a one of the surgeries that they had this you know big uproar about it was

845
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:56,840
the most painful experience I've ever had and I would probably pick the surgery and that's surprising

846
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:05,160
to me but it's true it was a pain I know I think my shoulder works really well now and you know I

847
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:10,760
think somehow I don't know if I could have gotten there with physical therapy because I don't know if

848
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:15,800
I would have had the discipline without the surgery to do the physical therapy but you know we're all

849
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:23,320
complex beings yep and on that note I want to thank you for your incredible exchange here and

850
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:29,720
let the audience in there have been several questions that have come up and Alex will you moderate

851
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:39,400
that part yeah okay so excuse me first question is from dr. Diane garland thank you Diane so she

852
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:44,600
was wanting to why don't you guys reflect on the popularity of hydroxychloroquine

853
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:49,880
and I've immectant in treatment of covid despite lack of scientific evidence I know you brush

854
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:55,080
on it slightly so if there's anything more you want to add on to that topic I would just say that

855
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:02,600
when people feel helpless they grasp its draws and want something that's going to make them feel

856
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:08,600
better people don't like the sense of being helpless being depressed to spare etc and so people will

857
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:13,960
gravitate to something one and secondly what we haven't talked about is you touch on a little bit is

858
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:20,520
how politics and political biases affect perceptions of these issues which I think is a factor

859
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:32,600
so literally and initially the drug was introduced in a daughter without having grand clinical trials

860
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:40,360
so somehow we ran away as people to the active drug and placebo to come to the evidence that

861
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:47,800
there was no indication for this treatment the covid-19 pandemic was a very difficult situation

862
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:55,480
to underland you know there was an attempt to try different therapeutic solutions now today we have

863
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:03,080
better answers after one year and the therapeutic protocols for covid-19 have changed as a result

864
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:11,880
of clinical trials with a placebo arm I think there's also there's also a a a pernicious sort of anti

865
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:20,040
medicine narrative out there that goes something like this doctors don't really want to look at

866
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:25,560
certain evidence because that's not the way they're trained and they are biased against certain

867
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:31,560
approaches that's sort of a little bit of the that storyline came a little bit into our previous

868
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:35,960
president's narrative about hydrochloroquine you know that doctors didn't really you know

869
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:41,320
weren't taking these anecdotal reports seriously and sure they sure should why they being so

870
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:45,800
pigheaded about it that was a sort of part of the negative narrative I would say that

871
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:52,760
reporters in situation like this have also a responsibility to educate lay language people

872
01:24:52,760 --> 01:25:04,520
you know to remember faces and solid knowledge is the dog models and a amount media spread example

873
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:16,840
that can convey false information okay on the next one okay um so this is a question I have

874
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:22,680
the formulate for this commenter on youtube and I'm only speaking with this level of disrespect

875
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:27,400
towards him because he showed no respect to any of you and so I think he brings up some points but

876
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:32,840
I just want to point out that to listen to this for an hour or so and to then come to the conclusion

877
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:37,000
that none of the people here know what they're talking about and that they have no model that

878
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:42,920
satisfies you I think is um I think show us more about you this is you're a professional medical

879
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:47,400
you know your medical professional dr kenith carcia I did more work looking into you than you've done

880
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,840
it to any of these people and some of the foremost question for you because you seem unwilling

881
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:57,400
and are able to do this and I think also to use buzzwords in either no context or even with the

882
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:03,640
context you provide that shows that your model is just as simple or even stupid I think um

883
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,360
I'm always saying this because of what he wrote and I think it's you're a grown person

884
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:14,360
you can write a question out without resorting to these insults and so that being said um

885
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:20,040
well move on well look let's just try to bring in some of the concepts he brought up because

886
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:25,400
maybe you can reflect on it in a way that with the proper context so he was curious about the effects

887
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:32,680
of complex social theory on the placebo effect and then he talks about CNS hierarchy central

888
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:38,600
nervous system hierarchy and nonlinear processing and with regards to effects of placebo so do you

889
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:43,960
have guys have any comments to give there so you could satiate is obviously complex model that exceeds

890
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:54,920
our human experience you know go ahead complex social theory yeah loana do you want to talk about

891
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:59,720
I mean I think there are very there are some very sophisticated models that are emerging and are

892
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:07,960
very interesting um one of them is the Bayesian brain or predictive error processing and um

893
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:16,760
um uh some of this work um is basically building on um work that's being done in neurobiology not

894
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:25,400
only in placebo research um that is about our brain tending to predict before um predict what

895
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:32,840
it's going to see or experience um and then taking the information from the experience and

896
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:40,120
basically integrating or averaging that um information to create the experience that we actually experience

897
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:48,120
um and so some of this predictive the Bayesian brain theories have been applied to placebos

898
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:57,320
in particular for instance into open to open labeled placebo to say that um that you know we have a

899
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:03,160
preconceived notion of what to expect when we get a pill um the new information that's coming in

900
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:08,520
to say like this pill is a placebo but you might want to try it and then there's this kind of

901
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:15,960
synthesis of these two in which the person might re reinterpret an experience of feeling better

902
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:21,640
because you know our symptoms are going are basically fluctuating over time so for instance if in a

903
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:28,120
moment that I take the pill I'm like oh I'm actually feeling better than I might revise my prior um and

904
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:33,640
have a new hypothesis of how I'm feeling and that might get revised continually to the point where

905
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:40,760
I'm having a quote unquote placebo response that's ameliorative or positive and Luana is a much

906
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:45,720
more of a neurobiologist than me and might want to comment on this you know these theories that are

907
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:54,280
in the field now again I like to refer to animal models the reason why we can study a placebo

908
01:28:54,280 --> 01:29:00,840
responses in animals is because we somehow can simplify the placebo effect to a prediction of

909
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:08,200
future events so if we are receiving a treatment and we try we I mean in this case our brain as

910
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:16,680
a great machine to make predictions we may predict based on our experience like this person is

911
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:23,400
offensive because doesn't know this topic to the extent that we know we are predicting a behavior

912
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:32,280
or we can predict a reduction of pain if we experience positive and artistic effects in our life so

913
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:41,240
so it is complex when we apply vision modeling in general to symptoms but there is an

914
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:50,120
enforce by different labs to use the prior experience current experience and expectation

915
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:57,720
to predict positive effects and the different kind of modeling not just the patient can be used

916
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:04,440
to anticipate if a person eventually based on different elements that they mentioned

917
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:11,240
can be a placebo responder or not to amplify a little bit on what Luana and Catherine just said

918
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:17,960
in terms of in terms of the brains organization or reorganization this actually dovetails a little

919
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:24,600
bit into Beverly's question that none of us took a whack at yet I'm ready to talking about LSD

920
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:30,120
microdosing but there's this notion that the brain of course and this again follows up on

921
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:36,040
Catherine's comment there it has a sort self-organization as a property of reorganizing itself

922
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:43,000
I mean in the old days I think this was what motivated in my mind anyway were motivated early

923
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:51,160
late 19th century German Gestalt psychology research where the brain tended to create holes

924
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:57,480
you know holes that the brain and our bodies do create these sort of self-organized states

925
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:05,880
and the Bayesian model says okay right through a series of iterations our brains reorganize and

926
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:13,480
occasionally it might incorporate a medication that pushes the biology of the brain in that direction

927
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:20,840
it might involve thinking and expectation that does that the idea behind a psilocybin LSD

928
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:27,320
treatment is that when it is supposed to work in as much as it helps to reorganize the way the brain

929
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:32,360
has sort of wrapped itself around the world around reality and by giving it a shake and

930
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:37,880
sort of a reboot your brain can reorganize and you can be happy and not want to use drugs anymore

931
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:45,880
or not have other sorts of psychological symptoms the study out of it was the Imperial College of

932
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:54,600
London found that in the micro dosing of an ametta analysis the micro dosing of LSD seemed to be

933
01:31:55,880 --> 01:32:00,440
pretty much matched with the placebo response in the same studies but it remains to be seen of

934
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:04,440
course the dosing could be changed it might mean maybe it shouldn't be micro dosing

935
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:10,760
I'm a little bit skeptic of it but I think it's an interesting theory that does touch on this notion

936
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:21,800
of the reorganization of the brain okay and I apologize I meant to say complex systems theory

937
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:26,920
anyway but I only did this because I gave him a chance and I thought it was still try to get to

938
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:33,560
these topics because I think they could add something um but anyway uh so the next question is from

939
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:41,160
Dr Ralph Wharton thank you Ralph and they were curious about um the kind like hypnosis so you know

940
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:47,560
about they they cloped that 30% of all patients are easily hypnotizable so how do you think

941
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,800
hypnotism and placebo relate to one another?

942
01:32:54,040 --> 01:33:03,080
I think there are studies comparing the brain imaging responses to hypnosis and

943
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:08,600
placebo and it looks like the two works through different mechanisms

944
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:17,320
again when we explore the brain responses we may see different mechanism for things that from

945
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:27,160
a syntomatologic or behavioral point of view looks like something similar so hypnosis is

946
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:33,800
strongly related to the sugestibilita how much people can be suggestible

947
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:40,360
there are studies that somehow show placebo responder tended to be also more suggestible

948
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:45,640
but whether when we look at the brain things can change and there you know

949
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:52,200
hypnosis versus placebo responses the two seems to work through different mechanism at least

950
01:33:52,200 --> 01:34:00,760
when we talk about pain. Dr Wharton will be a discussant in our stress round table in April

951
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:02,840
so thank you for the question.

952
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:10,280
Um it's okay I go on to the next one so this is sort of two birds with one stone because uh

953
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:15,720
sharing gold and jostlin Diaz asked questions in a similar vein but I think put them together

954
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:22,680
they can be quite interesting so Sharon asks is religion slash belief that god will make it

955
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:29,160
it being you'll fill in the blank better the ultimate placebo and then jostlin in a similar vein

956
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:34,040
asks do you believe that spirituality plays a part in one's illness and care and that do you

957
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:39,080
believe that one can receive more activist cures through dreams. I think there's a few questions

958
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:48,680
there so I think there's no doubt that data shows that quote religiosity that spirituality can

959
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:57,320
help reduce stress and can assist coping with many conditions and there's been some data and

960
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:01,720
my colleagues on the call may know it better than I do that it can help with

961
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:11,640
uh healing etc. I think one difference is that for many people religion and spirituality involve

962
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:18,280
social supports also so people will if traditionally people go to a church or a temple there are

963
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:23,800
other people and that's I think some of that may work by having social support people care for

964
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:30,600
you knowing that people care for you etc. So those are some initial thoughts. There's also

965
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:36,200
Myrna Weisman's group at Yale and that was at Yale now she said Columbia for a number of years

966
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:44,040
shows that there's actually differences in the the the cortex among people in resiliency to

967
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:51,800
depression those who are uh uh have some religiosity it could just be spirituality without religion

968
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:56,600
per se that there's actually differences in the cortex associated with that that may be involved.

969
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:06,920
So somehow we can compare again sorry for my uh approach that is very you know by neuro biological

970
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:15,880
based if we exercise eventually we have the ability to increase structure the area for example related

971
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:23,480
to the hippocampus if we meditate we also do an exercise of our mind and something in the brain

972
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:29,960
changes a matter of doing this daily exercise spirituality is somehow different than placebo

973
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:36,520
effects we are talking about two different things placebo effects is somehow our expectation about

974
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:44,200
receiving a treatment and perceiving an outcome improvement spirituality is more related to

975
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:52,600
our beliefs or fate how much you believe in something that is independent than the process

976
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:55,960
that we would describe as placebo effects today.

977
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:02,600
David I think the first thing I think this approach I does is it gives people a sense of meaning and

978
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:08,200
hope also so I think the notion of hope may be a commons-enormated potentially.

979
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:18,120
And it also addresses the emotions with music and ritual and sort of costume and celebration so

980
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:25,880
that that you know stimulates some kind of sense of really having experience

981
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:32,600
which is what many people mean when they say something meaningful am I really having an experience?

982
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:41,880
I do think that there are ritualistic elements of you know the clinical encounter the physician

983
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:48,280
is wearing a white coat they're wearing a you know might have a stethoscope they do you know

984
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:53,880
they there's you know there's the opening line how are you doing what brings you here today there's a

985
01:37:53,880 --> 01:38:01,320
very ritualized aspect to it so I haven't studied this Lohanna so I don't know like you know your

986
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:06,840
brain on spirituality versus your brain on placebo what the differences are but I do think that there

987
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:13,720
are you know even the kind of the host in communion you know is this kind of disc that you get

988
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:20,520
handed and you put on your tongue I mean there's a there's a lot of the format of a religious

989
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:26,840
experience that I think is kind of replicated in in a clinical setting and I don't think this is

990
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:34,120
unusual I mean you know our brains are economical organs and it's not making a new pathway for

991
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:41,080
every single different experience it's kind of funneling experiences generally into into these

992
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:48,680
set pathways so I wouldn't be surprised if there was more you know overlap but obviously very

993
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:53,640
difficult to study in the kind of acute setting that we study placebo's in.

994
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:00,840
Thank you. How many more questions are we feeling?

995
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:05,480
I think we should go another five minutes if that's all right.

996
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:09,800
Okay so I'll just because there's one more question from someone who hasn't asked yet and

997
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:13,160
then the rest are sort of second questions so I'll at least do that and we'll see where we are

998
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:21,640
from there so this is from Darwin a Gugo Rayas apologies if I bungled your last name this was

999
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:28,040
from YouTube he wrote is there a comprehensive list of quote unquote domains that are placebo

1000
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:31,320
responsive or open label placebo responsive?

1001
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:40,920
There are several papers we try to summarize what has been published so far in our

1002
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:49,080
review and we describe the methodological challenges and direction of open label studies

1003
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:56,120
or whether all these studies have been with an end that is quite limited to try to start to

1004
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:03,480
address questions of phenotypes of people who responded to open label placebo we will need

1005
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:11,640
the larger studies and before we draw any conclusion about who are the people who may respond to

1006
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,440
an undisceptive open label placebo.

1007
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:29,320
So we made some comments earlier about whether or at least I did about how whether immune

1008
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:35,080
and CNS diseases may be at least among the things where there's more of response but not

1009
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:40,440
exclusively and I also know that within psycho within the realm of sort of psychotropic meds

1010
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:48,120
there are there's a lower placebo response to OCD as far as I know in most studies and

1011
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:53,640
and also to psychosis and it's not complete but there's a lesser response that's been pretty

1012
01:40:53,640 --> 01:41:00,440
consistent. But we say overall also I mean the diseases conditions for which there are placebo

1013
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:05,960
responses I think within mental health disorders there's a disproportionate number and I think part

1014
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:12,520
was Luana's comments earlier that it's when one's not so mind how we define that is a layer of

1015
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:22,840
the symptoms there may be more of an effect. Well this has been a wonderfully rich exchange I

1016
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:30,040
really thank you all for participating and I hope that your communal experience here is having more

1017
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:36,920
than a positive placebo effect but if it's only placebo effect of talking to others with the same

1018
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:42,280
interests I'm happy that we could provide some of it and how much you provided for us.

1019
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:49,480
So thank you very much. Thank you for having us. Oh yes thank you. That's wonderful. Thanks

1020
01:41:49,480 --> 01:42:01,640
everybody. Thank you.

1021
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:21,480
you

1022
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:51,480
you
