1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I wanted to know what was an address in the movie was what is the relationship between

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,560
the Higgs and the unification of the nuclear weak force and the electromagnetic force?

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,560
The standard model incorporates the unification of the two.

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:30,960
The Higgs is part of that, so at the very basis of the standard model, we need to have

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,120
the Higgs to have it make sense.

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,400
So it's not the thing that is unifying it, but the fact is that the standard model really

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,240
only makes sense with the Higgs in it.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,440
Mathematically, even phenomenologically in terms of these particles having mass.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,400
Without the Higgs, all the particles would be massless.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:02,200
We know that in fact it was actually the problem of the mass, of having the mass of the W boson,

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:10,280
which is the mediator of the weak force, that really drove the necessity of a Higgs.

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,080
And getting that mass was the big step that actually Stephen Weinberg made.

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,480
So all the attention goes to Peter Higgs, who mathematically came up with this idea.

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,840
But it was actually other people like Weinberg who realized it could be incorporated into

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,840
this structure, the standard model that we have, and it could give the W boson mass.

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,200
But allow the W boson initially to be seen as sort of a symmetric partner to other bosons

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
in the electromagnetic force.

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Does that make sense?

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:52,400
I might actually add that you might be at the town of director, so Elle was quite about

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
the science.

21
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,400
And part of the story of this film is about the team in a certain unusual level of backgrounds

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,400
that he brought to him.

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,240
I studied knowledge of particle physics 30 years ago.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:17,680
And amazingly this was the issues that were still actually being worked on now.

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
What's the state of particle physicists now?

26
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,320
Are they excited, depressed, baffled?

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,560
Where's the field going with this?

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,320
Yes.

29
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,920
I would say all of the above.

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,240
I mean, you know what's interesting?

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,920
There is a really, I think here again we're now seeing a really big distinction between

32
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,280
the theorists and the experimentalists.

33
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,000
The environmentalists are excited for the most part.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,960
They're busy getting ready to start up again.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,400
This is almost history for them now.

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
And they've been doing upgrades.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,360
They have started it up.

38
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,800
Mike Weman, who is our character at the LHC, the Brit.

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,880
I mean, he's really at the center now of getting the machine ready to go.

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,480
And you see him in the news all the time.

41
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
He's telling what I say.

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
And they're about to go.

43
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,240
Meanwhile, they totally ripped out a lot of atlas and they've been replacing that.

44
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,600
So they're very excited about what they're going to find.

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,360
The theorists are worried, honestly, because in some sense nothing has changed.

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,240
I mean, there's this great accomplishment that completed the standard model.

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,840
I mean, having the Higgs, which is great for the people that predicted the standard model.

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,000
For the people that are mostly featured in our film, they're still really waiting to

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,320
see what's going to be there.

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,120
So I think there's nervousness.

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,360
How important is the difference between the CMS member and the atlas number?

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,240
It's not really considered significantly different, actually.

53
00:03:51,240 --> 00:04:00,760
So it's considered that they've confirmed it, you know, together.

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:11,520
Could you elaborate a little more, if you could, about why the relatively high value

55
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:21,720
that was confirmed for the Higgs mass would preclude supersymmetry or the supersymmetric

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
particles?

57
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,760
It doesn't entirely preclude them.

58
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:34,400
You know, to a certain extent, we dramatized it a little more than it is in terms of being

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,880
a complete bifurcation.

60
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,280
And you know, it's like, you know, you get the impression, we don't say this, but I know

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,520
that we sort of give the impression that, you know, it has to be this or this.

62
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,520
It's really a continuum.

63
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,720
And there are similarly theories that, in a sense, are a continuum.

64
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,640
And there are theories that can accommodate a multiverse and supersymmetric particles.

65
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:07,800
What is true is that in order to be supersymmetric, though, it doesn't fall comfortably into

66
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,360
the simplest supersymmetric models.

67
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,600
So you know, all these models, they have lots of different variations.

68
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
You can vary things.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,080
You can, you know, stick in additional, you know, terms and things like that.

70
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,560
The, you know, most common supersymmetric models do require a lower mass.

71
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,280
But there are, as I say, mixed things.

72
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:39,200
David, Sava, and Nima have all worked on things, you know, called split supersymmetry, which

73
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:46,600
allow the possibility that some things might be only explainable with multiverse, but there

74
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,080
could be supersymmetric particles.

75
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,320
Well, then let me rephrase my question.

76
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,000
Why is the current theory of the multiverse and supersymmetry?

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Why are they mutually exclusive?

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,400
I'm not clear on that.

79
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
They're not.

80
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,200
So that's actually what I'm saying is that they are not exclusive.

81
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,240
There are theories that could accommodate them.

82
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,520
So you know, if you think in terms of the multiverse, you know, the big thing about the multiverse

83
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,560
saying that there are certain numbers in our theory that we will not be able to explain

84
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:24,160
because they are random in the multiverse, what could be is that there are multiverses

85
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,640
and some of those numbers are only explainable this way.

86
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,600
But some of the others are not going to need that, that they might be explainable by supersymmetric

87
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,720
partners.

88
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:43,560
What was, what is there about the Higgs?

89
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:50,000
What was there about the Higgs that made it as elusive as it was as opposed to the other

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
particles?

91
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,440
One of the things was the weight, the mass.

92
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:03,800
So you know, being able to have an accelerator that could generate energy or mass enough

93
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
to be able to see it.

94
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,240
I mean, so in a sense, that's the most obvious thing that was there.

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,760
Beyond that, it's also, it decays very quickly.

96
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,760
There's so many other things it can decay to.

97
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,440
They didn't know exactly where they were looking for it.

98
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,440
But principally they needed to get to the energy of the LHC to be able to see it.

99
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:32,520
I just want to comment that these questions are, they're pretty great in terms of the

100
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:40,680
science and one of the goals of the film more broadly was to make audiences, broad

101
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,640
audiences feel that they were insiders into the adventure, the pursuit.

102
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:55,200
And you know, it was the sense, the Higgs, the God Particle had to be found.

103
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,440
And yet the physicists had moved on to asking some of these questions.

104
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:07,120
And one of the real goals, problems, and I think the back and forth during the, during

105
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,120
the making of the film was how to do that.

106
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,280
And finally, the kind of comic, the 24-7 news cycle, you know, represents that other audience.

107
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,120
And you know, the goal was to kind of have all of you really feel on the inside as part

108
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
of it.

109
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
So.

110
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,360
Well, you succeeded brilliantly in that.

111
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:34,600
And I'd like to bring you in as director and producers to talk a little bit about what

112
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:41,120
did you find to be the greatest challenges in creating such a seamlessly exciting and

113
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
engaging film.

114
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,640
Well, one thing that wasn't a challenge was finding physicists who could explain what

115
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,640
they were working on to ordinary people.

116
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,800
It was the most incredible thing that there were so many scientists who could have been

117
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,640
on this screen because they loved explaining what they were doing.

118
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,920
It was absolutely amazing.

119
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,320
So I would say the big challenge, we have a lot of physicists on the cutting room floor

120
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,640
now because we just couldn't squeeze them in.

121
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,720
But that was not a challenge.

122
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,760
I think the biggest challenge was creating the dramatic arc that would keep everyone sitting

123
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,840
in their seats wanting to know the ending of a scientific question along with the people

124
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,640
in the film.

125
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,840
That is what filmmaking can do at its best, but that is very, very hard to get to.

126
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,480
I would just add to that, what Andrew said, the parallel or the counterpart of this, the

127
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,360
hardest part I think really in the end was how do we incorporate the science and not

128
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,960
lose the audience.

129
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:00,400
And that we knew we had this great dramatic story, we had great characters and a profusion

130
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,760
of characters that was not the issue as Andrew said.

131
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,960
The problem was how do we explain the things that people need to know to understand why

132
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,360
they should be excited and where do we do it.

133
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,560
And the way we did it was basically we initially constructed the film without the science.

134
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,600
And then we put it in at the end as needed.

135
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,080
And so the mantra was just enough just in time.

136
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:30,400
And I think another critical element of that was we essentially came up with a lexicon

137
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
for this film.

138
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,760
And at a certain point we just said, these are the terms we are going to explain and

139
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
these are ones we're not.

140
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,960
And in the end we required a lot of rigorousness to just decide.

141
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,040
And even one example being the multiverse, multiverse physicists use many terms for that

142
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,920
anthropics, multiverse, naturalness, environmental.

143
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,600
And we decided it's going to be the multiverse in this film.

144
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,360
And I literally went back and had people rerecord lines if they didn't use that word.

145
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:10,240
I just want to add that it was part of that challenge was, I don't think there was any

146
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,080
one way that we did that.

147
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,800
I think what Mark just said is it was critical and deciding what concepts to explain, when

148
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,880
to put them in, the kinds of graphics and so forth.

149
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:28,520
But it was also other aspects of audience engagement that I think are particularly relevant for

150
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,440
this audience.

151
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:37,880
What does a character, what qualities of character are needed to foster engagement,

152
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:44,000
identification, engagement of curiosity and the feeling that one really thinks that what

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,120
feels that one is kind of understanding it enough to feel engaged and on the edge of

154
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,960
your seat.

155
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,640
And part of it is certainly the kinds of characters that they were, not only were they really

156
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:01,960
great science explicators, as Andrea says, but very, very authentically who they are

157
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:08,760
and very much I think just it sounds like a cliche, but it's really true, really human.

158
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:16,640
You know, really engaged in a huge pursuit and passionate about it, also having human-scale

159
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,440
ambitions, also being funny and also, you know, so that was really important.

160
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,680
And another was, as we all began through David and through Mark to understand and the two

161
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,840
of us non-scientists, some of the larger stakes, the emotional implications of those

162
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:41,960
stakes, the sense that this could, even though the helium leak that caused this huge hiatus,

163
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:49,640
was a technical, you know, a mistake in the infrastructure, but it did reflect a larger

164
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,800
concern that we had come to understand in the field the sense of what if nothing is

165
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,360
found or what if the Higgs is found and nothing else and a sense that this could be the end

166
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:09,000
of a branch of science and what, because they were so passionate, you know, what that means

167
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,720
for an individual scientist, not only in terms of one's own life's work and legacy, but in

168
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:20,480
terms of, in fact, they're all in it for a larger reason and that this could be a smack

169
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,920
dead end, which of course was a very compelling imaginative concept as well.

170
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:34,880
Hi, yeah, along those lines, one of the devices I really enjoyed was the confessional that

171
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
you had.

172
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,800
So I wanted to hear more about the part where people started to record themselves on webcam,

173
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,520
right, and you had them.

174
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,320
I wanted to hear more about that process, how did you focus on the one, I forget the

175
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,240
experimental girl who really you showed a lot of hers, and was there a difference between

176
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,880
her as an experimental physicist versus a theoretical physicist?

177
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,960
I thought it was really cool and wanted to hear more.

178
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:03,440
We actually stole that idea because a lot of art is imitation except better.

179
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,800
We stole the idea from a film called Baghdad High in which kids in Baghdad were given

180
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:16,200
cameras to record themselves because Westerners couldn't really go there to record what they

181
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,160
wanted to record.

182
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,680
And it seemed like a way, in the beginning it was very tough because we didn't know if

183
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,080
anyone would speak honestly on camera.

184
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,240
And they're all kind of, well, should she wear makeup and she doesn't look very good,

185
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,800
and is she going to later say, this is Monica, I don't want to see myself looking like that.

186
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:42,040
It is just amazing that the scientists really got into recording themselves at critical

187
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
moments.

188
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,120
I mean, we have some moments on camera where you really see people depressed and scared

189
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:57,720
and David recorded himself many, many times including during his tenure decision process

190
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:04,920
and all kinds of, we actually have a wedding that isn't, that on the cutting room floor.

191
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,040
I mean, so the scientists were really into it.

192
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Two weddings.

193
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Two weddings.

194
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:18,080
So, I mean, we were invasive in ways that we wanted to be invasive and we were lucky

195
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,720
that the scientists themselves took on so much of that burden because that's often why

196
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,360
documentaries are not personal as people just don't let you in.

197
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,640
And we had scientists who were willing to let us in.

198
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
It was amazing.

199
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:37,600
I would say just in terms of differences between theorists and experimentalists, yes, experimentalists

200
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,720
did it and the theorists thought about it.

201
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,160
Did I keep a problem on camera when they were talking?

202
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Absolutely, Monica.

203
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,040
You know, she just did it, you know, theorists, I mean, it took a lot of work to get them

204
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
to do anything.

205
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:58,520
Usually, with SAVAS, I'd have to have his student to actually set up the camera.

206
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:05,960
I thought what you did so incredibly well is the background of the images and the implication

207
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,520
that human imagination has been working on this from the beginning.

208
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,960
The mandala shapes that you used and there's all these alchemical images of the world that

209
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,240
are so much like the images that you used.

210
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,280
But the question is, it wasn't God particle a term that was used in a derogatory way by

211
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,000
someone who was mocking the Higgs boson.

212
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,200
I mean, it wasn't the physicists who were looking for it.

213
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,080
It was somebody who was commenting on it.

214
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,920
It was a physicist, actually.

215
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:43,000
A wonderful story is that, beyond Letterman, who is an experimentalist, he wrote a book

216
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,960
and he had proposed the title, The God Particle.

217
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,480
He actually wanted to call it The God Damn Particle.

218
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,480
The publishers said that that was not acceptable.

219
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,360
Physicists don't like the term, as we've said, because of the associations.

220
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:14,560
We tried to give that impression as well from a filmmaking perspective and publicists side.

221
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,800
It's great.

222
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:29,240
Were there any regrets expressed by Texas or otherwise for not moving forth with this?

223
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:35,280
I mean, this obviously seems to me the internet was associated with the creation and there

224
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:43,320
was certainly a lot of economic activity that had been lost to Texas, for instance.

225
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,920
We actually shot quite a bit more in Laxahatchee.

226
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,360
We had actually, it's also on the cutting room floor, we had a lot of things down there.

227
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:57,040
I went down there with David and actually filmed him seeing it for the first time.

228
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,640
The images you see are real, actually.

229
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,760
It's very sad.

230
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,640
When I was doing the location scouting, I was just driving around and right near where

231
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,840
the collider was, there was this tiny little town.

232
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,760
It's just the quintessential little one street dusty town.

233
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,360
We went in the cafe, I went in the cafe before we started shooting for lunch.

234
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,880
I started talking to the owner and I said what I was doing and he walks over and on this

235
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:34,800
top shelf, he pulls down this baseball cap and dusts it off and it says, Waxahatchee future

236
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,240
home of the SSC.

237
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,560
And there was a real poignancy to it.

238
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,720
They thought this was going to be it.

239
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,320
This would have been the center of the world, basically.

240
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
People had moved down there.

241
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,200
I know physicists who moved down to Waxahatchee who had been living there and they had quit

242
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,120
their other jobs or they had gone down there.

243
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,440
They had moved, they had set up their families there.

244
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,480
When it was canceled, it was a huge blow.

245
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,920
A number of them left physics.

246
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,240
It was actually one of the first emphasis to go to Wall Street.

247
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,560
I know a couple in particular that did at that point.

248
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,960
So it was a huge blow.

249
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,800
We showed the film, it's shown in Texas, I was at the USA Film Festival down there in

250
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,080
Dallas.

251
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,560
And we're kicking themselves.

252
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:36,480
One thing that's very interesting is that the country that's building the collider that's

253
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,920
going to be three times as big as this one is probably China.

254
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,600
The idea that you have these experiments and that attracts the best minds from all over

255
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:55,400
the world to work in your country is something that, we would like to see that come back

256
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
to America.

257
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:04,120
That was a little underlying theme in our goals in terms of making this film.

258
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:11,480
That it could be a real national, the idea that we would get a country sort of craving

259
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,200
for more science education was certainly something we thought about.

260
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:34,880
I don't know about that.

261
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,760
I know that there's talk of different ways of doing it.

262
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,880
The fundamental question is, do you make a linear collider, just slam things into each

263
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,960
other or into a target or do you have the circular one?

264
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,560
And the technology is, it's all about, the biggest challenge technologically is keeping

265
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,840
these things going in a circle.

266
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,960
Things want to go in straight lines and it takes more and more energy to keep them going.

267
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:14,080
It's a balance in terms of the larger you are, the larger the radius of curvature, the

268
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,440
less energy you need.

269
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,600
On the other hand, it's bigger and it takes a lot more space.

270
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:26,120
They always have a trade-off between those two elements.

271
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:36,800
In terms of the Watsuhatchee footage, it was something of a debate within our team.

272
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:46,760
Clearly that decision was, in terms of science education advocacy, the film could have emphasized

273
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,600
that a lot more.

274
00:21:48,600 --> 00:22:00,080
It's certainly as a nation we are very aware of the topical relevance of that.

275
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,040
I think the way that it ended up being there was just the right one in terms of the vision

276
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,800
of the film makers.

277
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:15,800
Of course, one of the hopes is that excitement about scientific discovery and the education

278
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,480
that is needed, the resources that are needed to accomplish that at every level is really

279
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,640
important.

280
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,640
It was not the vision of the film makers to be advocacy film per se and that this could

281
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,920
be a jumping off point and we certainly are hopeful and laying some of the groundwork

282
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
for that.

283
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:39,680
That is one of those decisions and it was interesting that important.

284
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:55,360
I went two weeks ago to the Brookhaven National Labs to the NSLS-2, the inauguration of the

285
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:04,120
10,000 times brighter light that Brookhaven has now, which costs $912 million of taxpayer

286
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,360
dollars and is free available to various countries and so forth.

287
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,440
I read the comments to the article that I wrote subsequently and many of the people

288
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,840
who commented were furious that it wasn't built by a private industry rather than by

289
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,400
government money.

290
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,800
I found that crazy because I think these kinds of things can't really be done comfortably

291
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
by private industry.

292
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:36,440
The same is certainly not really comfortably done by individual businesses in a coalition.

293
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,200
I was wondering if that was exceptional.

294
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:47,440
That the comments that I got that this was unholy or somehow improper was typical of

295
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,000
what kind of reaction people might have had, not this audience obviously, to the film and

296
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,720
the money that was spent for the film and showing what you showed.

297
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,960
We haven't had that reaction.

298
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,560
I think it's interesting, one of the things about this is, and about the SSC, is I think

299
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:20,040
that this also is a good example or it really points to the future that experiments of this

300
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,160
order are not going to be able to be done for the most part by a single country.

301
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:31,120
A lot of people would say that one of the problems with the SSC was that it was so US

302
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,960
controlled and so US centric and there were other people in the physics community that

303
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
objected.

304
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,920
And within the US, there's a lot of debate about whether the physicists themselves jeopardized

305
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,960
it because of all their debates about where it should be.

306
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,480
In Chicago or from the lab they wanted it there.

307
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,680
There was a big push to have it in California out at Stanford.

308
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
And there was Texas.

309
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,520
Why did Texas win?

310
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,240
The physics community come together and support it and in the way it should have.

311
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,560
There's a lot of debate about that.

312
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,800
And it was very much run by the US.

313
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:13,560
And I think there are a lot of people that feel that in the end it had to be an international

314
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,800
collaboration and anything in the future is going to be because they are so expensive.

315
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
It's going to require that.

316
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,360
And I actually think that's a great thing.

317
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,320
I think it should not be a nationalistic thing.

318
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:29,440
And I think that in some sense is the point of the film is that it shows that that's why

319
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,920
CERN was created.

320
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,080
CERN was created in the 50s in the aftermath of the war expressly for the peaceful pursuit

321
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:43,360
of science, no military research and all these countries who had been formerly, very formerly,

322
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,760
very recently formerly fighting in some cases are united.

323
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:55,240
And so I think it's very appropriately a government funded international collaboration.

324
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:04,920
Regarding the SSC, some of us have heard that the reason it was canceled is that President

325
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:12,360
Clinton at the time made an offer to the governor of Texas and Richards that they could either

326
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:22,040
expand NASA, the space program, or continue with the SSC and Governor Richards decided

327
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,080
that NASA is more appealing to public sentiment.

328
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:33,920
They could put on a bigger splash with NASA, which is more easily understood than particle

329
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,080
physics.

330
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:41,720
Did you, in your research, did you find out, is this a true story or is this just rumored

331
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,520
that it was a political decision that was made?

332
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:51,600
And in fact, Stephen Weinberg, who's at the University of Texas, said that he kicked himself

333
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,600
for not getting more involved in fighting for the SSC.

334
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,720
I've heard this.

335
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,080
I did not find out anything more about it.

336
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,400
I mean, you know, Clinton's role in it has been debated.

337
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,680
In the end, he did come out for it, but he did not express the strongest support.

338
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,560
People do criticize him for not having expressed the strongest support initially, whether he

339
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,400
had some deal with Anne Richards.

340
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,560
I don't know that.

341
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,160
It was certainly political.

342
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:29,600
I think that most physicists now blame themselves that at a fundamental level, they did not

343
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,480
communicate to the public why this was important, as opposed to something like the space station

344
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,760
or something like that.

345
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,520
But I do feel like we've seen a reflection of that.

346
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:46,600
Even at CERN, they are incredibly supportive of all sorts of outreach and media and things

347
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
like this.

348
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,160
So, you know, and that's something that was motivating all of us as well.

349
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,920
Other question?

350
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,920
I'd like to actually ask a naive question on my part, perhaps.

351
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:08,000
Is there a possibility that with higher energy colliders that other candidates for the Higgs

352
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,760
could be discovered?

353
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,000
In other words, this thing is sitting right in the middle.

354
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:23,720
Is it possible that if a particle at 115 or at 140, MEV turns up that this would challenge

355
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,720
the conclusion that this particle is the horizon?

356
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,960
It wouldn't erase this one.

357
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:37,520
So, you know, as the Higgs, you know, I think there are theories that have other more than

358
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,320
one Higgs and even in supersymmetry.

359
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,760
So there could be other particles.

360
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,360
You know what physicists really, you know, they hedge their bets a little.

361
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,480
They say it's a Higgs-like particle.

362
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,280
And what that means and is true and that we know is why it's unique is it has certain

363
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,520
internal properties that a Higgs has.

364
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,320
Particularly, it's a scalar, what's called a scalar vector boson.

365
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:06,240
And that has to do with internal spin symmetry and other internal characteristics, which we

366
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,600
had never seen before.

367
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,440
So we know this is a particle that has properties we have never seen before and are consistent

368
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,920
with the Higgs.

369
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,000
Could there be others?

370
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,640
Yes, there could.

371
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,480
I don't think anybody thinks there'll be at lower masses.

372
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,360
I think that, you know, they really feel they've sort of explored that, but could it be at

373
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,360
higher?

374
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
Yeah.

375
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,800
I mean, they would love to find something and they would love to find something that doesn't

376
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
fit.

377
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,960
I mean, that would be the greatest discovery of all.

378
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,640
This is also a totally naive question, but what does it mean to see the Higgs boson?

379
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Because we don't see them seeing.

380
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,800
That's a very good question.

381
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,600
That's not a naive question.

382
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,920
Yes, you actually never really do see the Higgs.

383
00:29:51,920 --> 00:30:00,320
I mean, as with most of these things, the Higgs itself lasts so short amount of time,

384
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,200
but immediately decays into certain things.

385
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:12,480
And so, I mean, if you take a very simple macroscopic thing, you know, neutrons are

386
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,200
not infinitely stable.

387
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,440
They actually decay into a proton, electron, and a tree.

388
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:24,200
And the theory tells you what could be the different processes that a Higgs could decay

389
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
into.

390
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
There's different pathways.

391
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,480
There's different channels, they call them.

392
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,520
It could decay into a certain number of photons.

393
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,960
It could decay into a certain number of electrons or other types of leptons.

394
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:43,600
And so, what you're really looking for are the signatures of a process that could be

395
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,680
the Higgs that don't match anything else.

396
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,960
But that's a really incredibly difficult thing to see because there's trillions of collisions

397
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,040
happening and all these other things are decaying as well.

398
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:00,560
And so, this is what, essentially, this is what experimentalists do in analysis is.

399
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,480
They try to look at all the different pathways and correlate the ones that, you know, would

400
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,720
match because they match the energy of what was coming in and they matched these other

401
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
internal properties.

402
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,240
Okay, no, these are all things that we know, but these two things coming out here, they

403
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,200
don't really match with anything else, but they're consistent with what our theory says

404
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,760
the Higgs could decay in this way to be.

405
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,000
That's what they're looking for.

406
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,360
Okay, so you've kind of touched upon this a little bit, but I was wondering if you could

407
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,440
go a little bit more in depth in the feedback and the reception you've been receiving with

408
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,080
the film, has there been any more discussions being sparked in the physics community about

409
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,160
outreach or science advocacy in education?

410
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm curious in that aspect.

411
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,480
The physics community has totally embraced it, which is absolutely really, really satisfying.

412
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,800
I mean, you know, obviously David, of course, in some sense, had the biggest stake of all

413
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:08,040
because he still has to face all of his colleagues and, you know, they really, you know, I think

414
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:13,160
trusted us in a sense to tell the story, but we were worried, for sure, you know, would

415
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,800
they really be comfortable with it?

416
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,360
And they have totally embraced it.

417
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,760
I mean, for them, it's become their anthem in some sense.

418
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,400
In fact, it's CERN now.

419
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,880
They've told us CERN has a little souvenir store outside of their thing, and they want

420
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,800
to make particle fever like they're definitive DVD at CERN.

421
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:39,840
And in a deeper way, the symbol of the standard model, the circular image with the Higgs

422
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,600
at the center, this didn't exist in the physics community.

423
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,760
Walter Murch came up with us, our editor.

424
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,240
And you know, their representations were like these odd charts and the Higgs was sticking

425
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
off here.

426
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,160
They did not really get the parallels in the symmetry.

427
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,360
And Walter became obsessed with something that was symmetric and that placed the Higgs

428
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,200
right in the center, which is where it should be for our film, but also for this standard

429
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,440
model.

430
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,240
And it has been completely embraced by the physics community.

431
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,480
And they now want to make it like their symbol.

432
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,000
And so NEMA was wearing a t-shirt with it at some physics conference, and everybody went

433
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,520
wild, and they were blogging about it, and they want to put it on their mugs and things

434
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
like that.

435
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,520
But that's pretty much being embraced by the physics community, I'd say.

436
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
You can all lie down two lines.

437
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,520
On the website, that's right.

438
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:36,520
But I just wanted to add to that.

439
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,960
Certainly the film has gotten great reviews.

440
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,880
And if you look at Metacritic, if you've timed, Zellite times and all of that, I mean, I think

441
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,840
that it really did succeed at what was the goal to cross over from being a science doc

442
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,400
to being a doc that was really received broadly.

443
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,720
That said, it wasn't easy.

444
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,920
And the process of the making of it, the decision making in terms of getting it out there, we

445
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,200
have had our lumps and bumps.

446
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:13,240
I mean, in many ways, it sort of paralleled the topic of the film itself in terms of successes

447
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
and failures.

448
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:23,560
But it's certainly the fact of the nature of it probably limited to some degree how many

449
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,680
people in the academy saw it, for instance, in that kind of thing.

450
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,840
But it certainly has had and continues to have.

451
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,600
We're very proud that it is, I think, the second highest grossing doc of 2014.

452
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,680
And it was really distributed in a not in a traditional way because we couldn't get the

453
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,560
attention of agents.

454
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,800
So that's, and we certainly are intending, the educational distribution is beginning,

455
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:58,360
and we certainly are intending to make the distribution and also the outreach impact,

456
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:04,680
which can go in many, many directions as strong as it possibly can be.

457
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:14,520
The film has a science curriculum that was created for it so that teachers can use it

458
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,520
in the classroom.

459
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:24,960
And right from the beginning, we thought about how the film would have an impact, specifically

460
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,920
would have an impact on the teaching of science because we thought the story was so inspirational

461
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,560
to young people because young people could perhaps picture themselves if they weren't

462
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
there.

463
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,040
I think I always thought science was just being a theorist and you had to be Einstein

464
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,000
or physics was.

465
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,680
And when you see Monica talking about her heart, her heart, and her boots and how she's

466
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:54,640
doing wiring, putting little wires together, I think that certainly for me broadened my

467
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,480
sense of, and also that it was so collaborative, which was something I never really thought

468
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
about.

469
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,200
So we thought the film would be very inspirational to young people.

470
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,640
And David was involved in something called QuarkNet, which actually trains high school

471
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:17,360
teachers to get their kids to analyze actual data sheets.

472
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,640
And there are, I don't remember, 4,000 how many QuarkNet teachers were there?

473
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,000
There were a lot.

474
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,680
And so we already were thinking right from the beginning, could high school students

475
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:35,080
see this, could college students see it, could it play in science type societies like the

476
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:40,640
Society of Mechanical Engineering or whatever, these are all over the country.

477
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:48,720
And we gave a presentation at a major conference for science museums and technology centers.

478
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,640
And that was right even before, I mean we barely had a trailer at that point, but we

479
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,520
really care about the film getting out there.

480
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:03,080
So if any of you have or attached to organizations that might want to show this for any reason,

481
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:08,600
yes, we really care about that kind of alternative distribution.

482
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,720
I'm a totally person and my mind is just going all over the place.

483
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,080
And I have a twofold question that I could ask sit here and ask you like 100 questions.

484
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,560
But when did you come up with the idea of doing this film, how long did it take you

485
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,480
to do this film?

486
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,680
And the other question is when they actually had the collisions, you know, at the first

487
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,080
time around when the helium leaked, there was this areas that they didn't consider,

488
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:45,240
right, of the consequences of other things that had to do that were part of the environment

489
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,160
that would create the collision, would allow the collision to happen.

490
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,280
But when the actual collisions did in fact take place, what were the consequences?

491
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,600
I mean the explosions that they just contained, was there a fear that there could be like

492
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:07,320
a really big like accident or, yeah, it's like what was the, you know, because the media

493
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,600
plays it up, it's like the black hole and we're going to disappear.

494
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,640
But was there actually a fear of, oh God, did we not consider something and this could

495
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,440
go really, really wrong and how, I mean, what were the implications of that?

496
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,080
Okay, I'll start, I think at the beginning, which is the beginning, how the film started.

497
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,280
The film started in the mind of David Kaplan.

498
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:37,240
A theorist who had a theory that a film about this thing turning on could be dramatic and

499
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,240
exciting and interesting.

500
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,560
And you know, David says, you know, probably as early as 2006, he was, you know, always

501
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,000
telling his family and friends as things going to turn on and it's going to be amazing,

502
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
amazing, amazing.

503
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,760
And somebody said, you know, okay, stop talking about it, you know, you should do something

504
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,360
and you know, he thought about writing, but that wasn't really right.

505
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:59,080
And then he thought about trying to film something and he actually, I think, did try

506
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,880
to film something and he famously filmed something with a Shelley Clash Owl, a famous

507
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,200
physicist and had no sound.

508
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,320
And I heard about him.

509
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,040
I was in the narrative fiction world and was actually trying to get a script made.

510
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:20,640
And you know, I was always interested in somehow doing something in film that related to science.

511
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,560
I thought it was going to come from the fictional world.

512
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,320
I thought I would write something about science.

513
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,400
And I heard about this guy trying to make a documentary about this and the people who

514
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,440
told me about it said, okay, he has no film experience.

515
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
It's an experiment.

516
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
They don't know if it's going to work.

517
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,440
They don't know if they'll find anything.

518
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,920
We're not going to get involved.

519
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,880
And I said, that sounds great.

520
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,040
And I met David in 2007.

521
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,160
So I heard about it.

522
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
He was in CERN.

523
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,880
I tracked him down.

524
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,400
And we talked about it.

525
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,920
For me, I was very clear from the beginning.

526
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,080
I did not want to make a typical science documentary.

527
00:39:54,080 --> 00:40:00,920
I wanted to use the narrative skills that I had in filmmaking, make a character based,

528
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,720
try to make a dramatic film.

529
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,640
And that's what David wanted as well.

530
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,400
So I started really working on it full time in 2008.

531
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,360
We started trying to get together.

532
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,440
Andrew and Carla came on.

533
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,360
We started to try to get some money together.

534
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:25,840
The first shoot was in 2008 in September for first beam.

535
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:36,720
We finished literally running to the airport with the film in 2013, in June of 2013.

536
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:44,920
In terms of the explosion, yes, there was a lot of sensationalists talk about could

537
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,320
it create a mini black hole that would destroy the universe?

538
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,880
No physicist was ever worried about this.

539
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,240
The person who was the biggest promoter of this was a high school science teacher in

540
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:02,040
Hawaii who had read part of a paper that said that it could create little black holes but

541
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,760
did not read the rest of the paper, which said that if it created these black holes,

542
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,520
they would evaporate.

543
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,600
Nonetheless, it got so much attention that CERN felt they had to address it.

544
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,960
And they actually had two very respected theorists go through all the calculations to show that

545
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,840
it was not going to be an issue.

546
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,960
In terms of the accident, when the accident happened, they were not doing collisions.

547
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,560
They were still first beams.

548
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,720
They were just getting beams in one direction and the other.

549
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:35,920
And in fact, the accident happened when they were just testing raising the energy of one

550
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,320
of the beams.

551
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,560
And they were trying to raise the energy and they needed to increase the energy and the

552
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,720
magnets to be able to keep them in line.

553
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:52,480
And what they believe now is that there was just as they increased the current in these

554
00:41:52,480 --> 00:42:01,200
magnets, one of the welds broke and it sparked and it caught the helium which is used to

555
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
cool it.

556
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,840
You know, it ignited that and it exploded.

557
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,800
There were it had nothing to do with collisions, particles or anything like that at all.

558
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,720
It was a very simple bed weld that did that.

559
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:21,560
The collisions themselves take place in the center of the detectors and there's no worry

560
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,040
that they're going to, they want them to explode in a sense.

561
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,720
You know, that's the whole point.

562
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,720
There's no concern.

563
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,400
And from the physics community, there was never any concern that they were going to

564
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,800
do anything that could create a problem.

565
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:43,600
I also just added in terms of some of the happy accidents or making your lock or jumping

566
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,800
from failure to failure which I think, you know, all of them are different ways of saying

567
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:53,560
it's only a letter to expressions, you know, that if you're in it for the long run and

568
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,160
you believe in it, that you just keep going and good things happen in some way, I think

569
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,760
that there are great backstories that, you know, partly speak to what documentaries

570
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:13,360
are making like this is about and to this particular subject and the people who do it.

571
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:19,760
One of them is that we really, we started to raise money for it just as the financial

572
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,840
world was melting down.

573
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:31,800
And it turned out that we reached out in different ways and it was actually people in the finance

574
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:41,420
world who were trained physicists or mathematicians and who still had some love of it and we

575
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:46,840
sent out a bunch of cold letters and, you know, one or two people actually opened them, you

576
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:52,200
know, and remembered back to, you know, and got excited and that started a ball rolling

577
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,200
that really enabled us to do the initial shooting.

578
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,280
And once we got a certain ball rolling, it was easier to raise money both in terms of

579
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,600
investment and in terms of philanthropic and foundation dollars.

580
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:16,040
Another, this film could have gone in so many directions and that period during the hiatus

581
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,320
when the machine had had the accident and was being repaired, which was over 18 months,

582
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:27,320
there was a great, there was certainly some depression and some sense of what does this

583
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,160
mean and we're ever going to get it up again and all those issues.

584
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,640
But there's also a great deal of natural abolions and curiosity and kind of a, you know, sort

585
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,360
of energizer bunny, you know, we would like, you know, David would say, David and Mark,

586
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,840
you know, there's something we really should film.

587
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,080
This may be a way to get it at a new way to analyze the data.

588
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,840
It's going on at NYU where there's a dark matter experiment.

589
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:57,640
The results of the American are going to be described at a conference in Santa Barbara

590
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:03,360
and we have some great footage which eventually is going to be put to use but really does reflect

591
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:08,480
a very natural buoyancy on the part of the scientists, the theorists.

592
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,600
Then there's the elephant in the room in which we have spoken about Mark did but which is

593
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:21,640
that at a certain point we really could, the science was becoming too difficult for the

594
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:29,760
first editor to really address in a way that the film we were kind of stalled and through,

595
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,640
well, really through Mark's long-term friendship with the brilliant feature editor Walter

596
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:42,960
March, he came in and really started to cut the film in a very different way in a more

597
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,320
kind of action film way and then we had, we never anticipated, we'd have the million

598
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:56,000
dollar ending within the course of our shooting and so there is all of those things together

599
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,200
with the characters and the sense of the story and the way we shot I think all combined

600
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:09,800
to have made it something that is of such broad interest to non-science audiences.

601
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:19,840
Do you have any of the cutting room for stuff? On DVD do you have any of the outtakes?

602
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:25,280
Well, we actually don't really have a DVD yet but in principle it will, yes, I mean it

603
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:32,720
is online so there's, I mean I, it's difficult to estimate exactly how much footage I have

604
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:39,200
but I mean it's in the neighborhood of 300, 400 hours of material and you know it's 99

605
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:46,480
minutes so there is a lot that's out of it. Some very complete fairly well edited sequences,

606
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,680
one of them has definitely been cut and is available online, I mean actually on our website

607
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:57,880
right now you can order sort of an enhanced download that includes that and a couple of

608
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:04,040
other things and we're hoping that there will be some additional things as well. Some of

609
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:11,840
them really were fairly, you know, pretty progressed fairly far in terms of the cutting

610
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:25,280
and we do hope that we'll be able to use them. Particlefever.com, www.particlefever.com.

611
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,520
Could you say more about how you convinced Sharon to let you in? I mean why did they

612
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:36,480
allow you to come in to do this whole project? You know it's interesting, it was not that

613
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,360
difficult, people have asked me that and I actually know some people that said that they

614
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:50,240
had difficulty. In general they're pretty open, I think we had a special access partly

615
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:56,040
because of our physics backgrounds, that they were very open in that regard and the interesting

616
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:04,080
thing was people would typically come over and their news crews that would come over

617
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,320
and they shoot for a day or two and they shoot certain people and they disappear. The fact

618
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:14,760
that I kept going back became the key and that I made certain key alliances right from

619
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:20,400
the very first time I was there and so typically when you go to CERN, if you go as a media

620
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:30,000
for media purposes, they assign you a sort of coordinator who's there and after the first

621
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,480
time I was there they stopped coming with me because they basically knew who I was going

622
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,600
to see. I was seeing very responsible people and at that point all I had to do was say

623
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:47,080
I'm coming at this point and they'd say okay we'll leave you a pass and then I just would

624
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:54,640
go wherever I wanted. And so again I think it was a function of the fact that I had key

625
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,480
people involved that they knew were responsible and then I kept coming back again and again

626
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,920
and again and in fact I came back so much that at a certain point I think people thought

627
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,280
I worked there actually. They didn't realize that I didn't actually live there all the

628
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:16,280
time but I was really so integrated that nobody even paid any attention when I was there and

629
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:22,200
that really ended up being what counted. And for our physicists I think that also when

630
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:30,120
talk to them why they opened up to us so much was they also saw the persistence there. They

631
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,680
knew that I was going to be back again and so if they didn't say it then I'm going to

632
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,520
get them to say it another time so they might as well just do it and they ended up really

633
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:47,400
being an incredible ally to the whole thing. Not only the physicists but CERN itself has

634
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:54,400
an extensive media department and they do all these official things they film everything

635
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,720
and they got very excited by the fact that I was making a feature film. I mean I actually

636
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:03,600
don't know which was more important whether I had a physics background or whether I had

637
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:09,480
worked on the talented Mr. Ripley which they all seemed to love. And the fact that they

638
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:17,920
had this film part to me was something they hadn't really dealt with before and so they

639
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:25,480
were very open to that and they would collaborate. And so the media department they loved the

640
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,240
idea that somebody was making a real feature film and they became in a sense a second and

641
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:35,760
third unit for me. We ourselves were usually just very small crew but I could have them

642
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,080
cover other things for me and they all put it together.

643
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:48,760
There's a bigger question involved I think which is that we always pitch the film as

644
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:56,400
what if there have been cameras inside Los Alamos. And I think we all wanted to know

645
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:02,520
as filmmakers but we thought that the public would want to hear what were the inside discussions

646
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:08,400
were there moral questions the question of how many scientists believe in God or do they

647
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,840
not believe in God or what do they believe in and what do they think they're doing what

648
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:19,440
is the beauty in it for them. That was something that I think we were very aware of going in

649
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,360
and I think that the scientists both in the university settings and its CERN itself also

650
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:33,080
they wanted mark there. They wanted people to hear them talking about some of those bigger

651
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:39,280
questions that they know they share with everybody else.

652
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,680
Do you have an upcoming project or a future project that you're working on or you're

653
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,080
primarily working on marketing and distributing this film?

654
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:55,120
I actually am working on another project and it's fiction but it's actually interesting

655
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:01,880
because as Andrew says we talked about it being Los Alamos for me people have said what do

656
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,640
you want to do. If somebody said if I had all the money in the world what would I do as

657
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,520
my next documentary and I said well it's not about our money I'd like to go back into

658
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,120
time and I'd like to go back to when Watson and Crick discovered DNA and I think that's

659
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,720
another place where it would have been great to have cameras and it turns out that there's

660
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,440
a book that I'm really interested in called the Goldbug Variations if anybody's heard

661
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:32,600
about it by Richard Powers. It is about molecular biology and music and so this art science

662
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:39,920
overlap is very dear to me and it turns out that the rights became available and so that's

663
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,560
going to be my next project I hope.

664
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:48,880
Carla and I have four documentaries that will come out this year including there's one on

665
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:56,880
Tuesday night at the at Lincoln Center it's called the Zionist idea and this shows our

666
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:05,840
crazy curiosity goes in so many directions. It's a look at the evolving definition of

667
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:12,360
Jewish statehood from the 19th century through to the present. We're also doing a film on

668
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:18,600
mental health services in the military called Thank You for Your Service which unusually

669
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:26,520
takes the in part takes the point of view of the psychiatrists and psychiatrists and

670
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:31,840
psychologists who actually work within the military and they went up to the highest levels

671
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:37,280
including a female general who was head of all mental health services there. We have

672
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,880
a film about a historic film about Gertrude Bell that will probably come out in the fall

673
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:50,040
who is an explorer British explorer and diplomat who drew the original borders of Iraq and

674
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:57,840
we're also working on a film about wind power offshore wind power and the struggle to make

675
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:04,240
it happen in the state of New Jersey. A real advocacy film for a change.

676
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:10,840
Please join me in thanking Andrew, Carla and Mark not only for their generous time today

677
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:18,560
but for creating a really brilliantly inspiring film that I think from our perspective of

678
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:37,280
the helix center is sort of the quintessence of fusing art and science.
