1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Now I'd like to introduce today's participants.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,280
And as I say your name, if you could just raise your hand

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,400
so the audience can identify you.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,720
Sarah Dammers, the Horace D. Taft Associate Professor

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,600
of Physics at Yale University, is a particle physicist

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,840
who studies the fundamental particles and forces of nature.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,960
Her recent work has focused on the characterization

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,800
of the Higgs boson and the measurement

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,800
of tau polarization with the Atlas collaboration,

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,560
as many of you saw in the film.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,440
It turns large Hadron Collider.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,840
She received her bachelor's degree from Harvard University

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,240
and her PhD from the University of Rochester.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,640
She was a postdoctoral researcher

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,080
with Stanford's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,200
before joining Yale's faculty in 2009.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,360
While at Yale she has received an early career award grant

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,760
from the Department of Energy

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,080
and the Yale Provost Teaching Award.

20
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,560
She also collaborates with professional dancer, writer,

21
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,000
and director of the Yale Dance Studies curriculum, Emily Coates.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
She encodes, co-teach, a physics of dance class together

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,680
at Yale and are writing a course book under contract

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,440
with Yale University Press.

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,640
They've created an art science film called The Three Views

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,840
of the Higgs and Dance.

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,320
Mark Levinson, before embarking on his film career,

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,640
earned a doctoral degree in theoretical particle physics

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,960
from the University of California at Berkeley.

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,840
In the film world he became a specialist in ADR, working

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,200
with actors and directors in post production

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,600
to write and record additional dialogue.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,440
He has worked closely with such directors as Anthony Mengella,

34
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,480
an English patient, talented Mr. Ripley, Cold Mountain,

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,960
Francis Ford Coppola, the Rainmaker, Milosz Foreman,

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,080
Goya's Ghost, Sean Penn, The Pledge, and David Fincher,

37
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,280

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,440
He is the writer, producer, director of the narrative

39
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,400

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,040
of former Russian dissident artists

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,960
after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and had an acclaimed

42
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,760
premier at the Moscow International Film Festival.

43
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,800
And as many of you saw, he directed the award winning

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,800
documentary feature Particle Fever.

45
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,840

as president of the Society of American Historians,

72
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,760
and worked as a consultant, as oral historian,

73
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,840

Coleman Center for Scholars and Writers

76
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,000
at the New York Public Library.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
Now we'll begin.

78
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,840
Maybe that film was absolutely fantastic,

79
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,200
and there's a moment when they've done it, at least,

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,560
we think they've done it.

81
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,480
They've found the Higgs boson.

82
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,120
And Savas, if anybody hasn't seen it,

83
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,320
maybe you can explain more exactly what it is.

84
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,600
But he says this little speech that made me cry,

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,440
probably you as well from watching it,

86
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,520
about how astonishing it is.

87
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,520
That humanity, that people with our little brains

88
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,800
can figure out things like this,

89
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,640
that we want to understand the world

90
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,400
and the universe we live in, and we can.

91
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,560
At least so you probably remember that scene better

92
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,320
than I've just described it.

93
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,200
You know, Savas was such a gift to us.

94
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
I mean, it's just like everything he said

95
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,880
was like a Greek philosopher.

96
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,600
I mean, and yeah, that line, I mean, you know,

97
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,400
really in some sense it also reflects

98
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,480
what really attracted me to physics initially.

99
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,480
I mean, this fact that there seems to be,

100
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,560
first of all, that there's any laws of nature at all.

101
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,760
I mean, there's any laws of nature at all,

102
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,520
that they're describable by mathematics.

103
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,560
Mathematics is a language that we've invented

104
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,640
and we understand this is the biggest mystery of all.

105
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,160
I mean, that there didn't have to be order

106
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,680
that we could comprehend.

107
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,320
And the fact that we come up with this,

108
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,000
you know, humans have come up with this invention,

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
this mathematical thing that actually describes

110
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,520
physical nature and the LHC, an extreme example

111
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,760
of very abstract theories and then this huge machine

112
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,200
that Sarah works on comes up with a bump

113
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,280
that corresponds to it.

114
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,440
I think it really is the thing that is the most magnificent

115
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,440
thing and representative of an absolute peak

116
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,840
in human achievement.

117
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,960
I found it fascinating.

118
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,160
The scientist is trying to find a vocabulary

119
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,680
to speak about this and the vocabulary coming

120
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,760
from philosophy, from literature.

121
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,560
I found it very moving that scientists speak

122
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,480
of a beautiful formula, a beautiful discovery.

123
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,120
What does that mean to a scientist?

124
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,920
I think that from my perspective,

125
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,800
the scientists are human beings

126
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,680
and so we think in these terms, right?

127
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,520
It's interesting that there's been a divide

128
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,600
between what people think of as the scientific brain

129
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,360
that's operating and the artistic brain that's operating.

130
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,400
I mean, I think it's natural to use that kind of language

131
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,280
to describe something that you're excited about.

132
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,120
It's wonderful to see it, to see it spoken,

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,520
to hear it spoken.

134
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,520
I think that the excitement or the miraculous discovery

135
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,080
of the Higgs, it's the amazing fact

136
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,120
that we can make that kind of progress

137
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,120
is just firmly planted in the context of the lack

138
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,120
of understanding in general that we have, right?

139
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,400
That keeps that discovery at perspective.

140
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,160
So as a practicing scientist,

141
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,720
thinking about the Higgs and that achievement,

142
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,560
as thrilling as it is and as much of a peak as it is,

143
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,560
it's in this incredible valley with the 97%,

144
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,960
94% of the universe that we don't understand,

145
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,760
these huge mysteries, right?

146
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,600
So it is very exciting and fascinating for me

147
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,080
to think about that progress,

148
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,760
but it's in that context of just a tremendous amount

149
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,800
that we don't understand.

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,240
It's not clear if we have a framework

151
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,840
that will let us make further progress in the same way.

152
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,680
For the next step.

153
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,520
Yeah, and it's true.

154
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,040
And I think that was one of the things that gave us

155
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,520
some confidence that hopefully there would be people

156
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,040
interested because we could touch these big issues.

157
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,920
And these are issues that anybody can understand

158
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
and anybody can appreciate.

159
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
You know, the details,

160
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,480
and look, we made the decision very early on,

161
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,160
this is not gonna be the film that explains

162
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,640
all the detailed physics,

163
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,440
but in some sense, we're gonna go for the big things.

164
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,920
And the big issues,

165
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,240
which are things that anybody has,

166
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,440
you know, that we hoped anybody of any intellectual curiosity

167
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,880
would be interested in, curiosity.

168
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,400
I mean, I think it's amazing,

169
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,240
you've written this book,

170
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:38,160
because I think that's another one of S

171
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,280
Grecise's great lines.

172
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,080
When he's saying, you know, why do we do this?

173
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,800
You know, and he thinks about these things

174
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,480
for no reason, for no reason.

175
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,600
I mean, and you know, he ties it in with this issue of,

176
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
you know, there's no evolutionary value,

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,480
and but what is the basis of it?

178
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,080
Is a curiosity, and once you have it, you can't forget it.

179
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,400
I mean, you must explore a lot more in your book.

180
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Well, I try to look at the questions that we ask.

181
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,320
I think that the questions are so much more interesting

182
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,640
than any answers that we can give,

183
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,840
and what interested me in the film was that even

184
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,400
with the discovery of the Higgs particle,

185
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,160
you don't have an answer.

186
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,120
You simply have more questions.

187
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,760
You have another set of questions.

188
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,320
And I'm always interested in the fact that we come

189
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,480
from whatever vocabularies we have,

190
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,360
and we apply the vocabulary to the world that we're seeing,

191
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,880
because we have to remember that the universe

192
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,160
is totally uncaring, the universe is not conscious of its laws,

193
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,000
or what we do with them, or where we are.

194
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So these are questions that we bring to our state of being

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,320
and to the universe around us.

196
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,760
Even these words are invented by us.

197
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,560
So we invent the story, and then we ask, how does this happen?

198
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,600
What is the initial impulse to understand something

199
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,080
or to work it out?

200
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,920
That's the deep question, in a sense.

201
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,640
And similarly related to the art issue,

202
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,680
what is it that prompted the first person to draw

203
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,760
a representation of the world on a cave?

204
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
I mean, animals don't do that.

205
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,640
I mean, that they would think that we could abstract,

206
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,640
it's an abstract symbolic representation of the world

207
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,000
around them.

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,840
Was it motivated for informational purposes?

209
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,600
Was it just, is it something intrinsic in us

210
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,560
that we just want to represent something?

211
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,520
And I do think that there's a very direct line

212
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,560
to what MIMA is doing on the board,

213
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,200
and we'll achieve very much.

214
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,680
There's a beautiful count.

215
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,160
Yeah.

216
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,520
I was going to say the same thing.

217
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,560
It's just a position of the glorious cave drawings,

218
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,720
and MIMA writing his formulas on the board.

219
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,360
And it made me think, this is what I see.

220
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,680
That the caveman was saying, this is what I see,

221
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,280
and MIMA is saying, this is what I see in such different realms

222
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,760
and eons.

223
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,600
But why do you think somebody first did it?

224
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,040
They're winning.

225
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,720
Biologists say that we came up with imagination

226
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,160
as a mechanism for survival, so that we

227
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,720
are the only species that can have an experience without actually

228
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,400
having the experience.

229
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,440
We can invent the story of what would happen

230
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,680
if you put your hand in the mouth of a lion before doing that.

231
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,040
And imagination leads immediately to questioning.

232
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,320
When you look at something and you think

233
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,000
that there's a story there, you want to know who did it.

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,440
You want to know where it's going.

235
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,880
You want to know what happened once upon a time

236
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,640
and how will it end.

237
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,200
I think we also, as individuals, have

238
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,240
experience with this without having to be

239
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,560
at the forefront of it, meaning when I was learning physics,

240
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,880
I got to discover Newton's laws.

241
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,640
Every step, when I understood something

242
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,160
and saw, wait, this is applying to something real around me.

243
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,560
I didn't have to be the first one to come up with that

244
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,440
to understand that experience.

245
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,080
And I think that all of the learning

246
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,040
that we do when we're young in science or not in science,

247
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,080
that teaches us what discovery is.

248
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,440
Every individual gets to discover so many things

249
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,120
about the world.

250
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,560
The nice thing about, well, in the scientific discovery,

251
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,720
what you get to keep doing is asking questions along that line,

252
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,600
along a path.

253
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,480
But you have a tremendous amount of experience

254
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,360
discovering all the physics that's

255
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,600
been discovered before you, everything you have time to

256
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,560
discover that you can manage to grasp, right?

257
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,520
I got the metaphor of running, by the way,

258
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,120
the fact that you can't concentrate on getting somewhere.

259
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,760
You need to keep asking the questions along the road.

260
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,320
And that's what makes the activity interesting.

261
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,400
Actually, it's also interesting.

262
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,960
I mean, we don't join in the film.

263
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,560
But Monica, Fabiola, and Martin all run.

264
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,880
And Fabiola, Martin, Monica, and Nemo all play the piano.

265
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,240
And I'm not going to extrapolate to everybody.

266
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,120
But it is interesting that they have the running

267
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,240
is this persistence, endurance, processing sort of thing.

268
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,160
And then they interest in music, this other slide.

269
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,080
It's going to be for each other.

270
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
So we take these words and say all activities.

271
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
For no reason.

272
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,560
Yeah.

273
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Yes.

274
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,160
It makes me think a little bit about young children

275
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,880
and watching them explore the world with curiosity.

276
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,200
Every single moment is a discovery for a young child.

277
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,080
And certain adults keep that quality.

278
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,000
And want to keep.

279
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,840
Do you learn it?

280
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,920
We relearn it.

281
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,480
Wait a second.

282
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,000
I get to ask why?

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,760
I get to keep asking why?

284
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,560
And having my kids are four and six right now,

285
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,240
I remember the stage when they went through and realizing,

286
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,480
wow, we learned being able to do that because I forgot it.

287
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,640
I forgot that I had permission to ask how does that work?

288
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,800
And to keep asking that next question.

289
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,840
And not for what financial purpose.

290
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,360
I guess.

291
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,920
That was a great moment.

292
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,720
Great moment.

293
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,960
So I'm going to ask David.

294
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,460
Yeah.

295
00:13:59,460 --> 00:13:59,960
Yeah.

296
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,560
So everybody here has seen the film.

297
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
Yeah.

298
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,120
Actually, with a curiosity thing, one of my favorite moments

299
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,960
actually, there was one Martin's doing the experiment

300
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,600
with the kids.

301
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,440
And he says, see this?

302
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,080
And he says, yeah, but the card got wet.

303
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Yeah.

304
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,840
You know, that's not exactly focusing on exactly the same thing.

305
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,240
It's a good question.

306
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,740
Yeah.

307
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,240
Yeah.

308
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,000
That leads to something else.

309
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Right.

310
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But it's interesting.

311
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,280
You were saying, too, I mean, in some sense,

312
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,720
is it evolutionary adaptations?

313
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,760
Maybe initially, it was predictive,

314
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,880
that there was an adaptation that you could predict.

315
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,640
That we first got this capability saying,

316
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,200
if I go there and there's a lion there, I'm going to be eaten.

317
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,640
And maybe it was a very practical thing initially

318
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,400
to have this predictive imagination.

319
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,560
And maybe the next step was an imagination

320
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,400
that didn't necessarily have survival on it.

321
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,000
Or maybe there wasn't a difference,

322
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,760
because these are categories that we

323
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,640
keep establishing in terms of practicality.

324
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,200
You were saying this absurd difference

325
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,000
between the mind of a scientist and the mind of an artist.

326
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,880
Well, for a very long time, there was no difference

327
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,440
in the Renaissance and the Middle Ages.

328
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,080
An alchemist was what?

329
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,760
An artist or a scientist?

330
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
The an artist.

331
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,680
Leonardo Dante, who was quoted and who, in fact, fits

332
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,720
so perfectly with his idea at the end of his vision,

333
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,760
when finally he sees the great vision,

334
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,280
he compares it to the universe of scattered pages

335
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:50,040
that somehow come bound in a volume at last for him to see.

336
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,160
This is what I felt with the film,

337
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,720
that the volume was being bound at last.

338
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,880
We haven't read it.

339
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,920
We don't know what it means.

340
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,840
But somehow it's coming together.

341
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,920
It's such a beautiful model.

342
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,080
Well, I do think that this notion of the artist's brain

343
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,640
and the science brain being separate is something

344
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,720
that's just not true.

345
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,600
I mean, there are examples of extremities in both cases.

346
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,040
But I think one of the rewarding things

347
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,840
we're taking a film around has been having people come up

348
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,560
to me afterwards who are not physicists,

349
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,080
which are first of all other scientists,

350
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,120
but also in the arts and feeling akin to it.

351
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,840
And actually having scientists tell me

352
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,520
that they feel like they're artists.

353
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,120
They feel like they're very creative artists.

354
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
It is.

355
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,360
You know, it's practically, it's difficult.

356
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,040
And you fail and come up with lots of bad ideas,

357
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,120
but artists do that all the time as well.

358
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,680
Lovely idea that came up, the idea of failure as essential.

359
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,160
Stevenson had this wonderful line about our purpose in life.

360
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,800
It's not to succeed, but to continue

361
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,120
to fail in the best of spirits.

362
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,400
He would be very friendly with solace.

363
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,160
I think one of the differences that I've seen working

364
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,680
with artists and learning more about the products

365
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,000
and the definition of research within art is the process.

366
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,520
Right?

367
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,960
That's what's different for us.

368
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,200
We have a different process.

369
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,080
And it's something that you learn how to do.

370
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,280
You have to learn how to do.

371
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,800
And when I talk to other physicists,

372
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,600
we have a language that's shared.

373
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,240
We tend to approach problems in similar ways.

374
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,440
And what's interesting, I think, if you're working

375
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,160
in these different realms, pushing toward research,

376
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
discovering something, is to have access

377
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,680
to other kinds of processes.

378
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,320
It's interesting that the scientists also have a piece

379
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,560
of that artistic process, right?

380
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,760
We're allowed to try to learn different kinds of processes.

381
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,640
I think it's helpful when you have that in your toolbox,

382
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,480
not just one way of approaching a problem.

383
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,920
Do you see parallels?

384
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,560
No, go ahead.

385
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,760
When you're working on dance, do you see parallels?

386
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,160
I mean, it's a different language,

387
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,240
but do you think about the connections?

388
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,560
Right.

389
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,600
So I'm not actually the one working on dance.

390
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,920
I'm working with a dancer.

391
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,920
And so I think we try to have our two disciplines interacting

392
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,720
with each other.

393
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
So we're going after that, I think.

394
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,400
We're actively trying to see how is your process, what's mine?

395
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,920
And yeah, that's our goal in some ways

396
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,760
of that collaboration.

397
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,280
Absolutely.

398
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,160
I think this was sort of fascinating

399
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,400
when I saw that you were doing this,

400
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,920
because there's a troop, Liz Lerman, as a dancer.

401
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,960
She has a troop down in Baltimore.

402
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,160
And she went to CERN.

403
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,120
And she wanted to try to do something there.

404
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,720
And she just, you know, is just this feeling as an artist.

405
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,760
And I think we're seeing a lot of this.

406
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,920
There's a cross fertilization, but there seems

407
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,760
to be many more artists that are really getting

408
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,720
fascinated with science.

409
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,040
And so she went there.

410
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,520
And they went down to the cavern.

411
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,120
And they did this thing.

412
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
And, you know, she had these dancers,

413
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,000
these men wearing dresses.

414
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,840
And you see the, they filmed it.

415
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,320
And you see these engineers there with hard hats

416
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,560
just sort of looking.

417
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,960
And I don't know which is more bizarre, you know,

418
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,920
the construction, like the Atlas cavern,

419
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,000
or these men and dresses dancing around down there.

420
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,720
And she wanted to just do a piece about it.

421
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,600
And we actually filmed a performance that she did

422
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,760
and didn't make it in the film.

423
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,080
But it's so, it was fascinating when I read

424
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,720
that you are now also involved working with a dancer.

425
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,960
And what was, how did that happen?

426
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,120
What was the motivation for you?

427
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,840
Well, one thing I should say is that we've had Liz

428
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
come to our class.

429
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,480
So that those of us who work in these kinds of juxtapositions

430
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,880
tend to find each other.

431
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,240
So the collaboration between physics and dance

432
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,880
that we have at Yale was really started in a top down way.

433
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,280
It wasn't organic story.

434
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,720
It was a curriculum development piece.

435
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,480
And I was imagining physics, like taking dance

436
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,680
to a work of art and breaking it down

437
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,160
from the physics perspective, right?

438
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,120
Making that mathematical model of everything

439
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,520
that's happening in physics.

440
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,920
And the dancer who I happened to work with

441
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,520
was very sophisticated with a mission of her own

442
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,840
who was doing movement research and was not interested

443
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,600
in that kind of art at the service of science collaboration,

444
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,400
which became obvious very early.

445
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,320
And so the two of us decided, let's

446
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
take our two disciplines on equal footing

447
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,680
and see where this takes us.

448
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,600
Let's let dance, help us understand and communicate science.

449
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,480
And let's let science help us understand and communicate dance.

450
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,400
Let's go in both directions, take turns leading.

451
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,240
And then sometimes we're not going

452
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,320
to be speaking the same language.

453
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,600
And those times we'll just put the two next to each other

454
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,400
and see what happens.

455
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,720
I think the place that we've pushed it

456
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,800
is this idea of embodied cognition,

457
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,240
and not really pushed it in that direction,

458
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,040
but thinking about it.

459
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,360
From my perspective as a practicing scientist,

460
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,560
what is it that how does this feed back into my research?

461
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,040
And it's been a recognition of the reality,

462
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,480
that the ways we operate in the world,

463
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,960
including our very bodies, have an impact

464
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,920
on the way we're approaching the world.

465
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,120
These, the creativity that you have,

466
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,200
the kinds of questions that you can ask.

467
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,800
The questions you're capable of asking,

468
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,960
the analogies that you have access to,

469
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,400
are all limited or informed by your experience in the world,

470
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,560
which wow, you're right, that has something to do

471
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,360
with your body, it never occurred to me

472
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,320
before interacting with the dancer.

473
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,040
I was sentenced as well, because I'm always wondering,

474
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,480
when you talk about that model of the universe,

475
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,400
where we are in this tiny lost corner

476
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,400
and the possibility of these other worlds around us,

477
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,800
expanding, what don't we see?

478
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,320
And already there, I'm limiting the question

479
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,880
by the fact that I know that humans see.

480
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,960
But what are the senses that would allow us

481
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,960
to understand, grasp, perceive, discover?

482
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,840
I don't know what verb to use, the rest of the universe.

483
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,160
Yeah, well, I think you are up the boundaries of things

484
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,760
that we can comprehend.

485
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
And that is an interesting concept.

486
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,320
I mean, the idea of the multiverse,

487
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,120
I mean, in one sense, it's easy to say the words,

488
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,400
oh, it's other universes,

489
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,400
but actually rigorously, mathematically,

490
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,240
I mean, it's hard to actually imagine

491
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,560
how we would actually detect it.

492
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,080
I mean, I think that's really the issue.

493
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,080
People often ask, do I prefer the multiverse

494
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,760
or supersymmetry or what do physicists prefer?

495
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,040
And I always say, I think it's legitimate,

496
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,160
is they actually don't care as long as they know

497
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,520
which one it is.

498
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,640
I mean, because supersymmetry

499
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,840
has all these beautiful things about it.

500
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,160
I mean, it's really, it's such an absolute accomplishment

501
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,760
and it would solve certain issues, possibly,

502
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,520
possibly explaining dark matter and various other issues.

503
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,320
And so that would be great.

504
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,880
But, I mean, if we could prove that there's other universes,

505
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,120
I mean, that would be even more profound,

506
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,080
but the problem is we just don't know how to do it.

507
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,360
And so we've invented an idea

508
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,560
that we might not be able to prove,

509
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,240
which is a very difficult position to be in.

510
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,400
Because not only perhaps prove,

511
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,920
but also we wouldn't have the vocabulary to name it.

512
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,960
I love an anecdote about Christopher Columbus

513
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,040
coming to America and he writes this in his journal

514
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,680
that he approaches the coast of Venezuela

515
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,080
and he sees three manatees swimming

516
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,280
and he says, yesterday I saw three mermaids,

517
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,960
but they're not as beautiful as they say they are.

518
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
LAUGHTER

519
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,960
We bring the vocabulary of what we think we're going to see,

520
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,240
but if we see something that we have no way of recognizing

521
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,440
how do we name it?

522
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,960
I wanted to see what you think about this,

523
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,280
because I understand what you said about art and science

524
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:31,960
and so on, but are there, A, individual differences

525
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,680
in the level of passion and energy

526
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,080
that goes behind the kind of endeavor

527
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,360
that we saw in the movie,

528
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,400
and which I feel coming from you,

529
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,560
because when you talked about what you were doing,

530
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,400
there is so much energy already behind it

531
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,320
that I assume you have a lot of passion for what you do.

532
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,320
So not everybody has it.

533
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,400
So that's number one.

534
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,800
And number two, is it possible that certain researchers

535
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:13,320
or endeavors are more fueled by curiosity

536
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,600
and this desire for the quest than others?

537
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,680
And is it possible that physics is one of them?

538
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,160
Wow.

539
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,320
So I think back to the idea of process,

540
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,520
I think in any work that you're doing,

541
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,280
there's going to be incredible drudgery.

542
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,520
There's going to be times when you're measuring

543
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,360
the lengths of springs.

544
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,360
I recently have been cutting and pasting a lot of names

545
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,160
of atlas data set IDs that we used

546
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,640
for one of the Higgs characterization papers

547
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,280
into a spreadsheet.

548
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,120
So I think that there certainly are different levels

549
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,920
of tenacity that people have.

550
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,920
Something that I try to do that is much easier

551
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,240
as an educator and a researcher to do for me

552
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,800
is maintain the sense of the big picture

553
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,360
so that when I'm cutting and pasting or whatever

554
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,480
the drudgery is in my process or the things I have to get through,

555
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,240
I know I appreciate the little steps,

556
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,800
the completed spreadsheet that tells the complete picture

557
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,320
of how we simulated that sample and made that plot.

558
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,000
It's the little victories that I celebrate along the way,

559
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,960
but also try to maintain the big picture of what the science is

560
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,400
trying to achieve and what we're doing together.

561
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,320
So I think that some people, the people who I've seen

562
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,320
who have left the fields of physics,

563
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,120
I don't know that it's a different level of passion.

564
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,440
It's not even a different level of capability,

565
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,160
but it's important to have the ability

566
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,400
to make it through the drudgery of your practice.

567
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,640
And when I think of the parallel with the artist,

568
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,640
so Emily, the practice of dance, the rigor of that,

569
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,000
or basketball player, dribbling the basketball,

570
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,360
you've got to dribble the basketball,

571
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,680
you've got to do the layups over and over and over again

572
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,520
and keep in mind the big picture of the game

573
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,840
that you're going to play, right?

574
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,280
You've got to, and then keep fighting past

575
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,240
when you lose the game or when we make the plot

576
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,160
and things don't look the way we think that they do,

577
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,640
things that we don't understand them.

578
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,120
So yeah, I think to be successful.

579
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,960
I was looking for something.

580
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,480
It seems to me there is an element of searching

581
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,720
for something, finding answers to something

582
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,200
that is particular to certain fields.

583
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,360
Yeah, I think you're right.

584
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,560
I think you're right.

585
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,840
For me, the idea of being associated with a quest

586
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,720
that I see as such a fundamental part

587
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,640
of who human beings are, something that's been going on.

588
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,400
How many years, thousands and thousands and thousands

589
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,360
of years trying to understand the universe,

590
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,680
even being a little part of that for me is real privilege

591
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,600
and I think keeps me very excited.

592
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,440
I don't know.

593
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,920
I mean, it is true, especially in big science.

594
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,160
I mean, there are different levels of engagement

595
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,880
and there are people that are very happy

596
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,560
to be just doing their little job

597
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,840
and they're not really thinking about the big questions.

598
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,640
It may have been their initial motivation

599
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
but the practicality is different

600
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,720
and it's hard to be at the frontier of things

601
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,720
and I think that you tend to think

602
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,640
that somebody who's an artist might be demonstrating

603
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,320
the passion more but you have to compare it

604
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,080
to the people in the sciences that are doing the same thing.

605
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
I think one of the big differences in the science

606
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,240
is there's sort of a measurable sense of progress

607
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,760
that when you're doing your spreadsheet,

608
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,160
you know when you've completed it, you've got it

609
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,560
and it's done whereas I think in the arts,

610
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,440
it's actually, you're never really sure if you're done.

611
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,600
You're never really done.

612
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,400
I think you're never really done.

613
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,640
No, the whole idea of discovery with the Higgs boson

614
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,640
is it's a limit we set five sigma, right?

615
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,120
I mean, there's not that kind of certainty

616
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,480
in the sciences, I don't think.

617
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,280
I don't know when I'm done with my plot.

618
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,120
I believe that I understand the data.

619
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,200
I've convinced enough of my colleagues

620
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,680
so they'll let me move forward with it

621
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,200
and we'll put our names on it in a paper

622
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,520
but no, we never know when we're done.

623
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,600
No, no, no, I didn't mean in a big sense.

624
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,840
I certainly agree with that but along the way,

625
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,840
there are tasks that can be completed

626
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,320
that you can say, you know, whereas, you know,

627
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,560
writing, what about it, you know,

628
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,560
do you ever really think that you're right?

629
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,160
That you, you know, oh, I've got this chapter,

630
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,360
I'm done with it, I don't have to go back to it.

631
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,200
Never do it.

632
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,080
This also reminds me,

633
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,520
and you're commenting about Columbus,

634
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,520
Rangabel with Daniel Boorstein in his 1975 wreath lectures,

635
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,320
made a distinction between discoverers and explorers.

636
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,880
Columbus was a discoverer because he was looking

637
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,000
for what he thought he knew, you know,

638
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,240
something about Asia that he was looking for a path.

639
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,680
But Bournsney's distinction was about exploration,

640
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,720
not having a defined goal per se.

641
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,160
I mean, I'm also wondering how you think about that

642
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,560
in your individual work, is that a useful distinction?

643
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,760
Or how do you process your curiosity

644
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,840
in terms of discovery versus exploration?

645
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Yeah, I mean, writing is similar and different

646
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,320
in some ways to all of this,

647
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,440
but to have an enormous research project,

648
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,920
which you probably think you know about at the beginning,

649
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,280
and then when you're tunneled into years and years

650
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,280
of reading and observing and learning,

651
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,320
you find it's taking you in directions

652
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,280
you weren't expecting at all.

653
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Well, you have your wonderful biography of Alice James.

654
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,760
You mentioned somewhere that Alice James talks

655
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,200
about the everyday tasks,

656
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,200
and in what bigger picture does that fit?

657
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,520
I don't know that I'm quoting this correctly,

658
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,480
but to speak of what she does every day,

659
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,960
and then asking the question of that you were asking,

660
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,680
in what big book do these individual chapters fit?

661
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,240
That connects to something that Mark said earlier too

662
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,760
about making this film,

663
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,160
finding people through whom to tell the story.

664
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,680
I think biography is finding narrative ways

665
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,080
into history that are very appealing,

666
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,560
both as a writer to be able to understand history that way,

667
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,160
and one hopes as a reader.

668
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,400
So yes, there is a particular life

669
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,960
with its particular circumstances,

670
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,200
and you absolutely stay with those,

671
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,400
but you also have to give it a context.

672
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,720
So here is the younger sister of William and Henry James

673
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,760
who was very articulate, very bright,

674
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,880
but she wasn't a genius on the order of her brothers.

675
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,160
What could she carve out for herself as a life,

676
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,200
as a way to be, to speak?

677
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,400
She did actually keep a diary toward the end of her life

678
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,440
and found her own voice in a way,

679
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,800
and was a very difficult life,

680
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,920
and it was only the last few years of her life,

681
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,920
but she did make a place for herself in that pantheon,

682
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,200
but in there was published, nobody knew about it.

683
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,080
So in an odd way, this is a funny thing to say,

684
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,560
but I think you'll see what I mean.

685
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,880
In writing a book about her, I gave her a bigger voice.

686
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
Yes, absolutely.

687
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,000
Absolutely, and you followed that part of exploration

688
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,160
rather than discovery, because you didn't know

689
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,800
where you were going, and I think it's always

690
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,800
the most interesting, I go back to the metaphor of the runner.

691
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,160
I find that very, very useful,

692
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,720
because running to get somewhere

693
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,360
is far less interesting than running.

694
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,800
Well, that's actually another quote of Salas's,

695
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,320
which we didn't include, I thought it was in it, but it's out,

696
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,560
which he very explicitly says,

697
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,360
that you have to enjoy the journey, it's like the Odyssey.

698
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,560
You have to enjoy the journey, and as he said,

699
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,560
when he got home, it actually wasn't all that great.

700
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
Yeah, absolutely.

701
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,560
That's a little more about curiosity, your book curiosity.

702
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Well, I started with the idea of which you asked,

703
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,760
which is why are we curious?

704
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,800
Why do we want to ask questions?

705
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,800
And what are the questions that pushed our thought forward

706
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,200
when we started thinking about who we are

707
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,040
and what this place is that we call the world,

708
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,520
or the universe, and then onwards.

709
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,880
And to see how many times those questions

710
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,320
are against our impulse of labeling,

711
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,320
so that we seem to exist between these two contradictory

712
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,880
impulses of building labels that comfort us,

713
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,880
and having languages that are catechisms and dogmatic,

714
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,080
and then on the other side,

715
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,760
asking questions that destroy those labels

716
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,600
and those catechisms.

717
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,920
And I go into the discussion of what is a permissible curiosity

718
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,640
and what is not, and I use Dante.

719
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:58,560
I thought it was wonderful when she puts Dante there.

720
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
Yes.

721
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,080
We made this film with you in mind.

722
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,360
Thank you.

723
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,440
Because you can hang almost everything,

724
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,360
these questions are in the Comedia,

725
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,680
and they are very useful to illustrate them.

726
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,680
So yes, but going back to the question and the film,

727
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,680
I felt such joy and elation when this higs purf to us.

728
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,960
And again, not discovered, but that we have the courage

729
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,960
of saying we, now you have the courage of saying,

730
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,400
this is there, and so there is something.

731
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,360
Now let's start to revise everything,

732
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:51,360
throw everything out of the window and start again.

733
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,880
It's extraordinary, and I think that there are so many moments

734
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,080
where we have done that, where we discover that the earth

735
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,720
is round, where we discover gravity.

736
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:08,720
And those are moments that exist also in painting and dance,

737
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,720
in literature, we certainly say this begins something else.

738
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Although I think actually that brings up really what is it,

739
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,000
sort of a critical difference with art and sciences.

740
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,160
And in some sense, there's consensus in science

741
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,360
when you have proved something.

742
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,720
There's very little consensus.

743
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,000
I mean, there can be an art.

744
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's easier to refute somebody saying,

745
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,680
oh, this is great, this is not great.

746
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,680
I mean, you're much more subject to subjective interpretation.

747
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,440
I can't argue against that.

748
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Yeah.

749
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,880
Yeah, I mean, there are a few fools who will say

750
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,120
that King Lear is not a good play.

751
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,560
But by and large, there are some things that we,

752
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,640
as humans, agree upon, we don't agree

753
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,400
why they are great or why they move us.

754
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,680
But I think that by and large.

755
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,320
But what about like modern art?

756
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,720
Give it time.

757
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,800
Give it time.

758
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Give it time.

759
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,000
It was modern art.

760
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,840
Yeah.

761
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,520
But I think one of the differences is that at its best,

762
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,480
or at his or her best as scientist is just waiting,

763
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,880
it has a theory, but the work is to understand

764
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,080
if the theory is correct.

765
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,960
The work is not to convince the worlds of the theory

766
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,560
or to build up everything around the theory

767
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,800
to make sure that this idea is the one

768
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,240
that everybody agrees with.

769
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,000
The work is to try to say, is this the right theory

770
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,920
or is this the not right theory?

771
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,760
And so what that means is when somebody refutes,

772
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,280
it's progress.

773
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,120
Yes.

774
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,360
And as opposed to condemnation of you, right?

775
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,280
Having a theory that's then refuted,

776
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,680
well, that's really helpful that you propose this theory.

777
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,440
And the fact that it's not true,

778
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,800
we've made progress through that.

779
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,400
There's no shame, right?

780
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,920
There might be frustration or some disappointment,

781
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,840
but it's progress.

782
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,520
And so I think it's a different.

783
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,800
Yeah, but I agree.

784
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,240
Just so following up on yours, do you think that eventually

785
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,000
Nima's going to like that sculpture?

786
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,080
LAUGHTER

787
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,480
I got pretty good at that.

788
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,760
But I liked it, certainly.

789
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:41,000
So maybe that's a refutation of his not lighting it.

790
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:52,440
But style as theory and science takes time to ground itself.

791
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,360
And when you build something, if everybody agrees upon that

792
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:04,040
at the moment, you know that it's conventional and probably

793
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,320
not of much use.

794
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,760
Yes.

795
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,400
When you have something that needs to be learned

796
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,880
with a different vocabulary, then maybe you

797
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,640
have something that is interesting.

798
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,560
But the artist as a scientist has constantly

799
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,520
to teach us how to look and how to think.

800
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,640
When you said there is curiosity and you kind of left

801
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,120
prohibited curiosity, you used what you have in mind.

802
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:47,600
Well, from the very beginning of our consciousness

803
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:55,240
of curiosity, we have discussed what

804
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,040
we should be allowed to be curious about.

805
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,360
So in the Judeo-Christian tradition, for instance,

806
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,800
we were not allowed to eat the fruit of one tree.

807
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,600
All the rest was fine.

808
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:14,080
But why that particular fruit and why that particular tree?

809
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:21,720
And this starts a line of thought that is also

810
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:29,000
found in Greek philosophy and also found in Indian philosophy

811
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,360
that there are certain enterprises that should not

812
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:39,840
be attempted because they might destroy our comfortable view

813
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,320
of the universe.

814
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,840
Ulysses in Dante is not allowed to go beyond the limits

815
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,040
of the known world.

816
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:56,480
When he goes there, he falls into a kind of wave

817
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
that swallows him.

818
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,880
And that is his last journey.

819
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,000
Because if he gets to that point, which is Mount Purgatory,

820
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,160
our view of the world is destroyed,

821
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,160
the dogma no longer holds.

822
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,360
And so that is considered bad curiosity.

823
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,840
But we have that in science now.

824
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,840
I mean, the whole discussion about in biology,

825
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:32,240
or how you should be allowed to tamper with genes, for instance,

826
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,160
up to where you can investigate science.

827
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,000
Well, I mean, now Oppenheimer's famous quote

828
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,320
after the detonation of Bonne was, you know,

829
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,800
in the sense that we had to do this.

830
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,360
It was such a beautiful idea, even though, in some sense,

831
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,920
even credited afterwards.

832
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,800
But that it was where our curiosity led.

833
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,280
And then we had to deal with the consequences.

834
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,800
Right.

835
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,600
And so it seems to me an individual fact,

836
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:11,680
because Sarah said she rediscovered the ability to ask why.

837
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,880
So there was a period where she had lost that ability.

838
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,000
She had it.

839
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,120
She lost it, then she rediscovered it.

840
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,520
And when you talk about your book,

841
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,400
it is clear that you had a lot of questions to ask.

842
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,920
If you didn't have questions to ask,

843
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,280
you wouldn't have been able to write your book.

844
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,240
So there is something that motivates that,

845
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,120
or there is a pressure that some people seem

846
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,240
to have more than others, that keeps wanting you

847
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:47,800
to keep asking questions as far as the quest for the he expose on.

848
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,560
There is an argument that was made in the movie and so on.

849
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,000
Why are we doing this?

850
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,800
In other words, there is no benefit.

851
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,160
There is, supposedly, we find it then what?

852
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,400
Well, you can't ask that question

853
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,520
when that is your curiosity.

854
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,680
That's what you want to do.

855
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,120
And so I was wondering if you people, all four of you,

856
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,800
who seem to be determined and have that pressure

857
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,880
and you keep going, what is it that is moving you like this?

858
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,040
At the top one.

859
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:31,040
Well, partly, the confidence that if you keep asking questions,

860
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,120
you will come to a more interesting place.

861
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,720
Because I think that many people are prevented

862
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,440
from asking questions by the idea that if you start

863
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,560
asking questions, you disturb the status quo

864
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,240
and you won't have that comfortable life.

865
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:57,480
And that applies in politics, in literature, in science.

866
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,320
If you don't ask questions, then everything seems fine.

867
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,760
There's a couple of necessary conditions, I think.

868
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,920
And one of them is the acceptance that failure is

869
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,280
of potential.

870
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,160
So I think that that throughout my life

871
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,080
has been, it showed itself in different ways.

872
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,640
In school, I knew, boy, I'm going to go for it with physics.

873
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,600
There were times when I was very underprepared

874
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,840
because of not having the same kinds of classes going in

875
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,000
that other people did.

876
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,960
But I knew, hey, if this doesn't work, that's OK.

877
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,240
I'll do something else.

878
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,400
My family will love me.

879
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,800
I can fail here.

880
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,520
And that's what gave me the ability to keep going.

881
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,920
And I think I still feel that.

882
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,840
I still feel that if a line of research

883
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,680
that I'm really excited about, that people say is risky.

884
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,000
I work with a topic, the tau lepton.

885
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,320
It's difficult to work with.

886
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,320
And a lot of people say, boy, that's just, why are you

887
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,400
doing that slog?

888
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,400
Because you might not get to that final result.

889
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,160
I feel like that's OK.

890
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,240
It's OK if that doesn't work.

891
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,760
There will be something else.

892
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,160
I'll do something else.

893
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,200
So I think that's one of the necessary conditions

894
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,240
in terms of the pressure.

895
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,880
There was a moment when Nimes says, 15 years.

896
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,080
I've been doing this for 15 years.

897
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,480
And it might not work.

898
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,000
And there goes 15 years.

899
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,520
It was not OK for his perspective.

900
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,040
It's not OK.

901
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,400
That's right.

902
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,960
And just a quick anecdote.

903
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,440
I wrote another book about JP Morgan.

904
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,920
And I didn't know anything about finance.

905
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,600
I just stepped off a cliff.

906
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,840
And I thought, oh, I'll learn it.

907
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,160
Year nine, I was waiting about 4 o'clock in the morning

908
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,800
thinking, I can't do this.

909
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,640
And I can't pay back my book advance.

910
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,240
And so something kept me going.

911
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,680
And I found a way.

912
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:50,120
But you're on a tightrope all by yourself in some ways.

913
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,040
You don't feel.

914
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,880
Not on the Atlas experiment.

915
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,240
I'm there with 3,000 of my best friends.

916
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,280
And I've made commitments.

917
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,680
I need to wake up at the 4 o'clock meeting time, which I

918
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,400
also have to do because I'm giving a presentation.

919
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,200
Or I'm going to be listening to somebody else's presentation.

920
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,840
So I don't feel alone in it.

921
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,120
I mean, there are times when you're

922
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,080
doing your own calibrating of the springs.

923
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,680
Like I said, the piece of it that is the drudgery piece of it

924
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,080
may be where you can feel very alone.

925
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,920
But no, there are thousands of us who have to work together.

926
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,640
It would be nice to be more alone sometimes in it

927
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,960
and have more control over the decisions.

928
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,520
What are you doing here to topics, though?

929
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,840
And that isn't interesting to me.

930
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,560
That's what I'm curious about.

931
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,520
And then I'm going to ask you why you left physics, OK?

932
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,840
They're long stories, and I'll try to do them very quickly.

933
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,200
Alice James was sort of a fluke.

934
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,360
I was, when I was in college as an English major,

935
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,120
you weren't allowed to think about the life of a writer.

936
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,440
It was just the text.

937
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,000
And then I got out of college and started

938
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,840
reading biographies.

939
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,920
And I thought that was pretty fascinating and great ways

940
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,520
to learn about history and literature.

941
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,880
And I was looking for a subject and Nancy Milford's book

942
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,040
on Zelda Fitzgerald had come out.

943
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,080
And it just seemed like the wives and the daughters

944
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,240
and the sisters of famous men were kind of a good avenue.

945
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,200
I was quite young, so I wasn't going to tackle anything

946
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,760
I thought, very big.

947
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,560
And I came across a reference to Alice James.

948
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,160
I loved Henry James and William as well,

949
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,880
but mainly Henry in college.

950
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:30,520
And the reference was from a book about Gerald and Sarah

951
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,040
Murphy, who were friends of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald,

952
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,840
who'd come back from Paris to Cambridge, Massachusetts,

953
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,600
and stopped in on Alice James and her circle.

954
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,640
And I thought, oh, she had a circle.

955
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,880
Maybe she was interesting.

956
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,080
So I quit my job.

957
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,520
I got a tiny advance.

958
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,920
I applied for fellowships.

959
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,880
And then eventually I went back and read that first reference

960
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,680
again, and it took place in 1923, by which time my Alice

961
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,720
had been dead for 30 years.

962
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,440
It was William's wife, who was also named Alice, who

963
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,280
had a circle in Cambridge.

964
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:08,080
So it was like that she found me, but not quite on purpose.

965
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:08,760
And then I did.

966
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,120
A productive failure.

967
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,640
Yes, exactly.

968
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,520
And then it took me five years to write that book.

969
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,600
And then I was a book critic at Newsy for about four years.

970
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,320
And I was looking for another subject.

971
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,200
And I really didn't want to do the same kind of story.

972
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,600
People kept coming to me with the daughters and the wives

973
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,160
and the sisters of famous men.

974
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,440
And I didn't want to do a literary story.

975
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,840
I wanted to do a bad guy, actually.

976
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:35,640
That sort of witch-cassity in the Sundance kid, really seriously.

977
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,840
And a friend at dinner one night said, Robert Barons.

978
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,040
And I thought, oh, that sounds good.

979
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,840
It wasn't really my period of the late 19th century.

980
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,480
I started to read about them.

981
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,880
Morgan seemed the most interesting,

982
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,480
but that he'd been written about so much

983
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,920
I'd have to find someone else.

984
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,240
And my editor pushed me back towards Morgan

985
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,840
and eventually did step off that clip.

986
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,640
I found that the Morgan Library in New York

987
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,240
had a vault of uncatalogged letters, diaries, papers, art history,

988
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,920
art dealers, records, business records.

989
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,680
And I thought, you know, this amazing, big part

990
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,760
of the 19th century in America.

991
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,720
And it hasn't.

992
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,560
He hadn't been done in any depth.

993
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,480
He was such a political figure.

994
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,040
The left crucified him as a terrible robber.

995
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,000
Robert Barons, the right, sanctified him

996
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,160
as a hero of industrial capital.

997
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,720
So I thought, I'll find these in this real documentation

998
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,800
and tell the story.

999
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,720
But I went in with every left liberal female intellectual

1000
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,320
preconception you could have.

1001
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,960
And it took me a long time to let go of all of that

1002
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,960
and to sort of see him whole.

1003
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,240
And he didn't find a formula to become rich.

1004
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:38,920
I did not.

1005
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,120
All my friends want that.

1006
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,360
I want me to know one minute.

1007
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,360
But I ended up not thinking he was a robber baron.

1008
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,960
Even though that's what I went looking for.

1009
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,960
OK.

1010
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,160
That was a long answer.

1011
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,960
So why did you do physics?

1012
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,960
Why did I need physics?

1013
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,920
I think it's interesting to reconstruct that time, which

1014
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,160
is I really hadn't been thinking about it for a long time.

1015
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,080
And I really, you know, it was like 30 years ago.

1016
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,840
And I was really in the film world.

1017
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,720
And this whole project didn't resuscitate

1018
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,920
a lot of these feelings.

1019
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,080
One of the fact was it was a bad time for particle theory.

1020
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,680
I mean, I was a particle theorist.

1021
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,000
It was not a good time.

1022
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,960
It was not clear.

1023
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,240
They were sort of lost in a lot of details.

1024
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,600
There was not a clear accelerator

1025
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,440
that was going to provide answers.

1026
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,120
Very specifically, I was working in a direction

1027
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,480
with somebody that was a little utray.

1028
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,240
And it was not the accepted sort of field theory

1029
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,480
approach that people were using.

1030
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,280
So there weren't a lot of places to go.

1031
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,440
I knew I'd have to do a postdoc and several other

1032
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,600
places.

1033
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,720
So the prospects were not great there.

1034
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,080
But I would say more than that, it

1035
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,800
was that I discovered something else that was a passion,

1036
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,480
that was I was interested in.

1037
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,200
And I discovered a film as something

1038
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,880
that suddenly I had liked as a kid.

1039
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,560
But it was just entertainment.

1040
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,720
And I never conceived that people made films.

1041
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,240
They just somehow appeared.

1042
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,160
And I discovered in particular Eastern European films.

1043
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,280
And I suddenly saw something that to me

1044
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,840
was a challenging, worthwhile thing to do.

1045
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,320
I think I did feel like I wanted

1046
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,120
to be doing something that was challenging,

1047
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,720
that was interesting, that would give me

1048
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,480
a sense of accomplishment.

1049
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,560
I mean, I was at some level just attracted to things

1050
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,680
that were a challenge, and that I could see films that were

1051
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,720
done that really made me think.

1052
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,840
I thought that would be interesting too.

1053
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,280
And I liked the idea of it being a broader palette.

1054
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,720
I met my wife, who was not a scientist.

1055
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:00,960
And I felt my life was very compartmentalized.

1056
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,560
And I think it was just that I sort of discovered the arts

1057
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,200
and decided, oh, I should explore that a little bit.

1058
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,440
And ended up just going and going and going.

1059
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:19,600
And we really didn't do documentaries,

1060
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,640
and didn't do anything related to science.

1061
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:26,720
I guess I really wanted to explore the human condition.

1062
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,240
I moved from this sort of physical world to the world.

1063
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,360
And I always thought that I wanted

1064
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,600
to do something that still would explore the science world.

1065
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,880
Because as I say, it's not that I became disenchanted

1066
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,880
within it.

1067
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:46,000
I still had that feeling of wonder, of what that was,

1068
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,320
I mean, what these scientists did.

1069
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,840
But I thought I would go back and somehow deal with that

1070
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,600
in a fictional world.

1071
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,720
And then a particle favor came up.

1072
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,560
Is that what drew you to dance as well?

1073
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,520
This rediscovery of wonder?

1074
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,680
That's an interesting question.

1075
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:13,240
So I think that I kept working in my collaboration with Emily.

1076
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,360
So we teach this class together, which

1077
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,360
was part of my job, which I love.

1078
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,560
I think it's a fantastic one.

1079
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,480
I think I was chosen that to be your job, no?

1080
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,480
Well, no, I had to teach something.

1081
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,480
And yeah, I guess, right, it's part of the Yale curriculum

1082
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:29,800
now.

1083
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,680
So somebody was going to teach a class.

1084
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,800
I was teaching physics classes.

1085
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,160
I could have just been teaching physics classes.

1086
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,280
How can you say that?

1087
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,320
I can't do that.

1088
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:37,880
Right.

1089
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,120
This is a physics class.

1090
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:44,520
I think that I am not a dancer myself.

1091
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,920
And I took ballet for a couple of years when I was 12 and 13.

1092
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,920
I really loved it.

1093
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,280
We do the dance class and physics class in a dance studio.

1094
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,160
And I have to say that about 80% of the time,

1095
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,240
I'm very deeply uncomfortable.

1096
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,440
Because there's a lot of movement that's in the class.

1097
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,240
And I'm also challenged constantly by my collaborator,

1098
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:12,520
Emily Coates, who feels that cultural forces and cultural

1099
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,960
pressures have a big impact on our scientific laws

1100
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,640
and the state of our knowing knowledge and science

1101
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,880
right now, which I've always been pushing back on.

1102
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,960
I'm not enlightened in some ways.

1103
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,360
I didn't take the studies when I was going through college.

1104
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:33,520
So I think it's a very productive level of being

1105
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,920
pushed, uncomfortable in every dimension.

1106
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,680
And there are times when that's not a good thing.

1107
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,560
But I think intellectually for me,

1108
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,640
if I have the opportunity to be pushed and to be uncomfortable,

1109
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,600
I try to go with it.

1110
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,920
That's because of your curios.

1111
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,920
Maybe because I'm curious.

1112
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,720
And not worried about failure on some level.

1113
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:01,040
Yeah, but it maintains its uncomfortableness.

1114
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,080
Do you mean you didn't take the cultural studies,

1115
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,360
sort of everything's determined by your society?

1116
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:10,800
So that perspective, so I started out

1117
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,800
as very much a humanities person through high school.

1118
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,200
I was going to go to law school.

1119
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,560
And I wanted to be a constitutional lawyer,

1120
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,640
a public defender, something that was at the framework

1121
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,440
of our society in this country.

1122
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,560
I thought that that's going to be what I do.

1123
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,040
And then I started taking physics.

1124
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,520
And I realized that my whole picture that I've built up

1125
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,560
of the world was completely wrong, totally wrong.

1126
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,160
How could I be so absolutely wrong about the laws of nature?

1127
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,360
Nothing worked the way I thought that it did.

1128
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,920
And it took a long time to swing my brain around

1129
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,160
and try to think, and even in terms that would let me access

1130
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,440
the world in that way.

1131
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,880
And it was just addictive, that challenge.

1132
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,600
I think it was so difficult.

1133
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,320
So then I became a scientist and a real scientist

1134
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,880
in looking for objectivity.

1135
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,760
And it's the steps and this process.

1136
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,480
And then I think, of course, I wasn't in a total vacuum.

1137
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,280
But then to have somebody very seriously in my professional life

1138
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,960
say, well, maybe take a different angle on this,

1139
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,960
readjust this.

1140
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,200
Maybe you're missing a part of the process.

1141
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,360
Maybe you're not taking these things into account

1142
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,600
with your process.

1143
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,600
I think that was another revolutionary moment for me

1144
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,120
that probably all of you in this room

1145
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,240
have had that maybe the process of science

1146
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,920
is influenced by society and who's

1147
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,520
been allowed to participate in science,

1148
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,720
that that was a revolutionary moment for me to realize.

1149
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,440
And so there are many reasons why I continue that conversation.

1150
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,200
Maybe there is a difference between the work

1151
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:46,720
that the creative imagination of a writer functions, the way

1152
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,880
that it functions, and the way of the imagination

1153
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,120
of a scientist functions.

1154
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,000
Because I got the impression from the film

1155
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,680
and from some scientists that I know

1156
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,640
that it is very much a collaborative effort,

1157
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:06,760
but not as much as that teamwork, but simply

1158
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:12,840
that a theory is constructed by many minds at the same time

1159
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:17,560
that you don't just come up with a model of the universe

1160
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,960
and put it out there that you imagine maybe this, maybe that,

1161
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,720
and you can build it.

1162
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,800
A novel instead, unless it's written by several people,

1163
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,680
is constructed from the first to the last chapter.

1164
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,280
And then you come and you want to publish it

1165
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,760
in some medley editor pulls it apart,

1166
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,680
but that's another story.

1167
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,240
So I think that it's different.

1168
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,480
I mean, I wouldn't, I think, be able to construct a book

1169
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,400
as a collaboration.

1170
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,400
I think that the parallel might be,

1171
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,560
in terms of what I've learned about science,

1172
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,120
that the idea of the history of an idea

1173
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,160
is very difficult to trace.

1174
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,920
How did you construct that chapter?

1175
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,760
What, from your experience or from your conversation

1176
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,440
with someone, was actually pulling into that.

1177
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,800
And I think the same is true about scientific ideas.

1178
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,400
We do have people, and I'm not one of them,

1179
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,800
that the theorists, I'm an experimentalist,

1180
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,600
but we do have the theorists like Mima, like David,

1181
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,840
people who are pushing in those directions.

1182
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,800
And we tend to think of those people as making big leaps,

1183
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,160
but the reality is, and they are making big leaps,

1184
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,360
but they're also informed by the conversations

1185
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,720
that they're having and the collaborations that they're having.

1186
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:45,040
So I think that, for instance, when Hicks was mentioned,

1187
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,000
immediately, a number of other names

1188
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,840
appeared that said these other people

1189
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,760
were looking at the same problem.

1190
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,840
Not in communication with each other very much

1191
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,680
at that point.

1192
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,920
Well, there were three groups, really.

1193
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,120
And so there were a couple that were working together.

1194
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,200
And Hicks was sort of on his own.

1195
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,000
But then there were others that were working together.

1196
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,080
But it was an idea that was burbling up.

1197
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,920
And it was, I mean, this idea of the single genius theory

1198
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:22,800
is something that I think a lot of people dispute.

1199
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:27,880
I mean, how many really nobody operates in a vacuum?

1200
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,640
There have been a couple of big leaps,

1201
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,240
and people always bring up Einstein for a couple of things.

1202
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:37,960
But even he, for some of his things in special relativity,

1203
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,400
he was working with other ideas as well.

1204
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,120
I mean, he did make big leaps.

1205
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:47,400
But I think in particular, the whole idea of the Higgs

1206
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,000
that we say now, as I said in the Q&A afterwards,

1207
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,120
Higgs was working on a purely mathematical problem, really.

1208
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:01,960
And in fact, the story is that in his initial presentation

1209
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,120
of the paper, he didn't even write

1210
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,640
that there was a particle associated.

1211
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,000
It's supposedly the reviewer said you might want to mention

1212
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,440
that there's an associated particle.

1213
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,440
And it still wasn't incorporated into the standard model.

1214
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,840
That was still done by others by Glass, Schow, and Weinberg,

1215
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,920
who then realized that this actually

1216
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,600
had a place that it could be the explanation for how

1217
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:31,400
the echometh bosons got mass.

1218
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,320
And so it was definitely an incremental thing.

1219
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,960
I think, and I think there is a difference

1220
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,840
with the theorists in experimentalists.

1221
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,320
But I think the interesting thing is that theorists are

1222
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,760
the ones that you really do have more this idea that it's

1223
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,720
like the single genius coming up with something.

1224
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,040
And what you see is it's very collaborative.

1225
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,360
There's a lot of talking.

1226
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,280
Eventually, they have to go and sit down.

1227
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,160
I mean, and I've talked to Sava and Nina

1228
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,280
about this both quite a bit.

1229
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,520
And they both say the collaboration, it's very important.

1230
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,920
But eventually, they have to go and I have to sit down

1231
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,640
and just think and try to make that step.

1232
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,480
It's all the physicists that you were in contact with.

1233
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,200
And you saw, and I guess you said a good bunch of them

1234
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,000
are not even in the movie.

1235
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,200
Did some of them impress you as being more genius, passionate,

1236
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,320
have this push?

1237
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,280
Or did they all seem of the same intensity?

1238
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,600
No, there's different.

1239
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:33,000
I mean, you know, I mean, Nima's obviously incredibly

1240
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,360
intense, and Sava's is more relaxed.

1241
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,040
But I don't think that there's a difference in their passion

1242
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,960
and their intensity.

1243
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:45,600
I mean, Nima very much was also influenced by Sava's.

1244
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,640
He considers, in fact, the interesting thing

1245
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:53,000
is he says that he, Sava's is the person who gave him

1246
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,160
the courage to start to go off in different directions.

1247
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,920
And interestingly, the multiverse initially, you know,

1248
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,680
physicists hated the multiverse initially.

1249
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,560
All physicists pretty much.

1250
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:09,280
And Sava's actually was one of the first to say,

1251
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,200
maybe we should think about it.

1252
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:17,120
And I think he was doing a visiting term at Harvard

1253
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,760
where Nima was.

1254
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,960
And he said, you know, maybe we should look at this multiverse.

1255
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,480
And Nima says, I said, are you nuts?

1256
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,000
This is a total waste of time.

1257
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,240
Why would I ever think about the multiverse?

1258
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,480
And Sava said, yeah, you might want to look at this.

1259
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,560
And eventually, Nima came around.

1260
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,880
So I don't think outwardly, you know,

1261
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,520
it's maybe a reflection inwardly.

1262
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,120
I think both of them are, you know, extremely passionate.

1263
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,360
There are different points in their lives though, you know?

1264
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,520
And this is something that, you know,

1265
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,760
it also gets to your, you know, when you said, well,

1266
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,480
Nima's were lamenting 15 years.

1267
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,800
Sava's is 30 years is the issue of mortality.

1268
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,800
And, you know, for scientists, I mean,

1269
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,640
it's for both scientists, for all creative people.

1270
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,080
I think science, it's even harder somewhat

1271
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,200
in terms of especially for theorists.

1272
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,200
And Nima said that he had the young genius theory initially.

1273
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,960
He said, you know, and his idea was he would, you know,

1274
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,280
they would discover the Higgs.

1275
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,560
He'd do all these things.

1276
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,240
And by 30, he would have that done and he'd move on, you know?

1277
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,640
And of course, you know.

1278
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,200
Yeah, now he's not.

1279
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,360
And he, you know, I asked him near the end.

1280
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,440
So what do you think about this now?

1281
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,480
And he sort of laughed and he said, yeah, it's interesting.

1282
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,160
I'm sort of revising my ideas now.

1283
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:36,640
He says, I think, and he said, you know, and he laughed.

1284
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,200
You know, he realized that this was a little bit self-serving.

1285
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,520
But he said, no, he says what he thinks is that,

1286
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,200
he said the problem is that when people get older,

1287
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,920
they become bourgeois was his term.

1288
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,560
And what he meant was that, you know, they get married,

1289
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,000
they have kids, they have other things in their life.

1290
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,040
And that what he thought was the critical thing was not youth,

1291
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:05,080
but the lack of distraction and the ability

1292
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:10,160
to absolutely, you know, be a jerk if you needed be

1293
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,240
to focus on what you were doing.

1294
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,280
That's why Sherlock Holmes doesn't get married.

1295
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,640
That's why Sherlock Holmes doesn't get married.

1296
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:20,480
So that was what he was thinking with the solution.

1297
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,920
And I think that issue of mortality is an interesting point.

1298
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,160
And I think, you know, look, honestly,

1299
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,960
I think Neema does really, you know,

1300
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,520
Neema's in an interesting position.

1301
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,000
I mean, he is, you know, he was regarded as the, you know,

1302
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,320
hot genius.

1303
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:39,960
And, but nothing that he has done has actually been proven.

1304
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,400
I mean, it's so he's recognized for what he's done

1305
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,160
and the brilliance and his passion and his insight.

1306
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,480
But we don't know if anything is right, you know.

1307
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,080
Solace has actually had more things done, but, you know,

1308
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,440
nothing completely proven either.

1309
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,080
And, you know, I think they're very interesting

1310
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,000
to look at the two of them right now.

1311
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,520
But this idea of proof is very interesting

1312
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,840
because I'm obviously not a scientist.

1313
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:12,360
But I understood that, for instance, Euclid was proven.

1314
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:16,600
And then, certainly, you had the non-Euclidean geometries

1315
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:21,160
and, suddenly, two parallel lines did meet.

1316
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:25,000
And so, does that happen constantly?

1317
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I mean, I think what happens, so my view of this is we have

1318
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,920
the theory that works in a certain regime.

1319
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,000
Maybe it works only at low energy.

1320
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It works at slow speeds.

1321
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,480
It works at large distance scales.

1322
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,880
And then, when we get the ability to move

1323
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,360
beyond those limitations, we realize, aha,

1324
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,560
that actually Newton's laws are a nice example, right?

1325
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,400
The macroscopic world around us.

1326
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,320
Force equals mass times acceleration.

1327
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,240
I push on something with a certain force.

1328
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,520
I'm going to get a certain acceleration for a given mass.

1329
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,640
And then, you're confronted with a speed limit to the universe,

1330
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,080
the speed of light.

1331
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,640
So there's a problem there.

1332
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,520
I must not be able to get a certain acceleration

1333
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,320
for a given mass with a given force

1334
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,840
when you get past that point.

1335
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:12,000
But it doesn't mean that Newton's laws were invalid

1336
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,160
or are invalid in a context.

1337
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,200
So I think that's what most often happens,

1338
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,880
is that we realize that there is context

1339
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,000
beyond our initial understanding.

1340
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,840
Or things that we didn't think matter do.

1341
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,640
You think that's the only matter.

1342
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:28,400
And it's about universes beyond our universe.

1343
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,480
What can we do?

1344
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,000
Yes.

1345
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,480
Yes.

1346
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:35,200
It's also interesting when you're talking about mortality

1347
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,440
as playing a role.

1348
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,200
And it's almost in some ways it's reflected

1349
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,320
by the attachments that one makes to this world.

1350
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:52,360
And quest literature is so focused on the Urquest

1351
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,120
Gilgamesh, the very question of mortality

1352
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,760
is at the center.

1353
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,960
And so much of quest literature is

1354
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:04,000
about a going away and ultimately returning.

1355
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,480
Right?

1356
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:04,880
Yes, yes.

1357
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,600
Yes, yes.

1358
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,600
I mean, the Wizard of Oz.

1359
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,280
The Last Lines in the Wizard of Oz is, you know,

1360
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,280
Aunt Emma, there's no place like home.

1361
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,560
But it's almost it.

1362
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,120
Because the Wizard is a failure.

1363
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,480
But there's almost a suspension of mortality

1364
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,640
in the journey that's taken.

1365
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,960
But there's always the return.

1366
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:27,080
And I wonder about that as a feature

1367
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,600
that when one is pursuing the quest,

1368
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:34,680
one has to set aside that aspect of experience.

1369
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,120
I have a question.

1370
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:36,560
Oh, sorry.

1371
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,920
Did you want to answer that?

1372
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,360
No.

1373
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,280
To go to art for a second.

1374
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,320
Because you've written novels as well as nonfiction.

1375
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:48,880
And I would, I mean, in working on nonfiction,

1376
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,840
there is a sense that you have evidence

1377
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,080
that you're trying things out all the time,

1378
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:58,320
that you're finding what seems true in quotes or something.

1379
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,520
But what seems accurate.

1380
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,120
And I would imagine there's a process like that for fiction.

1381
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:02,480
Oh, I've got that.

1382
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,920
What feels absolutely right to you.

1383
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,640
Would you talk a little bit about that?

1384
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:11,520
Well, in both cases, you have to construct a theory

1385
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,480
of the universe, a model, whether it's

1386
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:20,600
based on the fact that Morgan ate porridge for breakfast

1387
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,360
or wore brown shoes.

1388
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:27,560
Or your invented character did these things.

1389
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:31,920
And what you find out, as you were saying in the film,

1390
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:37,240
is that as soon as you establish one fact,

1391
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:42,720
a multitude of facts follows that if it's brown shoes

1392
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,680
and not black, then there are consequences for this

1393
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,960
in every direction.

1394
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,360
I find it much more difficult to write fiction

1395
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,880
than nonfiction.

1396
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,920
Because in nonfiction, so much of the work has been done.

1397
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,360
And you don't need to have the memory

1398
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,920
that you have to have for fiction.

1399
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,400
When was he born?

1400
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,920
And how many children did he have?

1401
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,600
And you have to jot these things down

1402
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,400
and invent these archives.

1403
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,360
But yes, essentially, they're the same process.

1404
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,080
Yes, and I mean, just from my novelist's friends,

1405
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,480
there's a sense of true north in some way.

1406
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,680
When you have it, you know you have it.

1407
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,560
And when you don't have it, you know you don't have it.

1408
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,080
That's right.

1409
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,480
But it's not until you finish the book.

1410
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,000
I know, right.

1411
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,080
But you know, it's actually interesting.

1412
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,560
Because right now, I am working on a script.

1413
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,000
So it's a fiction script.

1414
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,320
And it feels exactly like it did what

1415
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,200
I was in the edit room at the end of particle favor.

1416
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,720
And I think the process is very similar.

1417
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,400
And with film, the interesting thing with film

1418
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,120
is you go through these different phases.

1419
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:02,400
And the script stage is like theory.

1420
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,160
You're coming up with a theory of the world, basically.

1421
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,080
And then you go to experiment, which

1422
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,120
is like going into film production.

1423
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,560
And suddenly, you need lots of money and equipment

1424
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,520
and lots of people.

1425
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,120
And it's completely crazy.

1426
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,800
And you're just getting data.

1427
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:21,040
And especially in film, but I think in physics,

1428
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,240
too, to a certain extent, you just

1429
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,520
like hope that it's working and making sense.

1430
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,160
And then you come back to the edit room,

1431
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,040
which is like going back to the theorists.

1432
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,120
And it's like, OK, here's the data.

1433
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,880
This is what the real world is like.

1434
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,320
And you revise your theories.

1435
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,600
Or you revise your, you know, the script is now lost.

1436
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,280
And you have the film that you have.

1437
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:43,400
And so, you know, the long period in the edit room

1438
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,560
was taking all this data.

1439
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,480
And what is our story?

1440
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,560
And what is, but we were approaching it.

1441
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,080
It was like writing fiction.

1442
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,040
And that's what people always say.

1443
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,120
Anyways, documentaries, it's the editing.

1444
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,480
We're writing.

1445
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:00,920
And now I'm working on a script that's a fiction script.

1446
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,760
But it's the same process for me.

1447
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:07,040
I have, I mean, even using some of my organizational software,

1448
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,280
you know, that I was using in the edit room,

1449
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,840
keeping track now of people and stories.

1450
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,160
And there is a life to it.

1451
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,520
But it's, for me, it's a very similar process.

1452
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,880
There's a trying to imagine various outcomes

1453
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,440
and what are the ones that work and what

1454
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,840
is the thing that is consistent and the characters

1455
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,280
have become their own people.

1456
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,760
And oh, you start talking like, oh, this person wouldn't do this.

1457
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,840
You know, exactly.

1458
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,320
And it's so completely parallel.

1459
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:38,360
I mean, I'm just, it's the same.

1460
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:42,480
You offered of the questions useful, I think,

1461
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,080
for these creative processes.

1462
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:50,880
Because all the stage of accumulating material

1463
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:56,400
and then putting it together is that quest.

1464
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,520
But it's only on that return journey

1465
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,720
that you realize what you have, whether it's

1466
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,720
a golden fleece or empty hands.

1467
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,240
OK.

1468
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,400
People want to line up with the microphone

1469
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:18,600
and please identify yourself and keep your comments

1470
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,600
in the form of a question.

1471
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,360
Hi, my name is Olga Oste.

1472
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:32,120
I'm on the things.

1473
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:35,120
OK.

1474
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,120
Fused.

1475
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:45,120
I probably, probably the difference

1476
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:50,640
between scientist and artist, scientist,

1477
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,120
the science experiment has to be probable and has to be

1478
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,000
repeatable.

1479
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,440
And artists usually tries to do something

1480
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:03,600
absolutely original and nobody can repeat it.

1481
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:11,680
And also, I bet I said that probably few fools

1482
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:17,560
consider that King Lear is actually bad play.

1483
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:23,200
I'm not sure about fools, but Leo, Tal's story, famous writer.

1484
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,800
Yes, he did not like Shakespeare.

1485
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,720
He considered him primitive.

1486
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:33,680
And you know that he wrote this, and won peace, and anacrine.

1487
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:37,120
So probably I don't know if he was fool,

1488
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:43,760
but he was absolutely, of course, very arrogant person.

1489
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,960
But still he was like, oh, no, nobody would pay.

1490
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:48,480
OK.

1491
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:53,520
And my question is to Sara, actually.

1492
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,920
After you finished your film, I read

1493
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:06,640
that actually exact number, exact mass of Higgs Boson

1494
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:13,320
is 126 plus minus 0.4.

1495
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:20,760
And there are actually theories that didn't

1496
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,520
connect to supersymmetry or multivorts that predicted

1497
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:31,040
exactly these number.

1498
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:37,480
But still, my question is, should I get a question?

1499
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:41,920
What do you think is ideal of multivorts more

1500
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:48,160
dead or more alive after all these discoveries?

1501
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,880
OK, so that's a great question.

1502
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:54,280
So the mass of the Higgs within the standard model

1503
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,840
was actually a predicted number.

1504
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,360
Based on all the other information

1505
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,960
that we had, the mass of the top quirk, the mass of the W,

1506
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,360
all the measurements that we had and our understanding

1507
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,280
of how this theory fits together.

1508
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,200
If you have a Higgs Boson within the standard model

1509
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,840
that functions as evidence for the Higgs field, which

1510
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,320
gives us mass, it should be a certain number.

1511
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,880
We had a prediction.

1512
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:21,360
And we didn't find the Higgs at exactly that prediction

1513
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,120
before the LHC started.

1514
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,080
But the idea is, if it's a standard model Higgs Boson,

1515
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,600
it's got to be close to that.

1516
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,560
It has to be around 118.

1517
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,240
A number that's not that far from where we'd actually

1518
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,520
explored.

1519
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,840
So the further up away from that prediction

1520
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,600
within the standard model, the more exciting it is

1521
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,320
from the perspective of maybe there's

1522
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:45,040
something else that we have access to through this particle

1523
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,600
beyond the standard model.

1524
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,880
So that was kind of the excitement there.

1525
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,440
If it isn't really far away from the prediction of 118,

1526
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,200
so that it must be something else.

1527
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,080
So there's that thing that's happening.

1528
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,520
How close is this to what we expect from the standard model?

1529
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,120
And you could argue about 125.

1530
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,720
It turns out to be close enough to the prediction

1531
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:07,920
that it's perfectly consistent with the standard model.

1532
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,560
So there you have that.

1533
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,200
And then you look at other ideas.

1534
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:15,360
Well, maybe we don't say definitely not standard model.

1535
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,960
But even within that close enough to be standard model,

1536
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,880
it could actually be something else.

1537
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,520
It could be supersymmetry.

1538
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,920
It could be the multiverse.

1539
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,760
It could be this.

1540
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,160
And you look at all of these different spaces

1541
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,680
in terms of these different theories

1542
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,480
and try to understand what do they

1543
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,600
predict for this particle's mass.

1544
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,960
What do we learn from that?

1545
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,600
And I think the issue with the Higgs at this mass

1546
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,640
is that it makes some of our favorite theories

1547
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,240
a little bit uncomfortable.

1548
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:46,260
For supersymmetry, I would say a mass of that Higgs boson

1549
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:49,560
means that some of the best motivation for supersymmetry,

1550
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,760
you lose at that mass.

1551
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,240
So supersymmetry could definitely be reality.

1552
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,920
But it wouldn't solve all of the problems

1553
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,240
that we hope that supersymmetry would come along and solve.

1554
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,160
In terms of the multiverse, I don't

1555
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:05,000
think it gives us information in that it doesn't rule it out

1556
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,680
as a possible idea.

1557
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:09,040
I'm sorry, I'm not adding any content beyond the film.

1558
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,960
I think it captures pretty well where things stand.

1559
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,600
The funny thing about the Higgs, or one of the funny things

1560
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,520
about the Higgs is that so many of us

1561
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,720
were hoping that it wouldn't be there.

1562
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,360
What it does, and I used to say that,

1563
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,600
I hope we don't find the Higgs.

1564
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,040
And now having been even some small part of the discovery,

1565
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:31,160
I think it's an absurd thing to say, because it was thrilling.

1566
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:34,720
It's amazing that that prediction actually was true.

1567
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:38,120
But the Higgs boson ties up the standard model

1568
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:42,000
really neatly in some ways and doesn't get us beyond.

1569
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,160
And we know that there's so many things

1570
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,000
about the universe that we don't understand.

1571
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,120
It would have been wonderful if the answer

1572
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:51,560
to the generation of mass actually

1573
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,720
took us in some step further beyond the standard model.

1574
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,200
But I think right now it's inconclusive.

1575
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,560
It's consistent with the standard model Higgs.

1576
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,760
It doesn't rule out supersymmetry,

1577
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,040
though it's making it a little bit less attractive.

1578
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,800
And it leaves us with the idea of the multiverse hanging.

1579
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,880
And every theorist out there, including probably David Kaplan,

1580
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,240
who said, oh, all of my theories are ruled out,

1581
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,520
went back and thought about how do I adjust that

1582
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,880
so that it actually still works?

1583
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,600
I'm sorry, I don't have a better answer.

1584
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:26,120
It's very inconclusive.

1585
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:30,320
I really don't understand this topic too much.

1586
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,560
I'm definitely going to research it now that I've seen this movie.

1587
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,200
But my understanding is that the Higgs boson

1588
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:40,960
generates the Higgs field, which gives particles mass.

1589
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,280
Is that correct?

1590
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:47,080
So if you're on a lake in a boat,

1591
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,480
think of the lake as the Higgs fields.

1592
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,560
If I add energy to the lake, if I splash the lake,

1593
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,920
and this is not my analogy, I should say, my killedrith,

1594
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,600
thank you wherever you are, if I splash the lake,

1595
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,760
that's an excitation, I've added energy to the lake,

1596
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,400
there's a wave that goes out.

1597
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,520
The wave is the Higgs boson.

1598
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:07,960
The evidence for the Higgs fields existing

1599
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,400
is the fact that when you add energy to it,

1600
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,360
you actually have a particle that's created.

1601
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:16,160
So the Higgs boson tells us that there's this field

1602
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,600
everywhere in the universe.

1603
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,560
And it's the Higgs field everywhere in the universe

1604
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,640
that gives us a way to have mass for particles.

1605
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,080
OK, that.

1606
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,000
And so the other thing I wanted to ask

1607
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:34,560
was, would it be possible to explain to layman

1608
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:39,480
the more of the mechanism in terms of which the Higgs field

1609
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:42,160
makes particles have mass?

1610
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:45,360
Look at the little film that she did.

1611
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,160
Right, so we did.

1612
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,960
Yeah, I think so.

1613
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,000
Here's how I think about it.

1614
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,920
You have to first understand what the definition of mass

1615
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,640
is, because how do we think of mass?

1616
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,080
We think of mass as the more mass I have that's

1617
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,720
kind of like the more stuff, right?

1618
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,640
So if we're going to think about mass

1619
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,920
from a perspective of the Higgs boson and particles,

1620
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,960
let's shift our thinking a little bit.

1621
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,000
OK?

1622
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,880
A massless particle.

1623
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,120
So a particle out there with no mass, like the photon.

1624
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,080
So the photons coming to my eyes.

1625
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,640
They're light particles.

1626
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,960
Now I can't see you anymore.

1627
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,880
A massless particle travels at the speed of light.

1628
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,200
It has no choice.

1629
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,200
A particle that has no mass, fundamental particle,

1630
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,520
travels at the speed of light.

1631
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,840
OK?

1632
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:33,760
Particles that do have mass can't travel at the speed of light.

1633
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,840
They can't get up there.

1634
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,160
As much force as you put on them, they can't get up there.

1635
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:41,120
So the question of mass is slowing things down.

1636
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,800
How is it that we slow things down?

1637
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,240
What is the mechanism that means that some things

1638
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,880
can't move at the speed of light,

1639
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,720
that all the massless particles move at?

1640
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,440
It's kind of similar to the idea of mass as stuff, right?

1641
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,640
The more mass you have, the harder you are to get going.

1642
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,400
Maybe you'd say, I don't know if it works perfectly.

1643
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,600
So the idea of the Higgs field being the mechanism for that

1644
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,120
is that this Higgs field, some particles

1645
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,680
it can't slow down at all.

1646
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,640
It doesn't have any interactions with them.

1647
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:08,120
OK?

1648
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,480
Those are the massless particles.

1649
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,880
So the photon travels through the Higgs field.

1650
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,080
The field is there.

1651
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,320
But it doesn't have any interaction with it.

1652
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:19,400
Other particles that do have mass, they see the field.

1653
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,640
They're slowed down by it.

1654
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,960
It's like they're traveling through molasses.

1655
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,360
And the more they see the field, the more they interact

1656
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,720
with the field, the more slowed down they are,

1657
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,000
the more massive they are.

1658
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,520
So I would say that's the mechanism for how it works.

1659
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,520
I think you leave many of us wishing you'd been our first

1660
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:33,520
picture.

1661
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,020
Yes.

1662
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,520
And I'm just thinking.

1663
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,680
Yes, we are.

1664
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,720
There you go.

1665
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,520
Can we only end telling the truth?

1666
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:44,440
We're all great, great, great, great, great, great.

1667
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,960
Hey, I had a question for Mark.

1668
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,560
And you were talking about how the creative process

1669
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,520
for creating, I think, films, parallels

1670
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,760
the process of, I guess, progress in theoretical physics.

1671
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,280
And I was wondering about, in terms of your background,

1672
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,280
have you found that your background informs

1673
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:06,440
your artistic sensibilities in different ways

1674
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,320
than the people that you're sort of working with?

1675
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,240
Like, do you find, not just in terms

1676
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,440
of domain-specific knowledge that was probably useful

1677
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:16,760
for particle fever, but more nebulously in the process,

1678
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,600
do you find that you see things differently or think

1679
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,400
about things differently, I guess?

1680
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,360
I don't think in an obvious way.

1681
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,080
But I mean, I certainly can't deny my background.

1682
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,040
I think there are certain ways that I think.

1683
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,440
But I think there's a certain logic

1684
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,640
that I apply to things.

1685
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:40,200
I don't feel I look at things as a scientist.

1686
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:45,600
People always say that, oh, I don't know what that means.

1687
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,520
It's the way I think.

1688
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,640
As I say, I feel the process of writing and writing

1689
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,280
something fiction is exactly the same as when I'm sitting

1690
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,600
in an editor room.

1691
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,600
And I assume I'm using certain processes of logic

1692
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:07,320
that are also what I used when I was doing theoretical physics.

1693
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,960
And so I will make that comparison.

1694
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,080
When I was in graduate school, when

1695
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,440
I was doing theoretical particle physics,

1696
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,440
it was a very similar process.

1697
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,680
Somebody asked me after the Q&A, how

1698
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,440
did I make that transition?

1699
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,480
Practically, it didn't feel all that different.

1700
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:28,320
Yes, I think I have a certain logical way

1701
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,560
that I approach things.

1702
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,800
But when I was doing theoretical physics,

1703
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,400
I was sitting in a room by myself with a pencil and paper,

1704
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,600
coming up with a theory of the universe,

1705
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:41,120
not getting paid very much as a grad student.

1706
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,720
And then I started writing a script,

1707
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,880
and I just changed rooms.

1708
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,400
I can't help, but I was still sitting there

1709
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:50,800
with a pencil and paper thinking about the way more

1710
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,200
humans interacted.

1711
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,320
But with a certain logic that you apply to it,

1712
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:00,320
and to me, it felt very similar.

1713
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,360
So I don't know.

1714
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:05,560
I think the creative process is the creative process.

1715
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:10,040
And you have certain ways.

1716
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:16,760
I mean, I do know that I can see that I approach certain things,

1717
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,520
and there's a certain logic.

1718
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,000
But that's a fundamental thing that

1719
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,040
doesn't have to do with science either.

1720
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:22,840
I don't think.

1721
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:26,880
I think that any artist is applying a certain logical process

1722
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,760
and working out the consequences that's similar.

1723
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,760
I don't know if there's a meta-level at which the brain is

1724
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:37,000
working that jumbles things together.

1725
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,520
I wouldn't know.

1726
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,000
I just think the way I think.

1727
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,960
But I think, for me, the process is extremely similar.

1728
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I have questions.

1729
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I can't see you.

1730
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
You have to go.

1731
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,440
While you're going there, I'll tell a quick Einstein joke,

1732
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,000
OK?

1733
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,320
That supposedly a reporter came to interview him.

1734
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,680
I have no idea what this is true.

1735
01:24:58,680 --> 01:24:59,400
I read it somewhere.

1736
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,680
It's probably not true.

1737
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:03,240
And said, Professor, where do you get your ideas?

1738
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,080
And Einstein said, what do you mean?

1739
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,360
And he said, well, do you get them

1740
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,640
when you're taking a walk or in the bath

1741
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,720
or playing your violin?

1742
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:13,160
And Einstein thought for a moment and said, actually,

1743
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:14,680
I've only had one or two.

1744
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:19,400
OK.

1745
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,440
So my question, it actually sort of arose

1746
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:26,160
when you were discussing Savos.

1747
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,840
And I remember from the movie, he said

1748
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:33,880
that he told us anecdote of how paradise to him was frightening

1749
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,840
and he started to cry.

1750
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:38,200
And it just made me start to think about fear

1751
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:42,320
and fear as how it plays in the role of a quest.

1752
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,280
Or it's role in a quest.

1753
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:46,400
So I guess I was just wondering how for you, for you guys,

1754
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,800
what was your experience with fear?

1755
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,240
Does it have a role in what you do?

1756
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,440
Does it drive you to, as Savos would do,

1757
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,760
go find what exists out there?

1758
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:04,600
I mean, there is a certain fear.

1759
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:09,680
I mean, certainly there were points in particle fever

1760
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,600
where I had a fear that this was not going to add up

1761
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,120
to anything.

1762
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:17,560
I mean, I always thought that it would at some way.

1763
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:22,280
But the fear of creating something

1764
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:25,920
that nobody responds to, that people don't understand.

1765
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,160
I mean, it was a long process.

1766
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,440
We tested the film at various along the way.

1767
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:36,880
And I mean, it's an interesting thing with a process where

1768
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,520
you're working intensely and you think, oh, yeah, OK, I've

1769
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,440
got it.

1770
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:44,920
And you show it to people and they don't get it at all.

1771
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:48,520
And you think, wow, OK, now I have to go back.

1772
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:53,480
And there's a certain fear that for me, it drives me on.

1773
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,000
I mean, I would say that.

1774
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,760
I don't, I think fear makes me work harder.

1775
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,880
It doesn't make me run.

1776
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:07,480
So I guess that's my own personal reaction so far, anyway.

1777
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,440
Yeah, well, failure is an option.

1778
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:09,920
Yes.

1779
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,800
It's a feared option.

1780
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,680
So I think that's definitely true.

1781
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:19,120
And with every book you write, it doesn't really matter

1782
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,480
that you've written another book.

1783
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,120
The new one could be a disaster.

1784
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:27,640
I mean, it's got its own constraints and requirements.

1785
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,960
And you don't know you can do it.

1786
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,360
So you have to compliment fear?

1787
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,840
So it's just so fascinating to me as it's

1788
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,360
sort of coming out with your dialogue.

1789
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,960
So fear can you thrive to you.

1790
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,480
But it's also you need to learn to be successful and quest

1791
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,760
to sort of conquer fear at the same time.

1792
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:49,560
For me, there is an interesting fear that happens rarely

1793
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:54,320
where I think if this works out, it

1794
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,440
changes what I wanted to do.

1795
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:01,360
It changes the way I was thinking about the subject.

1796
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:07,120
And that's a big fear because it forces you

1797
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,600
to start all over again.

1798
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,960
But when it happens, you know that you're

1799
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,480
onto something interesting.

1800
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:17,320
I think it may also be a question for me

1801
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,240
of how deeply you are into it.

1802
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:26,000
So the longer the further I went, the more at stake

1803
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:31,280
I felt about not failing and pushing and pushing and pushing.

1804
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,080
I mean, I don't know.

1805
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:39,320
At an earlier stage, there might be a wisdom

1806
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,320
in an earlier stage sometimes of a banning.

1807
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,920
And you do that in a minor way all the time.

1808
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,040
I mean, in a minor way, you try an approach

1809
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,800
and you have to make a quick assessment.

1810
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,040
No, that's not going to pay off.

1811
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,760
And I have to go in a different direction.

1812
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,360
But you learned from that.

1813
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,360
You learned from that.

1814
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,200
That's the way Sarah was saying.

1815
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,200
That's true.

1816
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,680
Actually, you know, it reminded me.

1817
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:00,320
I forgot it.

1818
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,880
When you said it, a quick thing, it was Whitehead who said

1819
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,880
that in philosophy, when you come up

1820
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,040
against a contradiction, that's the end.

1821
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,000
And in science, it's the beginning.

1822
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,160
And I thought that was a very interesting point, which

1823
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,240
relates to what you said, too.

1824
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:19,280
And to pick up your image of the quest, which I find very

1825
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:24,800
interesting and useful, any quest that's

1826
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:30,360
engaged without fear is not worth engaging.

1827
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,000
It's also a minor degree.

1828
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,560
You have a certain amount of fear.

1829
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:36,040
It can motivate you if it gets to be too much fear.

1830
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,960
You know, that's what I mean.

1831
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:43,200
One of my favorite quotes is what Einstein wrote back when

1832
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,800
he was asked to describe his process.

1833
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:49,920
And he said, first, everything came in the form of images.

1834
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:55,320
And then he felt the deep emotional desire to communicate.

1835
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:58,760
And that's what led him to create formulas.

1836
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,960
I think that's so beautiful because it's an imagination,

1837
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:05,240
emotion, and the desire for communication, which has to

1838
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:08,960
be part of science.

1839
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,360
And so that's a little bit of a background to the question

1840
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,840
which may otherwise sound a little bit out in left field.

1841
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:20,400
But I'm really struck at now how neuroscience departments are

1842
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:24,880
hiring physicists, and that there's some way in which

1843
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:29,240
neuroscience is bringing the psyche together, which is the

1844
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:34,600
source of imagery and emotion with the sciences.

1845
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:40,520
So I wondered, I think Yale has started on that as well, yes?

1846
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,480
So I'm not in the neuroscience department at Yale.

1847
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:45,320
So yeah, I can't speak for them.

1848
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:49,840
I think that I can try to answer it in some way and then see

1849
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,360
how other people feel.

1850
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:55,720
I think that one of the miraculous things about Einstein

1851
01:30:55,720 --> 01:31:00,800
and his theories was he was working with physics that we

1852
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,800
can't directly relate to, meaning, speed of light,

1853
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,720
special relativity in particular, speed of light,

1854
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,920
length contraction, time dilation, these things that we

1855
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,680
don't actually experience.

1856
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:18,600
And he set up very straightforward thought experiments.

1857
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,640
He put you on a train and had you turn on a flashlight.

1858
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:26,520
And he had two brothers or two astronauts and one of them

1859
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,520
travel and the other one stay at home.

1860
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:33,840
He set up images in some ways, stories, places that let you

1861
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,440
access that contradiction with something that you did

1862
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,440
understand.

1863
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,120
And I think that that is incredibly powerful.

1864
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:42,200
It's something we're floundering with with the Higgs,

1865
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:46,240
for example, to have this be something that we all can

1866
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,480
grapple with in ways that we can understand.

1867
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:53,920
I think that the ability that we have to imagine or to have

1868
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,920
actual images associated with what we're trying to understand,

1869
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,600
with the frameworks that we have, is really tied into how

1870
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,920
much progress we can make in terms of our scientific theories.

1871
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,440
So those two things, that's the only access I have to

1872
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,840
trying to answer your question.

1873
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,440
I don't know.

1874
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:15,560
In the March round table, Rob read the background of the

1875
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:16,000
people.

1876
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,720
So we have neuroscientists, but one of the people of that

1877
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:23,440
round table on the subject of consciousness is a physicist.

1878
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,960
So there is no question.

1879
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,200
And one of the people who's been at the round tables here a

1880
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:33,680
couple of times, Andrea California, who's a top-notch

1881
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:37,600
microbiologist who is close to discovering significant

1882
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,680
things about cancer.

1883
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:41,720
And he always says, he always thought he would go to

1884
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:46,320
physics, discover something, go to microbiology, discover

1885
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:50,520
cure of cancer, and then discover the cure of Alzheimer's.

1886
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:53,000
He's about to move to the Alzheimer's territory.

1887
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,880
And he was a physicist.

1888
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:58,560
So I think physics gives us tools to tackle complicated

1889
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,320
problems and to model complicated systems.

1890
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:06,200
And a lot of the, yeah, so I think there's a natural way

1891
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:09,120
that the different branches in science can interact with

1892
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,160
each other.

1893
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,080
More and more.

1894
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,440
Yeah, yeah.

1895
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,760
I'd like to touch on something that Mark brought up about

1896
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:19,840
the scientist as genius.

1897
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,520
And it seems like the Saren project with 3,000

1898
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:28,080
scientists, many of the major leaps, at least in the past

1899
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:32,160
in science like with Einstein, he was a lowly patent clerk in

1900
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:35,160
Beren when he did his four major papers on the photoelectric

1901
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:38,360
fact and his first theory is a relativity.

1902
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:41,920
And I was thinking about Copernicus, who was a church

1903
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:45,320
canon when he developed his helocentric theories, even

1904
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:48,040
though there had been prior helocentric theories going back

1905
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,720
to ancient Greece.

1906
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,600
But in some cases, the mere fact that you have collaborative

1907
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:59,160
effort, in Germany, they said that Einstein was a Jew and

1908
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:03,000
therefore his science was Jewish science, which was less

1909
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,120
accurate.

1910
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,600
And they burned his books.

1911
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:09,120
So the mere fact of having collaboration, in some cases,

1912
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,120
waters down science.

1913
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:14,040
So that's why you have, in many cases, the great leaps in

1914
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,760
science, at least in the past.

1915
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:18,480
You also had gentleman scientists, Le Boisier and others,

1916
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,320
who would be in their little laboratory.

1917
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:24,560
But they wouldn't necessarily have to listen to 20 other

1918
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:25,160
guys.

1919
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:28,040
And I was thinking again about Einstein, where 20 years at

1920
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:31,600
Princeton working on his field theory, he accomplished not a

1921
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,560
lot.

1922
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:37,560
Whereas in one year as a Beren patent clerk, he wrote four

1923
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:40,200
earth-shattering theories.

1924
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:44,040
So is it better, and again, going back to this genius theory

1925
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:48,160
of scientists, that isn't it better to be the little guy in

1926
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:51,200
the corner that everybody says you're wrong than being

1927
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:54,680
with the 3,000 people who say, this is what the consensus is.

1928
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:59,200
And just like with the Ptolemaic theory of the universe

1929
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:01,960
versus the Copernican theory, if you're going to go with the

1930
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:04,160
consensus, you're going to go with Ptolemaic.

1931
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:06,000
But if you're Copernicus, you're going to say, wait a

1932
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,520
second.

1933
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:10,560
I think that the sun is the center, not the earth.

1934
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,480
I would push back.

1935
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:16,120
Well, I think we need to get at the reason that there are

1936
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:19,320
thousands of us who are gathered at CERN working on this

1937
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,120
together.

1938
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:26,440
We are at the point where we are colliding protons at 99.

1939
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:32,840
99999999% of the speed of light.

1940
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,720
People have described that enterprise.

1941
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,200
I don't remember if this was in the film or not.

1942
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,040
But people have described the enterprises, the

1943
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,640
cathedrals of our time.

1944
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,960
The amount of resources that you need to muster, the ideas

1945
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:47,840
that go behind it, the building of the structure, the lone

1946
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:51,320
person working in the corner is not going to make a large

1947
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:52,880
Hadron Collider.

1948
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,120
This is a $7 billion machine.

1949
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:01,600
So I think that a lot of the collaboration, it's part of

1950
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,200
what makes it so fascinating.

1951
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:07,160
As a species, if we're going to take the next step in this

1952
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:11,760
exploration, we need to pool our resources, financial,

1953
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,880
intellectual, passion.

1954
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:18,120
We need to all bring that to bear to answer some of these

1955
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,080
questions.

1956
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:23,640
Now, what we're doing at CERN is testing theories.

1957
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:28,120
And coming up with ideas for sure.

1958
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:31,240
But a lot of the intellectual work that we're doing is

1959
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:34,200
trying to figure out how with this physical experimental

1960
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:37,800
apparatus, we can access something like supersymmetry

1961
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:40,280
or the multiverse or go after some of those ideas.

1962
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:44,520
So there certainly is still room for people in different

1963
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:48,240
pockets around the world to be thinking on their own.

1964
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:55,440
But the enterprise at CERN is justified and required and

1965
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,760
yeah, an incredible challenge.

1966
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:02,040
And I would say, with respect to Einstein, I don't think

1967
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:05,440
that most people think that if Einstein was tackling

1968
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:10,080
Grand Unified Theory when he was 20, he would have solved

1969
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,080
it.

1970
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:13,160
I think it's also very much a matter of the time and the

1971
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,160
problems.

1972
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:16,160
And this is another thing that Sava says that I think is

1973
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:20,360
really, really very trenchant at the beginning where he says,

1974
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:23,920
what distinguishes a great scientist?

1975
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:29,240
You have to know what's the right question to ask.

1976
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:33,040
And it has to be the right time for there to be a solution

1977
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,600
that you can understand.

1978
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:38,320
And that time when Einstein was coming up with a

1979
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:42,080
photollectric effect and relativity, it was the right time.

1980
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:45,520
And he made advances.

1981
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:50,760
But it was about asking the right questions as almost the

1982
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,200
first question.

1983
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,760
I mean, the first issue.

1984
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,880
He knew the question asked and it was the right time and

1985
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,120
there was the right things happening.

1986
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:59,880
It was the time to solve it.

1987
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,720
And that's what Sava says.

1988
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:04,480
Really, the time to solve it was then.

1989
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:09,040
And I don't know that it would have been different later.

1990
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:12,160
I mean, because there are many brilliant people that have

1991
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:16,120
come since Einstein and have tackled these problems and the

1992
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:18,720
time hasn't come to get it yet.

1993
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:19,720
So.

1994
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,720
OK.

1995
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:21,720
Any other questions?

1996
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:22,720
Yes.

1997
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:29,160
Among the points of intersection art and science.

1998
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,160
I'm a painter and was male in graduate school.

1999
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,160
Was there representation?

2000
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:36,400
Well, landscape painter, which always kind of irritated me

2001
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:40,040
because I always just considered a painting.

2002
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:44,200
So down the road, having done a lot of paintings, so you can

2003
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:47,080
be painting like the energy and inherent nature, whatever

2004
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:49,160
that meant, or seemed to mean.

2005
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:52,560
And then reading about or hearing that, well, scientists

2006
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:59,760
consider the nature of things as chaotic, swarming,

2007
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:05,080
intersecting energies or patterns, chaotic patterns.

2008
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:08,360
Somehow, it's come out in the work in a weird kind of way.

2009
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:11,080
I just was curious what physicists would have to say

2010
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,840
about that.

2011
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:16,760
I don't think I'm illustrating science, but some of these

2012
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,360
coming out of the work.

2013
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:21,760
Pollock said, when somebody said, why don't you pay nature?

2014
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,920
He said, I am nature.

2015
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,120
The materials nature, the materials energy.

2016
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:27,960
I'm energy.

2017
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:28,680
Makes sense?

2018
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,000
That's interesting.

2019
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,320
So I have a colleague who, well, so one of the theories

2020
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,800
that's really challenging to interact with

2021
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,760
is quantum mechanics, I think, where

2022
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:44,560
you have probabilities that are governing what will happen

2023
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,240
or what will be measured, as opposed

2024
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:53,360
to push a box and see how far it will slide before it stops.

2025
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:57,920
So I have a colleague who says that he thinks in terms

2026
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,400
of quantum mechanics.

2027
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:02,000
And he said this to me multiple times.

2028
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,160
And I always ask him, I say, I don't

2029
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,040
believe that you think in terms of quantum mechanics,

2030
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:09,080
because you couldn't drive a car if you think

2031
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:10,320
in terms of quantum mechanics.

2032
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,160
It's just not possible.

2033
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,160
So maybe what you're asking, or maybe what you're saying,

2034
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:20,520
is that you're removed from a framework of the macroscopic

2035
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:25,960
or of how we tend to look at the landscape

2036
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:28,000
and seeing something else there.

2037
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,040
And I think that people have used that kind of art

2038
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,640
to try to access ideas within physics of quantum mechanics.

2039
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,840
It's almost like I get the civic time

2040
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:40,880
that inverters and power planets have to go about the energy.

2041
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,760
But it's interesting, because also,

2042
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:48,320
when you're saying that your collaborator accuses you

2043
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,880
of having a scientific cultural bias,

2044
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:54,080
that you're being affected by cultural bias in science,

2045
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:57,000
I actually see it going much more the other direction.

2046
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,480
That I do see people, I mean, it's

2047
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:01,600
fascinating even from a language,

2048
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,400
a linguistic perspective.

2049
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,960
Quantum is used in so many instances.

2050
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,640
It has nothing to do with science.

2051
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,720
There are so many instances of this

2052
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:15,280
where popular culture has taken over these words.

2053
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:17,080
And I think one of the really interesting things

2054
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:20,560
that I thought about a lot during making a film,

2055
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:25,080
and general is that in both science and art,

2056
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,120
in the beginning of the 20th century,

2057
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,440
what happened is very significant,

2058
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,040
that in both cases they went to abstraction.

2059
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:35,320
And so before that, painting was very literal

2060
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:36,800
and science was very literal.

2061
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,320
Anybody of sort of normal intelligence,

2062
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:43,040
you can understand laws of physics and painting.

2063
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,520
And suddenly in both the arts and the science,

2064
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:49,040
we went to abstraction and it required specialists.

2065
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:54,560
And that seems to have a dialectical language.

2066
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,640
I don't need to electrolyze it.

2067
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:56,520
Just do it.

2068
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,360
It's about a flow of work.

2069
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,160
But just whether it's good painting or a bad painting,

2070
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,600
I think you can see it.

2071
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,720
I think that there's been throughout history,

2072
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,800
back and forth between science and art.

2073
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,960
And there's a very interesting book Leonard Schlaine wrote

2074
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,560
called Physics and Art.

2075
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:16,280
And he looks at the parallels in which,

2076
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:20,640
in often in many instances, art led science

2077
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:22,520
in terms of making and breakthrough,

2078
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:26,760
in terms of perspective, in terms of light,

2079
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:28,120
in terms of many things.

2080
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:32,600
So I would say what you're feeling

2081
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:37,600
is the end of a long process that's been ongoing.

2082
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,440
He used to be going.

2083
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:41,040
It's fascinating what this all about,

2084
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:42,280
what the time the editor is.

2085
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:43,280
Yeah.

2086
