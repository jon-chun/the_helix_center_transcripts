1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Well, good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,360
This is the Gillics Center roundtable.

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,160
The date today is February 26, 2022.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,640
And I'm pleased to present to you our esteemed panel for today.

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,280
I'll make a few brief comments first.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,680
I'm Jerry Herowitz.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,440
I'm the associate director at Gillics Center.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,280
And we're continuing this Zoom and YouTube format for the meantime.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,480
And we're not sure about our next.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,920
I think we're going to be in Zoom next time also.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,280
And that date for our next talk is March 12.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,720
Yes, sorry.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,280
I think September, October would be when we would be live.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,160
Very important.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,840
Good.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,840
So March 12 will be our next roundtable.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,640
And the topic there will be psychedelics.

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,720
It might not matter to you whether it's March 12,

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,920
if you're taking psychedelics.

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,600
But anyway, that's the date of it.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,120
And it should be really interesting, really interesting talk.

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,520
And we are targeting April 30 as the date for our last talk

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,440
of the spring season, which will be on metaphysics.

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,920
Today, we are pleased to be presenting a panel with the main theme

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,840
of economics in the present and the near future.

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,840
But we have some non-economists and economists.

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,320
And I'd like to take a moment now and describe to you

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,800

of social disapproval in a globalized digitized world

60
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,000
and of the playbook, how to deny science, sell lies,

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,520
and make a killing in the corporate world,

62

103
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,720
And Richard Powers is an environmental

104
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,720
and ecological economist who studied the interplay

105
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,080
between economic analysis and the ecological, moral,

106
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,960
and social dimensions of environmental governance.

and intergenerational justice, climate stabilization policy,

110
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,720
the ethical foundation of voluntary pro-environmental

111
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,720
behaviors, and the relationship between economic growth,

112
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,160
environmental quality, and human well-being

113
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,960
is mediated by endogenous social norms.

114
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,560
Professor Howard graduated Sumit Komal from the Biology

115
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,440

116
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,520
and holds an MS in land resources from the University

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,080
of Wisconsin-Madison.

118
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,680
He received his PhD from the Energy and Resource Group

119
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,800
of the University of California at Berkeley in 1990,

120
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,200
where he collaborated with Richard B. Norgaard

121
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,360
on the economics of natural resources

122
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,920
and sustainable development.

123
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,920
So that's as short as I can make it,

124
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,760
introduction to our esteemed panel.

125
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,040
I wanted to just start off by quoting Charles Hindelberger,

126
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,200
the economics historian who mentioned just very tersely

127
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,200
that how history is particular in economics as general.

128
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,680
And I mentioned to some of our panelists

129
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,120
in advance of our talk how much I found it interesting

130
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,080
that economics is being pressed into dealing with a lot

131
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,520
of rapid change and instability in the world,

132
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,240
which we're facing now, which includes, of course,

133
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,880
climate change, mass migrations, supply chain disruptions,

134
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,080
et cetera, et cetera.

135
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,440
Now we know, of course, of this dreadful tragedy

136
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,360
going on in the Ukraine, which is going to almost

137
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,560
certainly impact all of these different domains.

138
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,240
So I want to open the floor to whoever wants to take

139
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,240
a quick stab at introducing the conversation

140
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,560
and getting a rolling, and then we'll just take it from there.

141
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Well, if I may, I think that the present reality

142
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,000
after the invasion of Ukraine reminds us

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,560
that we should be humbler in more humble

144
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,720
in terms of making predictions.

145
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,760
I mean, we are talking about the long run.

146
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,080
I thought that's what was our topic today.

147
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,280
And unfortunately, even in the short run,

148
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,240
we see instability we didn't anticipate.

149
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,400
So from my point of view, that means that it's crucial

150
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,400
to think of what really works in human behavior

151
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,480
but economists think really works.

152
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,840
And think of that, which is going to remain there

153
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,840
no matter what happens in world politics and world affairs.

154
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,880
And I would underline the issue of incentives,

155
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,040
that incentives work.

156
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,660
People being paid more are going to work harder.

157
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,200
The lower taxation on investment can make a huge difference

158
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,080
to drive economic growth.

159
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,080
And the crucial aspect of education,

160
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,080
that education, persistent excellence in education

161
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,160
has driven innovation in the United States

162
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,040
and other countries of the world

163
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,880
where education was underlined.

164
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,560
And as an academic, I have to express my concerns

165
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,560
for the cheapening of education, making exams easier,

166
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,560
making, allowing people to perform well

167
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,920
when they're not performing well,

168
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,800
showing them as if they're performing well.

169
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,280
So these are kind of the long run issues

170
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,280
that come up to mind as we think of what might survive

171
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,040
the upheaval that we're seeing in the world these days.

172
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,800
So let me start from there

173
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,800
and let other people have a chance to say more.

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,840
Thank you.

175
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,040
I don't wanna preempt the woman on the panel.

176
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,280
And generally in Zooms, I respect that.

177
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,400
I don't know if I'm the oldest one here, probably not.

178
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,560
But nevertheless, I'll say a few things

179
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,880
to try to provoke the conversation

180
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,880
because I think I'm probably the most left-wing person

181
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,360
on the panel.

182
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,120
And so I'll try to live up to that.

183
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
My motto is be as radical as reality itself

184
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,840
and taking radical as a good thing,

185
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,080
being going to the root.

186
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,080
So I come, let me read a quick quotation

187
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,720
from my latest book, The Global Solar Commons.

188
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,720
This is from the editorial board of the Financial Times,

189
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,800
right at the beginning of the pandemic.

190
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,240
And it said, radical reforms are required to forge

191
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,800
a society that will work for all.

192
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,400
Governments will have to accept the more active role

193
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,360
in the economy, they must see public services

194
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,040
as investments rather than liabilities

195
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,680
and look for ways to make labor markets less insecure.

196
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,240
Read distribution will again be on the agenda.

197
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Policies until recently considered eccentric

198
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,840
such as wealth taxes will have to be in the mix.

199
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,960
So again, I come from a physical natural science background.

200
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,440
That's my expertise, I'm not an economist,

201
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,480
but I am most concerned on how the physical economy

202
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,760
will need to be developed that is compatible

203
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,800
with preventing catastrophic climate change

204
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,160
and protecting biodiversity.

205
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,880
And that again has really deep implications

206
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,520
through the political economy, which as an ego socialist,

207
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,520
I find fossil capitalism to be obsolete

208
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,720
and a profound barrier to preventing catastrophic climate change.

209
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,720
So I'll conclude by saying again as for provocation

210
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,040
that a militarized fossil capital that we now see in play

211
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,040
with this war that's going on

212
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,040
is the main obstacle to forging a world

213
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,720
where you have cooperation necessary

214
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,200
to prevent climate catastrophe.

215
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,240
So I hope that's not superbocative.

216
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,600
I hope it's more provocative.

217
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,960
Thank you.

218
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,400
That's perfectly provocative.

219
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,720
Anyone want to take a response to that?

220
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,200
I was going to say that I think you're trying to combine

221
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,640
some of these first two comments.

222
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,880
I'm on the one side talking about being as radical

223
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,600
as the world is on the other side,

224
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,200
sort of reinforcing our interest

225
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,680
in competence, education and competence.

226
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,960
Who's interesting to note the performance of the CDC

227
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,080
in the face of the pandemic.

228
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,400
And of course it did have also economic implications

229
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,320
that were quite strong and not something the CDC

230
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,000
probably normally welcomes as a challenge.

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,760
But here you have an institution that was really felt

232
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,120
to be rather competent.

233
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,720
And by some folks reckoning it struggled a lot anyway.

234
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,840
And I think in part struggled because of their rapidity

235
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,160
of onset of the particular stresses we were facing.

236
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,960
So I wonder if people want to comment on that at all.

237
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,440
May I comment on the previous speakers' ideas?

238
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,640
I think that it's very, very important

239
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,640
to keep in place incentives for investment and growth.

240
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,880
And I think that people who want the distribution

241
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,280
have to take that into consideration.

242
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,960
The idea that suddenly there is this gold mine there

243
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,560
in which we can all tap and distribute to the poor

244
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,920
without taking to account what effect this will have

245
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,160
on investment and growth is just foolish.

246
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,920
I'm sorry, it could be a great radical idea

247
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,640
but it's just foolish.

248
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,640
I mean, we need to be able to invest in growth.

249
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,720
And that works through incentives.

250
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,720
And incentives of the government provides tax incentives

251
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,280
for growth.

252
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,600
So we shouldn't really eliminate them.

253
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,480
And that's serious.

254
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,320
I mean, it's not trivial to just put it under the carpet.

255
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,440
No matter what kind of other objectives we have,

256
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,840
we have to make sure that this happens.

257
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,840
And in particular, the United States is facing

258
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,480
a huge challenge, not from Russia, but from China

259
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,640
on this issue.

260
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,720
China is about to overtake the United States economically

261
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,240
in a few years.

262
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,240
If we focus on redistribution without thinking

263
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,760
of investment and growth, this will happen very quickly,

264
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,240
the overtaking of the United States by China.

265
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,240
And being second or being third is really not good.

266
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,200
People haven't lived it in our lifetime.

267
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,160
The United States was always first

268
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,320
and therefore the issue didn't really come up.

269
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,320
But if we are second or third in the next five or 10 years,

270
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,280
that will hurt us.

271
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,000
And that's very, very important.

272
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So without putting down in any way David's radicals ideas,

273
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,400
I think it's very important,

274
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,400
I think it's very important to keep the investment incentives

275
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,440
and the excellence in education,

276
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,240
investment in special, I mean, investment in education,

277
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
especially for the top institutions,

278
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,120
the top academic institutions,

279
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,200
because this has driven innovation

280
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,760
with all kinds of positive effects, externalities

281
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,480
in the United States.

282
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,560
Let me briefly respond,

283
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,080
and then I'll be quiet for quite a while, if you don't mind.

284
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,480
I agree with you, Nicholas.

285
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,560
We do need incentives.

286
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,680
Right now the incentives,

287
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,360
the IMF estimates that the subsidies

288
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,560
for fossil fuel direct and indirect

289
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,440
total nearly $6 trillion a year,

290
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,520
that's certainly an incentive,

291
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,200
powerful incentive for the continuation

292
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,120
of the burning of fossil fuel globally.

293
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,920
And so those incentives should be shifted to green capital.

294
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,120
Absolutely, we need green growth,

295
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,120
not to say that green capital doesn't have its own problems,

296
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,120
but certainly in terms of curbing fossil fuel consumption

297
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,760
as fast as possible, which is necessary

298
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,760
for any chance of meeting one and a half degree warming limit,

299
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,160
we need to promote green capital,

300
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,720
defeat fossil capital and form a global alliance

301
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,920
with green capital.

302
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,760
So I agree with you, there are incentives

303
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
that are necessary.

304
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,080
We probably agree more than you think,

305
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,120
and I'll be quiet now.

306
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,760
I'll jump in, I'll say that from this angle,

307
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,800
I see a set of intersecting,

308
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,320
interlocking global crises,

309
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,760
that all are linked to the history of the last 30 years

310
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,120
in globalization 1.0.

311
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,520
And we deregulated financial markets.

312
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,240
We decided not to move away from oil and gas

313
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,760
in the United States, at least we decided that in Europe,

314
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,920
the approach to Russia was about market liberalization,

315
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,760
the idea that interdependence would turn Russia

316
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,920
into a liberal democracy.

317
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,000
And just on that last, and then Germany in particular,

318
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,480
in Europe became very dependent on natural gas

319
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,560
for reasons that are complex.

320
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,080
But in some ways, you could ask whether that focus

321
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,560
on market liberalization,

322
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,720
does that humor aimed back in ways

323
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,760
that have contributed to the current crisis in Ukraine?

324
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,120
I'm not sure that that's right,

325
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,680
but that's a question that's on my mind

326
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,840
that I'll put that there.

327
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,020
Can I add a little bit on incentives as well?

328
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,160
Of course, incentives are important.

329
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,680
The reason we're in, the mess we're in right now

330
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,920
is precisely because we've been sending people

331
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,360
the wrong incentives.

332
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,400
You discharge CO2 into the air,

333
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,280
that has costs on everybody.

334
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,000
Nobody pays an extra fee for the right to do that.

335
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,520
We could do it without charge now.

336
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,800
We never should have allowed that incentive

337
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,040
to remain in place.

338
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,400
We need to make massive public investment now

339
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,000
in order to achieve climate stability.

340
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,680
And there's very little time left

341
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,680
to meet the objective of avoiding temperature increases

342
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,880
greater than 1.5 degrees Celsius,

343
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,880
which read David Wallace Wells' book.

344
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,680
If you haven't, there are grim fates in store

345
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,040
for us in every country,

346
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,480
if we let temperature rise more than that.

347
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,280
So we've got to act quickly.

348
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,680
And I think the investments we need to make,

349
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,880
many can come in the private sector.

350
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,920
We can guide them as we have in the past

351
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,920
with subsidies for renewable energy investments and the like.

352
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,920
There is now a very exciting new technology

353
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,880
developed by ClimbWorks in Switzerland

354
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,000
to suck carbon out of the air

355
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,680
and turn it into a carbon-based slurry

356
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,160
that you pump deep underground.

357
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,240
And it's very expensive now,

358
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,360
but we're on a track to have the cost of that come down

359
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,320
rapidly enough to where it too could make a difference.

360
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,880
But all this is going to require an enormous amount of money.

361
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,880
We've got an enormous amount of money.

362
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,440
That's not the problem.

363
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,040
The problem is to persuade people to part

364
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,960
with what they're using the money for now

365
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,720
and to use it instead for these other things,

366
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,600
that if we don't use it for them,

367
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,600
there's not going to be a future for us.

368
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,160
And so I think that means if you want to be practical,

369
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,800
looking to the top of the income pyramid,

370
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,840
there's enormous resources there.

371
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,480
We've been hearing about wealth taxes

372
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,640
and how small the bite they need to take

373
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,120
in order to generate enormous pools of resources

374
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,800
to invest in these public projects that need to happen.

375
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,560
I'm not worried about people lacking incentives

376
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,760
to grow wealthy if they have to pay a little bit more in tax.

377
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,080
There's a huge literature on the determinants

378
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,480
of human flourishing.

379
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,760
It's contentious.

380
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,120
People argue about many of the findings in it.

381
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,240
The one thing they don't argue about,

382
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,400
the one really secure finding that's held up in every study

383
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,360
is that beyond a certain point,

384
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,240
and it's one we've long since passed,

385
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,800
and most countries in the West have too,

386
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,280
further increases in consumption

387
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,280
serve only to raise the bar that we think of as adequate.

388
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,800
So if all the mansions get 10% bigger,

389
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,000
the people living in them aren't any happier,

390
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,760
any healthier than they were before.

391
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,760
If the cars get bigger, people aren't only not happier.

392
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,600
They're at more risk of death and injury.

393
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,880
We burn up more fossil fuels.

394
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,320
All of these things could be changed

395
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,640
if we changed people's incentives,

396
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,720
and we've got simple tax levers that can do that.

397
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,280
So yes, incentives are important,

398
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,880
and we've been steering people with the wrong incentives.

399
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,520
Thus far, that's why we're in the best that we're in.

400
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,320
I guess I should jump in to just ask,

401
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,960
you know, a kind of meta question about economics

402
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,080
or the field of economics,

403
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,160
which is something I grapple with,

404
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,680
is how much is the field of economics itself

405
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,480
responsible for those misaligned incentives?

406
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,320
And so I'm one of the people here who did major in economics

407
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,000
as an undergrad, then a master's in economics,

408
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and realized I did not want to get a PhD in economics.

409
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,120
I know Rich, you and Bob have survived the field,

410
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,240
and I'm sort of curious, you know,

411
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,680
when Nicholas says like, what really works?

412
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,280
How much should we look to economists for what really works?

413
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,520
I feel like we've been gravely misled

414
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,280
by some of the assumptions and ideologies of the field.

415
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,160
And also some serious levers for human behavior

416
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,480
have been overlooked, including reputation, of course,

417
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,320
and reputation being the primary mechanism

418
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,760
to enforce the Paris Agreement.

419
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,800
And it's something economists don't,

420
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
I think, address very well.

421
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,160
And I've been very disturbed more recently

422
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,760
by the fact that, you know,

423
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,880
the student divestment movement around fossil fuels,

424
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,080
the pushback within academia has come primarily

425
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
from economics professors.

426
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,520
And this strikes me again as an area of tension

427
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,640
where we have this kind of hubris

428
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,640
about what really works in an era of mass unpredictability

429
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,720
and a kind of lack of humility, I would say,

430
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,800
on the part of economists in general,

431
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,720
not, of course, specifically to anyone in this roundtable,

432
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,840
but about, you know, asking what really works.

433
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,080
When psychologists start winning the Nobel Prize in economics,

434
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,800
you should start doubting, you know,

435
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,380
the tenets of your discipline.

436
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Well, I think that's the thing.

437
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,720
I mean, if we're going to be serious about it,

438
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,600
you cannot attack a field of study.

439
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,040
I mean, seriously, I mean, that would be just dumb.

440
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,640
I mean, there is diversity among people.

441
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,880
People have right used the same quantitative tools

442
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,320
with different assumptions

443
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,960
and they're all different conclusions.

444
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,520
Not the way I see economics.

445
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,600
Like people would do that in physics

446
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,920
or in psychology or in other fields.

447
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,160
It's a science, you know, not everybody agrees.

448
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,600
But I think practically everybody agrees

449
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,960
that incentives work.

450
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,920
And I think that Robert's ideas

451
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,600
about how to change incentives are, in my opinion,

452
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,880
very important.

453
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,440
And society as a whole has to think seriously

454
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,040
what possibilities there are there.

455
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,040
I think there is a conflict between trying to take away

456
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,160
the wealth of whoever is the wealth individual,

457
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,080
or whatever that is,

458
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,600
and trying to create the right incentives

459
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,120
even for the objectives that you were talking about

460
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,120
of green growth, for example.

461
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,120
I mean, there could be a lot of different ways

462
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,280
to achieve that green growth without screwing up

463
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,040
the incentives of the society for investment.

464
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,120
Because after all, you know,

465
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,160
when we're talking about wealth individuals

466
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,960
with multi-billion dollar wealth,

467
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,800
when we take away, let's say a billion dollars

468
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,760
or 10 billion dollars from them,

469
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,720
we're not changing consumption

470
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,120
because these people cannot possibly consume

471
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,440
that amount of money.

472
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,720
We're taking it away from investment.

473
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,720
So that would have to be, you know, truthful about it.

474
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,320
We're taking it away from investment.

475
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,080
So the real question is,

476
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,680
is the government good in doing investments?

477
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,120
And everybody knows that it's not true.

478
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,480
It's not true.

479
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,160
The government, if you give it 10 billion dollars,

480
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,000
it's going to be wasted to a very large extent.

481
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,800
And we all agree on that.

482
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,360
So we have to think of ways in which the incentives

483
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,760
are set up so that the private sector produces

484
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,640
what we want, the green growth that we all agree we want.

485
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,440
So we need to think of that.

486
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,880
And this is a serious issue.

487
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,360
I mean, it's not trivial.

488
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,240
And we need to work on it.

489
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,680
I mean, how can I put it?

490
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,760
I mean, just general declarations,

491
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,480
let's take the portal that Bezos has.

492
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,080
I mean, that doesn't, we'll not get us anywhere.

493
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,440
We need to think of incentives

494
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,680
for the private sector to invest in this areas

495
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,240
that we're interested to invest.

496
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,480
Thank you.

497
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,880
And luxury fever, in 1990, I came out

498
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,840
and you had the graduated conception tax.

499
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,640
And that's a really good idea, because we live in a society

500
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,880
that is Galbraith said back in the 50s,

501
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,400
is characterized by what?

502
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,320
Private splendor and public squalor.

503
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,080
And we're arguably, because of status externalities

504
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,680
and positional goods, we've constructed a society

505
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,600
where we have excessive levels of private consumption

506
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,280
and we under invest in public goods

507
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,960
and in public infrastructure.

508
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
And I think I agree with Robert Frank

509
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,440
that most of, or many of the investments that now

510
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,640
are most important, the public sector has to be in the lead

511
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,600
on that and it has to be done at a global level.

512
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,880
And so what works, I think, is something

513
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,960
that looks more like social democracy

514
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,880
than like laissez-fieck fear of capitalism.

515
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,440
Now, maybe we need to look back at what works

516
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,240
in the New Deal era in the 50s and 60s.

517
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,240
There are some problems there, but maybe we need to go back

518
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,680
towards a better balance between the public

519
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
and private sector.

520
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,160
And it should be incentive-based

521
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,400
and it should be investment-focused.

522
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,320
Nick, you said we all agree that when government

523
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
invests they do a bad job of it,

524
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,160
I don't think we all agree about that,

525
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,600
at least I don't agree with it.

526
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,680
They do a bad job in some cases,

527
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,040
but in other cases there are investments

528
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,240
that the private sector simply doesn't have any incentive

529
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,640
to make so that even if the government did a poor job

530
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,480
with them it would be better than not seeing them happen

531
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,480
at all, but there are plenty of examples

532
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,160
where the government's done a splendidly good job

533
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,360
with public investment.

534
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,520
I mean, there are massive public works,

535
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,840
product programs all over the world

536
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,320
that do an enormous amount of good for the citizens

537
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,800
of their countries.

538
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,120
Why do we insist that the government's not pretty good

539
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,360
at things like that?

540
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,600
If I may, I mean, I would say the reason why the government

541
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,800
might not be as good as you think on that

542
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,800
is because the government is run by politicians

543
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,240
and politicians need to be reelected.

544
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,400
So on top of their minds is how they're going to please

545
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,760
the public and to get the real act.

546
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,760
And one way to please the public is to take this money

547
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,560
that they have under their control and double it down,

548
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,720
give it to the public rather than invest it,

549
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,520
even though you're absolutely right, Robert,

550
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,920
that investing it in some public goods

551
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,480
is in fact an excellent idea.

552
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,160
There are of course aspects of the economy

553
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,360
where the incentives for the private sector are not big enough.

554
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,320
I mean, that's for sure.

555
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,440
But the problem is that there is a conflict

556
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,560
at the government level because we are human beings.

557
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,560
We're run by politicians whose top priority

558
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,600
is to get reelected and there's no doubt about that.

559
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,560
The top priority is not to make the United States great.

560
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,160
The top priority is to get reelected.

561
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,520
And to do that, they're going to distribute the money

562
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,600
to the voters.

563
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,320
And that's in that problem is going to be there,

564
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,520
no matter what government we have,

565
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,720
as long as we have an elected government,

566
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,000
it's going to be there.

567
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,360
And therefore we need to take it into account and say,

568
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,360
well, do we really want to give huge amounts of money

569
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,000
from the private sector to the public sector?

570
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,280
Or we know it has less productivity.

571
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,120
Are we, do we need to do that?

572
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,960
Except for a very essential stuff,

573
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,400
like national defense, for example,

574
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,200
in which we don't want to give it to the private sector.

575
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,680
So it's important to think about it

576
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,280
and not jump to conclusions and say,

577
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,200
oh yeah, great.

578
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,240
I mean, that just because the government

579
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,920
is doing some good job in some investments,

580
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,240
let's give them a huge project,

581
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,840
which is the green project to them.

582
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,280
But rather try to find ways to do it in the private sector.

583
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,240
I just like to.

584
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,880
I would challenge that, Nicholas,

585
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,400
because that analysis,

586
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,680
because how do politicians get elected?

587
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,000
Undiably, we now have less of a democracy

588
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and more of a plutocracy.

589
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,280
And knowing the amount of money

590
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,760
from the big corporate sector

591
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,200
that goes into campaign funds.

592
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,040
So that has distorted our democracy.

593
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,160
And many people have pointed that out.

594
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,880
So therefore, the politicians that are elected

595
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,840
tend to serve the interests

596
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,960
of their big campaign contributors.

597
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,160
This is not rocket science.

598
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,360
I would add in terms of what I would call

599
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,480
trickle down economics or neoliberal economics,

600
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,040
which basically that's what I'm hearing from you.

601
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,360
With all respect, I am.

602
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,360
And let me give a case study from my community in D.C.

603
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,880
We have an elected city, a local government.

604
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Of course, we don't have statehood.

605
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,640
We're fighting for it.

606
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,800
And actually, the big prime instrument

607
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,880
of fossil capital, Senator Manchin,

608
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,120
is blocking that among a few others

609
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,840
to actually have self-determination.

610
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,160
But our own economic policies and social policies

611
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,200
in our D.C. have been dominated by trickle down economics.

612
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,800
And what has this resulted in?

613
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,280
D.C. now has the biggest life expectancy gap

614
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,800
in the country compared to 50 states

615
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,680
between black and white residents.

616
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,920
It actually has grown in the last 20 years.

617
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,600
It's shockingly high.

618
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,400
And this is a reflection of where the priorities

619
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,400
of public spending and the fact that our politicians

620
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,240
that are in power in our local government

621
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,680
are basically beholden to the big developer class,

622
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
which has gentrified D.C.,

623
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,680
which has forced residents out, long-term residents.

624
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,680
And so I'm going by our own experience in our local government,

625
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,800
our local community in terms of the impacts of these policies.

626
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,920
And we also have seen in the pandemic

627
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,840
how the billionaire class has grown even richer

628
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,400
and income inequality has grown.

629
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,720
And finally, what does that mean to health?

630
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,720
If we look at the life expectancy of in the United States,

631
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,720
compared to its cohort of wealthy countries,

632
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,560
we're ranked about 40 in the world.

633
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
A matter of fact, Cuba and the US

634
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,160
have about the same life expectancy now.

635
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I wonder if I, I think, I'm sorry, David,

636
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,160
so Jennifer, you also had something to add at that point.

637
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,560
I'm gonna mute.

638
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,560
I would just say that, of course, you can attack an entire field.

639
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,520
I mean, we have many times in the past,

640
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,760
we attacked the field of eugenics right now,

641
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,000
critical race theory is under attack.

642
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,600
You can most certainly attack a whole field.

643
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,320
And I think it's worth questioning,

644
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,200
especially with the premise of this roundtable

645
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,680
was about the sort of role of the dismal science of economics,

646
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,160
which is not, of course, in fact, a science.

647
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,320
Economics uses scientific tools, it uses empiricism.

648
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,560
But if you know anything about the epistemology of science,

649
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,080
terms like good and necessary growth

650
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,120
or trickle down economics, these are all normative assumptions.

651
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,360
They're all values that we bring,

652
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,920
rich I see you nodding, I'm sure,

653
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,840
ecological economics has these kind of arguments all the time

654
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,360
about the values that are baked into the research.

655
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,920
And so I think what I'm interested in

656
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,760
is the way in which, especially members of this panel

657
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,400
have grappled with some of those assumptions

658
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,480
in the field of economics and are trying to modernize

659
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,400
or make them relevant to the 21st century,

660
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,400
make them less glaringly insufficient

661
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,880
as they were, I think, in the 20th.

662
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,960
I mean, that's a good question.

663
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,840
I mean, I also say that the government,

664
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,960
democracy isn't working well in America.

665
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,560
What is working well is the ability of corporations

666
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,120
to get all a distance left that who pursue corporate interests.

667
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,280
And so we've been through 30 or 40 years of that.

668
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,200
We have an economy now that is built around rent capture

669
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,400
and rent seeking.

670
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,080
And a lot of what we call investment

671
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,280
is about the financialization of the economy.

672
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,040
But as our economy has become more financialized,

673
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,960
then innovation has gone down, not up.

674
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,680
And what we've seen then is a capture of wealth by capital

675
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,280
that the extensive labor or workers use that drum,

676
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,880
because capital isn't an entity,

677
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,480
capital is a factor of production.

678
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,840
But what we have seen is an economy

679
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,320
because of the financialization and the emphasis

680
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,240
on rent seeking and rent capture.

681
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,600
We have an economy that is less fair,

682
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,760
it's less productive, we're not able to solve

683
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,240
some of the crucial problems that I mentioned earlier

684
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,440
with globalization 1.0.

685
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,280
So.

686
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,040
That's in a way giving support to Nick's arguments

687
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,600
about not wanting to give the government more resources

688
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,840
because they're in the pocket of corporate interests.

689
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,160
Of course, they're not gonna spend the resources

690
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,760
we give them in the public interest.

691
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,640
I think it's important, that is a problem.

692
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,640
I totally am quick to acknowledge if that's a serious problem.

693
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,440
But it's not an insurmountable problem.

694
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,080
As we know from the surveys done every year

695
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,040
by an organization headquartered in Berlin,

696
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,880
it's called Transparency International.

697
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,840
They interview people in countries all around the world.

698
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:20,320
The kinds of questions they ask are of the sort.

699
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,760
How do you feel about your government?

700
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,920
Do you feel you get good value for your tax payments?

701
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,880
Do you feel the people in charge of your government

702
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,440
are honest and general free of corruption?

703
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,360
There are seven or eight or nine or 10,

704
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,760
depending on how you count countries that end up

705
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,840
at the top of that survey each and every year.

706
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,200
The Scandinavian countries are there, New Zealand is there,

707
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,480
Singapore interestingly is there.

708
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,400
These citizens feel like, yes, our government's really

709
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,400
delivering good value for the money we pay in a taxes.

710
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,720
The United States doesn't do very well in that survey.

711
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,720
And I think really if we maintain a narrative

712
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,840
where government is evil and government is wasteful,

713
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,080
it becomes harder to attract talented people to serve

714
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,920
in government.

715
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,600
Why would you want to be a bureaucrat if everybody

716
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,160
thinks you're just wasting their money?

717
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,160
You've got to work hard to build a good government.

718
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,040
We had a woman elected here in Ithaca

719
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,400
to be the Tompkins County Clerk.

720
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,920
She happens to be in charge of the Department

721
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,480
of Motor Vehicles, the favorite whipping boy

722
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,280
of all government agencies.

723
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,200
So you don't want the whole government to be run

724
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,360
like the DMV, don't send them any money.

725
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,760
She said, no, we're gonna turn this agency around.

726
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,120
She had the staff trained.

727
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:55,120
She got a mission for all the DMB

728
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,920
line, the payment system that they used.

729
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,480
And now it's a pleasure to go to the DMV here.

730
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,880
I sold a car recently to a guy in Rochester.

731
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,480
He said, I'd come and pick it up there,

732
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,320
but I don't have plates to drive.

733
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,480
I said, come register it at an RDMB.

734
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,880
Said, no, it's gonna be an awful experience.

735
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,080
No, he did it.

736
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,760
And he walked away, dumbfounded.

737
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,640
You just couldn't believe what an easy and helpful experience

738
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,480
he just had.

739
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,200
So you want a good government.

740
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,880
You have every reason to want one you got to work in.

741
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,200
I mentioned earlier the CDC in this context,

742
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,560
because I thought it was an interesting case study

743
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,200
for an institution that had a high reputation to start with.

744
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,920
And ran it to some troubles.

745
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,320
I mean, it still gets, I think, fairly good grades,

746
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,600
but it's been eroded to some degree.

747
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,000
And the question is, obviously, competence is one important,

748
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,840
maybe the most important factor in maintaining

749
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,800
public faith in an institution,

750
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,600
but there may be other issues to it play.

751
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,600
And I wonder about incentivizing somehow

752
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,760
the restitution of our belief in the system.

753
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,760
Because I think if you look at those other countries

754
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,960
where people do think their government does good work,

755
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,520
part of it is because their neighbors

756
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,400
think their government does good work.

757
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,080
And of course, the government made you good work,

758
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,920
but the question is, there's sort of a ground swell

759
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,800
of public opinion.

760
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,920
How do we foster that?

761
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,840
Because that's part of what makes our government work,

762
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,440
I think you go agree?

763
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,200
The CDC went downhill because it was in the service

764
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,000
of Trump's agenda during his term.

765
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,360
I mean, he had people in charge there

766
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,280
who were doing his bidding,

767
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,560
not the submission of the public health agency.

768
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,640
That's improved markedly in the meantime,

769
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,640
but still you can see they don't have a good sense

770
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,520
of what's required of them as an agency.

771
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,520
They recently postponed the approval of vaccines,

772
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,440
COVID vaccines for kids under five demanding months

773
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,480
of additional study.

774
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,800
There were absolutely no red flags in the field

775
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,920
showing that the vaccines were dangerous.

776
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,320
There had been some indications

777
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,440
that there was a very low incidence of myocarditis

778
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,880
and teenage males from the vaccine.

779
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,560
They weren't even sure that that was true,

780
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:24,240
but in no instance, was anybody hospitalized on that account?

781
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,880
Nobody died of it certainly.

782
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,240
And they made kids under five ineligible for the vaccines

783
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,240
for more than a half a year longer than necessary,

784
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:38,240
just out of some odd desire not to be criticized

785
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,360
if anything possibly could have gone wrong.

786
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,240
Well, we know things are gonna go wrong

787
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,160
if you don't approve it,

788
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,840
because kids were getting the virus and dying from it.

789
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,680
Wait, after SARS in 2004, I think it was,

790
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,320
the global health community pointed out

791
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,800
that it wasn't the question of weather,

792
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,920
but now there would be a major pandemic.

793
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,960
I recall Drow Harlem, Brooklyn giving a talk at Dartmouth,

794
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,360
they think maybe in 2009 when she was running

795
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,040
the World Health Organization.

796
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,680
And she made the case that the global community

797
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,120
was woefully underprepared for what needed to be done

798
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,760
to prevent an event like we were now living through it.

799
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,080
I mean, she turned out to be right about that.

800
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,640
I mean, if you read the scientific journals,

801
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,680
then people end up in genealogy in public health

802
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,080
have been making that argument for a long time.

803
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,400
There's been some successes

804
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,040
like controlling Ebola and Africa.

805
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,800
You know, in part, it's also about the nexus

806
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,120
between the environment and people's livelihoods.

807
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,440
And pandemic risks have a lot to do with the,

808
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,440
with how agriculture and resource extraction is carried out

809
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,840
in biodiversity hot spots where people report

810
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,360
and don't necessarily have fliable livelihood opportunities.

811
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,560
And solving a problem like that,

812
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,520
heading off the next pandemic requires global institutions

813
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,800
that point in the direction of sustainable development

814
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,240
instead of more wars and more financial market crashes.

815
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,240
I would add to that, I just looked up the death rates

816
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,480
by country of COVID at the Johns Hopkins website today.

817
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,800
The death rate that is by population.

818
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,280
The US, the ratio of the US to Cuba death rate is four times.

819
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,080
And why is that?

820
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,080
Cuba has a robust public health system.

821
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,000
International observers have recognized that.

822
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,120
Obviously, the United States doesn't.

823
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,760
And the defunding of our public health

824
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,560
has certainly contributed to this

825
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,440
along with what has already been pointed out.

826
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,960
What Robert pointed out,

827
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,960
the insidious influence of the anti-vax,

828
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,960
anti-mandate propaganda that comes mainly from the far right.

829
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,800
Not only in the United States, but globally.

830
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,800
And by the way, there's a convergence

831
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,380
with climate denialism as well.

832
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,000
Andreas Mom and his associates wrote a very good book

833
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,960
documenting this called,

834
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
White Skin Black Fuel that I recommend, Verso Press.

835
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And so by the way, the ratio for the US to China death rate

836
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,080
by population 800.

837
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,840
The death rate in the United States is 800 times

838
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,400
the death rate of China.

839
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,680
So I would just conclude, Cuba did this,

840
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,360
even though Biden during the campaign said

841
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,320
he would want to normalize relations with Cuba

842
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,440
like Obama did, but he did the opposite.

843
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,840
He basically imposed new sanctions against Cuba.

844
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,640
And in spite of that, Cuba has vaccinated virtually

845
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,000
all its population and has been sharing it

846
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,080
with people all over the world.

847
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:23,080
So let's respect public health and investment

848
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:28,080
and public health as several of you pointed out.

849
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,440
You're muted, Nicholas.

850
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,600
Yeah, and are we ready to accept the social regime

851
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,840
in China and Cuba?

852
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,000
Are we ready to live under the conditions

853
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,600
that the Chinese government imposes on its population?

854
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,680
Are you ready?

855
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,680
I'm asking yourself openly.

856
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,600
I mean, you call me names, neo-liberal, this and that,

857
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,120
but what about freedom?

858
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,520
Isn't freedom important to you?

859
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,800
I think it is.

860
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,240
It's very important to you, I'm sure.

861
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,520
It's important to everybody in the panel.

862
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,440
So we should really take that more seriously

863
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,680
before looking at the justice statistics,

864
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,360
at least that's my point of view.

865
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,200
But I wanted to come back though to the issue of inequality

866
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,600
because I think that's a very important issue

867
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,160
that was brought up by Jennifer.

868
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,040
The issue of inequality and especially,

869
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,960
well, some maybe somebody else said that too,

870
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,440
that the rich got richer during the pandemic.

871
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,440
I actually think inequality is a result

872
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,560
of the fourth industrial revolution

873
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:40,600
that we have been living in for a long time, actually.

874
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,840
And now we see the big fruits of it

875
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,280
because that industrial revolution meant

876
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,800
that we use more machines, we use more software,

877
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,000
we use more robots, and because they have become

878
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,640
more productive over time.

879
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,880
And the way that things work in a corporation

880
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,840
or in any business, this productivity is attributed

881
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,320
to capital and not to labor.

882
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,800
And it's therefore paid to capital.

883
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,280
And therefore, it shows up in profits.

884
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,280
So if a labor is changed and replaced by a machine,

885
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,920
then the amount of that goes to labor decreases

886
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,040
and the amount that goes to capital and profits increases.

887
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,040
So that almost automatically creates inequality.

888
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,760
It's inequality at the corporate level,

889
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,640
at the level of the business.

890
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,880
But if you think that the owners of the capital

891
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,640
are not the workers, then automatically it creates

892
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,640
an inequality between the owners of the capital

893
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,920
and the workers.

894
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,400
And that's something that is there.

895
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,320
I mean, we should really see for sure that way.

896
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,600
And at least in my opinion, the way to fix it

897
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,240
is to make sure that the workers have a part of the business,

898
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,960
they have shares, they have a way to get

899
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,400
to have an avenue of access to the profits

900
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,680
of the corporation.

901
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,000
It won't fix inequality across the board,

902
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,800
but it will fix this particular inequality

903
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,760
to some extent that comes from the foreign industrial revolution.

904
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,120
It comes from the importance of the product,

905
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,240
the increase in the productivity of machines and software.

906
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,080
And I think that we should take it,

907
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,320
at least from my point of view,

908
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:40,040
we should think of ways for this to actually happen,

909
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:45,160
which we might be able to implement at the corporate level

910
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:50,600
and fix a significant part of the business.

911
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:54,320
I think one of the objections that you hear most often

912
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,280
when there's any proposal to do anything

913
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,560
to reduce inequality is that you don't

914
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,200
want to kill the geese who lay the golden eggs.

915
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,840
It's the people at the top who are doing the real work

916
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,720
in the economy.

917
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,160
And if we were to tax them more heavily,

918
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,520
they would either not try as hard as they're trying now

919
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,000
or if we're in a local jurisdiction and we tried that,

920
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,640
then they would move somewhere else.

921
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,920
That's been actually put to the test many times.

922
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,080
I think in the most vivid recent experiment in California,

923
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,320
the legislature there raised the top marginal tax rate

924
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,400
from 9% to 13.5%.

925
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,080
That's a 50% increase.

926
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:43,000
It came in two births, not far apart.

927
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,920
And the predictions were dire.

928
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,320
The predictions were uniform that the movers and the shakers,

929
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,560
the people that made California, the wealthiest state

930
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,360
in the country were going to move to Oregon,

931
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,040
they were going to move to Nevada,

932
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,880
they were going to flee the state and droves.

933
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,120
It's been studied now.

934
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,480
Stanford published a very detailed study

935
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,640
in the wake of those increases.

936
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,560
They tracked every percentile in the income distribution

937
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,200
among California residents, the 99th percentile.

938
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,360
The people who are wealthier than 99% of the state's residents

939
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,480
left the state at the lowest rate by far of any other spot

940
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,120
on the income level.

941
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,960
So people have lives.

942
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,600
They're thriving in their local areas.

943
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:38,600
The states and budget surplus now, the state university

944
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,120
system, which you know Nick was the best of the world

945
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,480
from your own experience there.

946
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,640
It was in crisis.

947
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,000
It's no longer in crisis.

948
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,960
It's not being much better funded.

949
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,960
The roads are a better repaired now.

950
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,240
Things are still struggling in some ways in California,

951
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,320
but I think the revenue from those hikes

952
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,200
has enabled people to leave better lives on balance.

953
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,400
They may, as you say, they weren't going to spend it all anyway.

954
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,800
And there's been a lot of public investment

955
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,920
with the funds that will raise.

956
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,120
So all in all, a good trade, it seems to me.

957
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,440
Yeah, I just wanted to, I mean, I see what you're saying,

958
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,080
Robert, but my proposal wasn't to tax the rich.

959
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:29,200
My proposal is to find ways in which the workers would

960
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,000
get a part of the company.

961
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,480
They would get shares.

962
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,280
And that's how they would participate in the wealth

963
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,840
that was being created.

964
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,320
So that's quite different.

965
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:42,080
It's not really changing the taxation system at all.

966
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:48,920
It's just a way to provide wealth to the workers

967
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,280
through ownership, parcel ownership.

968
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,240
So let me suggest that we urge capital owners

969
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:59,000
to give some of their ownership to the workers.

970
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,600
And then imagine that they say, no, we'd rather not do that.

971
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,960
And then we counter with the proposal,

972
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,600
well, we're going to tax you and buy shares that will deposit

973
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,200
an account for them.

974
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,040
Well, one way to do it, tax the rich.

975
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,720
One way to do it would be to provide incentives to the rich.

976
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,960
I see this negative point of view here.

977
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,880
Let's tax them.

978
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,160
Let's beat them up.

979
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,320
Why that?

980
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,680
What happened to positive incentives?

981
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,120
Is that how we run?

982
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,880
Our corporations, is this how we run our universities?

983
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,360
By beating people up?

984
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,400
I mean, what do you create them in set?

985
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,040
Give them incentives.

986
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,880
OK, so I said I said what their incentives have been.

987
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,560
I have a show that I'm fortunate I can't share it

988
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,680
right on the screen.

989
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:48,040
The data from 1948 to 2018 productivity

990
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:58,080
has increased to a 253% hourly compensation for workers

991
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,520
increased 115%.

992
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,000
Where did that gap go?

993
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,840
It went to corporations in the top 1%.

994
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,600
OK, so that's it.

995
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,760
The other thing I find very funny is you, Nicholas,

996
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,240
rightly started off with the crisis of education

997
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,160
and the idea that we didn't want to give students things

998
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,720
they didn't earn.

999
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,240
And as you know, incentives and disincentives

1000
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,800
are two sides of the same coin.

1001
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,680
And this is one thing I've really discovered

1002
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,200
in the work on shame and honor.

1003
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,840
And to tack on to Bob's point about California,

1004
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,560
California also has an issue with delinquent taxpayers.

1005
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,760
And it turns out, of course, that the rich, when they're not

1006
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,600
paying their income taxes, have a greater effect

1007
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,960
on the tax deficit than the poor.

1008
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,000
That's the nature of taxes.

1009
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,640
And rather than introduce a policy

1010
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,240
where they decided to expose everyone who

1011
00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:00,440
hadn't paid their taxes, which felt potentially, well,

1012
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,160
I guess unjust and also maybe wouldn't use attention

1013
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,760
in the best way, they introduced a policy

1014
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,760
where they only threatened to shame the top 500 tax

1015
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,600
delinquents in the state.

1016
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,160
They initially thought they might make the money back

1017
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:16,880
on the policy.

1018
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,640
It costs about $180,000 a year to employ people

1019
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,560
to manage these lists and to send out the letters

1020
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,360
and to potentially publish the names online.

1021
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,920
And they've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars

1022
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,920
in back taxes through a threat of a disincentive, which

1023
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,520
is to just expose your name.

1024
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:43,720
It's just reputation, and it costs very little.

1025
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,680
And you ask, well, why disincentives?

1026
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,160
What happened to the incentive?

1027
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,600
Well, what we're going to honor people who pay their taxes?

1028
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,600
It all depends on the norm, right?

1029
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,360
We're going to honor people who write the best album of the year

1030
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,520
or make the best movie of the year.

1031
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:05,520
But when you're dealing with delinquent taxpayers,

1032
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,760
disincentives are really the only option in the system.

1033
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:14,280
There is not an incentive mirror in that kind of social problem.

1034
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,320
The thing is that no one's given Nicholas an opportunity

1035
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,200
to express how there might be a positive incentive.

1036
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,240
In this scenario of providing equity to workers,

1037
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:27,160
I just wonder what you thought about that.

1038
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:27,880
Sure.

1039
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,320
I mean, the standard, the way in which the government provides

1040
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,640
incentives is through taxation.

1041
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,520
So if you did, for example, it went to Amazon and said,

1042
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,640
well, we'll tax you a bit less.

1043
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,240
Or for this particular shares that you're

1044
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,280
going to transfer to workers or potentially transfer to workers,

1045
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,400
offer them to workers besides their regular compensation.

1046
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,800
That could work, right?

1047
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,880
I mean, that could create an incentive for any corporation

1048
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,120
to say, now from now on, from 2022,

1049
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,120
we're going to hire people and not just pay them $20 an hour,

1050
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,120
but we're going to also give them some percentage

1051
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,040
of the corporation so that we'll have in the future

1052
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,800
some percentage of the profits.

1053
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,560
You can even give it in a different way

1054
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,360
in which you can loan them the shares

1055
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,160
so they can get some percentage of the profits.

1056
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,080
There are ways to do these things,

1057
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,280
but they're not clobbering the rich.

1058
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:31,160
This is a way to figure out a way so that self-driven interest

1059
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,520
of these guys who manage these companies

1060
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,480
would create a more just society in the future

1061
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,320
and through using positive incentives.

1062
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,520
I think that's important.

1063
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,160
I think that's a way in my experience in life, maybe not

1064
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,800
yours, but in my experience in life,

1065
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,040
people respond much more positively, much more easily

1066
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,960
and positive to positive incentives

1067
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,800
than negative incentives.

1068
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,040
Let me just jump in one more time.

1069
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,560
I wondered though, Nicholas, if you think

1070
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,640
that clobbering the rich isn't a good idea

1071
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,720
because it's too severe of punishment

1072
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,080
or it's too negative for them to tolerate

1073
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:14,880
or whether it just provides the public

1074
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,160
with a negative view of capital.

1075
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,080
Well, I mean, I won't go into the sociology kind of issue.

1076
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:30,320
So why this thing might be bad for psychologically or socially?

1077
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:34,720
But I want to say it from only purely economic point of view,

1078
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,080
if you take $20 billion away from Bezos,

1079
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,800
you are not taking it away from his consumption, right?

1080
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,960
You're not restricting them from buying a great house

1081
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,080
or a great yacht or whatever.

1082
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:51,760
You are taking it away from investment, OK?

1083
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,480
That money was going to investment,

1084
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,120
and now it's going to the government.

1085
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,280
And we will see if the government actually invested

1086
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,280
or let's say invest 30% of it and give the way

1087
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,640
to the voters, the remaining part.

1088
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,640
So that's important because that says

1089
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:16,520
that we are changing the investment

1090
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,880
to consumption ratio in the country.

1091
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,840
And we need investment.

1092
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:25,120
That's why I said you should be careful about taking away

1093
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,880
this money because the way politicians have presented it,

1094
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,440
it's as if it's just free.

1095
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,040
There is no bad consequences of it.

1096
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,440
How can it be bad to take $20 billion from Bezos?

1097
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,000
And I have nothing to do with Bezos and Amazon, by the way.

1098
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,920
Just I'm not an anyway concerned.

1099
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,800
But how can it be bad?

1100
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,600
People don't even think about it,

1101
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,960
but it has significant negative consequences,

1102
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,320
at least in my opinion.

1103
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,400
So we can think of other ways in which we can,

1104
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,880
if we need money to finance ourselves,

1105
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,480
I mean, when we can create more investment,

1106
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,880
we can think about it.

1107
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,360
In my opinion, it would make more sense

1108
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,280
to give money to the private sector

1109
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,920
to do investments rather than the public sector

1110
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,680
because traditionally the public sector

1111
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:17,120
doesn't reduce as good results as the private sector.

1112
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,720
And I think that is, in general,

1113
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,680
we've understood in the United States.

1114
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,640
I mean, we don't try, we don't see the United States

1115
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,920
try to make its own fighter planes.

1116
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,080
They don't, they just try to give the contracts

1117
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,480
to the private sector and in many, many, many other dimensions.

1118
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,800
So, I don't know, in other countries,

1119
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,120
it's possible in Cuba, things happen differently.

1120
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,880
It's possible in China, things happen differently.

1121
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,040
It's possible in Russia, things happen differently,

1122
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,480
but not in the United States.

1123
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,240
So, given the environment we live in,

1124
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:53,080
we should think of ways to tweak it in the right direction

1125
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,200
rather than in the wrong direction.

1126
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,840
I mean, my students are usually shocked

1127
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,760
when I tell them that in the 1970s,

1128
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,560
the top marginal tax rate was 70%.

1129
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,560
And somehow that didn't prevent the economy

1130
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,640
from being productive and inefficient.

1131
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,400
And it didn't forestall abroad.

1132
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,000
And I looked at Build Back Better,

1133
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,440
which is now stalled in the Senate.

1134
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,040
And Build Back Better isn't about massive tax increases.

1135
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,440
It's about spending what?

1136
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,680
Maybe one or two percent of national income

1137
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,160
to address some critical problems relating to education

1138
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,400
and social justice and also decarbonization.

1139
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,360
And markets aren't going to get that those jobs done

1140
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,760
are working on their own.

1141
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,640
Market failures have caused those problems.

1142
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,960
And a male distribution of wealth

1143
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,880
has contributed to those problems, including.

1144
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,120
So I look at public schools and I'm very concerned

1145
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,480
about the inequality that we see in education

1146
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,000
between people in privileged communities

1147
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,160
like the town that I live in and I'm an amateur.

1148
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,000
And then I look at poor black and brown communities

1149
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,560
because they don't have good schools

1150
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,440
and they don't have good public services.

1151
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,320
And we need to invest in those people,

1152
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,880
not just for the sake of us communities,

1153
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,840
not just for the sake of social justice,

1154
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,040
but also because that's human capital

1155
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,160
and that's where our nation's future lies.

1156
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:21,240
Richard, you could mention also that in Build Back Better,

1157
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:27,160
the final version that was blocked by two senators.

1158
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,880
It also, what they gutted out provision to tax rich

1159
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:39,600
because of a few Wall Street inclined Democrats

1160
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,560
that got that removed.

1161
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,800
And not only, remember under Eisenhower,

1162
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:48,280
the top marginal rate was over 90%.

1163
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,200
That's true.

1164
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,040
Yeah.

1165
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,440
And matter of fact, the latest issue of the nation

1166
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,680
has a proposal to bring that marginal rate back.

1167
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,680
Nevertheless, even with that marginal rate,

1168
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,640
and I've looked into tax issues in DC,

1169
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,760
but even with that marginal, high marginal rate,

1170
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,520
the effective tax rate that they're very wealthy

1171
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,360
were paying was like 40%,

1172
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,440
because of loopholes and so on.

1173
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,320
We need to address that.

1174
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,840
But my question to Nicholas is,

1175
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:25,840
why should we trust the billionaires

1176
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,240
that own these companies to make the right decisions

1177
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,840
about investment?

1178
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,560
Where should it go?

1179
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:38,000
Why shouldn't that decision be socially determined

1180
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,800
rather than by billionaires?

1181
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:45,800
And I would take a lesson from the movie, Don't Look Up.

1182
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,040
Okay, to me, as a climate scientist,

1183
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:54,040
that message was that obviously it was about

1184
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,600
the threat of climate catastrophe,

1185
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,120
not really about a asteroid.

1186
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,400
And secondly, the message was,

1187
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:06,400
if we trust the billionaire solution will be doomed.

1188
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,600
That was, if you watch the movie,

1189
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,240
that's what it ended up.

1190
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,440
And I think that was a very good prescription

1191
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:18,000
about what we should do,

1192
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,920
actually, because I believe the world is overpopulated.

1193
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,720
Even one billionaire has won too many.

1194
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:31,720
I wondered, because just before Nicholas takes a shot at that,

1195
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:36,720
I mean, the term neoliberal was used earlier.

1196
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,520
And I wondered if anyone wants to offer

1197
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,720
a kind of a definition of what that means.

1198
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,320
And maybe, yeah.

1199
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,560
But what we tell our students is that it needs

1200
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,800
a transition from more public provisioning

1201
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,200
and a public having a mixed economy

1202
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,120
with the government and markets.

1203
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:58,760
And it means the focus on market liberalization

1204
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,360
and then a transfer also political power from the people,

1205
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,480
from the public, to an entanglement

1206
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,240
between corporate interests and the political interests.

1207
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,440
Now, that's contentious.

1208
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,240
I teach in a department where I'm an economist,

1209
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,480
but my colleagues are human geographers.

1210
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:27,480
I think what I just said is roughly what they would say.

1211
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,840
If you want me to reply,

1212
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,640
I mean, I don't want to reply about the names.

1213
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,200
I mean, people call names curses all the time.

1214
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,000
I'm not going to get pigeonholed to a particular name.

1215
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,840
I'm telling you the positions.

1216
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,720
I'm telling you, I'm trying to argue seriously

1217
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,920
about what I think needs to be done.

1218
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,640
If you want to argue seriously too,

1219
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,920
you can find a way to talk about the reasons

1220
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,920
why this is not right or this is right.

1221
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,080
It's just saying, oh, we have too many billionaires,

1222
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,360
let's execute them and so on.

1223
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,200
I mean, that's a childist.

1224
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,040
Come on.

1225
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:03,600
I mean, seriously, I think that there is a serious issue,

1226
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,880
very serious, and we have opened at least three or four

1227
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,640
that we need to argue on to talk about them.

1228
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,720
I mean, and I don't think that characterizations

1229
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,800
make any difference, in my opinion.

1230
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,360
I mean, I don't want to talk about it.

1231
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,400
I think it would be useful though,

1232
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:26,600
to not view proposals to raise the progressivity of the taxes

1233
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:31,120
somehow a moral indictment of the rich or a statement

1234
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,960
that we're out to get them.

1235
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,800
My effective tax rate, I've learned from my accountant,

1236
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,600
is over 30%.

1237
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:45,000
Jeff Bezos pays next to nothing in tax.

1238
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,280
I think when he thinks about investment,

1239
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:52,320
if he were taxed more heavily, the way we teach investment

1240
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:56,480
is that if the rate of return on an investment is 6%,

1241
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,600
and you can borrow money at 5%, then you ought to do it.

1242
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,520
You invest if the rate of return is greater

1243
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,000
than your cost of capital.

1244
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,280
We don't, in any part of that module, teach them,

1245
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,720
look at your wealth balance and decide whether to invest.

1246
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:14,840
Maybe that would influence your attitude toward risk.

1247
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:18,560
But I can't imagine that's going to be a factor for Bezos.

1248
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,240
So taxing his wealth will not change the projects

1249
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,960
he finds it profitable to invest in.

1250
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,360
That's not one of the things that's on the table.

1251
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,320
Maybe if he had a little less wealth,

1252
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,560
he wouldn't be as quick to spend money on a rocket ship

1253
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,720
to take a thrill ride into space.

1254
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,440
That's possible.

1255
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,560
It's easier for me to imagine that response

1256
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:43,200
than that he would back away from an otherwise profitable

1257
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,440
investment.

1258
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,080
But let's go back to the issue.

1259
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,000
What am I saying?

1260
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,400
Why am I saying it he will invest less?

1261
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,880
Because the government will take away this money, OK, for sure.

1262
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:57,080
And that's the money that are being presently invested

1263
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,320
in whatever way.

1264
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,960
I mean, I'm not even going to argue

1265
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,200
that there are all that there is he's investing them

1266
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,200
in the right way.

1267
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,960
But he's invested somewhere.

1268
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,240
Maybe he's invested in whatever activities Amazon does.

1269
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,400
So this money is invested.

1270
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,480
Now the government is going to take it.

1271
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,320
But the government has mixed incentives.

1272
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,960
I said it before.

1273
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:21,280
The government has run by politicians

1274
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,440
who want to be reelected.

1275
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:28,080
And that creates an incentive not to invest whatever 20 billion

1276
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,960
they got from Bezos.

1277
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,760
But to use a significant part of it

1278
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:36,320
in giving it to the voters, giving it

1279
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,160
to the people who are going to get you reelected.

1280
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,480
Or in your theories, some of you said,

1281
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:44,200
or giving it to the corporations that will get you reelected.

1282
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,280
You said this, not me, OK?

1283
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:51,280
But either way, the incentives are not OK anymore.

1284
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,720
The money is taken away from the US economy

1285
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,520
and is given to consumption.

1286
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,440
Or some significant part of it given to consumption.

1287
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,160
And that's about that.

1288
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,800
Now I said that with Build Back Better,

1289
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,000
a lot of the investment is in kids.

1290
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,160
And it's here, the end gets in schools.

1291
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,280
And those are investments in human capital

1292
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:14,720
and human capital is a productive asset that we need more on.

1293
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,440
And those are investments that have high returns.

1294
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:21,320
I mean, we know that they have really high returns.

1295
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,120
The other thing that to bring it back to climate change,

1296
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,520
I think, is to think a little bit about the investments that

1297
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,600
have been made over the last three or four decades

1298
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,160
in renewable energy.

1299
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,920
And one thing that is upsetting to me

1300
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,560
is that the people analyzing what

1301
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,040
this effect has had on the economy and certainly

1302
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,120
on the energy system and on the climate system

1303
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,440
are sociologists, not economists.

1304
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,520
They don't seem to compel to dig into these data.

1305
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,760
But the data show, of course, that it is not

1306
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,680
a one-to-one substitution that, in fact, there

1307
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,360
is more fossil fuel being used.

1308
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,280
This is, in some ways, complementary and not

1309
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:07,280
a substitute to the existing fossil fuel use, which

1310
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:11,920
suggests that the economic theory that, oh, you build it,

1311
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,200
they will come, it will substitute whether or not it's,

1312
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,040
and we see this across so many other products too,

1313
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,320
in aquaculture or something else I study,

1314
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,480
it's been complementary to capture fisheries.

1315
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,640
It has not been a substitution for it, renewable energy

1316
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,840
and fossil fuels.

1317
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,520
And it's sort of endless, the way in which, again,

1318
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,640
the foundational economic theory has been undermined

1319
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,360
by the empirics.

1320
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,600
But it speaks, again, to this idea of incentives

1321
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,280
versus disincentives and the point I brought up very early

1322
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,800
in the conversation about divestment,

1323
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:50,520
that investment sometimes has to be coupled with divestment

1324
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:55,800
and divestment being a voyage as well to a kind

1325
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:01,680
of stigmatization of fossil fuels, not just an economic lever

1326
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,640
and understanding there's a reputation even to the product

1327
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,800
itself.

1328
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,680
And it's something, again, that I feel economists do not

1329
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,640
want to engage on.

1330
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,360
They want to talk about the market.

1331
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,720
They don't want to talk about the reputation even

1332
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,040
of the product, even though they're

1333
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,240
perfectly willing to talk about the reputation of brands,

1334
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,080
as you know, Bob.

1335
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,520
We're going to soon, I'm sorry, open up.

1336
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,800
And I'm not cutting the conversation off yet,

1337
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,320
but I wanted to ask in any kind of negotiation

1338
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,160
when there's different viewpoints and parties,

1339
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,960
there's this first effort to say, well,

1340
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,360
what do we share in common?

1341
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,880
Like, what can we all agree would be reasonable?

1342
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,720
And I have to think that he's given the way

1343
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,680
the conversation is going on.

1344
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,520
The question might be posed.

1345
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,120
What are the things that, via incentives,

1346
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,680
the government, which will come from the government,

1347
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,400
the government should be involved in trying

1348
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,800
to affect the economy?

1349
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,920
What are legitimate goals that the government can get

1350
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,680
involved with?

1351
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,880
Within incentives, whether or not

1352
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,080
their taxes or the subsidies or whatever they may be.

1353
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,440
Following up on what Jerry said, I

1354
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,920
think it will be good because move also a little bit

1355
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,920
and look at the future, what you see happening,

1356
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,560
and what you think is possible to happen as we look

1357
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,960
at the future in the next 10, 20 years in terms

1358
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,480
of climate change and so on.

1359
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,520
Let me add a couple of cents on that one,

1360
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:31,680
because I think we need to not only promote a Green New Deal

1361
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,160
in the US, but a global Green New Deal.

1362
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:39,920
And there have been many proposals out there.

1363
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,480
I think Bernie Sanders' Green New Deal

1364
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:49,520
was probably the best that's been put out in the mainstream

1365
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,120
and because it also includes a cut in the military budget.

1366
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,160
A rather modest cut in the military budget.

1367
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:01,120
But that was a robust Green New Deal

1368
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:05,640
that would really have an impact on what

1369
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:10,920
Jennifer's referring to to curb fossil fuel consumption

1370
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:14,080
while renewable energy is being built.

1371
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,800
Robust Green, of course, the global south

1372
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,680
needs the most investment there in terms

1373
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:25,600
of renewable energy, which is definitely related

1374
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:31,040
to the energy, the fact that most of humanity suffers

1375
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:37,400
from energy poverty, because most people in the world

1376
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:42,520
don't have enough energy consumption in their nation

1377
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,160
to live to the highest life expectancy.

1378
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:49,440
You can find out more in our book, The Earth is Not the Sale

1379
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,600
on that issue.

1380
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:56,120
But the global Green New Deal for it to be a success

1381
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:00,880
will require demilitarization of the global economy

1382
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:05,720
because that's another area where we have a huge waste

1383
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:09,320
of $2 trillion a year in expenditures.

1384
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,840
So in addition to the $5.6 trillion

1385
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:17,400
going to fossil fuel subsidies, direct and indirect,

1386
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,120
we have that too.

1387
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:24,160
And so that would be what I see as the hope

1388
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:29,600
for any chance of needing the one and a half degree warming

1389
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,240
limit of the IPCC and creating a better life

1390
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:38,920
for everyone in the world at the same time.

1391
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,200
So that will be my final intervention.

1392
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:50,440
Can I say something about a point that Jacqueline made?

1393
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,880
I think some economists are sympathetic

1394
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:54,880
to what you do.

1395
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,800
Certainly the message of much of what

1396
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,280
you've written about, I take to be this, which

1397
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,520
is that public policy levers that we have,

1398
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,000
the traditional ones that we've been talking about

1399
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,880
for the two centuries that there's even

1400
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:16,720
been a field called economics, are actually much, much more

1401
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,920
powerful than we even imagined them to be.

1402
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,920
And I think the example that really

1403
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,520
drive that point home for me was the taxes we started

1404
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,920
imposing on smoking.

1405
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:33,600
We didn't do that really at any significant degree

1406
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,720
until we saw studies coming out of Japan

1407
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:40,200
showing that secondhand smoke exposure caused illnesses

1408
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,400
in others.

1409
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,920
Those lakes are actually fairly weak.

1410
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,560
You don't harm others very much with your secondhand smoke.

1411
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,920
But that was the excuse we felt we needed

1412
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,240
to start discouraging people from smoking.

1413
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,840
We didn't want to say we want to protect you from yourself.

1414
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,280
We want to say it's legitimate to tax you

1415
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,880
because you're harming others.

1416
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:07,560
It turns out that the real harm you caused others when you

1417
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,480
smoke is not from your secondhand smoke.

1418
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:13,760
It's by making others in your circle more likely to smoke.

1419
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,560
We take our cues to a much greater degree

1420
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:21,760
than I think most of us realize by what people around us do.

1421
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,640
I started smoking when I was 14 because most of my friends

1422
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:26,160
smoked.

1423
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,680
I'm grateful to have quit a few years later.

1424
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,200
Most people don't manage to quit.

1425
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,640
They're stuck for the rest of their lives.

1426
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:37,400
And a friend who had been a smoker and also a heroin user

1427
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,000
told me that it was much harder for him to quit smoking

1428
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,640
than it was for him to quit heroin.

1429
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,200
So perhaps the most addictive substance we know of.

1430
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:51,120
And the reason the taxes worked, they

1431
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,960
didn't work very well at first.

1432
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,200
If you're a smoker, you're going to keep on smoking.

1433
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,360
You'll just buy less of something else

1434
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,120
when they tax your cigarettes.

1435
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,520
The reason it worked is that some people quit

1436
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,440
and others didn't start.

1437
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:08,600
Maybe the ones with the least money in the first place

1438
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,480
didn't start.

1439
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:13,560
That meant each and every peer group had fewer smokers in it.

1440
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,880
That meant everyone else in those groups

1441
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,800
were less likely to start or remain smoking.

1442
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,280
And over time, there's just no other way

1443
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,960
to account for how we went from a smoking rate

1444
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,120
among adults of over half to what it is today, 13%.

1445
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,760
Nobody says, oh, that's horrible.

1446
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:31,760
We shouldn't have done that.

1447
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,960
Everybody says, thank goodness we took that step.

1448
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,840
And there are steps like that to be

1449
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:40,080
taken in domain after domain.

1450
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,840
Many of them in the climate.

1451
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,400
We could change energy use patterns in a dramatic way

1452
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,600
just by some gentle shifting of incentives

1453
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,800
and let people influence one another

1454
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,920
to carry the ball the rest of the way home.

1455
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:03,640
Jennifer, Richard, Nick, any other thoughts?

1456
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,280
Well, you asked if there are things we agree on.

1457
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,960
I agree strongly on incentives.

1458
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,760
I think it's important, though, it's

1459
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:13,520
a form that says achieve beliefs in markets, markets

1460
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,800
with rules.

1461
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,840
And I think what I would say is that many of the problems

1462
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:22,160
that we have to do with having written rules that were

1463
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:26,240
pursued by red seekers that have facilitated red capture

1464
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:30,080
at the expense of investment in innovation.

1465
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,680
So I'm not anti-billionaire.

1466
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,040
I'm not anti-market.

1467
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:38,840
I think we need to work on making markets work more efficiently

1468
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,880
and making our economy more innovative again.

1469
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,720
And that means balancing in some of the most

1470
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,640
important investments really has to be done by public sector

1471
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,880
because they're public goods.

1472
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:57,360
Yeah, I would say that it will be very useful

1473
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:03,640
to create positive incentives to reduce consumption.

1474
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:07,600
So in different types of consumption of energy

1475
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,840
at home, consumption of energy in the cars, and so on.

1476
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:16,200
And additionally, at least in my opinion,

1477
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:21,120
it's important for whatever major investment

1478
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:26,960
it's going to happen in production

1479
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:34,840
to also give incentives to individuals and companies

1480
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,440
to go in that direction.

1481
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,560
I don't think I can agree with the idea

1482
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,560
that the major investment should happen,

1483
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,600
but the government, as I said before,

1484
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:48,880
the government has terrible results in terms of productivity

1485
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,080
compared to the public sector.

1486
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:55,080
And we shouldn't really go with major investments

1487
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,280
in that direction if we can actually

1488
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:03,280
do them in the private sector by tweaking the incentives.

1489
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,120
So at least that's my approach.

1490
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:09,040
I'm not saying that there are areas

1491
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:16,240
in which the public, the government shouldn't be involved.

1492
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:20,760
I'm saying that the lion shares of the investment

1493
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:25,080
should be geared towards the private sector doing them.

1494
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:28,360
And we can fix the right incentives,

1495
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,600
and I don't think we have disagreements among ourselves

1496
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,680
that there is a way to fix incentives

1497
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:38,280
so that money pours in the direction we want them to pour.

1498
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,320
Yeah, I agree with that, in part,

1499
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,360
and I'll just say schools are an investment.

1500
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,200
I think hospitals and public health care is an investment.

1501
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,120
And we spend 17% of US national income on the health care

1502
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:54,040
sector, and that's about twice as much as other industrialized

1503
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,080
countries, and we have worse life expectancy.

1504
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,760
And that's an example where we're spending more than we should

1505
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,560
be to get an outcome that we don't like very much.

1506
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,920
And that's the product of a whole bunch with misaligned incentives

1507
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,000
that were structured to facilitate red capture.

1508
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,720
Glad I put this part on getting red capture and monopoly

1509
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,280
power out of the economy.

1510
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,760
I think that's it.

1511
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,520
And that would help with the political problems that we have.

1512
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,400
And I think another thing that would help

1513
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:28,480
is really to challenge what economists tell us

1514
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:32,720
are the variables that we have to pay attention to.

1515
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,200
We have to pay attention to parts per million.

1516
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,960
We have to pay attention to the extinction rates of species.

1517
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,640
We have to pay attention to flourishing, as Bob said.

1518
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:47,960
These are not captured by productivity or GDP or return

1519
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:50,960
on investment or any of these variables

1520
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,400
that economists want to constantly bring us back

1521
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,560
to as the fundamentals to the economy.

1522
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,480
And that is why I think it's hard to be someone like Rich,

1523
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:05,520
where you are an economist with broad sweeping values

1524
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,440
because you're kind of stuck.

1525
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,040
And that's why I left economics to go

1526
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,040
to a Department of Environmental Studies,

1527
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:17,040
where I felt like I could set the terms of the kind of future

1528
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,880
I wanted without being hemmed into the ideology, which

1529
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,480
is not a science of the foundations of economics.

1530
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:29,960
I'll say that I'm a professor of Environmental Studies.

1531
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:34,280
My work is at the interfaces between economics, governance,

1532
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:37,040
political ecology, environmental sciences.

1533
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:40,840
So I'm sitting in a very interdisciplinary space

1534
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:44,600
to try to figure out how this discipline of economics

1535
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:48,040
can we need to get that part of that right?

1536
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,280
Hold on, everybody.

1537
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,280
Hold on, Nicholas, please, hold on.

1538
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,280
Yeah, go ahead.

1539
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:53,880
It's pretty fine.

1540
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,520
I think that on this issue of what

1541
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:59,120
economy space attention to, I mean,

1542
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:03,800
I think that there is, economics has a pretty wide set of tools.

1543
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,200
And if there was a way, and if there is a way

1544
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,880
to take it to account a lot of stuff

1545
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,400
that Jennifer says, some young assistant professor

1546
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,000
would write a great paper and get it published

1547
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,640
and get tenure based on that.

1548
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:22,680
So I don't think that it's you should preclude the idea

1549
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:27,360
that in the whole field as wide as this, as economics is,

1550
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,560
with the collection of tools and then using some assumptions

1551
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:36,720
and getting certain conclusions, that somehow the majority

1552
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,080
of economists who presses the rest of the economy

1553
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,240
so they cannot really write something

1554
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,120
really interesting in that dimension.

1555
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,000
I mean, I cannot believe that.

1556
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,920
I mean, I've seen people in my lifetime

1557
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:52,960
in the economics world write some very radical stuff

1558
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,520
and get tenure based on that.

1559
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:59,400
So I wouldn't agree that we are, you know,

1560
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:03,040
that not so open as it's being presented.

1561
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,120
All right, so I want to add that.

1562
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,920
I'm not talking about getting tenure.

1563
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,800
I'm talking about controlling the public conversation.

1564
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,920
I'm talking about being in the White House.

1565
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:15,200
I'm talking about having power.

1566
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:19,160
And those people can get tenure, but they have not been

1567
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,120
the right hand man for the president.

1568
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,680
Look, I mean, economists don't run the world.

1569
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,000
That's for sure.

1570
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,320
I mean, like Harry Truman said,

1571
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,760
the economists come to me and say,

1572
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,960
on the one hand this and on the other hand this,

1573
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,640
that's why I hate economists.

1574
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,960
The politicians run the world, not us, okay?

1575
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:38,440
So if you want to make political change,

1576
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,920
you can make political change,

1577
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,440
but it's not up to the economists

1578
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,880
to make the political change.

1579
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,720
I think it's up to you and me as citizens to make the political.

1580
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,320
All right, so now I do want to step in here finally.

1581
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,160
This is wonderful.

1582
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,280
I think actually this conversation.

1583
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,680
We have some questions I know from our viewing audience

1584
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:01,680
and Alex will sign in here and give us some of those questions

1585
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,080
and you can all take a shot at responding to.

1586
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:08,120
Yeah, so I guess everyone watching on Zoom and on YouTube,

1587
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,440
please write your questions and their respective spots

1588
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,640
and I'll get to them.

1589
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,320
So let's click, okay.

1590
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,240
Let's see.

1591
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,480
I'll start with,

1592
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,640
Reisa Mandel wrote this really early on.

1593
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:24,240
And so they wrote, I guess, thank you for the question, Reisa.

1594
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:27,240
They wrote, does innovation have to implicate growth,

1595
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:30,040
which they believe is a fetish and driver

1596
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,840
of ecological degradation?

1597
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,160
I'll take your questions.

1598
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,720
Go ahead.

1599
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,480
I just wanted to clarify the questions.

1600
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,480
Innovation.

1601
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,920
I guess that this innovation have to implicate growth,

1602
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:51,920
I guess, like, do they have to imply growth?

1603
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,680
Or evolve it or yeah.

1604
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,000
You have very innovative energy policies

1605
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,680
that decarbonize the economy.

1606
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,240
But I will say one thing is that,

1607
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:02,080
having been trained as an energy economist,

1608
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:05,560
we knew in the early 1980s or early 1990s,

1609
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,000
we could decarbonize the economy

1610
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,760
by paying about one or two percent of GDP

1611
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,120
for some decades and that they wouldn't have

1612
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:16,400
very much impact on the rate of growth.

1613
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,520
And so this idea that growth and environmental

1614
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,680
conservation are incompatible,

1615
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,800
I don't think that works empirically.

1616
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,720
And there are people that do think that works empirically.

1617
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,040
But in one or two percent of GDP,

1618
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,280
you don't pay that unless you're gonna get a return

1619
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,840
on that investment in climate capital.

1620
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,360
So that's not, those resources are real,

1621
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,240
but I don't think there's a tradeoff really

1622
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,960
between growth and the environment,

1623
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,320
like they go hand in hand.

1624
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,600
And actually, the same one more thing.

1625
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,120
The US spends about 3% of national income

1626
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,120
on environmental compliance,

1627
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,000
mostly because of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.

1628
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,960
And the benefits to society are much greater than 3%.

1629
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,560
Yeah, I'd go one step further, Richard.

1630
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,960
There are a lot of people in the environmental movement

1631
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,520
who say we've got to somehow accept the idea

1632
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,000
that growth is a bad thing

1633
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,360
and that we've got to be prepared to live without growth.

1634
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:16,360
I think that's wrong-headed because it's growth

1635
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,280
in certain kinds of things that are harmful.

1636
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,760
There are lots of things that we can have more of

1637
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,000
with not only no harm to anyone else,

1638
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,360
but with benefits, yeah, if we plant ornamental trees

1639
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:31,240
around our house, that doesn't harm the environment.

1640
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,760
It gives pleasure to the neighbors walking by.

1641
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,440
I mean, my wife takes piano lessons.

1642
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,800
There's no environmental harm from that.

1643
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,800
There's all sorts of things that we spend our income on

1644
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,360
that don't cause any harm to anyone else

1645
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,800
and often create external benefits for other people.

1646
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,880
And what we know, and there's good work on this,

1647
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:57,280
is that when we don't grow, when the economy grows slowly,

1648
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:00,640
we're much less likely to make important public investments.

1649
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:04,040
We're much less likely to take steps

1650
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:07,400
to increase social justice of various kinds.

1651
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:11,080
We start raining in and becoming much more stingy

1652
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:14,040
in the public sphere when there's a low growth rate.

1653
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:17,320
So I think growth is a positive-

1654
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,920
Going to your point, Rit, to a point, Rob,

1655
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,920
that the GDP or GNP has been critiqued by degrowthers.

1656
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:33,800
And I share it on the chat my critique of great degrowth

1657
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:38,800
because it doesn't, this GDP as many have already written about,

1658
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,120
for the common good, daily and calm,

1659
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:52,120
that you need to look at what the components of growth are,

1660
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,680
as you just pointed out.

1661
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:56,000
So there's bad growth and good growth.

1662
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,120
I would submit that the growth

1663
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:02,200
of the military industrial complex in the fence,

1664
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,840
but is bad growth.

1665
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:09,000
The growth of renewable energy and affordable housing

1666
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,400
and ecological agriculture would be good growth.

1667
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:17,560
So we need to deconstruct what the growth is.

1668
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:22,560
And therefore, I am, I recognize the contribution

1669
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:27,560
of the degrowth discourse that has positive implications,

1670
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:38,680
but many of them fail to do this deconstruction

1671
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,880
of what growth is.

1672
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,880
And so that's my two cents.

1673
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,280
Next question.

1674
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:51,040
Okay.

1675
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,680
Risa, I think wanted to hear Nicholas's viewpoint,

1676
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,560
given I guess the perceived perspective

1677
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:03,040
that he's a neoliberal, so apologies.

1678
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,160
But if he wants anything to add to that,

1679
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:08,680
just in case, if not, we could go on to the next question.

1680
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,600
If there wasn't anything that wasn't said

1681
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,280
that he wants to add, if not, it's okay,

1682
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,280
going to the next question.

1683
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,160
I was just noting what Risa wanted to say

1684
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,680
was directed towards Nick.

1685
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:23,600
I would say it's best not to try to pigeonhole people

1686
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,280
and just argue on the specifics of the arguments.

1687
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,240
That's all I'm going to say.

1688
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,880
I'm not going to talk about it.

1689
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,720
Okay. Okay.

1690
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,320
Oh, you reviewed it, Alex?

1691
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,320
Yeah, sorry, I made it myself.

1692
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,640
All right.

1693
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,400
Next, we have Linda Martin.

1694
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,680
Thank you, Linda, Linda wrote.

1695
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,480
What fact do you know about narcissism

1696
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,080
and how do you think it impacts income inequality?

1697
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,080
Capitalism, government.

1698
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,280
Are you familiar with research

1699
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,040
that has been done on the destructive impact

1700
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,120
of narcissists on corporations?

1701
01:30:56,120 --> 01:31:00,440
And then they also add also on even your own fields

1702
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,240
or the impact on business or government in general?

1703
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,680
I'm concerned that in America

1704
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:12,480
that we've landed on a blame culture

1705
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:16,320
and we could review problems in society to someone else

1706
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:19,120
or our outgroup rather than looking at what we as well

1707
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:22,880
in our in-group can do to affect positive change.

1708
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,920
And that's more narcissistic.

1709
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,520
But I mean, there's a difference

1710
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,440
between taking ownership and responsibility

1711
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,960
and the scheme of out-group politics

1712
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,640
which I think is very corrosive.

1713
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:36,520
I'm not sure if that's a, is that a non-sequitur?

1714
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:40,800
I mean, it's, I mean, that's related to narcissism in a way.

1715
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:44,680
The only paper I'm sure, Bob, you've read more

1716
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:47,320
but because you study luxury markets

1717
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:49,720
but on narcissism I read,

1718
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:53,480
took Murray-Gell-Man, the physicist as its prime example.

1719
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:57,040
So I don't feel comfortable representing those views

1720
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:00,000
completely because they were very unfamiliar to me.

1721
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:06,800
I mean, to the extent that you associate narcissism

1722
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,440
with luxury consumption,

1723
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:12,160
then the main consequence of it

1724
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:16,160
is that it's simply wasteful that if you need

1725
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,880
a diamond three times as big to express

1726
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,520
a given level of commitment,

1727
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:25,200
that's not really doing anybody any good

1728
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,720
compared to a regime when all we're spending less

1729
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:32,120
and express the same amount of commitment as before.

1730
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,440
Okay.

1731
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,680
Alex, the next question.

1732
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:36,600
Okay.

1733
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,720
Next one.

1734
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:42,120
This is from Mel M.

1735
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:42,960
Thank you, Mel.

1736
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,120
They wrote, what are the chances of Ray Dalio's worry

1737
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:48,600
that inequality between the wealthy and the poor

1738
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,600
could lead to a bloody revolution?

1739
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,960
Is the current rise in populism on the left and the right

1740
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,080
a sign this has already started?

1741
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:04,440
I'll say, I've been able to say that I think

1742
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,760
that our political divide in the United States

1743
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:08,720
is at least in part the class divide.

1744
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,720
And that healing the class divide,

1745
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,720
I think it's gonna require fresh thinking

1746
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,720
and some kind of realignment.

1747
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:18,720
And I would like to, I mean, this is a political statement,

1748
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,720
but I would like to see the Democrats think a little more

1749
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:25,720
about the demos and about creating an inclusive,

1750
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:28,720
an America that's inclusive of all people.

1751
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:32,720
And that probably means focusing on rebuilding,

1752
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,720
rebuilding the working and middle class.

1753
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:40,720
Interesting, that was exactly Bernie Sanders' advice

1754
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,720
in an interview around the Guardian.

1755
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:44,720
So you made the same point.

1756
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,720
I do read the Guardian.

1757
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:47,720
But yeah.

1758
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:50,720
Can I ask that question?

1759
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:55,720
I mean, why do you think that the political divide

1760
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:59,720
is a class divide when we see some of the wealthiest people

1761
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:02,720
in the United States supporting very left-wing

1762
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,720
points of view?

1763
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:09,720
Well, what they support that's left-wing are our cultural values.

1764
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:13,720
It's not about how we organize the economy.

1765
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:18,720
And so we shifted from a debate over economics and class

1766
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:21,720
to a coded debate that's about quote unquote

1767
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:25,720
traditional values versus, you know,

1768
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,720
what term should I use here?

1769
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:30,720
I mean, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

1770
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,720
the other side of the culture of wars.

1771
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:35,720
And I don't want to put a label on that because labels,

1772
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,720
we need to be very careful of that as you said.

1773
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:40,720
But I do think that it's become, you know,

1774
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:44,720
there's a, there's, it's also that not, not just income,

1775
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:45,720
but it's about education.

1776
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,720
And so what really marks this best of why it's about

1777
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:51,720
educational status or educational attainment.

1778
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,720
That's at least partly what I read in the Guardian and other

1779
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,720
blists.

1780
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:56,720
I'm not sure.

1781
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:00,720
I mean, I, I, I, in the general statement about political divide

1782
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:04,720
being class divide, we have seen Bill Gates or in Buffett come

1783
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:08,720
out and say, we really want to be taxed more.

1784
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:09,720
Okay.

1785
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:10,720
Right.

1786
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:13,720
I mean, and these are some of the wealthiest people in the United

1787
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:14,720
States, correct?

1788
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,720
Yes.

1789
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:16,720
So that's, that's, that's fair.

1790
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,720
I'm not calling for a class war.

1791
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,720
I mean, I, but I do think that we need an economy that's more

1792
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,720
inclusive.

1793
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:26,720
And I look at the, that the Rust Belt from Milwaukee all the way

1794
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,720
over to Rochester, New York, maybe even Detroit, New York.

1795
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:33,720
And I see a part of the country that has to struggle for the last

1796
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:37,720
four years since the, since the Paul Volcker interest rate hike.

1797
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,720
And then when the manufacturing went downhill and for that

1798
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:43,720
country, for that part of the country to do better, it seems

1799
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:47,720
that we need some form of regional economic development and

1800
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:48,720
industrial policy.

1801
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:52,720
And, you know, I'm not an expert on that, but that's, that's,

1802
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:55,720
I'm inclined to think that, that would help our politics.

1803
01:35:55,720 --> 01:36:02,720
I am adding to the chat a great book on the red last year on

1804
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:06,720
billionaires and stealth politics because part of this also is

1805
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,720
about reputation.

1806
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,720
So Bill Gates gets a lot of attention for that.

1807
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:14,720
Soros gets a lot of attention, but the vast majority of

1808
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:18,720
billionaire wealth actually is going to support Republican

1809
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:19,720
candidates.

1810
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:23,720
And this was a great empirical treatise on that point.

1811
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:27,720
I just want to read the next question.

1812
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,720
Yes, I'll go on the next one.

1813
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:34,720
I'm trying to make sure I got everyone.

1814
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:36,720
There was one in the chat.

1815
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:37,720
Okay.

1816
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,720
Okay.

1817
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:39,720
So let's see.

1818
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,720
I have two more for now.

1819
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:45,720
So this was from Gregory Burke from YouTube.

1820
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,720
They wrote, why do we obsess about GDP when it does not include

1821
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,720
health, education, or general well-being?

1822
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:57,720
I think it was a point Jennifer major a little bit earlier.

1823
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:59,720
You started talking about.

1824
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,720
Okay.

1825
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:04,720
Did anybody want to ask?

1826
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:10,720
How can we get the chat record because, uh,

1827
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:15,720
can you give us a copy of the chat because it's a very interesting

1828
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:16,720
post there.

1829
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:21,720
Jennifer's post and, uh, no, I'm collecting the,

1830
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:25,720
I'm collecting URLs and I could post it as a comment on the

1831
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,720
website, uh, a later.

1832
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:29,720
So I could get, I could do that.

1833
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,720
Yes.

1834
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,720
So is there, is there anything more you'd like to add to that?

1835
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,720
I could go on, or I could go on to the next question.

1836
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,720
If you feel it hasn't been, if you feel it's been.

1837
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:40,720
Well, just so what, what matters as well being and then the

1838
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:43,720
production of market goods and services plus governance services,

1839
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:47,720
I mean, measure that we call that GDP, but there are other things

1840
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,720
that contribute importantly to GDP.

1841
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:51,720
And we also know that in, well,

1842
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:56,720
in an affluent countries that that GDP growth doesn't really increase

1843
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,720
average well being very much.

1844
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:02,720
Um, and so we should stop using GDP as a, as a,

1845
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:06,720
as a metric of, of the good society.

1846
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,720
But what I would agree though, with the market stand and probably

1847
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:13,720
with, with, with Nicholas, but economic growth is a means.

1848
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:17,720
If we use the means of growth to support the right ends.

1849
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:22,720
Maybe Bob wants to talk about Nepal's, um,

1850
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:26,720
view of GDP growth, national happiness.

1851
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:27,720
Yeah.

1852
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:30,720
Yeah, it's actually Bhutan that is taking the.

1853
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:34,720
On that, the, the, they have what they call the gross national

1854
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:38,720
happiness index and they measure their progress according to

1855
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:41,720
movements in it rather than movements in GDP.

1856
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:44,720
And I think there's a, there's a case to be made for that.

1857
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:48,720
Certainly focusing only on the dollar value of the stuff we can

1858
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:54,720
buy leaves out a whole longer list of things we know we care about.

1859
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:59,720
And so, uh, I mean, even, even just counting the fact that we're

1860
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:03,720
depleting resources, uh, to produce this GDP, we don't take any

1861
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:07,720
account of that, which seems like an odd thing to leave out.

1862
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:13,720
If you burn up, uh, billions of dollars of resources producing, uh,

1863
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:16,720
an annual GDP, and it's barely more than that.

1864
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:19,720
You're not really, uh, adding much to the picture.

1865
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:22,720
If you're doing that. And, and the.

1866
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:26,720
There's a long list of things that we know that matter to people's

1867
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:30,720
well being that aren't included at all in GDP.

1868
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:34,720
I mean, if you have time to do exercise every day, uh,

1869
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:36,720
that makes people happier and healthier.

1870
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:38,720
There's good evidence on that.

1871
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:41,720
If people had six weeks of vacation a year, uh,

1872
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:44,720
instead of one or two weeks, they would be happier and healthier.

1873
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:46,720
They're, they're hard data on that.

1874
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:50,720
So the fact is we don't measure those things.

1875
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,720
We could be.

1876
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:55,720
And we ought to.

1877
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:59,720
We would be more likely to pay attention to them if we met.

1878
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,720
Well, just put it in a comment.

1879
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,720
I'll put it in a comment for a few things.

1880
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:04,720
Yeah.

1881
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:09,720
When it's, when it's the book with San and Stiglitz and Tusey that was

1882
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,720
the report to the French government.

1883
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:12,720
Yes.

1884
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,720
And that's outstanding.

1885
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,720
And that's two no-dell, laureate economists.

1886
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,720
And so if we think that the industry and economics is all over

1887
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,720
the list about GDP, then that's an exception.

1888
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:25,720
And I'm also an admirer of Kate Rayworth's concept of the

1889
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:28,720
donut economy, which has planetary boundaries and living with

1890
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:33,720
military limits, but also the social floor, which means meeting

1891
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:37,720
people's basic needs and focusing on them flourishing or

1892
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:43,720
thriving, rather than the opulence per se as the goal.

1893
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:47,720
On the point of the happiness index.

1894
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:52,720
It should be, I actually discuss this in my last book, the global

1895
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:53,720
solar commons.

1896
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:59,720
And the people of Bhutan don't live really that long, actually.

1897
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:06,720
So people can be happy with the assumed constraints, which may

1898
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:10,720
be unconscious of what, of their society.

1899
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:13,720
You can, you know, you could be happy.

1900
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:17,720
Well, I'm not going to, you know, my parents didn't live more

1901
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:19,720
than 70 years.

1902
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:21,720
So that's my expectation.

1903
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:24,720
And you could be happy under those conditions.

1904
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:29,720
So I think there's limits to the happiness index.

1905
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:34,720
If you want to apply this globally, you know, to what is really

1906
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:39,720
possible to, for quality of life with people in the world, I

1907
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:42,720
wouldn't go by the happiness index.

1908
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:45,720
Or see me not only by.

1909
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:48,720
I think we have to think about wrapping up.

1910
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,720
Is there one more question when we're going to pose?

1911
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:57,720
Yeah, I think the way, sorry, I was like, it was lost in the, in

1912
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:58,720
the chat.

1913
01:41:58,720 --> 01:41:58,720
Well, okay.

1914
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,720
So, I mean, there's a few people talking about stock buybacks.

1915
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,720
We had Mel M again and then also Anthony Lobeir.

1916
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:05,720
They're talking about stock buybacks.

1917
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:06,720
I guess.

1918
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:11,720
Is there any comments anyone wants to make related to, like,

1919
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:15,720
incentives to discourage stock buybacks or like what role stock

1920
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:16,720
buybacks could play?

1921
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:20,720
I guess in a relatively ethical manner or moral manner that fits

1922
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,720
in line with what everyone's been talking about today.

1923
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,720
Because that seems to be what people are sort of grasping at in

1924
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,720
their comments about stock buybacks.

1925
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,720
I mean, maybe I'll say something about stock buybacks.

1926
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:39,720
I don't, first of all, I don't see there's a crucial issue, but

1927
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:45,720
I would be concerned as an economist about the, about

1928
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:50,720
companies that are doing widespread stock buybacks because

1929
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:56,720
essentially what, what they're saying is that we don't want to

1930
01:42:56,720 --> 01:43:00,720
give this money to its dividends to shareholders, but we want

1931
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:03,720
to just invest in ourselves more.

1932
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:06,720
I mean, I'm not sure that's the best strategy, but at the same

1933
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:10,720
time, I don't really see as a, this is a big deal.

1934
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:13,720
I mean, this is, we talked about a whole bunch of other problems

1935
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,720
today.

1936
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,720
I don't think that's a crucial one.

1937
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:25,720
As we are coming to ending, I just want everybody to know that

1938
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:29,720
if they want to go on our website, there may be more comments.

1939
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:32,720
And if you want to respond to them on the website, you're

1940
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:33,720
welcome.

1941
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:34,720
Great.

1942
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:35,720
All right.

1943
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:37,720
Well, look, I want to really, Alex.

1944
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:41,720
Well, if you'll ask one question or if you want to close out

1945
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:43,720
on fun with that too, I don't want to.

1946
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:44,720
Go ahead.

1947
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:45,720
Oh, yeah.

1948
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:48,720
So I guess, um, I guess going back to the definition of

1949
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:51,720
neoliberalism, it seems more oriented towards the market

1950
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,720
liberalization side.

1951
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:57,720
But do you think that overlooks that government spending has

1952
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:01,720
gone up a lot in a bipartisan manner since about, you know,

1953
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,720
Reagan, given the fact that usually when people talk about

1954
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:06,720
neoliberalism, they talk about sort of the change in economic

1955
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,720
policy from Reagan and Thatcher on.

1956
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:11,720
Because I mean, I'm looking, you know, the U.S.

1957
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:15,720
print-up or capital basis does spend more on health insurance

1958
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:19,720
and education compared to the OECD index.

1959
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:23,720
So like, do you think if we, like in the critiques of neoliberalism

1960
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:27,720
by mostly saying it's a supply side, we tend to overlook some of

1961
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:31,720
the more Keynesian issues that have common neoliberalism?

1962
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,720
Because when I hear red syncing behavior and the corny

1963
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:37,720
capitalistic complaints people make, that seems to be more of

1964
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:41,720
an issue of the, um, where, like the points where government

1965
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,720
and private industry mix together.

1966
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:47,720
So yeah, what do you have to say about those comments?

1967
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:53,720
On the question of are spending more on health insurance?

1968
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,720
It's true.

1969
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:58,720
We spend twice what the OECD countries spend on health insurance

1970
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,720
and we get way worse outcomes.

1971
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:05,720
And you can hold a, I think, a variety of, of discussable views

1972
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:09,720
about whether government is more efficient or the private sector

1973
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,720
is more efficient.

1974
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:16,720
But I think there are certain structures of markets under

1975
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:21,720
which we know that pure private market incentives lead to bad

1976
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:25,720
outcomes and I think health markets are exactly a case in

1977
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:29,720
point of the adverse selection problem.

1978
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:35,720
You know, people hated the mandate in the Obamacare bill.

1979
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:39,720
They were all in favor of the idea that we require insurance

1980
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:43,720
companies to sell us insurance at affordable rates, even if we

1981
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:46,720
had pre-existing conditions, but they hated the mandate.

1982
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:50,720
And I could never have a, uh, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

1983
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:54,720
a conversation that went anywhere with those people until quite

1984
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:57,720
by accident one day I asked the question, what do you think

1985
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:02,720
would happen if the government required home insurance companies

1986
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:06,720
to sell fire insurance at affordable rates to people after

1987
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,720
their houses had already burned down?

1988
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:12,720
And, and thinking about that question, everybody got it right

1989
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:13,720
away.

1990
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:16,720
Well, the insurance companies would go bankrupt, of course.

1991
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:19,720
Well, the health insurance companies go bankrupt if they

1992
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:22,720
have to sell health insurance at affordable rates.

1993
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:25,720
Even if you have a pre-existing condition, that's the guy who's

1994
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,720
house has already burned down.

1995
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:29,720
They can't insure you unless everybody's in the pool.

1996
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:33,720
Every other government just puts everybody in the pool.

1997
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:36,720
And they don't argue about it, but, you know, it's paid for out

1998
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:37,720
of tax revenues.

1999
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:39,720
Uh, you're, you're insured, you're covered.

2000
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:40,720
We don't do that here.

2001
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:44,720
We've taken a small step toward doing it, but the, the history of

2002
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:21,720
how we've done it in the past under reliance on the

2003
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:48,720
government.

2004
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:52,720
And so we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're

2005
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:56,720
we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're,

2006
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:00,720
we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're

2007
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:03,720
relying strictly on private incentives thinking that the

2008
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:05,720
private sector is always more efficient.

2009
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:08,720
It just has led us to this absolutely horrible outcome.

2010
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,720
And relying on relying on employer.

2011
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,720
Employed paid insurance.

2012
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:14,720
Can be a burden on working people because of the very high.

2013
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:17,720
Very high benefits costs, which gives companies and in, in

2014
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:18,720
the United States.

2015
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:19,720
And you can't leave your job.

2016
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:21,720
If that's how you get your insurance.

2017
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:23,720
And that does not feel like freedom.

2018
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:24,720
Yeah.

2019
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,720
Well, that's freedom.

2020
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:32,720
Freedom to do I sooner than our cohorts, wealthier cohorts that

2021
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:37,720
provide, you know, guaranteed health insurance for everyone.

2022
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:40,720
I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think

2023
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:44,720
what he is in the world and life expectancy now in the United

2024
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:45,720
States.

2025
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:49,720
But I think on the issues of, of, of the health system, they're

2026
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:53,720
very, very serious issues of monopolization of certain

2027
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:54,720
sectors.

2028
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:58,720
And I would also say that I think that there are very serious issues

2029
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:02,720
of monopolization in provision of broadband, for example, we pay

2030
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:06,720
much more on broadband than people play, let's say in France.

2031
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,720
And these are very serious issues.

2032
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:12,720
And well, unfortunately, we didn't talk about them in most of our

2033
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:15,720
top today because we couldn't talk about everything.

2034
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,720
There are other issues.

2035
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:20,720
And Alex, in terms of the question that's being asked, that

2036
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:25,720
it's very important to also, to a significant extent, beef up the

2037
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:30,720
antitrust enforcement in the United States so that we deal with

2038
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:31,720
the monopolization issues.

2039
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:35,720
Now, of course, on the issue of insurance, Robert is absolutely

2040
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:36,720
right.

2041
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:39,720
There is the problem of adverse election and has to be dealt with

2042
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:42,720
very specifically on that.

2043
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:46,720
But anyway, I wanted to, to, to end at a good note.

2044
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:51,720
I appreciate being invited and talk about every, with everybody.

2045
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:58,720
And I am, I am humbled by all the good opinions that I hear today.

2046
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:00,720
And I thank you very much.

2047
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,720
Well, thank you, everybody.

2048
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:03,720
Wonderful.

2049
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:09,720
And I thank you very much.

2050
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:10,720
Well, thank you, everybody.

2051
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:11,720
Wonderful.

2052
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,720
A challenge for us.

2053
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:13,720
We appreciate that.

2054
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:16,720
Well, that's very, very, very boring.

2055
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:17,720
Yeah.

2056
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:20,720
On that very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

2057
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:23,720
on dismal note, I want to thank everybody for a wonderful and

2058
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:26,720
very lively conversation today and look forward to having a

2059
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:29,720
reason to being in touch with you again in the future sometime.

2060
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:30,720
Thank you, Joe.

2061
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:31,720
Okay.

2062
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,720
Bye bye.

2063
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:08,720
Thank you.

2064
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:38,720
Thank you.
