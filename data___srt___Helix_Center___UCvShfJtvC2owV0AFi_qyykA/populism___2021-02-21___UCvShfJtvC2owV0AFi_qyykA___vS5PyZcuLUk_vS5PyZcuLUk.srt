1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
you

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,060
you

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:23,300
do

4
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:34,020
Well, it being the noon hour here in New York City, I want to welcome everyone and wish

5
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,340
you a good morning, good afternoon or good evening depending on where you're viewing

6
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,020
the Zoom roundtable.

7
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:52,140
This is I think our third Helix Center roundtable for which we've relied on the Zoom format.

8
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,020
And of course that's due to the COVID pandemic.

9
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,140
We're trying to do the best we can to make the best of it.

10
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,340
I think so far these Zoom meetings have been quite lively and interesting.

11
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:10,060
So before I tell you about today's roundtable, I want to make just two very brief announcements

12
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:17,340
and those relate to our upcoming roundtables scheduled for March 20th.

13
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,220
We will have a roundtable on placebo and the placebo and no-cibo effects.

14
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,980
That should be very interesting.

15
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:34,540
And then either on April 17 or 24th to be determined, we're going to have a talk on stress.

16
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:40,660
And right now we're not stressing out about which data is exactly, but we should be able

17
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,300
to have that nailed down shortly.

18
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:49,580
Today we have a really wonderful panel of discussions convened to discuss this topic

19
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,220
of populism.

20
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,620
And before I get things underway, I want to just say a word, a brief word about each

21
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:06,140
of our discussions and in the interest of equity, I'm going to do this in alphabetical

22
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,740
order.

23
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:15,740

25
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,460
American Journal of Cultural Sociology.

26
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:30,620
A social theorist whose early work challenged the anti-cultural reductionism of classical

27
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,900
and modern sociology, Alexander has worked with generations of students and colleagues

28
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:43,980
to create a quote strong program unquote in cultural sociology.

29
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:51,660
Alexander has also developed the civil sphere theory, a macro sociological model of democracy

30
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,900
and the forces that can undermine it.

31
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,300
He is currently organizing a series of conferences and edited a book project, The Civil

32
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:06,460
Sphere in Latin America, The Civil Sphere in East Asia, bridging the civil order radicalism

33
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,860
and civil sphere.

34
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:17,620

35
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,180

At present he is completing a book manuscript entitled Aristotle's Practical Epistemology,

40
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,460
which seeks to situate Aristotle's theory of practical wisdom within his views of knowledge

41
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,820
and understanding and thereby to explain why Aristotle thinks of practical wisdom as an

42
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,220
extraordinary achievement as equivalent to political wisdom.

43
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:00,180

63
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:49,620
Okay, that they're with, I'm going to open up our conversation by asking each of our

64
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:58,860
discussants to make some comments about how they define populism, and I want to make it

65
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:05,140
clear at the outset that I think everyone will agree that the term populism is not something

66
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:12,900
it has an exact and precise definition, but it's something that we all at some point seem

67
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:19,420
to be wrapping our minds around, and then especially recently with the developments in

68
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,780
our modern history, I think it's become a very hot topic.

69
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,020
So I throw it open.

70
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:37,260
Who wants to take a quick shot at just making a quick definition so we can get things underway?

71
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Well I don't know if that's a student or any account, if I may, if everybody else is going

72
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,260
to be shy.

73
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,780
First of all, thank you very much for inviting me to participate.

74
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,100
I look forward to this as being very interesting.

75
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:58,100
It seems to me that you're very right to stress that populism is a fuzzy category, but it seems

76
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:05,540
to me, almost always to refer to a mass movement, usually a mass political movement but not

77
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:14,620
always, of a large group of people who define themselves as simply the people, usually not

78
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:22,740
subdivided further than that, they usually have agreements against elites who may feel

79
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:31,500
have deserved them and who are not too, who are there to serve the people but have not.

80
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:40,700
And the people are asked to replace, overthrow, displace these elites and govern more directly

81
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,540
themselves.

82
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,460
Sometimes the people also define themselves against a subordinate group and they regard

83
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:57,820
as also undeserving and who perhaps are allies of elites who are working from both ends,

84
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:05,100
as it were, against the people.

85
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,900
Yeah I think I can endorse quite a lot of that.

86
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:13,620
What I want to add is I think something that distinguishes a lot of populist movements is

87
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:21,740
that it's not just that they want to define a group of people as the people, but also

88
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:28,660
that the people are kind of repository for certain kinds of qualities that are underappreciated

89
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,300
by that elite that the people are defined in relation to.

90
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:38,460
So I think coming from a kind of classical perspective, populist movements, you might

91
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,380
say, appeal to the virtues that the masses possessed that are not commonly recognized

92
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:51,380
and that it's a reaction to a construal of the people as lacking those virtues and deserving

93
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,020
only secondary forms of political or social participation.

94
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,420
I can go with that.

95
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:08,540
Can we begin talking without?

96
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,020
Yeah.

97
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,820
So I will go next.

98
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,780
And I beg to differ here because I do not believe that optimism is a fuzzy category and

99
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:25,140
I think that we can arrive at exactly the precise definitions of that.

100
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,940
But before that, let me take a different approach here.

101
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,620
My concern is when we talk about populism is why do we care about populism and why do

102
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,340
we care about it now?

103
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,380
And I think that there are, we're talking about modern populist here.

104
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,140
Of course, there have been populist phenomenon history from, you know, from the Greek demagogues,

105
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,780
for example, to the Romare public and all the way down to our own days, right?

106
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,420
But we're talking about modern populist now.

107
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,620
So what is very interesting about populism and about our concern about populist is that

108
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,180
first it is a novelty.

109
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:07,820
It is a new phenomenon that emerges in the aftermath of World War II in the liberal democracies

110
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,140
that developed after the end of World War II.

111
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,220
Secondly, it is a geographically diffused phenomenon.

112
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,140
We see that firstly in Latin America, then it comes into Europe in the late 70s and then

113
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,180
it expands to the United States.

114
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,780
Thirdly, it is a very ambivalent phenomenon.

115
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,380
We have left-wing populist and right-wing populist.

116
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,900
And sometimes they come together very nicely and neatly like it happened in my country

117
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,420
a few years ago.

118
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:41,020
And finally, the fourth factor that makes populist such an intriguing phenomenon is

119
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,260
that it has a strong impulse for autocracy.

120
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,340
Although populist leaders come into power by the ballot box, okay, it has a very, very

121
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,540
strong impulse for authoritarianist for autocracy.

122
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,220
We saw that in the United States quite recently.

123
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:01,620
Now, all of those four factors lead us to a very, very simple definition.

124
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,140
If we put them together and my definition has two words.

125
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,900
It is the most minimal definition you can get around.

126
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,980
There's nothing more minimal than that.

127
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,940
So I define populism in my work.

128
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:17,740
I've been here in this area for many, many years actually working on populist democracy.

129
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,020
So I define that as democratic liberalism.

130
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,460
So it is a system, it is a political party or a party.

131
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:30,380
So it's for a system or a leader if you like any kind of level of unit of analysis that

132
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:37,540
abides by the rules of democracy, but not by the rules of post-war liberal democracy.

133
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:43,060
It is a democratic, illiberal kind of rule.

134
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,620
And I will leave it here for the moment.

135
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:53,620
But illiberal democracy and illiberal democracy, a democracy that is not liberal.

136
00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:01,900
By the way, this is the question used by Viktor Orban.

137
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:10,860
I think a lot of the people wouldn't agree with Orban's definition.

138
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:18,980
But I don't think there's anything to argue with any of these definitions.

139
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:25,140
And people who are listening to this podcast have to realize that this word is a fuzzy

140
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,380
concept.

141
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:33,340
And anybody who says that they have a precise definition is just taking a position in the

142
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,140
field of discussion.

143
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:43,620
And that definition will stand for certain other associated positions.

144
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,740
I would like to argue, I would like to add on to these, I don't have any disagreement

145
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:57,580
that with a few questions, one, populism isn't a post-war phenomenon that it goes back to.

146
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:06,020
Certainly, it's endemic to, in fact, it's endemic to a Republican idea of democracy.

147
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,780
It's a theme, it's a dimension, and it's a strain.

148
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,500
Why is it a strain?

149
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:21,580
Because a democracy, let's just call it, always has a reference to the people.

150
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:29,740
It always has a presupposition that there is a civil community regulated by law and that

151
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,900
the people vote and elect somebody.

152
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:41,900
So you're never going to have a democratic process, even if it's a relatively elitist

153
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:48,860
18th century process or something more incorporated like the one we have now, that doesn't have

154
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,780
continuous references to the people.

155
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,020
The people should rule.

156
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,060
This movement is on behalf of the people, et cetera.

157
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:04,140
Obama, who's not a populist, had populist dimensions, he talked constantly about the

158
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
people.

159
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:11,900
The other thing is I'd say that there's a continuum of populism, therefore, that moves

160
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:22,820
from within the institutions of democracy to beyond what I call radical populism, which

161
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:33,180
breaks then the institutions and results in one man or one woman rule on the left or the

162
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,180
right.

163
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,940
I certainly agree with the idea that there's a kind of endemic feature that, especially

164
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:52,260
in Republican politics, because lowercase-R Republican politics has this internal tension,

165
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:58,060
and you can see populism as one kind of way that that tension comes to the surface.

166
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:04,300
I think as one of the prompts for this panel, we got this quote from either Madison or Hamilton

167
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,180
from the Federalist Papers about how even if every opinion citizen had been a Socrates,

168
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,540
a group of them would still have been a mob.

169
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,580
This idea that when you, for Republican politics to work, you need a suitable number of people

170
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:22,620
who are fit to the task of governing, but who in governing represent, in some sense,

171
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,340
the will of the people and are accountable to them, but whom the people as a whole see

172
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,380
is better than that.

173
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:36,060
That particular intrinsically elite dimension of Republican forms of democracy is, I think,

174
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,500
unpopular in the 20th century and the 21st century.

175
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,500
It's no longer seen as appropriate to regard the political elite as superior in virtue

176
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,660
or in decision making or anything like that.

177
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,500
As a result, I think that explains why populist movements have emerged.

178
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:04,060
It's the suspicion of a governing elite who are better at the job than the rest of us.

179
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,580
We can see other circumstances in which these kinds of suspicions have broken forth in the

180
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:14,220
past where elites have not done a good job of maintaining the illusion, let's say, at

181
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,460
least of governing well or of representing the will of the people or remaining accountable

182
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
to them.

183
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:26,180
I do think it's intrinsic to Republican politics because it has this combination of a popular

184
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,900
basis and the establishment of a governing class.

185
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,620
I'd like to endorse that.

186
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,180
I think that's very well put.

187
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:46,020
My perspective as an American historian focuses my attention, I guess, so I'm less familiar

188
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:54,780
with some of the other examples, but if we restrict populism to the post-World War II

189
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,820
period, it leaves out the biggest episode in American history that's been labeled as

190
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,180
populist ever since it happened.

191
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:11,620
That was the uprising of the emergence of the so-called People's Party of the 1890s.

192
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:21,060
I think going back, there have been several conspicuous occasions in American history

193
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:31,580
again where movements have appeared that say the people have inherently more virtue than

194
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,260
the elites.

195
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:40,060
While it's true that virtue is essential to Republican government, we, the people, have

196
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:47,060
more of it than those stuff shirts at the top and we demand that they be displaced and

197
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:53,060
replaced by people who are more authentic representatives of our will.

198
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:58,820
I think that was very much a characteristic of Andrew Jackson's political movement.

199
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:06,580
I think they're going back into episodes like the Whiskey Rebellion or the North Carolina

200
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:12,380
regulation even in colonial period at times, there have been mass movements with populist

201
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,060
features like that.

202
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:20,620
I think that's one of the benefits of calling it, of using a fuzzy definition because you

203
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:28,580
can legitimately talk about a movement with populist features without getting utterly bogged

204
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:34,660
down into whether it fits this box exactly or that one.

205
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:40,260
Okay, let me try to link some dots here if I may.

206
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,260
Do we care about populist mass historians?

207
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:49,580
That would be fine, of course, and populist has been out there in history since Memorial

208
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,580
Times.

209
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,980
I mean, all societies have been divided between elites and the people, right?

210
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,220
If you go back to the Roman Republic, for example, you can find the party that is called

211
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:05,260
the Populares, that was the party that went against the Senate, against the optimatists,

212
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:11,300
and the tribunes of the plebs like Tiberius Grák, who's, for example, his brother, Gaius

213
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,580
Grák, who's were populist leaders.

214
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,260
And this is why they were assassinated because they went against the Senate, against the elites

215
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,420
of that time.

216
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,260
And if you go all the way up to today, you find many, many populist movements.

217
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:28,100
I mean, no one doubts about that, and when it comes to the United States, Michael Kazan

218
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:33,820
has written a marvelous book about populist in the United States since the 19th century.

219
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,380
But and of course, Jackson was a populist leader.

220
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,780
I mean, he was divisive.

221
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,740
He was the one who relied on the spoiling system.

222
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:48,500
And those are phenomena that we see in contemporary populist galore, I mean, polarization, patron

223
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,500
of politics, et cetera, but it's not the reason.

224
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,780
I mean, we're not historians.

225
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,060
I mean, we care about populist because-

226
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,060
Wait a minute.

227
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,060
I am.

228
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,060
Yes, you are.

229
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,060
You are.

230
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,060
Yeah, yeah.

231
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,060
I mean, I mean, yes.

232
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:10,860
I mean, we the people, the ordinary people, okay, we are not historians like, you know,

233
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,860
like you.

234
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,500
Now, it affects our lives.

235
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:23,540
I mean, this is why there is this booming thing about since 2016, actually, about populist,

236
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,700
because populist and populist governments affect our lives.

237
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,860
And this stands on two puzzles.

238
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,820
This presents us with two puzzles.

239
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:40,260
First, how can that populist emerges in recent times in our liberal democracies?

240
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,180
We used to live in liberal democracies.

241
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,100
Now, something is happening here.

242
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,980
We see one of those guys who are not liberal, pull, do, period.

243
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,220
What do we do with that?

244
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,620
How can we deal with that?

245
00:21:52,620 --> 00:22:00,460
And secondly, what would populism, if successful as it sometimes is, how does it do to liberal

246
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
democracies?

247
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:11,220
How can people like Chavez or Bond, Trump, et cetera, how, what can they do to our lives

248
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,940
for liberal democracies?

249
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,900
So this is why I focus on the modern times, because I'm not a historian, first of all.

250
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:28,060
And secondly, because I care about the future, my future and my children's future.

251
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,060
I want, can I respond to that?

252
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,700
Yeah, I think, you know, one of the things that a historical perspective offers you is

253
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,540
alternatives to liberal democracy.

254
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,100
I mean, I think it depends a little bit on how optimistic or pessimistic you are about

255
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,380
the liberal project in the post-World War II period.

256
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,300
And if you feel that there are, you know, that the, for instance, the rise in economic

257
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:55,020
inequality over the last 50 years is a, you know, it's a feature, not a bug of the liberal

258
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,940
order.

259
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,220
It's a consequence of concentration of certain kinds of power in the hands of some people.

260
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,100
Then you might not be so optimistic about thinking, well, what we need to do is to get

261
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
back to that.

262
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm very suspicious of Golden Age thinking whether it's looking back to the 17th century

263
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,580
or looking back to the 1950s.

264
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,580
And you know, if there are vulnerabilities in our form of life, our form of political

265
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,940
life, then looking to some of the alternatives and thinking in historical terms can give

266
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,980
you perspective.

267
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,020
And I think this applies, you know, even when you're thinking sort of cross-constitutionally,

268
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,940
I find it very illuminating to think about the groggy and their land reforms when I'm

269
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,580
trying to understand what Narendra Modi is up to, you know, how he came to power on the

270
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,460
back of the struggles of ordinary farmers in India and the kind of land reforms that

271
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,460
he's put into place.

272
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,660
Monty is not the tribe, you know, the blabs.

273
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,260
Monty is the prime minister.

274
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,260
So he's the senate.

275
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,260
Yeah.

276
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,260
It is here to draw the analogy.

277
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,540
Go ahead, Jeff.

278
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:06,180
I mean, I think that most of the populism that people are afraid of most but not all

279
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,820
is populism of the extreme right today.

280
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:18,940
There are some exceptions like Manuel Lope has Obrador in Mexico.

281
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:25,820
But the fear, the ones that move to the right usually combine an anti-elitist movement on

282
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:32,180
behalf of the people with a deep person with, well, that's part of populism on the left,

283
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,460
extreme left.

284
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:47,460
But also with bigotry and anti-Semitism, anti-Islamism, some kind of anti-civil discourse that targets

285
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,940
not just an elite.

286
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:55,740
I think one of you referred to that earlier, but another group as a tremendous danger.

287
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:02,660
So that the country that they or the people that they want to set up are ethnically homogeneous

288
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,140
group.

289
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:11,060
The left populist is not as concerned usually with that, but thinks more in terms of the

290
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:17,740
class so that there's a pure class that they will represent and they'll come to power.

291
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:24,300
But they're also just at Sanders because they will then possibly well eliminate members of

292
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:30,180
all the other classes that the people don't represent.

293
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:38,380
I was interested in this reference to virtue because of course, virtue is also, I don't

294
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,500
want to say, I don't want to keep repeating that it's a fuzzy category, but it's certainly

295
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:48,340
not something easily defined or it can take it tomes to define virtue.

296
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:54,780
And yet it seems to be an engine, the issue of virtue and who has it seems to be an engine

297
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,220
driving these conflicts.

298
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,660
And I think similarly, this is the idea of who are the elites because I think elitism

299
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,300
also has been changing over time.

300
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
What exactly, who are those people?

301
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Just a moment.

302
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,300
Just a moment.

303
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,060
I mean, populist comes into power quite often.

304
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,300
I mean, it has happened in many, many places.

305
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:20,100
Not only with left-wing populist like in Venezuela, for example, think about Soutes and Maduro.

306
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,180
Think about my little country Greece.

307
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:28,140
We have had our share of left-populism for many, many years under Papindreo and under

308
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,580
Tupras more recently or under right-wing governments.

309
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:38,460
Now what happens here is when they come into power, they become the elites.

310
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,060
How do we deal with that?

311
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,460
I mean, populists have been in power in several countries for many, many years.

312
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,540
They are the elites.

313
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,060
It is very simple or simplistic to say that those are against the elites because they

314
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,900
do become elites.

315
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,420
Think about Trump.

316
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,420
Think about Orba.

317
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,220
He has been in power since 2010, 11 years now.

318
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:10,620
First, secondly, if I may, left-wing populist, right-wing populist, I alluded to that earlier,

319
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,340
often come, they form a tandem and they rule together.

320
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:23,020
This happened again in my country in 2015 until 2019 for four years, full years.

321
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:29,340
A populist party, Syriza and a right-wing party, a stream right-wing party, a native party,

322
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,900
independent Greeks, rule together.

323
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,260
No problem there.

324
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,260
Or think about Peronism in Argentina.

325
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,620
Peron was a right-winger.

326
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:44,420
And today, the Peronist party, the judicialist party, is a left-wing party under the Kirchner.

327
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:52,860
So, it is not that simple.

328
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:58,940
So you're making it simple by arguing that left and right are the same.

329
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:04,180
This is a common argument of people who attack populism, which is, well, there's no real

330
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,020
difference between the left populism and the right.

331
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,220
In fact, there's a great deal of difference.

332
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:16,980
I mean, going back to what Donaje said, if there are vast structural inequalities in

333
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:25,860
a country that has a democratic form of government, there have to be, and there should be, constant

334
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:33,500
movements to overthrow the people who have privilege or to restructure the society.

335
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:39,940
Now as long as you have democratic institutions, that's not going to end up in an anti-democratic

336
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,940
form of power.

337
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,980
It will be metabolized in various ways.

338
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:51,260
But these populist threads, I think, throbbed through the history of all stratified societies

339
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,420
that have democratic forms of government.

340
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:58,740
I actually want to say something that might be surprising given what I said earlier,

341
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,540
which is that I actually, you know, I think in our contemporary global context, I want

342
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:08,060
to endorse what Taka said about the contrast between populism and liberalism, because I

343
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:13,620
think that is the most illuminating pairing of phenomena.

344
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,220
But I think, you know, one way in which the, I mean, there are left liberals and right

345
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,620
liberals, and I think this helps us get some clarity on the differences in the origins

346
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,780
of fluffing and right populism.

347
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:31,060
And in particular, I think there are different kinds of elites or phenomena of elite capture

348
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,460
that drive populist movements.

349
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,300
And this might be one of the reasons there's overlap between the left and the right, because

350
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,980
it's not all economic.

351
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,780
If it were just about economic elites and a corresponding sort of class critique, then

352
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,820
we would not expect left and right wing populism to overlap.

353
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:52,260
But in addition to economic elites or phenomena of economic inequality, there's also, I think,

354
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,300
political and cultural phenomenon.

355
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,620
So I think this is especially true in the United States context where economic, political

356
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,860
and cultural capital come apart in very visible ways.

357
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,820
You can think about Wall Street, K Street and Hollywood.

358
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:10,820
That's kind of the totemic, you know, things to pin this on.

359
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:15,860
So you know, as has been documented extensively, especially in recent years, we have this phenomenon

360
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,580
stagnation of wages and rising economic inequality in this country.

361
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,180
But the government, I think related to that, but separate, conceptually separate from that

362
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,860
is the fact that our government institutions are increasingly responsive to certain kinds

363
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,060
of private interests.

364
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,100
And people don't feel like they have the possibility of political accountability.

365
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,780
And that's for a wide range of reasons, including our campaigns, our electoral system and our

366
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,260
campaign finance system, lots of other reasons.

367
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,220
Those are the things that I care about the most.

368
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,420
But, and then there's a kind of phenomenon of cultural elitism, where, you know, I think

369
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:55,500
we've lost a kind of mass culture that we have had in the past in various ways, which

370
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,420
help to unite people across different kinds of social strata.

371
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:06,060
And you know, there's a kind of, there's a sort of pluralism, a form of cultural pluralism

372
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,300
that has taken hold in elite institutions, like universities, and many of us are affiliated

373
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:18,340
with the media, certain other kinds of institutions, that I would call a pluralism without aspiration.

374
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:23,560
It says that people are essentially different from each other, and we don't have any common

375
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,900
values around which to unite, and you have to accept these essential differences and

376
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:34,180
not try to make common cause with people across those differences.

377
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:40,660
And I think that that particular cultural phenomenon has driven a kind of popular insurgency in

378
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,260
the United States that crosses the left-right wing distinction.

379
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,300
Whereas I think when it comes to the economic issues, and I think to some extent the political

380
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,660
issues, that's been much more polarized.

381
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,540
And I think those things stand much more behind the success of someone like Bernie Sanders

382
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:00,860
and Democratic Party politics than it does explain the rise of Donald Trump.

383
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:06,660
But famously it was documented that in the 2016 election, people who actually were at

384
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,860
the bottom of the economic poll went for Clinton over Trump by some extent, which put the lie

385
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:17,740
to the idea that this is an economic populism that was really driving the Trump phenomenon.

386
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:23,900
So I think because of this sort of plurality of forms of elitism or elites and the ways

387
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,620
of these come apart, I think you actually have overlapping populist energies that can

388
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:38,420
get sucked into different forms of populism across the political spectrum.

389
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:46,540
John Rawls had written in laws of people that liberal democracies had a sort of, I'd

390
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:55,180
call it a homious static principle where liberal people educated in liberal democracies

391
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:01,260
grew to value the democratic process so much so that they would not allow it to slip back

392
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,860
into tyranny.

393
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:08,740
And I think latter day developments and developments in history sort of put the lie to that approach

394
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,700
and perhaps overly optimistic.

395
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:23,300
Well, I think if you've got democratic forms that have created results that are profoundly

396
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:31,980
alienating, disillusioning, engraving to those who define themselves as the people, then they

397
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:40,660
may decide that those democratic forms are the source of their deprivation and may turn

398
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
against those.

399
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:49,300
So I think we all recognize that democracy is a lot more fragile than maybe Professor

400
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:55,180
Rawls appreciated at the time he was writing it.

401
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:00,820
I mean, I think that we have to realize that when we let talk us first, because I think

402
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:06,780
his his feed delay kind of got him behind the behind the eight ball go ahead, talk us.

403
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,780
No, I'm fine.

404
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:19,780
I mean, let me see how how to how to how to work how populist works.

405
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,300
So what we have in the beginning that's the situation of nature.

406
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,900
We have a liberal democracy.

407
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,740
What's a liberal democracy, right?

408
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:30,820
A liberal democracy is a system that acknowledges that there are many divisions in society, class

409
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,420
divisions, cultural divisions.

410
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:39,580
So again, I'm trying to link the dots, but regional divisions, religious divisions, you

411
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,580
name it, right?

412
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:48,020
Now, Rawls comes and says, Hey, guys, let us play moderately.

413
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,340
Let us know what he calls over overlapping consensus.

414
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,260
He uses this phrase overlapping consensus.

415
00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:00,420
How do we do that by applying the rule of law and protecting the rights of minorities?

416
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,220
Now this is liberal democracy.

417
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,700
This is what we have.

418
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,660
Now a guy comes.

419
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,140
Okay.

420
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:12,220
And he says, because it is always a he, by the way, but I don't want to get into that.

421
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,620
He says, no, no, no, no, no, no, democracy.

422
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,500
I mean, our societies are not divided by so many divisions.

423
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,540
We have one one over our division, the people versus the elites.

424
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,460
Therefore we cannot build bridges.

425
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,180
There will be polarization.

426
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,180
Forget it.

427
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,100
Yes, adversity conflict.

428
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,620
We have to fight against each other.

429
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,220
Who's going to win?

430
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,220
We?

431
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
Why?

432
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,220
Because we are the majority.

433
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,220
We are the people.

434
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,220
Okay.

435
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,900
Forget rule of law, forget the protection of minority rights, et cetera, et cetera.

436
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,100
And this is how you get wrong.

437
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,060
And this is how I just said I disagree with that.

438
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,060
Five million.

439
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,060
Forters.

440
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:58,100
You have to realize that we are social movements that have that communicate our society all

441
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,100
the time.

442
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:04,820
I mean, Rawls is describing an idealized.

443
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,300
He's a political theorist.

444
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,500
He's a normative political theorist.

445
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,780
He's not a sociologist.

446
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,460
You can't wear political empirical social scientists.

447
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:24,380
You can't convert Rawls's idea into a empirical description of how democracy actually works

448
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:29,060
in an actual society.

449
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:34,420
So you can't criticize an actually existing society from the point of view of Rawls and

450
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,780
say it doesn't work right.

451
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,780
No.

452
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,460
It, in se we have to think about how does it work?

453
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:49,460
And I think it's fascinating to me that despite the most radical right-wing challenge in American

454
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:59,020
history, which was Trump, because he took the presidency, the structural difference

455
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:04,340
in the administration of the United States, the set of office obligations of many office

456
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:13,740
holders, the legal order, other civil associations, and the institution of journalism as a profession,

457
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:19,540
it contained this very dangerous populist movement.

458
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:24,700
And so we can't just broadly talk about populism taking over countries.

459
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,500
We have to think of them as movements.

460
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:33,860
And we need to think of institutions and other kinds of virtues.

461
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:39,980
I think it's sort of a populism as a stress test, I think, is an interesting way of thinking

462
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
about it.

463
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:47,900
Insofar as it's not just individuals who are singled out as the bad elites, but actually

464
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:53,180
institutions like the media, like universities, I mean, I would say the United States has

465
00:37:53,180 --> 00:38:00,420
passed a stress test a lot better than Hungary currently is, given the state of civil society

466
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,660
institutions there.

467
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:11,940
And that might have to do with the particular forms of decentralization of power that are

468
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,940
possible.

469
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,140
And power thought of very broadly, not just as political power, but also as economic,

470
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,980
cultural power.

471
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,260
How many people know each other in certain kinds of political circles?

472
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,620
And can a political party take over a media apparatus or not?

473
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,100
Those kinds of things depend on networks of affinity that are much harder to pull off

474
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,260
in a country of 330 million people.

475
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,900
Oh, no, I don't think that's exactly true.

476
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:43,100
I mean, we have big countries like Brazil and Turkey.

477
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:49,220
I think if you have a democracy for 200 years and you have a gradual institutionalization

478
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:57,940
of professions, I mean, most of the weak, the illiberal democracies, including Greece,

479
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:05,340
including Poland, including Hungary, including Brazil, are very recently established.

480
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,780
They have very, very fragile.

481
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,020
Look in the liberal democracy.

482
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,340
No, it's not, but it has a very unstable democracy.

483
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,020
It has had in the past your references to the right.

484
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:23,420
I mean, it's a great democracy is very stable.

485
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,420
I'm sorry.

486
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,420
I mean, we didn't say now.

487
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,420
I didn't say now.

488
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,260
It is almost 50 years in the scheme of things.

489
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,140
That's not very wrong.

490
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,580
I'm sorry.

491
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,140
I mean, I'm glad that that's fine.

492
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,140
That's fine.

493
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,140
No problem.

494
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,140
No problem.

495
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,140
I don't take that personally.

496
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
Don't worry.

497
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:49,940
But, you know, democracies, right.

498
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,980
I mean, the thing is that when a populist party comes into power and this has happened

499
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,820
in Greece, as I said earlier, I mean, I've lived through this.

500
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,260
I mean, this is the story of my life as a matter of fact.

501
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:09,460
They stop the weakening situations and then another populist may come down the road and

502
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:14,660
then another one and then you do not know what will happen to your democracy.

503
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:20,100
And this is what happened in the Republican room, by the way, after Tiberius Gracus, we

504
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:25,940
mentioned earlier that 60 years down the road, another guy came that's in a gun called

505
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:33,020
Marius and another one called Silla and then Bruce's and then the Republic was gone.

506
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,060
This is what we get.

507
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:42,100
I mean, I cannot see how Hungary, for example, Poland can go back to even weak liberalism.

508
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:50,020
Yes, those are weak liberal democracies, but liberal have been in the past.

509
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,260
This is what I'm saying.

510
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:56,260
And Greece might go down that same road again.

511
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,260
I know what you mean.

512
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,700
I mean, I didn't mean to disagree with you, but democracy has been stable in Greece for

513
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,740
a number of years, but the institutions are not that strong.

514
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,820
Yes, I know what you mean.

515
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,540
So I don't disagree with you at all.

516
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:17,740
But it is exactly those feeble institutions that charismatic leader because there is

517
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,660
charisma there and there is agency.

518
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:26,380
They may win power over and over again and lead those democracies to some authoritarian

519
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,380
direction.

520
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,340
That is the fear.

521
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:39,140
So this populism is a deep tendency in, I would say, all societies and it's counteracted by

522
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,300
what?

523
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:48,860
By deeply structured autonomous institutions committed to certain virtues that are run

524
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:55,060
that are deeply professionalized by strong civic traditions.

525
00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:00,140
But that won't stop the populist impulse, right?

526
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:05,180
And the populist impulse can be very productive if you have these institutions.

527
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:12,180
It can lead to reforms like the working man's movement in the 19th century or socialism

528
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:19,340
being transformed into social democracy and the big welfare state in Western Europe.

529
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:26,340
And these are very positive developments, but then you can have something like the peasant

530
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:34,940
movements in China and the workers and peasants movement in Russia that end up creating dictatorships

531
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:39,220
that last for a long, long, long time.

532
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:43,300
They don't have populism, right?

533
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:48,940
They don't have populism.

534
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:55,260
One point I want to make and I challenge here is that I do not know in the modern world

535
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:04,820
again any case in which anywhere in the liberal world, meaning the Americas, Europe, Canada,

536
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:13,140
Australia, etc., Japan, any case in which populism has had positive outcomes that populism has

537
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:17,940
been positive after being in power.

538
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,940
Olivia?

539
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:24,820
Well, I honestly think that's one of the advantages of his talk with perspective because it gives

540
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:33,820
you a lot more examples of populist movements that have been very beneficial.

541
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,700
And I think the working men's party in the United States is a good example.

542
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:42,220
I think the People's Party in the 1890s was a good example.

543
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:50,820
I think we can all think of revolutionary movements that looked maybe pretty awful and close,

544
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:56,500
but had beneficial results over a longer degree.

545
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:06,380
So let me put in a plug for historical examples and a historical perspective because I think

546
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:14,580
that gives us a much more complicated nuanced view of what the possibilities are.

547
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,780
What would you be aware of?

548
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,260
I think I focused on modern populations.

549
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,260
Yeah.

550
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,260
Would there be a way to distinguish?

551
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,260
I know this is not likely, but good populist movements.

552
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,460
What is that may be in a good populist movement that leads to reform versus one that seems

553
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,860
to be what we use the words divisive, polarizing, et cetera?

554
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,660
I don't think polarization is necessarily bad.

555
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,060
I mean, right, I think-

556
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,060
Polarization.

557
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,820
The fracturing of civil society is bad.

558
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,180
And maybe that's a characteristic effect of long-term polarization.

559
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:58,460
But if we think about corruption as obviously one phenomenon we can identify, it's possible

560
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:05,020
for a mass movement to demand more accountability from political actors and economic actors for

561
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,460
that matter that reduces corruption.

562
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,140
And that's something that's quite measurable.

563
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,980
And I would say that that's one phenomenon.

564
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,940
Another- The reason I brought up Bolivia is that inequality has gone down.

565
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:26,100
And of course, there- Under Morales, who has obviously had authoritarian tendencies, which

566
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:32,020
we should think are bad, to maintain power and to self-aggrandize in certain ways.

567
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,300
But infrastructure spending is massively up.

568
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,660
The welfare of people in rural poverty is massively up in Bolivia over that time frame.

569
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:48,100
And you might think that's a happy accident of the resource extraction economy and market

570
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,100
prices and so on.

571
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,660
There's disagreement to be had.

572
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,220
But one interpretation of those events is that that was a situation in which- This is

573
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:03,340
especially a problem in petrostates or resource-dependent states that that money gets tied up in the

574
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:09,140
hands of a handful of people and does not get used to bring people out of poverty.

575
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,940
Of course, Norway is a petrostate too, and they seem to do a pretty good job of taking

576
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,780
care of people there.

577
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,740
And you can see how resource extraction can be to the benefit of a welfare state and to

578
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:24,740
the welfare of the worst-off people.

579
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,500
And I think there are different trajectories that a populist movement can take.

580
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,100
And I think Venezuela versus Bolivia is an interesting contrast because of the relatively

581
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,260
similar time frames.

582
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:40,820
I mean, Bolivia is a very unusual movement of a very unusual example of left populism.

583
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,820
Radical.

584
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:49,340
I mean, radical left populism staying within the tracks barely of democracy and the recent

585
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:56,700
elections, a great example of a populist being elected again after an interim liberal.

586
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:03,660
But I mean, what I'd like to ask the panel, like, what about the surging of black people's

587
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,340
movements in the United States from the 1960s?

588
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:13,620
That's a social movement, and they call themselves the people acting on behalf of the people.

589
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,940
I mean, they have charismatic leaders.

590
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,540
How do you fit that in?

591
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:24,780
I mean, there's this tendency to look at the issue as elites dominating or populism.

592
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:31,140
But there's very positive social movements starting with the socialist or working people's

593
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,420
movements in the 19th century that have...

594
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:41,180
So what do you deal with the mass movement against racial oppression?

595
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:47,340
And how do you classify that in these terms?

596
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:52,100
Mass movements are part of, you know, they fit very well in the framework of a liberal

597
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,100
democracy.

598
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,780
I mean, those mass movements have two flurries.

599
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,780
They may flurries.

600
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:03,300
They may have their leaders as long and they may act and produce their results as long as

601
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,300
they abide by the rules of liberal democracy by the institutions.

602
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,740
There's nothing problematic about those movements.

603
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:18,420
I mean, by the way, let me say that Bolivia, Bolivia is not a good example, because Bolivia

604
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:24,060
is the only country in Latin America in which you have the majority of the population is

605
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,060
in the US.

606
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:29,380
So if you don't take the ratio issue, you cannot make sense of Bolivia, and you cannot compare

607
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:34,620
Bolivia to any other country in Latin America and the world, actually, because...

608
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,820
And this is what Morales was an individual, right?

609
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:45,580
So here, we support of his people, essentially, and he became president of Bolivia, and then

610
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,940
the end was not very happy.

611
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,820
It was a very unhappy end, but that was...

612
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:55,500
I mean, Bolivia is not comparable because of the racial composition of the country.

613
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,780
So let us leave Bolivia out.

614
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,620
It's a bad case.

615
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,860
It sounds like it's a case that doesn't fit your priors, and that's why it's a bad case.

616
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,860
I think it's a very interesting and illuminating...

617
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,860
It doesn't fit in the others.

618
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,860
But anyway, I want to respond to the question about...

619
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,860
I think I examined...

620
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,860
I mean, I think I answered by, you know, data.

621
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:23,220
I mean, I'm giving you data, and there is something that distinguishes Bolivia, and this is race.

622
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,940
Well, let me talk about race in America for a moment.

623
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,940
So I think...

624
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,940
I'm a compartment.

625
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:33,060
I think the 1963 March on Washington is a fantastic example of what the civil rights

626
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,820
movement accomplished and what it didn't.

627
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:40,060
This is the March on Washington for jobs and freedom, and in the writing of American history,

628
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,020
the jobs part has dropped out.

629
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,940
The minimum wage that is being debated in our country now is roughly corresponds to

630
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:51,220
the minimum wage that was one of the main demands of that march, a $2 minimum wage in

631
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:56,900
1963, which works out to something like $15 or $16 I think today.

632
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,540
And it didn't get passed.

633
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:02,780
And in general, you know, people remember the... I have a dream and the content of the

634
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,500
character and things like that.

635
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:10,500
And that's been written into sort of American history, but not the economic demands.

636
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:16,820
And I think the profound failures of the labor movement, both through internal fracturing

637
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:20,820
and through external pressures and the failure of the kind of regulatory apparatus in the

638
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:25,740
government side, that is one of the reasons for the continued massive gap in wealth between

639
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,820
black Americans and other Americans.

640
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:32,980
And one way of looking at that is that the civil rights movement was a beginning, obviously

641
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:38,380
guaranteeing civil rights in legislation and constitutions is crucial.

642
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:44,740
But it was seen as only one piece of a larger platform of changes to the material benefit

643
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:48,980
of black people that have largely not been realized in the country.

644
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:53,620
And I think from that perspective, that I think is a huge stain.

645
00:50:53,620 --> 00:51:02,780
And I think there will be... There's a continued opportunity on that front for multiracial

646
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,900
coalitions of people within the labor movement and in other venues in America.

647
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,420
And I think there will be a kind of resurgence of economic populism along those lines before

648
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:16,380
too long because it looks like the basically center left and center right policies of the

649
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,580
democratic and republican parties are not sufficient to address those kinds of problems.

650
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:27,300
But what I was really asking is whether the black movements in the 20th century have...

651
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:33,660
Don't they have many of the elements of populism, not whether they're incompatible with liberal

652
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,660
democracy?

653
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,700
No, no, I think they absolutely did.

654
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,020
And I think their economic dimensions are underplayed.

655
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:43,260
So that's what I was suggesting is that actually seeing them as a... Seeing that movement as

656
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:46,820
an economic populist movement is really essential to understanding what it was.

657
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:47,820
Yeah, exactly.

658
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:52,020
And they also critique the white even if you take the non-economic dimensions.

659
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:55,460
They were a movement and are a movement against an elite.

660
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,460
They called the white elite.

661
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:06,020
And just as the women's movement is... Has been very, very anti-black male elites.

662
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,980
It's been a mass movement of attack on male power.

663
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,300
I mean, the Me Too movement.

664
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:21,260
These are massive uprisings of people in a quote unquote class that I regard as a part

665
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,420
of this populist impulse that nobody would call them populist though.

666
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:31,780
Because they like them too much or many of the elites like them too much.

667
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,780
Harry?

668
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:40,820
Well, I would say there, if I could interject just a moment, I think the women's movement

669
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:46,460
or the civil rights movement are good examples of movements with populist features.

670
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:54,100
But the race-based civil rights movement cannot claim in the United States to represent the

671
00:52:54,100 --> 00:53:00,140
whole people because African Americans are what?

672
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:04,540
20% of the population, 11% of the population in some counts.

673
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:11,340
We've seen in recent years coalition building efforts.

674
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:22,140
So now you hear about black and brown people or broader or black Latins and indigenous.

675
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,300
And so there's coalition building.

676
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:30,220
But nevertheless, the civil rights movement doesn't claim to represent the whole people.

677
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:35,380
But it, Jeffery's absolutely right there, it has very strong populist features.

678
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:40,940
Women's movement, the same way the women's movement can represent half the people, but

679
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,540
not the whole people.

680
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:52,340
So this I think is one of the benefits of fuzzy categories is you can say, look at the populist

681
00:53:52,340 --> 00:54:01,700
features of civil rights, look at the populist features of anti-sexism and make those kind

682
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:11,060
of productive comparisons without getting hung up on just exactly how well they fit your

683
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,060
prayer definition.

684
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:18,460
Are these movements we're describing now, the degree they partake of populism as a driving

685
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:28,100
force, do they succeed to the degree that they also partake of some, they moderate this

686
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,060
radical part of it.

687
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:35,620
I think MLK is a good example of someone who sort of promised to white folks that he was

688
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,900
not a radical.

689
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:43,940
And I think to some degree that was helpful, I think abolitionists also a century earlier

690
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:48,540
tried to make the case or win over the hearts of the rest of the country as a way to sort

691
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:54,860
of spear, and some of them of course were quite radical, but is that the case that this sort

692
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,820
of moderating their radical?

693
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:06,660
I wouldn't go to the radicalism effort, but I would say that populist movements, like

694
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:12,180
minority populist movements, if we can use that expression, succeed to the degree to

695
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:18,700
which they can build a majority coalition by persuading people outside their base that

696
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:26,420
hey, I think that's just, or I can see how our people would benefit from that also.

697
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:34,020
So the degree to which they can build coalitions for radical measures or radical measures,

698
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:43,100
but the point is that they can move towards a majority in a democratic framework.

699
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,980
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I think that's a good point.

700
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:54,700
I mean, the idea of a civil sphere or a republic has the idea that there's a vital center.

701
00:55:54,700 --> 00:56:05,220
And if a populist movement moves too far to the right or the left, it says, I don't care.

702
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,220
Nope.

703
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,660
I think we have.

704
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:08,660
We will.

705
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,660
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,660
Yeah.

707
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:14,580
Who else wants to jump in?

708
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,460
I mean, I want to endorse that point.

709
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:21,420
I think the kind of stability of movement depends on coalition building in important

710
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:28,660
ways, and this is one of the puzzles is that yes, you set yourself up against the elite

711
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:34,300
and you might complain about the domination of certain kinds of institutions by the elite.

712
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,300
But do you want to get rid of the institutions themselves or do you want to innovate them

713
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,820
so fully that they can't function?

714
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,900
That's the point of which I think this starts to become sort of consumptive of the civil

715
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,700
sphere, the republican spheres.

716
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,340
I think Jeff was saying.

717
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,660
Jeff, I think you're freed up.

718
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,500
You want to finish your thought?

719
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,260
I'm not sure where I was cut off.

720
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,060
It's hard to finish it when I didn't know where I was.

721
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:01,300
I was saying that, I mean, if a movement on the right or the left moves away and says

722
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:07,420
I give up on the Bible center, I'm going to establish a power simply on behalf of my

723
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:08,740
own movement.

724
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:15,260
So in that sense, black power in terms of black panther, that was a populism.

725
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:20,020
They spoke to the people all the time by the way.

726
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:25,900
And Trump, as to the good point that Harry Mann, I mean, Trump spoke on behalf of the

727
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:31,380
people all the time, but we know it was on behalf of only white people.

728
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:36,820
His people, especially white people, and he left out.

729
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:41,580
So this tension is always there, of course.

730
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:49,220
Let me go back to social movements, if I may.

731
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:56,060
When I went to school, we called them movements and the whole field was called consensus politics.

732
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:06,660
So there was, by the eighties, nineies, et cetera, the whole gamut emerged around the

733
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,740
time and they were asking power, essentially.

734
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,580
And the most important of those movements was the Green movement, of course.

735
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:18,420
They created lots of parties in Europe, some of the parties formed coalition governments,

736
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:23,100
some of those are in power even today in a number of countries.

737
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,980
Now, those movements are the gist and the essence of liberal democracy.

738
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,740
We need those those movements because they do not go against the constitution.

739
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,740
They want to change how politics works.

740
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,540
They bring in new issues.

741
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,660
Why do we call them populist?

742
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,340
The world populist did not exist back then.

743
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:47,860
I mean, we knew that Peron was populist, but no one understood what the terror meant.

744
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,660
So those movements are always there.

745
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,900
A very sensual part of democracy.

746
00:58:52,900 --> 00:59:00,580
They did not popularly speak for particular electrics, constituencies.

747
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,020
And that's not.

748
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,020
What about the sort of...

749
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,020
What about the...

750
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,020
Making some claims.

751
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,020
Let me...

752
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,020
Yep.

753
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:14,460
I was going to say, what about laying some claim to a particular kind of virtue?

754
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:20,060
Some particular sort of virtue based on their who they are as a people.

755
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:24,500
That is a component of this.

756
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,740
These movements.

757
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:29,300
They are not there as people.

758
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,660
They are there as carriers of particular interests.

759
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,900
They want all goals.

760
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:35,900
Political goals.

761
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:45,180
They want a better climate, a green development, feminist movement, for example.

762
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:50,060
I mean, they want to pursue the interests and the rights of the feminist movement, for

763
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,540
example.

764
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:56,100
And then let me ask something, the whole panel, because this is a very interesting question.

765
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:03,020
I mean, this is one of the elephants, a number of elephants, when it comes to populism.

766
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,420
What do we mean when we say the people?

767
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:11,380
I mean, do we mean the nation, like, you know, make America great again?

768
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,380
Do we mean the underprivileged?

769
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,380
Straight up?

770
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,380
All over the place?

771
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,780
The poorer people, the ordinary people?

772
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:26,820
Do we mean the working class, in which case where the Marxist domain, for example?

773
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,020
Do we mean race?

774
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,700
Like in Bolivia?

775
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,700
Do we mean...

776
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,300
Stay in English?

777
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,300
Like in India?

778
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,020
For example, who are the people in India?

779
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,500
Define the people?

780
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,900
Well, according to Modi, it's Hindus.

781
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,500
But there is an open question.

782
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Right?

783
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,220
I mean, it's pretty straightforward in some case, what the relevant form of populism

784
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,220
is trading on.

785
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:53,220
I mean, changing the laws on citizenship is a pretty clear move to define the people.

786
01:00:53,220 --> 01:01:00,540
If you want to look at a concrete political action, you know, the 2009-19 Citizenship Act,

787
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:05,940
you know, to make it impossible for large numbers of Muslims living in India to remain

788
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:12,100
or become citizens, you know, that kind of religious test is a pretty clear, you know,

789
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,060
attempt to define the boundaries.

790
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:15,700
So what do you say in the United States?

791
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:21,020
The people that don't exist, the people that don't exist, the people that don't exist,

792
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,700
the people that are made, yep, it is a construction.

793
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,700
Right?

794
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:28,740
I mean, Buddha talked about that, I mean, the making of the class.

795
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:34,180
So you have a populist leader who makes his own people, and then he has his own clients

796
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:37,820
for going to vote for him, and he's going to stay there in power forever.

797
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,980
And that's that.

798
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:39,980
Enjoy.

799
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:44,700
It's a function of language to a degree, to label some group.

800
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:49,700
And it's interesting now, and I wanted to open up the conversation to incorporate information,

801
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:50,700
the flow of information.

802
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,940
We talked about, you know, the free press and how that's important.

803
01:01:54,940 --> 01:02:03,020
And it's attacked by populist leaders, demagogues anyway, is often a part of their game plan.

804
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:10,060
You know, labeling any group with any label, elite people, you know, is a language game

805
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,060
in a way, right?

806
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:18,780
But I wonder how much you all think information, how it flows and who controls it has an effect

807
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,780
on populism.

808
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:28,980
I mean, I think this is one of the differences in modern populist movements is now the attempt

809
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,300
to bypass traditional media and use social media.

810
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:36,260
You know, that's one way of kind of doing an end run.

811
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:41,580
I think that's been proven to be pretty successful worldwide in various cases.

812
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:49,020
I mean, I'll move this to pandemic on filtering the reality for the people in the movement

813
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:53,900
so that it recapitulates the tenets of the movement.

814
01:02:53,900 --> 01:03:00,980
But every social movement for the last 200 years has always had its own misfampers, its

815
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:09,180
own, you know, you didn't need social media to have Hitler, right?

816
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:18,540
And yet grasping a new form of communication has been effective for populist movements

817
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:25,660
and not just in our lifetimes in an early Republican society where communication was

818
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,460
based on drawing room conversation.

819
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:37,260
It suddenly introduced mass circulation newspapers and political rallies with hundreds of people.

820
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:43,940
That's a new form of political communication and it can be very effective.

821
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:50,780
Even populist are very innovative in their political techniques and seizing new forms

822
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:57,700
of political communication can be, you know, part of the winning strategy.

823
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:06,100
Well, but Obama was a campaigner and President introduced the digital revolution first.

824
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:11,260
Yeah, and you can see how, you know, you can have these features of populism without maybe

825
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:12,740
being a full-throated populist.

826
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:16,780
And of course populist leaders are very good at learning, you know, these kinds of techniques

827
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,060
and adapting them and it takes time.

828
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:23,980
And I think, you know, the common thread is a kind of attempted direct communication

829
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:27,660
unmediated by the kinds of traditional institutional actors.

830
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:32,220
So instead of, you know, primary politics in America have changed dramatically in the

831
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,580
last 25 years.

832
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:39,540
It used to be that, you know, it was a very, is a hyper-local sort of phenomenon and you

833
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:44,180
had to have the kind of grassroots organizing which meant that you had to get hold of people.

834
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:47,660
But going back to Howard Dean up to the present, you know, the internet has really changed

835
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:48,660
that.

836
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,100
The flow of money has changed.

837
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,100
The flow of information has changed.

838
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:55,620
There's been a kind of nationalization of party primaries and that's really changed the

839
01:04:55,620 --> 01:05:00,580
influence of political parties and their ability to keep certain kinds of radical people out

840
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,860
of, you know, presidential primaries in the US.

841
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:04,540
And I think that's a fascinating change.

842
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:08,380
And lots of people are learning that lesson all across the political spectrum, sort of

843
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:09,380
all at once.

844
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:16,620
I would put that in a broader perspective because it is not only the type of the medium, the

845
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:24,380
type of the, how do they try to reach larger audiences and what do they do, the technique.

846
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:30,780
It is that obviously this, when they come into power, they try to silence the practice

847
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:34,100
that opposes the rule.

848
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:40,980
So I would put that in the broader framework of institutions because what we see, we put

849
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:47,820
the playbook there, the populist playbook, is that when they take power, they attack

850
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:52,300
the institutions, all of them, press is one of them, freedom of the press.

851
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,300
They attack the judiciary.

852
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,780
They go against the courts.

853
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:56,780
We saw that in America.

854
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:00,900
We saw that in all other cases, populist rule.

855
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:05,540
They try to violate the division of powers.

856
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:08,740
They try to control education.

857
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:14,580
So they meditate against institutions of liberal democracy, hence my definition of democratic

858
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:15,580
liberalism.

859
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:16,580
Okay.

860
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:17,580
And this is very typical.

861
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:23,260
I mean, there is not any case of populist rule that I happen to know that you do not

862
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,700
see the same moves over and over again.

863
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,700
It's like a playbook.

864
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:31,460
I think the exact same thing.

865
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:38,860
I think the fact that we know there are actors, China, Russia in particular, who have made

866
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:47,860
an effort to redirect the conversation on or the ideas flowing through social media,

867
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:52,220
that that's an important aspect of what we're seeing in modern modern times.

868
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:56,980
These are not the most important questions though.

869
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,620
I think we can sign them.

870
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,620
China, no questions.

871
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:02,980
Yeah, are the democracies.

872
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:03,980
Say that again.

873
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:08,260
I'm sorry.

874
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,260
Repeat that.

875
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:10,260
Talk to us.

876
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,260
You repeat that.

877
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,260
Okay.

878
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:16,260
For some reason, I think he's sorry.

879
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:18,460
Yeah, I didn't say anything.

880
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,460
Okay.

881
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,460
All right.

882
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:26,420
So the ideas we will open up some of the questions that have come from the audience.

883
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:31,460
And Alex is here to help guide us through that.

884
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,460
Yeah.

885
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:35,380
So if anyone wants to write more, because only I only have one question so far, I guess

886
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,780
too, from Susanna Black through the Zoom.

887
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:42,700
So if anyone has any questions, please write it in the Q&A part or on the chat and I'll

888
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,700
relay it.

889
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,180
But yeah.

890
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:50,580
So Susanna Black wrote something, I guess, based on what sort of Jeffrey had asked, which

891
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:55,500
was, are contemporary race and sex-focused progressive movements populist or anti-pop

892
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,500
list?

893
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:01,860
Can you speak to distinction between class-based left populism of the 2016 Bernie type and

894
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:06,940
contemporary progressive politics, which tend to center issues other than in class and

895
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:12,700
may tend in certain cases to reinforce existing institutional power, i.e. the phenomenon of

896
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:18,140
will capitalism, and then they wrote, alternatively, how can we do a better job in creating a

897
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:25,500
common good politics that speaks to and includes all people in a polity as opposed to ontologizing

898
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:29,940
the division or antagonism between the people and the elites?

899
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,940
Is that possible or desirable?

900
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:36,380
I mean, one thing that I was saying earlier, I think, in response to that, which is that

901
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:41,900
there's different kinds of different forms of pluralist politics.

902
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:47,580
And one of them is sort of concerned with, say, the rectification of historical or present

903
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:57,340
injustices and attempts to point to places where people cannot meet on an even footing

904
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:02,780
in the public sphere as is desired by the principles of Republican politics.

905
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:09,100
And I think we don't have a lot of talk about our Republican form of government anymore.

906
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:13,420
We spend very little time, you know, there's attention as paid to the eroding of our institutions

907
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:20,780
or to certain kind of issues about dark money in our politics and so on.

908
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:24,820
We don't talk very much about things like, well, citizens need certain kinds of virtues

909
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:28,100
for our system of government to survive, the very things that you can see littered all

910
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,900
over the federalist papers, as I mentioned at the beginning.

911
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:35,820
And I think one result of that is that we get a kind of empty pluralist politics, which

912
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:42,300
says not taking into account whether people are subject to any form of injustice or meeting

913
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:48,660
each other and even playing field, that certain kinds of identities are more important than

914
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:55,300
one's identity as a citizen and need to be sort of celebrated or valued in certain ways.

915
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:59,260
And to some extent, this is a kind of, this is fine because it might be pushing back against

916
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:04,180
a homogenizing impulse that's also inappropriate to a large plural society.

917
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:08,260
But unless it's framed with a certain set of aspirations about what we want to do together

918
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:16,860
in civil society, my fear is that it tends to be more, you know, to contribute to certain

919
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:25,500
kinds of fracturing that make it impossible to have broad coalition-based politics of

920
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:32,380
a kind that, you know, is in defense of our common life.

921
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:37,140
So that's sort of my concern about what I call pluralism without aspiration or empty

922
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:43,620
pluralism that I think maybe certain strands of progressive politics point in this direction,

923
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,180
not all of them.

924
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:49,660
And I think it's very easy to sort of paint different political movements and dismiss

925
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:51,900
them.

926
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:55,580
And I don't mean to be doing that, but that's a sort of reservation that I have.

927
01:10:55,580 --> 01:11:04,420
I really like to endorse that, Jay, because you mentioned the Federalist Papers and the

928
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:11,980
invocation of virtue over and over again in the Federalist Papers, going past that word

929
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:20,740
virtue to think about what people in that era meant by the word virtue.

930
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:26,500
When you were talking about public life, they meant virtue to them was the ability to set

931
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:32,140
aside narrow personal self-interest and to advocate for the common good, however that

932
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:35,060
might be defined.

933
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:40,820
And the pitfall there was that every pluralistic group tended to define the common good as

934
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:47,260
their good, and it sort of collapsed into brokerage liberalism.

935
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:56,740
But if there were a way for us to recapture a vision of the common good or to advocate

936
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:06,900
for a vision of the common good that would embrace more than relatively small, certainly

937
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:15,060
minority-sized slices of the population, then I think we'd be taking a step in the right

938
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:16,060
direction.

939
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:22,300
One of the problems is that the word virtue was so hokey these days that anybody who stands

940
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,900
up and tries to advocate for it kind of gets wet.

941
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:29,140
I guess we're supposed to say good character now or something like that.

942
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:31,140
There's something like that.

943
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:35,060
I mean, I disagree with both of you guys.

944
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:42,420
I think that virtues are completely at the heart of all most of our public discourse

945
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:50,780
today, and that the idea that we need to go back to an earlier smaller form of republicanism

946
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:58,620
based on the Greeks or the founding fathers, it's not right because virtues still are here.

947
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:04,780
For example, when people say Trump was selfish and he only cared about himself, and then his

948
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:09,700
opponents argued we need somebody who cares about the whole society.

949
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:17,900
Just as virtue talk, when somebody says people are dishonest, when they say they're corrupt,

950
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:25,980
when they say that they're irrational or insane, that they don't have common sense, this concern

951
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:34,500
with virtue permeates left, right, and center in all these democracies.

952
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:43,340
I don't think that the way to get a good society is to say that we need a new set of virtues.

953
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:51,380
I think that in fact there's an ideal of a good society in back of left, right, and center

954
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:57,820
except for the extremes, and that that ideal is going to be incorporated in a partisan way

955
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:59,460
through ideology.

956
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:04,340
You will never have us all sharing this whole thing, but we'll have us talking about it

957
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,340
all the time.

958
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:10,820
I want to push back on that because I think a lot of the, if you look at the polling,

959
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:16,940
people thought that Trump was not a very honest or a public minded person when they voted

960
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:19,700
for him, and that's the scandal, right?

961
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:23,140
The thought is, and it doesn't have to be Trump in particular, you can apply it to whoever

962
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:29,340
else you like, the idea is that virtue should be a criterion for high office, and it should

963
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:33,940
also be what we try to promote in society rather than factional interest rather than

964
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:36,380
monetary benefit.

965
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:40,100
This is true of technocratic liberals on the left as well as the right that they want

966
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:44,380
to measure the flourishing of the society based on how much money is in your pocketbook

967
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:48,460
or how good you feel about things rather than character.

968
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:53,740
I think that is the part of the Republican ideal that is lacking.

969
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:58,060
Not leaving—all of our moral talk is virtue talk, of course.

970
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,060
I agree with that.

971
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,060
Yes.

972
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:06,780
And Trump, you're taking a poll that says, polls are impossible to use as ways of judging

973
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:14,620
how people think of leaders, but I'm sure that people thought that Trump, his supporters,

974
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:18,700
that he has the virtue of telling the truth.

975
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,700
And truthfulness is a virtue.

976
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:23,260
It's an important virtue.

977
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:31,380
But isn't virtue or pretend virtue what essentially ends up creating the groups?

978
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:38,060
Yeah, I mean, but the thing is we can't try to find what's the true virtue.

979
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:47,180
I mean, not if we stand back and look at the discourse of a complex pluralistic society.

980
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:51,100
Every group will claim that it has the right virtue.

981
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:54,540
Right, but that's what creates the group.

982
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:56,620
Yeah, I agree totally.

983
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:57,620
It is.

984
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:05,660
But I think that's also what creates the aggression between the groups because I think

985
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:12,140
my virtue is better than your virtue and therefore you are wrong and so I can attack you.

986
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:14,100
Yes.

987
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:18,980
But if you want to see what is an operational definition of a better society, to me as a

988
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:28,860
more incorporated one that allows more people the use of their full life forces.

989
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:36,260
And I think that that's really what Trump, the right populace, are a reaction against

990
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:40,900
the expansion of the civil sphere in the United States.

991
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:46,500
And so Susan, I wouldn't be so depressed about this.

992
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:52,340
I don't, I think that these movements are reactions against progress that we may be in

993
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:58,420
store for another few years of a progressive movement.

994
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,780
Not a populist one.

995
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:06,300
May I take a different approach perhaps?

996
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,820
I like this discussion about virtue.

997
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:10,100
Of course, we need that.

998
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,300
We need tons of that.

999
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:18,260
But thinking about our lives and about the future and about what we're going to do in

1000
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:24,060
future, let's see what are the problems first of all.

1001
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:31,380
I mean, what are the problems we face as humanity, public health, pandemic, next epidemic, the

1002
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:36,180
other one, the third one, that's it.

1003
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:53,660
I mean, my graduation and multiculturalist, fourth, I think, I mean, what do we do?

1004
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:57,980
I mean, with an ethos who happened to live in the same neighborhood.

1005
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:01,060
And finally, the survival of democracy.

1006
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:04,260
It is not evident that our democracies will survive forever.

1007
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:07,180
Now, my question is this.

1008
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:09,540
I will make two points actually.

1009
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:15,500
First, I think that in all of those things, technocracy, technology is very crucial in

1010
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,100
all of those things.

1011
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:23,940
And I think that populists are very much inimical to the technology and the technocracy.

1012
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:27,340
It is the elite after all, okay?

1013
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:31,460
We don't like the elites because we're populists, but it so happens.

1014
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:39,780
But among the elites, most of the technocrats from bigade to the universities where all

1015
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:46,460
of you teach in the United States, you are very fond of technocracy and technology and

1016
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,220
populists don't like that.

1017
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:51,780
So we have to do something about it.

1018
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,060
So populists do not play a positive role.

1019
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:59,940
And my second point is that populists do not solve any of those big problems.

1020
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:04,540
Apparently, accept or theoretically accept inequality.

1021
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,700
But do they have the means?

1022
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,460
Do they have the policies?

1023
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:11,900
Do they have the agenda to solve socio-economic inequality?

1024
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:12,900
No.

1025
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:18,900
So I will leave it here by saying that liberal democracy is the only and better solution

1026
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:25,060
that we have and we have to improve the institutions of our liberal democracies.

1027
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,100
And this is the stance I will take in this discussion.

1028
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:36,220
Maybe the panelists could respond to the Fishline question that's on the Q&A.

1029
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:37,220
Yeah, yeah.

1030
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:38,300
I'll read it out for you.

1031
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:42,660
So the first one, Scott wrote, thank you, Scott, for writing these questions.

1032
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:48,220
The first one he wrote was, what do the panelists think about the idea of popular and communitarian

1033
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:53,860
thought and again after Trump that the rise of right-wing populists movements in the

1034
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:59,740
United States is a result of a hollowing out of America's civil society and engagement

1035
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:05,340
in local politics is a big part of left and right-wing populism, some sort of illusion

1036
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:11,300
of national engagement in politics that replaces the vital role of engagement in community life

1037
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,580
in societies.

1038
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:18,060
We'll talk about a second question.

1039
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:23,380
And then the second one, excuse me, it seems that all right-wing populism is immediately

1040
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:29,180
labeled fascism by the left media and all left-wing populism is immediately labeled socialism

1041
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:30,900
by the right-wing media.

1042
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:35,500
And that ultimately this prevents any real engagement for the country with the very real

1043
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:40,700
problems that generate these movements and give demagogues like Trump a platform.

1044
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:45,900
How can we engage with people's outrage in a more constructive way than populism or labeling

1045
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:52,060
people's grievances as politically radical and therefore invalid?

1046
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:56,340
And I think I'll just say briefly, I really like that second point.

1047
01:20:56,340 --> 01:21:04,020
It's very, it's really fascinating and important which is that populism tends to be a label

1048
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:15,460
of denigration often used to undermine the valid dimension of massive social movements.

1049
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:22,820
We are right to be very worried about the anti-democratic dimensions as Tarkis has talked

1050
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:23,820
about throughout.

1051
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:34,380
At the same time, I think we want to respond to Trumpism by saying it reveals as Don and

1052
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:42,180
Jay's talk about the underlying displacement of masses of Americans economically.

1053
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:50,780
So I think that's a good point that populism is a label that is right to use in a sense

1054
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:57,700
to pollute the anti-democratic and demagogu-d aspect but yet usually populism responds to

1055
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:02,100
deep fractures that need to be repaired in a society.

1056
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:09,660
I mean, I think one thing we can think about is sort of what is government for and what

1057
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:15,140
are the limits of what government can achieve and what are political movements for.

1058
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:20,380
And when I think about economic issues or issues of distributive justice or even issues

1059
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:27,060
of access to certain kinds of institutions, those seem like places where government can

1060
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:29,940
do something and ought to do something.

1061
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:35,100
But if the grievances are related to there are too many brown people in my neighborhood,

1062
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,740
I don't think that's something that government should be in the business of doing quite the

1063
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,820
opposite.

1064
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:45,660
So politics of grievance can be politics of legitimate grievance or illegitimate grievance

1065
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:50,020
and we have to hold the line on we have a multicultural, plural society.

1066
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:54,380
I'm an immigrant, a legal immigrant and a naturalized citizen of this country and I've

1067
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:55,820
also immigrated to other countries.

1068
01:22:55,820 --> 01:23:03,060
I spent some years living in the UK and I think that's been central to the kind of American

1069
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:07,620
experiment in American national ideology and politicians of all strikes should agree with

1070
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,300
that.

1071
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:16,540
But we can also say that these kinds of grievance politics are exacerbated by certain kinds of

1072
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:25,020
economic phenomena and you don't have to respond directly to people's feelings but you can

1073
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:28,740
respond to what their feelings might be driven by if you think that's a legitimate side for

1074
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:36,500
government intervention in a problem of distributive justice or a problem of equality and rights.

1075
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:45,140
And again, not to sort of jump on the Republican hobby horse too much but solidarity is also

1076
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:47,340
a word that's kind of dropped out of our politics.

1077
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:55,180
The fraternity element of our Republican imagination and I think there ought to be a bigger space

1078
01:23:55,180 --> 01:24:02,020
for solidarity, not just solidarity among say the working class or anything like that but

1079
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:06,780
solidarity across class divisions, across racial divisions and this is really central

1080
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:10,220
and needs to be restored to our politics too.

1081
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:15,140
And so far as we think of populism as a bad thing, I think part of the appropriate response

1082
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:18,740
also has to be building a culture of solidarity.

1083
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:27,060
Well I would say that populism can be redeemed if you will, it is not always bad.

1084
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:36,380
If it embraces a coalition building ethos that says let's reach out to other aggrieved

1085
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:45,780
people who don't look exactly like us and let's build a movement, then populism can

1086
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,820
be a very good thing.

1087
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:56,700
I guess so far as to say that populism created liberal democracy from the 18th century forward.

1088
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:07,100
It's not automatically an opposite force that we have to choose either or instead we need

1089
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:15,100
desperately to have a populist element in liberal democracy and we needed to have a coalition

1090
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:19,820
building ethos to it.

1091
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:25,620
That's how you get things done in a majority based political system.

1092
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:30,380
And I mean what about going back to talk at this first point about illiberal democracy

1093
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:38,700
being a definition in that there are certain virtues associated with illiberalism, they're

1094
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:45,740
actually what they call with these folks who promote it, call their virtues and it's interesting

1095
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:50,260
to think well what are those and how might we neutralize them or engage them in a way

1096
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:54,540
that's more constructive.

1097
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:59,500
Can you be more specific about the virtues of illiberal democracy?

1098
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:02,940
Well let's see, one comes to mind.

1099
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:08,780
If the elites are overly educated in their egg heads they don't really know how the plain

1100
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:18,060
folk what they experience, what they do, there's this virtue which is we don't listen to experts.

1101
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:21,780
In fact listening to experts is considered a negative virtue.

1102
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:24,980
So that would be an example of what I mean.

1103
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:30,780
Also I think that there's such a thing as impartiality or that anyone might strive towards impartiality.

1104
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:36,500
I made this comment several times that Trump made a comment about their Republican judges

1105
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:41,980
and their Democratic judges and Justice Roberts said no no they're not and Trump said well

1106
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:45,100
of course they are you're being a chump and I know.

1107
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:48,340
He was going to speak the truth on that occasion of course.

1108
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:54,860
We have a lifetime appointment super legislature that runs large parts of our public life.

1109
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:55,860
Of course we do.

1110
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:57,940
Every single political scientist would tell you that.

1111
01:26:57,940 --> 01:27:02,900
But wait wait okay but yes if people want to write and if people left both seem to endorse

1112
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:11,140
that claim of Trump's which I would say is unfortunate in this sense that it's not prescriptive

1113
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:13,740
of the Democratic spirit.

1114
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:19,180
Because judges do think they're being impartial and we have ways of discerning people who

1115
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:24,540
tend to be impartial were deliberative in their judgments and people who are not and

1116
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:30,620
I think everyone can recognize that or usually can and it's an important virtue that I don't

1117
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:34,540
hear from it very much and not to use a clang term.

1118
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:41,540
But just on the point of intention of impartiality I mean one issue we haven't spoken about is

1119
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:45,620
nationalism versus cosmopolitanism.

1120
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:50,620
That's a different version of it but it's complementary to what you're saying and illiberal

1121
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:58,780
politics are usually highly nationalistic and explicitly anti-conson-polliton which they

1122
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:09,260
associate cosmopolitanism with intellectuals choose and other people like bankers etc.

1123
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:13,660
Just can I give a Jerry's point about expertise because I think this is really interesting.

1124
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:19,700
I mean I think listening to experts you framed it very carefully listening to experts is

1125
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:25,140
a good thing we might think because there are problems that arise in complex political

1126
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:28,660
societies that require expertise to address them.

1127
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:35,500
But rule by experts is bad anti-democratic and inappropriate.

1128
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:41,740
And there's a strain of anti-democracy on the technocratic left just as there is on

1129
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:49,820
the kind of hyper-nationalist or hyper-populist right which wants to exclude people from voter

1130
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:52,540
rolls and things like that.

1131
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:57,300
And one way of being anti-democratic is being technocratic, two technocratic and saying

1132
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:03,380
I think a great example of this is in the current pandemic we've had this kind of polarized

1133
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:08,980
response to public health guidance that either wants to say well public health experts are

1134
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:14,020
the right people to make these political decisions on our behalf and Anthony Fauci should decide

1135
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:19,900
whether we should shut down or not which fails to recognize that there are lots of goals,

1136
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:23,220
political goals that we have in a public health crisis that have to be balanced against each

1137
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:24,220
other.

1138
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:28,180
And I think this comes out most clearly in the conversation about school closures.

1139
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:32,260
Even after it's been, it seems like schools can be reopened pretty safely, it's become

1140
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:38,100
a kind of principle in certain corners of the left in our current political system to say

1141
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:42,660
no the schools have to stay shut which ignores the massive inequality that is drive as when

1142
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:47,620
you think about the radically higher effects of school closures on poorer and minority

1143
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:49,100
children.

1144
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:55,820
And so I think just realizing that there is no such thing as political expertise that

1145
01:29:55,820 --> 01:30:00,380
there is only political wisdom which is to say there is a sense of the different kinds

1146
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:04,940
of goals that we are trying to pursue on behalf of all of us.

1147
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:08,500
And we have an sort of imperfect people who are sufficiently different from each other

1148
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:13,260
who are going to deliberate and figure this out but they are not experts in anything.

1149
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:18,140
They should listen to experts and so far as expert knowledge is relevant and available.

1150
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:20,980
And of course saying you never listen to experts is just as foolish as saying always

1151
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:22,460
listen to experts.

1152
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:27,340
But I think there is a deeper truth that is not a nonpartisan truth about the nature of

1153
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:31,780
politics that we can get to here just by careful reflection on what it is that we are doing

1154
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:32,780
when we are deliberating together.

1155
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:41,100
I think one of the things that gives expertise a bad name is that experts claim their authority

1156
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:48,540
on universal characteristics they would say we know the scientific truth and that is good

1157
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:55,500
for everybody and we sort of insist that it go down.

1158
01:30:55,500 --> 01:31:02,620
When in fact they are advocating a set of policies that benefit a very narrow slice of

1159
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:04,380
the population.

1160
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:13,140
So when experts claim to be to have universal validity but actually are being very selfish

1161
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:20,860
then that is a perfect ticket for getting discredited on the populist level.

1162
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:28,580
So I think one of the reasons, one of the things that sets off populist movements is

1163
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:31,900
that the elites really have failed for people.

1164
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:43,340
And that means that if information based elites that is experts want to retain the

1165
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:50,260
respect of the public and they have to kind of keep doing a gut check about whether their

1166
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:58,860
advice is truly beneficial for people at large or only a fraction.

1167
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:07,580
Well last century in his public opinion Walter Lippmann had written about the use of stereotypes

1168
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:15,300
as a potent force in driving public opinion how much they repressed ideas as much as they

1169
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:22,500
put forward ideas which is an interestingly psychoanalytic way of looking at stereotypes.

1170
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:28,980
But I would say that the issue about let's say experts and expertise is that in this information

1171
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:35,620
marketplace some of these stereotypes end up acting as tokens and the sort of subtleties

1172
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:40,540
that you just both of you just expressed about expertise which is wonderful and should be

1173
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:47,380
out there ends up being repressed pushed away because of the effect of these stereotypes.

1174
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:54,500
Okay, how many questions are we feeling sorry just because there's one on YouTube and I

1175
01:32:54,500 --> 01:33:00,220
have one myself but I don't want to abuse my position as a Q&A moderator.

1176
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:04,540
So if that's cautious so there's one on YouTube and then I could give mine if that's okay

1177
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:07,460
with all of you otherwise I'll just do the one on YouTube.

1178
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:09,460
No no you can do that too.

1179
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:10,460
Okay, okay.

1180
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:11,460
You're both.

1181
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:15,660
Okay so the one on YouTube is from Robert Price thank you Robert.

1182
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:21,740
So Robert wrote what is the balance between identity versus issue or virtue with regard

1183
01:33:21,740 --> 01:33:23,980
to intensity of emotions?

1184
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:32,460
Are different orders of passion generated by identity and issues or virtues?

1185
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:36,940
I mean just I just like to say that a lot of can be popular.

1186
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:38,940
Let me let me try.

1187
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:42,900
Wait hold on Taka's we got a little delay here but Jeff why don't you go first then we'll

1188
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:45,220
take you talk to us.

1189
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:52,100
I think that's a good question because a lot of the fear of populism is the fear of emotions

1190
01:33:52,100 --> 01:34:03,460
in politics as endangering supposedly the virtue of deliberative rationality and I don't

1191
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:12,020
agree with that I think that sociologically mass movements are emotional and in that sense

1192
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:21,860
they all engage in stereotypes they engage in in passion and non rational behavior that

1193
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:27,620
gives them if you want to start from every the center yes it gives them a dimension of

1194
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:32,620
populism but it doesn't make an anti-democratic.

1195
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:34,820
Taka's?

1196
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:43,220
Well more or less what Jeffrey said but from a slightly different perspective I do not

1197
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:49,220
understand why mass movements are emotional I think they are rational to a very large

1198
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:53,740
extent but let us not argue about that.

1199
01:34:53,740 --> 01:35:00,220
I think that again going trying to answer both questions I was listening to you earlier

1200
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:05,260
guys I mean talking about perhaps populists might be a good thing and populists created

1201
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:12,020
liberallies meant you know to take to technocracy and I was thinking from my little place in

1202
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:18,380
Europe because I'm in Europe that if I remember well you had an election a few months ago

1203
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:24,860
in the United States and the whole society became very much polarized about those issues

1204
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:29,820
we are all of the motions we are all of technology what do we do with you know COVID-19 how do

1205
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:38,140
we face that and you know rationality technocracy etc etc so that did you forget about that

1206
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:43,940
so populist was not a good thing and this is why the American people voted for you know

1207
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:49,100
a different administration and non populist one because that was the issue I mean a liberallies

1208
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:51,100
versus liberallies.

1209
01:35:51,100 --> 01:36:00,580
So the interesting thing here is that emotions versus rationality are populists it's always

1210
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:09,580
about words about ethos about emotions about resentment resentment vindictiveness those

1211
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:18,340
are crucial feelings behind the rise of populist movements on the other hand you have rationality

1212
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:25,700
problem solving making positive some games not zero some games how to build positive some

1213
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:33,500
games this is not the game of populist this is the game of liberallies okay so that is

1214
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:39,460
the the thing that has a balance that has to be achieved in our societies I mean how much

1215
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:46,580
emotion how much rationality what do we want how do we what do we prefer what do we choose

1216
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:53,100
when you know the chips go down like now with COVID for example so that is you're describing

1217
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:56,940
this is an enormous process for us to understand what they are.

1218
01:36:56,940 --> 01:37:02,180
Well it seems to me I don't know they go to get us forward sample of the importance of

1219
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:11,220
a long term perspective because populism was part of the collapse of the Soviet Union populism

1220
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:17,460
a represent was throughout the Arab Spring that didn't work out as well as it should have

1221
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:23,900
but populism is part of the legacy of the American and French revolutions and that ultimately

1222
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:35,140
strengthens liberal democracy populism can be an enormously liberating thing in the proper

1223
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:47,220
context and so that's why I'd like to keep a window open to the the positive aspects of

1224
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:56,780
populism because in the law in historical long run there it has been very important to my

1225
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:57,780
way thank you anyway.

1226
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:04,820
That is fully legitimate Harry I understand that of course but I don't forget that there

1227
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:10,300
was a populist president in your country a few months ago.

1228
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:18,540
Yes I think that's a perfect example I think the remarks you've made and the remarks I've

1229
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:28,140
made are good examples of the way that populism has in effect a two-faced character it can

1230
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:36,700
be beneficial and it can be very harmful and you know like like so many other things it

1231
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:42,380
needs to be deployed properly.

1232
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:45,260
Alex you want to go back fire away with your question?

1233
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:50,300
Yeah so I kind of want to put the mirrors on to the populist leaders so what do you think

1234
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:55,340
about this statement the populism that we see you especially amongst Trump and the other

1235
01:38:55,340 --> 01:39:00,860
leaders you mentioned is a reflection of the road in competence and sadism and incompetence

1236
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:05,780
being even emotional and confidence and so I've heard references to Venezuela and then

1237
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:11,500
some of Modi's failed policies in India like with the land reform and I think the demonetization

1238
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:15,620
that was a complete catastrophe but I also thought of a funnier example I think it's

1239
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:22,820
also rather telling is the MVP so the member of European Parliament from Hungary I can't

1240
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:26,460
I don't want to pronounce his name because I'm not going to get it right but he wrote

1241
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:33,500
the Constitution of Hungary that Hungary currently has on his iPad he made gay marriage illegal

1242
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:40,420
and he was found in Belgium at a orgy amongst like 20 other men during the lockdown with

1243
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:45,380
ecstasy on him and so he's like oh that's not mine but boy it's like you know that's

1244
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:49,620
I the other reason I came up with this besides that funny story is that in Hayek Friedrich

1245
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:55,220
Hayek's wrote the serfdom when he looks back on the collectivism amongst Naziism Italian

1246
01:39:55,220 --> 01:40:01,860
fascism and US sarcommism that you have these characters who really exact really brutal

1247
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:05,500
like this brutalism amongst the people and you really sort of wonder what would these

1248
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:09,980
people be doing if they didn't live in these societies in this way like would they have

1249
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:14,660
this political power and then lastly to bring it more modern if you look at the distinction

1250
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:21,140
in immigration policy between Trump and Obama they did similar things Obama deported I think

1251
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:25,340
more people than Trump did and a lot of the pictures of kids and cages were also during

1252
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:30,420
Obama I think Obama was better in general I'm not I'm just saying like what I guess yeah

1253
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:35,020
so what line do we draw between like this incompetence and sadism seen amongst these

1254
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:39,860
populist leaders versus I guess what we see with leaders that we're seeing are normal

1255
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:46,740
or you know fit the mold that are not populist I mean I think there's definitely a dimension

1256
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:51,580
to which some of these differences are about language about the kind of form of political

1257
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:58,460
communication and I'm always very interested in what the actual material impact of people's

1258
01:40:58,460 --> 01:41:03,980
policies are rather than in the way they talk but you have to admit that you know the

1259
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:09,940
way that politicians and leaders talk does have an effect on the limits of acceptable

1260
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:17,380
discourse on the demonization of minorities in particular I mean I think I think especially

1261
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:24,900
if you look at the corruption that has come hand in hand with with populist leaders all

1262
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:29,820
over the map you know the kind of patronage politics or cronyism that you know those are

1263
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:34,020
those are very material impacts that you can see like our contracts going to the friends

1264
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:41,100
of this charismatic leader or not so that those kinds of very concrete authoritarian tendencies

1265
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:48,460
I think are important to keep in mind in competence that's interesting I mean the tendency is

1266
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:53,980
for populist leaders to come in from the outside but not always right Modi is a good example

1267
01:41:53,980 --> 01:42:01,700
he was sort of normal part of BJP politics for a very long time before he came to power

1268
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:06,660
and it was only because he was stained from from the 2002 scandal in Gujarat the sectarian

1269
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:12,060
violence there that he he had to wait his time before he could he could successfully

1270
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:17,980
run for higher office and he did you know he was kind of forgiven by the elite in various

1271
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:25,780
ways for his role in that and you know I think some of some of his trade policies and

1272
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:29,900
international development policies and infrastructure policies have worked and some of them have

1273
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:35,500
been disastrous but you know the I think the lasting legacy is not going to be sort of

1274
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:41,100
the normal politics but rather the demonization of Muslims the reconstruction of India not

1275
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:45,220
as a secular but as a Hindu country and if you think about Trump and his effect we have

1276
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:51,300
a kind of nationalist strain a xenophobic strain in our politics that has not succeeded before

1277
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:56,300
post-World War II I mean other people have had this strain you know think about Pat Buchanan

1278
01:42:56,300 --> 01:43:00,900
and various other people who have been sort of openly nationalistic but you can just sort

1279
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:04,860
of say white nationalist things as a normal member of the Republican Party especially

1280
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:09,060
at the local level and that scene is acceptable and that's a change from the top so I think

1281
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:14,380
I think that's the kind of that's that's the worrisome legacy outlasting any of the

1282
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:18,780
incompetence or the competence of particular economic or tax policy or whatever else you

1283
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:19,780
got.

1284
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:20,780
Okay.

1285
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:26,940
Well, what do you mean by incompetence?

1286
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:28,740
Can I?

1287
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:35,860
Yeah well yeah because I yeah because even sort of saw this with because yeah just sorry

1288
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:39,820
just to clarify because you know with the with the people who stormed the Michigan State

1289
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:47,380
House and then even the people who stormed the Capitol building on June January 6th

1290
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:50,780
there was this idea that they were larping like their live action role playing and so

1291
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:55,180
this idea that they're enacting a fantasy and then in a way when people talk about even

1292
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:59,740
Trump and some of the policies he did a lot of the time you're like what you know what

1293
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:03,820
like why is he hiring these people who are obviously not good at their jobs like he's

1294
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:08,940
not good at his job to pick competent people so that's what I meant by I guess incompetence

1295
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:13,540
in that way and I guess even mentally or emotional incompetence would be with the with the you

1296
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:19,260
know talking about the guy from Hungary obviously having maybe being closeted and then enacting

1297
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:25,180
and then creating a constitution doesn't allow you know civil rights to gay and lesbian couples

1298
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:30,140
so I guess that's it's yeah it's not the most concise definition of incompetence but that's

1299
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:37,940
sort of what I just think words because I mean yeah I mean the Hungarian guy I mean this

1300
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:44,660
happened here in my neighborhood by the way three weeks ago four weeks ago he was you

1301
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:49,740
know he was a creep I mean he went to that boardy and he was caught and tried to escape

1302
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:55,340
the police he was taken to the police station etc etc I mean that's that's that's okay he

1303
01:44:55,340 --> 01:45:03,380
was a hypocrite anyways I mean he's one of the students of all-bound in Budapest but

1304
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:11,340
that's not the point the point is that police leaders when they come to power they have proven

1305
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:17,540
their competence okay they're strong charismatic leaders in most of the cases they create from

1306
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:24,580
scratch their own parties like Chavez like Orban himself by the way like the Ruscone or

1307
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:31,620
they take over parties created by others like your Trump for example right or Perron he

1308
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:37,140
created his own party Alberto Fichimor in Peru created his own party Rafael Correa in Ecuador

1309
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:47,860
so those are important strong people with great you know blunt ideas about the future and they

1310
01:45:47,860 --> 01:45:58,060
apply radical policies now they may be confident in implementing their policies I don't disagree

1311
01:45:58,060 --> 01:46:04,780
with that of course but they are very charismatic leaders in all the cases there's not any case

1312
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:12,660
of charismatic leaders if I know again in power that has not had previously a charismatic leader

1313
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:22,420
so it is that's a fact yeah all right well I think we should as much as I'd like to hear this go on

1314
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:27,820
this has been a wonderful conversation I would say it's incredible I think it's time to wrap up

1315
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:35,660
I want to again thank our our participants for such a lively conversation and our audience too for
