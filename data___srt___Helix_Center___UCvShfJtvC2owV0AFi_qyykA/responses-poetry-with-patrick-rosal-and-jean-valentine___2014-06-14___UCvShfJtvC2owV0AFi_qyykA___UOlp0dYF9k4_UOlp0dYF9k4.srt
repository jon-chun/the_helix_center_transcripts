1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
Patrick Rosal and Jean Valentine, we're going to read their poems and discuss each other's

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:13,360
poems and we hope to have a very nice informal conversational experience in which the poets

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,040
share their appreciations of each other's poetry.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,920
Patrick, we're lucky to have him as a member of our Poetry Committee here at Helix for

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,280
our poetry programming.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,160
He's the author of three full-length poetry collections, most recently Bone Shepherds,

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,520
named a notable book by the National Book Critics Circle and the Academy of American Poets.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,240
He's also won the Association of Asian American Studies Book Award, Global Filipino Literary

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,560
Award, and the Asian American Writers Workshop Members' Choice Award.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,760
His poems and essays have been published in Grantland, Tin House, Harvard Review, Language

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,880
for a New Century, Best American Poetry, and many others.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,120
He's a founding co-editor of some call it Ballin, a sports quarterly, and is a former

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,960
Fulbright Fellow.

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,720
He teaches on the faculty of Rutgers University, Camden's MFA program.

15
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,840
And Jean Valentine, I think, is the author of a dozen books of poetry, the first being

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,640
Dream Barker, which won the Young Young Poets Prize, up through her door on the mountain

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,280
new and collected poems, which won the National Book Award for Poetry.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,840
And I think Break the Glass is the most recent book.

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,480
She's a recipient of the 2009 Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets.

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,200
She's taught at Sarah Lawrence, NYU, and Columbia.

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,960
So the format for this afternoon will be that Patrick's going to read some poems, and Jean's

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
going to have a conversation with him about them.

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,040
And then I think Jean is going to read her Lucy sequence, and Patrick is going to talk

24
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,480
with her about his appreciation of that series of poems.

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,640
Patrick will read a couple more poems.

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,960
Jean will respond, and then I think Jean may finish with a couple of new poems.

27
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,760
Is that still your plan?

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
Super.

29
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,800
And then we'll have time for the audience to comment.

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
So we begin.

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Thank you very much.

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,280
Thank you everybody for being here, too.

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,160
I'm fighting what I hope is the tail end of a cold.

34
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:40,400
I'm used to very energetic readings, but I'll muster whatever I can for today.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,360
A lot of the things that I've been interested in lately have been, I've always been interested

36
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,760
in my family history, but more and more I've been trying to place that in terms of a global

37
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,600
history.

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,040
My parents are from the Philippines.

39
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,120
This poem is called, The Lendre Undone.

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,320
And so we've all been told to shut up.

41
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,240
Don't talk, they say, too fast, too loud, or for too long.

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,840
Don't take too much time trying to tell the truth.

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,880
But this is my work, to break out among strangers into laughter.

44
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,960
How I've watched small children, for example, fill with the lucky gust a poem can ride into

45
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,440
the mere stillness of a room and dance.

46
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:42,460
For that, I am always, as now, grateful.

47
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:48,600
My father tells me in his seminary days, during the Japanese occupation, most of the priests

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,520
who ran that school were German.

49
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,560
The boys then were to speak only in Latin and would surely be slapped three Sundays

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,600
back if heard speaking in the language of my father's country, which is a beautiful

51
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,120
country and a beautiful language.

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:14,840
And which has a curious word for being so suddenly seized by affection, you clench every muscle

53
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,680
from your eyelids to your toes, for wanting to hold a loved one tight, squeeze one, and

54
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,840
kiss one so deep you place yourself and your beloved on the brink of physical harm.

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,360
There's no word for this in English.

56
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,200
No word for those small provinces of silence or for the kind of love that will trouble

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,480
that silence into music.

58
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:50,760
My work is trying to find the very word rippling in my body, which is a woman's body, my mother's,

59
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:57,160
and a man's body, my father's, and nowhere to be found in the languages that have conquered

60
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,720
the land of my ancestors.

61
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,360
In the outskirts of every empire, there are man-made lakes large enough to receive with

62
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,880
ease, 100 villages worth of bones tossed into them.

63
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,960
This is a fact.

64
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,920
There are more than 7 million illocanos in the Philippines, maybe a million in diaspora.

65
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,840
All of us at one time or another have been told to shut up.

66
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,880
Don't talk too loud, too slow, or for too long.

67
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,720
In Saudi Arabia, in Madrid, in Tokyo, in Milan, on Bowery, near the foot of First Street.

68
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,360
You've been told this.

69
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Some of us have been famous liars, Ferdinand, for example, who married another liar, Ymelda,

70
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,880
and my grandfather, Capitano de Barrio, who clinged to kick the shit bare-fisted and

71
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,640
single-handedly out of 14 ruffians in the small barangay of Santatomas.

72
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,000
Actually, he kicked the shit out of five.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,720
Nine ran away.

74
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,600
These are not lies.

75
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
This is the truth.

76
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,520
I'm not wealthy.

77
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,920
I can't buy space or time on billboards or websites.

78
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,400
The name I inherit doesn't part columns in the city's daily journal.

79
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,840
My family comes from a long line of farmers.

80
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,800
My cousins scrubbed their chopping blocks with salt.

81
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,480
They shushed the goats before they killed them.

82
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:29,640
So Santatomas is essentially a barrio.

83
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:35,160
And the barangay that my mom comes from is Santatomas.

84
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,840
I was born and raised in New Jersey.

85
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,360
I went to the Philippines for the first time when I was 14.

86
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,560
But I didn't go back for almost 25 years.

87
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,600
So this is a welcoming poem about how I got welcomed to the Philippines after 25 years.

88
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:08,000
In the middle of my uncle's yard, a goat bounded the hooves wags its tongue.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,520
I've traveled 10,000 miles to be welcomed home by a town that knows me only by my middle

90
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,760
name and photos sent by post more than 25 years ago.

91
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,800
And there is an old man from the foothills of the barrio's far edge who has heard my

92
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,400
uncle Charlie drag this small beast to the block.

93
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,760
Heard the news by music, the bottles, the banging, the laughter inside the slaughter.

94
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:40,040
The old man limps the half mile by foot up the long dirt road, unshod, a ratty tank top,

95
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:46,640
a brand new Vegas cap, a cut black strip of inner tube draped around his neck.

96
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:55,680
And in front of him, he's rolling the whole way, a common jug on its side, emptied of

97
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,360
its vinegar, dusty, immense, to his hip in height and three times the old man's girth.

98
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,080
My uncle is strumming the guts out of his ukulele when the old man arrives and sets the

99
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,880
huge jug upright, pulls the bike tube off his nape and stretches it across the jar's massive

100
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:21,440
ceramic yawn, holding the rubber strip in place with one big muddy toe and on the downbeat

101
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,560
of the first measure of the second chorus, he joins my uncle in the kind of mooing these

102
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,120
beloved geysers swear has several times tricked a field of blossoms into blue.

103
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,520
The old man plucking from the makeshift base, not so much a moan, but a pulse that ranges

104
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:47,480
a full octave into each man's chest, the sinews of the old timer's arm straining, the

105
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,360
long muscle of his back top, his quadricep, his calves, his black foot pumping blood into

106
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:02,280
his whole awful body, his maw flashing every one of his seven good teeth to have him.

107
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:14,400
And if a man become part of a giant, the song of a giant, each one of us laughing like a

108
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:21,480
giant, if each one of us fulfill the exact measure of a man, and if the goat at the same

109
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:28,080
time is singing as it's dying among men who are singing and dying, the youngest cousin

110
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,680
among us butcher slaughtering elbow deep in the animals belly does not sing.

111
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:44,560
The carcass bloodlet now also silent as if it's stillness were a source of music too,

112
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:52,680
the way in death one becomes all the sounds one cannot make, the sum total of everything

113
00:09:52,680 --> 00:10:01,480
the living cannot say, sometimes we have to sing just to figure out what we cannot say.

114
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Sure.

115
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Let us know how she feels about your problems.

116
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,480
I love your problems.

117
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Thanks, Jean.

118
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,520
And it's great to sit here beside you and hear them.

119
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,320
Usually I'm over there hearing them and it's so nice to be near you.

120
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:34,040
And I was thinking reading them the weeks coming up to now when we would be here.

121
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:43,760
But I can't really, having her to read, I can't read these without hearing your voice.

122
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,160
And it's so, it's such a gift.

123
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:55,560
Even if I don't have it really in you being in the room, but the voice is so, as you can

124
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:04,480
hear, the voice is so present in everything that writes and it's so important.

125
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:12,120
And one thing I want to ask you is, I've probably been asked this before, but when you're writing,

126
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,400
do you talk it while you're writing it?

127
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:28,760
Yeah, I think that there's a sort of, you can call it a collaboration between my voice

128
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,760
out loud and my interior voice.

129
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,320
And so I don't know that I necessarily read it while I'm writing it down or composing,

130
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,760
but I certainly, sometimes I will say something and I'll stop to record it.

131
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,160
And then I'll read it again.

132
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:54,160
So it becomes, it's like kind of transubstantiation between sound and ink, right?

133
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,600
And it goes back and forth between those two substances.

134
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,000
I think that's more what my process is like, but the out loud part feels very important

135
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
to me.

136
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,880
It's important to you too though, isn't it?

137
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
Yeah.

138
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Yeah.

139
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:18,560
It's important to every poet, but I hear, what you've said is perfect for me too, I think,

140
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,680
but not the way I read, as you know.

141
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,800
But I hear the voice inside, and then I put it down.

142
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:35,320
But I wondered if you actually talked to yourself like Hamlet or somebody.

143
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,480
Well, I love hearing you read.

144
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,720
It's wonderful.

145
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,080
It's beautiful.

146
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:57,560
And I loved that you have this verse, I guess it is, by Neruda in the front of your book.

147
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,880
You feel like reading that to the folks?

148
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
I could do it.

149
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Yeah.

150
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,400
I'd like you've had a chance to read that on, but it's wonderful to hear that voice too.

151
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,560
So it's slipping for me now.

152
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,520
My mind is, I'm drawing a blank.

153
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,920
Anyway, I'll read the verse.

154
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,200
It's from Heights of Machu Picchu.

155
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,400
I can't remember which section it is though.

156
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,640
Show me your blood and your furrows.

157
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:34,480
Show me I was punished here because the jewel didn't shine or the earth didn't surrender

158
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,680
it stone or grain on time.

159
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,440
Point out to me the rock you fell upon and the wood on which they crucified you.

160
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,680
Strike for me into fire the old flint, the ancient lanterns, the whips lashed upon those

161
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,480
wounds throughout centuries.

162
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,200
Show me blood-bright hatchets.

163
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,480
I come to speak through your dead mouth.

164
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,520
Thank you.

165
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:11,760
I love having that in the front of your book because I think it's what you're doing.

166
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,400
Not always dead mouths, but through others' mouths.

167
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,520
And I think that's really what poetry is doing.

168
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,720
Do you hear us okay?

169
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,520
Yeah?

170
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:32,360
I think the great poet Mary Ponzo is among us, so I just want to be sure she's hearing

171
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
this.

172
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:45,200
I think I've never really, I don't think, met a poet who isn't trying to speak for others

173
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:57,040
at least some of the time and for people who couldn't speak for themselves oftentimes

174
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,720
or who you feel that about.

175
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:08,200
But when you read, I've seen you, we work together at Drew University, so I've seen Patrick

176
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:15,200
read on different occasions something formal like this or something where you're helping

177
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,480
to get something going or to announce students' names who are going to read at that time

178
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
or something like that.

179
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,680
So I've seen you in different degrees of formality or not.

180
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:46,120
I think you have such a gift of really using your body, I know you must hear this all the

181
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:53,400
time, but really the whole body comes into Pat's poetry and not just the voice.

182
00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:02,240
So that's something like I suppose we might be used to a great actor doing, but it isn't

183
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,680
every poet who can even aspire to that and it's a wonderful gift I think.

184
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,240
Can I say something?

185
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,000
Of course you can't.

186
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,480
The Kwame Dawes says, he talks about the sound of a drum and that the striking of the drum,

187
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:33,080
the moment that you strike it, the attack is like a consonant.

188
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:39,560
And when the drum rings, those are like the vowels of language, so he likens language

189
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,080
to making drums.

190
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,080
My buddy Roger just told me this last night, I think it's brilliant.

191
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:52,240
What I think also is fascinating about that too is that in terms of language, the consonants

192
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,920
are mostly made here up in the mouth.

193
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:05,080
So those become the percussion and the metronomic sounds in a line or in a poem and that ringing

194
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:13,800
of the drum, boom, the vowels, they become the harmonics that come between percussiveness,

195
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,920
but they also, they come literally from the body in order to sing them out loud.

196
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:28,280
You can't say a vowel without, it comes from the body and so, you know, I wasn't trained

197
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:34,000
as a singer and an actor, but I think that I've always felt very, I was a dancer, I was

198
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,200
a street dancer when I was younger.

199
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,720
I've always felt very connected to my body.

200
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:48,560
So I think that you're reading something about my own practices and my own engagement with

201
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
art.

202
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,760
Coming from that, yeah.

203
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
Yeah, thanks, that's fascinating.

204
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:02,280
I never thought of that consonant vowel thing before, but you mentioned musical instruments

205
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:10,440
and it's a mouth a lot in your poetry, of course, drums, we just had a wonderful one, that amazing

206
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
barrel with the tire.

207
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,160
God, I love that.

208
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,120
And then guitars and, yeah, homemade things.

209
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,120
Yeah.

210
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Piano.

211
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,560
Piano is definitely piano.

212
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Yeah.

213
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,640
Beautiful one.

214
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,520
Maybe you'll read that to us later on.

215
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,320
That's a big poem.

216
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:45,960
You know, when I was young, I think the biggest reader I ever heard are the most impressive

217
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,440
reader I ever heard was Dylan Thomas.

218
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Oh, wow, yeah.

219
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,200
You ever hear recordings of him?

220
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
I have, I have.

221
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Yeah.

222
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,640
And I think although it's different, he came from a tradition, the Welsh tradition of

223
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:07,720
singing and reading and he just took our heads off when he came over here, you know?

224
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,560
I just, I never heard anything like it.

225
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,520
I'm sure there was stuff like it, but I just never heard it.

226
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Yeah.

227
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,200
And speaking of consonants, I mean, the way that he sort of was able to conjure sound

228
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,560
in a poem is just unbelievable.

229
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,440
He's a real model for me in that way.

230
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
He's a real model.

231
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

232
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Yeah.

233
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
Wow.

234
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:39,560
There's so many different styles of reading, but I really love, I love sound so much.

235
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,280
It feels like it's more than half of what goes on.

236
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:48,320
Were there any readers throughout your career?

237
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Were there any readers?

238
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:58,000
I think that it's sort of, it's easy to perhaps remember people who are dynamic.

239
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,600
They're like readers and good readers.

240
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:07,600
But were there readers who were more pulled back that you found not just their poems being

241
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,600
sort of arresting, but the performance of their poems?

242
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Being arresting?

243
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,480
Yeah, or being able to grab your attention by being not sort of bardic necessarily, but

244
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,040
more interior in their performance.

245
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,840
Oh, more interior and arresting in that way.

246
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
Yeah.

247
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
More.

248
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,840
Yeah, I would think, well, let me just think for a minute.

249
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:43,960
There was a couple of interesting things about Robert Lowell.

250
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,240
I don't know if you've heard him on a tape or anything.

251
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,880
I think he'd never heard any tapes of him read ever.

252
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,240
Well, he was from New England, but he had gone into a southern accent somewhere along

253
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
the way.

254
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,920
It was important to him.

255
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,440
So that was one surprise when you heard him read if you didn't know anything about him.

256
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,120
You thought he came from Boston, which he did.

257
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:14,120
But then he, at first, would we, and I didn't hear this, but he talked about it in interviews.

258
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't know if any of you ever heard him in life?

259
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You did, yeah.

260
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,840
Oh, great evening at St. Mark's Church.

261
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,040
Ginsburg was there.

262
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,920
And Peter Orlowski was sort of giving him a hard time from the sidelines.

263
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,160
And Ginsburg was very like a supplicant.

264
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,600
It was surprising to see, because most of us were sort of younger, heard of hippie-ish

265
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,120
group, sort of on the Ginsburg side of things.

266
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,240
He got right down and he kind of kneeled in front of Lowell as he was reading.

267
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
It was Ginsburg.

268
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
It was quite a sight.

269
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
That's wonderful.

270
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,240
I think they became friends at the end.

271
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
Yeah, that's beautiful.

272
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:59,280
I heard that they went on a march to Washington together.

273
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,600
And there was a reading, and of course Ginsburg is heard by everyone.

274
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,520
And Lowell got up there, and there was a mic and everything.

275
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,800
But people kept saying, we can't hear you.

276
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,320
We can't hear you.

277
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,600
And he said, well, I can't do anything.

278
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,120
I could shout, but you still wouldn't hear me.

279
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,640
It was a big, huge crowd of people, I guess.

280
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,360
He just didn't have that Ginsburg.

281
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:28,120
But the interesting thing that I was going to say is anecdotal anyway, that he would

282
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,600
read quite formally as he wrote at the beginning.

283
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,840
And I think quite resolved.

284
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,440
But then he went out on a reading tour in California.

285
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,240
He said, no, the country in those days.

286
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,720
It was very different, politically and far geographically.

287
00:22:48,720 --> 00:23:02,040
And I think he sensed that nobody understood a word he was saying in this very formal,

288
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:11,680
very kind of formal metrics as well as formal language.

289
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,920
And it was before life studies.

290
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,760
It was the more formal work before that.

291
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,800
And people just didn't get it.

292
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:27,400
And so he started in response to audiences talking much less formal, including the way

293
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,680
he would read.

294
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,200
But he would also stop and say something if he thought people weren't getting it.

295
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,120
So it was happening in front of people's eyes that he was changing his style of writing

296
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,520
too, as we found out later when he got to life studies.

297
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,840
So the audience helped transform the way that he saw his own poems.

298
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,600
I mean, that's a wonderful story, I think, an interesting story anyway.

299
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,640
Now, people don't think of you as somebody who performs your poems, but you do embody

300
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,880
your poems in the way that you're crafting silences and your lyrics.

301
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:14,800
But do you imagine yourself or do you think about performance at all or an interaction

302
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
with the audience?

303
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah, I want to talk to the audience.

304
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,600
I want to reach the audience very much.

305
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,240
But I don't think of myself as performing because I've seen yourself and other people

306
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,720
who really can reach probably wide audiences.

307
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,880
And I don't think I would be good at that.

308
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:40,080
But sound is everything to me.

309
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
So I want to have that.

310
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,600
And if I've got a good mic, I'm okay, I think.

311
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,360
But as you know, if I don't, it's pretty hard.

312
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,360
I haven't ever learned how to really project my voice.

313
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,680
So I need a mic.

314
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:03,560
As you were saying before, you feel that probably all poets want to speak also for someone

315
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,960
else who doesn't have the same capacity to speak.

316
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,120
And that should bring us to Lucy.

317
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,080
Because you're speaking to Lucy and speaking for Lucy.

318
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
And...

319
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Cross my fingers.

320
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,240
Yeah, she certainly spoke to me.

321
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
Yeah.

322
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,920
Yeah, thank you for bringing her up.

323
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:30,920
I'll read that later when we get to my turn.

324
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:42,200
I was thinking when we were talking about sound and performing how I once, when I was

325
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,600
in Ireland, there was another anecdote, but there was a sign by the road that said poetry

326
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,080
school.

327
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,920
And it was pointing down this way.

328
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,280
And so I said to the guy, I was, I said, let's go.

329
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,440
I was so lonely, I was dying.

330
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
You know.

331
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,400
So I said, let's go see the poetry school.

332
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,320
And so we drove down this little dirt road and it got to the ocean.

333
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:10,080
And there was a few rocks piled up on each other where you could go in and say it.

334
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,280
And it said poetry school.

335
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,560
And I thought, that is the best.

336
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,440
I ought to just stop right here, you know.

337
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Never leave.

338
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,520
It was just wonderful.

339
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,960
But I was thinking about the first poets probably, they had to speak.

340
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,640
They wouldn't have gotten the job otherwise, right?

341
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,320
I mean, that was the job, I think.

342
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,920
That's not true anymore, but I think it's true of some people.

343
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
Yeah.

344
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Yeah.

345
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
So should we hear Lucy?

346
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
We could do Lucy.

347
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
I don't know how time is.

348
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
Do you do this?

349
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Well, we're going to think about it.

350
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,960
I don't know how time is.

351
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,200
Well, we're going to 3.30, so I don't know.

352
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,000
You think it's probably 20 minutes to read those poems or more?

353
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't know.

354
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,760
I can stop at 20 minutes though.

355
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,720
But you want to get Patrick a chance to respond to the Lucy sequence and we have some more

356
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,040
things to read.

357
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,440
And to read more to us.

358
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,280
Well I don't know if you can hear back there.

359
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,520
I said, okay, you're where you want to be.

360
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Okay.

361
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:36,280
This is a sequence about Lucy who is a hominid so called, whose skeleton is approximately

362
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,360
3.2 million years old.

363
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,800
You've probably heard about her.

364
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,040
And they found her skeleton in 1974.

365
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:55,640
And she was, if I understand it right, she was one of the first early people who was

366
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,080
able to stand up and walk.

367
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:06,000
And for me she's very much a mother.

368
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,920
And one thing about standing up is you can then hold your child in your arms because

369
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,120
you're not on all fours.

370
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:21,760
And so that was one of the moving things about her, that development of humans.

371
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:32,800
And she was found, I told you in 1974, the Ethiopian people where she was found referred

372
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:41,360
to her as Dinkenos, which is an Amharic language term meaning you are beautiful.

373
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:51,760
And they called her Lucy, the, what do you call the people who find skeletons?

374
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,400
Anthropologists, paleontologists, people who found her called her Lucy because they got

375
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
back to the campground.

376
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,440
Oh, this is a thing I love about this finding.

377
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,680
And if you went to the museums or any of the exhibits you'd see, they were walking along,

378
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,680
end of the long day.

379
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,240
And they didn't see anything, they were looking for her but they couldn't find anything.

380
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,880
And then one of them saw a little gland of light out of his eye and he turned around

381
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,320
and it was a bone poking up from the sand or earth or whatever it was.

382
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,080
And they went back and that was the beginning of the skeleton that they found.

383
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,560
And I love that because it must happen all the time but you know it's just chance what

384
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,160
we would call chance if you hadn't turned around.

385
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:45,400
You know, somebody else would have found it later maybe but it's so chancey.

386
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:52,280
And then when they got back to the campground, the radio was playing Lucy in the sky with

387
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
diamonds.

388
00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:03,920
This was Beatles time so they named her Lucy from that.

389
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:11,560
Lucy, your secret book that you leaned over and wrote just in the dirt.

390
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:17,440
Not having to have an ending, not having to last.

391
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,760
This is a quote from a song.

392
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:29,160
In thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there

393
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,760
was none of them.

394
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,960
And this is the poem again.

395
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:42,080
Two hands were all you owned for food, for love.

396
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,440
Now you own none Lucy nor no words.

397
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:55,200
Only breath marks, breath marks only nor no words.

398
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:04,360
For what do you do now, Lucy, for love, your eyes?

399
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:12,080
This has a quote from William Carlos Williams, my saxophage that splits the rocks.

400
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,640
Lucy, my saxophage that splits the rocks.

401
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:23,280
Wild good mother, you fill my center hole with bliss.

402
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:34,240
No one is so tender in her scream, wants me so much, not just but brings me to be, is

403
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:41,160
when I am close to death and close to life.

404
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:51,000
The spider in her web, three days dead on the window, Lucy.

405
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,600
In the electricity of love, it's lightning strike or in its quiet hum in the thighs,

406
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:05,480
like this little ice box here, not knowing any better, or in the dumb hum of the heater

407
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,800
going on.

408
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:17,120
Little stirs in the room tone, I rush outdoors into the air you are, Lucy, and you rush out

409
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:27,120
to receive me, at last there you are, who I always knew was there, but almost died, not

410
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,000
meeting.

411
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:40,520
When my scraped out child died, Lucy, you hold her all the time.

412
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,600
This one has some names of people I knew who died around this same time, this next one,

413
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:58,160
also talks about a story of Chekhov's called Easter Eve, where there's a fairy man in

414
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,240
this story whose name is Jero Neem.

415
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:13,040
Lucy, when the dark bodies dropped out of the towers, when Ruth died and Grace and

416
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:26,200
Helen Ruth, and Iraq, and Iraq, and Nikolay, Lucy, when Jane in her last clothes goes across

417
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:40,720
with Chekhov, you are the fairy man, the monk, Jero Neem, who throws your weight on the rope.

418
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,800
I wash my plate and spoon as carefully as a priest.

419
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,320
Did you have a cup, Lucy?

420
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,560
Oh God, who transcends time, let Lucy have a cup.

421
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:00,320
You Bodhisattva, here with us, you wanted to come back.

422
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,200
I'm afraid and can't pay attention to it.

423
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,640
I'm wild with heat and cold, and my head hurts.

424
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:17,600
The nine wild turkeys come up calmly to the porch to see you, Lucy.

425
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:24,960
When I was writing this, I began to get the idea that Lucy's name, at least, was going

426
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,840
to be in every one of these things.

427
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:34,000
I didn't have any idea about that beforehand, or anything else, really.

428
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,120
This is called My Work of Art for Lucy.

429
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:46,480
It's a piece of brown wrapping paper taped to the wall over the table in this beautiful

430
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,200
room with no pictures.

431
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:57,560
First written across the top, quote, it was as if she was standing across the road waiting

432
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,200
to see if anyone wanted to get to know her.

433
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:08,600
Then taped under that, forgive my German, I'm going to quote Rilke for one line only,

434
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:15,040
do dare do vise, und gessen, vaiten, svissen.

435
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:22,560
You, this is Rilke still, you who know and whose vast knowing is born of poverty, abundance

436
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,840
of poverty.

437
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:31,360
Make it so the poor are no longer despised and thrown away.

438
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:38,440
Look at them standing around like wildflowers, which have nowhere else to grow.

439
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,080
That's Rilke.

440
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:51,320
Then a blue panther, a 26 cent stamp from Florida for postcards, then a Catalpa leaf curling

441
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:57,800
from its huge curving stem, curving rather from its huge curving stem.

442
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:06,040
The leaf a little broken and its passing from the west onto the east.

443
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:12,920
And the note, I found this leaf on my way to the post office.

444
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:23,880
Then Lucy, you, hominid, sapiens, seperi to taste be wise.

445
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,480
Rilkeleton standing around like a wildflower.

446
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:42,560
Lucy, what you want that I will do to hear you know your poem, but you need nothing.

447
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:51,680
The deer and the wild turkeys that draw close now to hear you my life is for.

448
00:36:51,680 --> 00:37:03,920
In its language, your voice, I can't tell cold from heat, anxiety, dust, death, no,

449
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,160
not even dust.

450
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,760
So I don't know.

451
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,560
Let's finish it up.

452
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
Okay, we'll finish it up.

453
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,240
But hang that too much further to go.

454
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:24,120
Your picture, brown museum hair, brush the way they brush it there, brow lit from inside,

455
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:30,840
intelligent eyebrows, a slightly wrinkly nose, a little flat.

456
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:36,480
Brown woman, I want your nose, your cheekbones of light.

457
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,640
I was brown, I got white.

458
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:49,560
Her large and friendly mouth, half open, in a half smile, surprised.

459
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,400
But Lucy, your eyes.

460
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:03,200
So I gave all I had to the poor, standing around like wildflowers.

461
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,000
Lucy, the spider moved last night and again this morning.

462
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,680
I wonder, do you sleep and wake where you are now?

463
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,080
Do spiders hibernate?

464
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,560
Do they lay eggs and webs on window panes?

465
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:27,080
You must know everything.

466
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,200
Enter the sweet why.

467
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,800
Don't treat it or question why.

468
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,280
Whistle why.

469
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,760
Whisper why.

470
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,560
Was sweetness done to you?

471
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:45,200
What I wanted most, the mother, has come to me.

472
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,360
Will she stay in my ear?

473
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,360
Lucy, is it you?

474
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,560
Still all night long my Lucy, I entreat you.

475
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,360
I will not let thee go except thou bless me.

476
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:10,440
Well, here comes another character in the last few pages of this and his name is Martin

477
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Ramirez.

478
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,280
He's what we call an untaught artist.

479
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,920
And I have to just say that I was looking at his work one time.

480
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:30,120
He did a lot of tunnels, railroad tunnels and railroad tracks and landscapes around railroad

481
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:37,640
because he was a railroad worker from Mexico, came to California.

482
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,840
What they say had a nervous breakdown, no longer could do that work, was put into a hospital

483
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:50,560
and mental hospital in California where he began to draw and paint.

484
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,880
And different people in the hospital helped him and brought him crayons and pencils and

485
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,480
paper and everything he needed and gave him time.

486
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:08,280
And one of the doctors particularly collected his work and that's why we have it.

487
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,880
And so when you go to these folk art museums and so forth you can find his work there,

488
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,720
Martin Ramirez.

489
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,400
And I don't know how he got into this but here he is.

490
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,800
Except I love him.

491
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,000
That could be why.

492
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,720
You think so?

493
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,680
You love coming to the poems, don't they?

494
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,840
Martin Ramirez, be with me.

495
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,640
It looks, oh this is something I heard in the gallery when I was looking at one of his

496
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,160
paintings of tunnels.

497
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,440
I'll start over.

498
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,880
Martin Ramirez, be with me.

499
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,000
It looks just like a vagina, a bystander said.

500
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,920
Yes, it is a vagina with chains and tunnels and like in the great cathedrals a clitoris,

501
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:05,440
a starry one and a womb, John T. Martin being born, Lucy, did you hear animal woman screams

502
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,920
in the night?

503
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,760
Were you afraid?

504
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,840
Was it you last night?

505
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:17,560
Your scream over and over as you give birth.

506
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,400
How did you pray, Lucy?

507
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,640
You were a prayer, your hands and toes.

508
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:35,000
When writing came back to me, I prayed with lipstick on the windshield as I drove.

509
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,560
Newton made up with the world.

510
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,160
He had already turned himself into gold.

511
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,200
He was already there.

512
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:53,280
A skeleton woman in, down, over, around.

513
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,520
Blessing from the old English bleats the end.

514
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,560
Its root is the same as for blood.

515
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,560
My head is at your window, Lucy, at your glass.

516
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,800
But we offer nothing but money now.

517
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,080
We beam it to each other near and far.

518
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,720
But you are my skeleton mother.

519
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:23,760
I bring you coffee in your cemetery bed.

520
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:31,880
This morning I miss most of all you, Martin, and her who when you were born looked and

521
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,720
blessed your beauty.

522
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:44,280
You see, when you are with me, I feel the atoms racing everywhere in this old oak table

523
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:53,280
in the eight pointed double star spider and in the starry rippling all around us.

524
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:05,360
Newton woman, guardian, death woman, Lucy, here, a picnic, cornbread, here, an orange

525
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:16,640
with my teen and me at the lip of the earth's surface world.

526
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:28,360
So, last semester, this spring, actually, I first taught this course in the fall semester

527
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,360
to undergraduates.

528
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,440
It's about digital remix of all things.

529
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:41,400
And that I taught it again as a graduate seminar in this past spring.

530
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,080
So Lucy Palmas is one of the assignments that I signed in this digital remix course.

531
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,880
So for the remix, for those of you who might not be familiar with the concept, essentially

532
00:43:51,880 --> 00:44:02,440
remix is gathering random or disorganized data or even organized data for that matter

533
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,640
and then reorganizing it into another form.

534
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,320
Any kind of data can be sound or whatever.

535
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:16,000
This is how I've almost always composed poems because I came out of a music production background.

536
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:24,600
I thought about gathering data, gathering bits and figuring out ways in which these different

537
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,240
pieces fit together.

538
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:37,040
Reading the Lucy poem gave me this window, I think, into what many, if not all of Jean's

539
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,320
poems are about or the process anyway.

540
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,720
And that I think it's about collecting bits.

541
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,080
And it's very clear.

542
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:50,280
She was sort of, she was making the commentary and she was going along, but there's a quote

543
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,280
from Assam.

544
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,680
There's a catalog of the dead.

545
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,640
There's personal memory.

546
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,840
There's an elegiac address.

547
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:03,440
These are not necessarily things that you will find next to one another.

548
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:13,320
Up here in this long poem inspired by Lucy, she draws them together and rearranges them.

549
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,920
I don't mean to talk about you in third person, but it's funny, Eugene.

550
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,400
I'm happy.

551
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:28,040
I actually had never heard of Joseph Cornell before Jean had told me about his work.

552
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,680
And I'm fascinated now with his boxes.

553
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:39,720
And I see a real correlation between what Cornell is doing in terms of collecting these

554
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:46,280
bits and arranging them in boxes and what you're doing in poems.

555
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,880
Is that, do you see that parallel as well?

556
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,880
Not until this matter.

557
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,520
But I'm very happy with it.

558
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,520
Is this still working?

559
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,680
I'm very happy with it.

560
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:04,680
I love him as you know, and is my cooking?

561
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,680
Yes.

562
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,480
I get you.

563
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,440
Yeah, I love him.

564
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,680
But I've never thought of doing that.

565
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,320
But on purpose, you know, like he did.

566
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,400
But you know, he did it first little brother.

567
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,240
It's so sweet.

568
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,240
Yeah.

569
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,280
So I guess that would be a wonderful reason to make anything.

570
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,280
Yeah.

571
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,040
I'm so happy to know that you love him so much too.

572
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,040
Yeah.

573
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:44,520
I think the other thing that I love about that sequence too is that the book has, it's

574
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,760
elegiac also, the book.

575
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,880
I mean, it has the elegy for Reginald Shepard in there too.

576
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,640
And so this long sequence ends a book that goes in and out of elegy.

577
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,760
This is a long sequence that ends up addressing the dead.

578
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,920
And it's the oldest dead that we know in some ways, the oldest standing dead that we know.

579
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,280
And I love that pairing.

580
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,160
And what is it that paleontologists do?

581
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,960
They excavate.

582
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,400
They dig up the remains.

583
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,440
I think poets are trying to do that also.

584
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,640
And in fact, in DJ culture, one of the things that you learn is the art of digging, which

585
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:32,600
is going into record stores and finding sounds and records that nobody has found before.

586
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,600
Right?

587
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:39,200
And anyway, so on so many different levels, that long poem, I mean, it's just a moving

588
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:47,000
poem anyway in terms of both personal and long historical meditation on motherhood, on

589
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,840
being in the world, on death, on living, on making art for that matter.

590
00:47:53,840 --> 00:48:01,080
On so many levels, that poem is beautiful to me.

591
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:08,080
And I think that if I told people that you work, I find these parallels between your

592
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:13,120
work and mine or the way that I think about art, I think if people heard us, people saw

593
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:17,720
us walking together in the street, they'd be like, what an uncoupled they are.

594
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,600
In my mind, I think we make the most sense, actually.

595
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,600
Yeah.

596
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,600
I feel the same way.

597
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,600
Yeah.

598
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,600
I feel the same way.

599
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,600
I'm so happy.

600
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,000
Well, because I do think when I'm reading through this book of yours, which I have here

601
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,440
Bone Shepherd, it's really a sequence, too.

602
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,440
I feel that.

603
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,440
You know?

604
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,440
I don't know if you've thought of it that way, any of you.

605
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:52,480
But it really may partly come from being in such a, your family's part of diaspora and

606
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:59,480
your drawing on a lot of that and your travels back and your travels back here and all that.

607
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,440
And that's a little further back in my life.

608
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,080
But I wonder, quite a few generations back.

609
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:14,320
But I wonder if part of that is maybe unconsciously wanting to bring things together a little

610
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
bit.

611
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,320
Absolutely.

612
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:23,160
Like making a box for your younger brother or putting things in it, even if it's not

613
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:29,640
a pointed to sequence, things that do kind of, I felt that reading your book a lot, yeah,

614
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,440
this book.

615
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,000
And I feel it when you read, you know, from music to speech, too.

616
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,680
That's another kind of historical sequence, isn't it?

617
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,680
For everyone.

618
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,880
But with you, it's very, very alive, you know?

619
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,880
And I love that.

620
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,960
So I wonder if this happens to you, because what happens to me, and there's poets in the

621
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,080
room, I'm sure I'd love to hear.

622
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:05,040
When I was writing the Lucy thing, I was very fortunate, because I was in one of these artist

623
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,000
colonies for probably a month or something.

624
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,200
I had nothing to do at all.

625
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,200
And so, except if I could write something.

626
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,760
But with that kind of silence or any kind of silence we can find, you know, or a little

627
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:28,560
space, maybe in the summer vacation or something like that.

628
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:36,440
I wonder if things come to you the way, I just sort of sat there, and things come, you

629
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,800
know, by themselves.

630
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,400
If you can have that kind of quiet, sometimes that will happen.

631
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,480
It doesn't always happen.

632
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,080
But this poem, that was happening.

633
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,240
You know, I'm just copying down.

634
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,240
Wow.

635
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,240
Really great.

636
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,920
Coping down what I heard.

637
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,400
So a lot of it came just as it was.

638
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,040
Because I've seen you sort of, I'm confessing here that I've peaked over your shoulder while

639
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:05,240
you're kind of composing on your yellow pad, and I see you arranging and crossing out.

640
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,240
Yeah, I'll do that.

641
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,080
But for this poem, it seemed to sort of let itself out.

642
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,640
Pretty much as is.

643
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:19,280
You know, I had to look up some stuff, but I even went to the house and used the phone.

644
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,760
I didn't have a cell phone.

645
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:26,840
I went up to the house of the writer's colony and called up a friend, mutual friend of

646
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,400
ours, Anne-Marie Macare.

647
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,800
I said, I can't stop writing this thing.

648
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,960
I said, I've been depressed, but I've never been manic.

649
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,280
You think I'm in trouble?

650
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,360
You know, I was going day after day, you know, writing this thing.

651
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,040
She said, you know, she said, isn't it funny when something good happens.

652
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,400
People think they've done something wrong.

653
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:54,320
Yeah, and she said, it sounds like you've got a little more to do on that poem.

654
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,960
Why don't you go on back and do it?

655
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,760
And she said, just don't operate any heavy machinery.

656
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,680
You can hear her say.

657
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,840
I can totally hear her say.

658
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,480
Both of her, you know, in common.

659
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,520
But it was just amazing.

660
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:16,000
I don't usually certainly get things like that, but I wondered if you do sometimes.

661
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Occasionally.

662
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,400
And it does, I mean, teaching doesn't allow for a whole lot of silence because most of

663
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,240
that quiet time is being used to think about my students and so forth.

664
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,040
But you know, I just told you I moved to Philadelphia about a month and a half ago.

665
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:38,280
And it's a different quality of silence than living in New York City or other places that

666
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,280
I've been.

667
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:45,960
And there's a kind of, I don't know, you just settle into a place.

668
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,200
And images arrive.

669
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:58,960
I think part of it is that the silence allows me to access deep memory.

670
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,920
And that doesn't necessarily mean that this deep memory is whole.

671
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:11,280
Sometimes this deep memory is fragmented, but it's their intense fragments.

672
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,960
So yeah, I have a very intimate relationship with silence.

673
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,960
I would have thought so.

674
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,960
Yeah.

675
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:25,960
So if you want to help an artist, give them some silence.

676
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,960
That's it.

677
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,960
That's the thing.

678
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,960
Yeah.

679
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,960
That's why they had that poetry school down by the way.

680
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,960
Down by the ocean, a couple of rocks.

681
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,960
It's got the waves, but nothing much else.

682
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,960
Oh God.

683
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,960
So, Packard, maybe you could read a couple more of your beautiful poems.

684
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,960
Yeah.

685
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,960
I'm sure which ones I gave you later.

686
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:58,960
I'm just going to start picking from the book.

687
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:25,960
I wonder if maybe I'll read a couple of poems that I don't normally read out loud.

688
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:32,960
There's still quite narrative of the poems, but they make more lyric leaps in Al-Ajean

689
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,600
Valentine than many of my other poems do.

690
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:42,960
So this one's called Undrowning.

691
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,720
In Spanish, there's a word called disallerci.

692
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:51,240
I learned that word from my friend Jessica and it sort of gave me this poem.

693
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:57,240
She was going through a hard time and her mom said that you have to undrown yourself.

694
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,240
Yeah.

695
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,440
Undrowning.

696
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,320
Who needs to be convinced of loneliness in murmurs?

697
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:12,040
In the palimpsest of a few words rising out of a sentence you don't understand, unless

698
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,400
it's whispered directly into your fingers.

699
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,560
The rain itself isn't terrible.

700
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:26,360
But sometimes I believe whole oceans are lifted in the name of some worshiped fury and dropped

701
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:30,120
into our eyes mid-life.

702
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:37,000
You tell me the word is disallerci, which is to say you've already drowned.

703
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,640
And to undrown you must recall how the light of Venice's lamps and the stars long traveled

704
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:50,560
a reverent burn break on the wake of a small boat, ferrying you and a couple friends.

705
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:58,640
One you now grieve, another an opera singer, drunk her hair you remember sweeping over

706
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,800
the prowl.

707
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:08,800
If the gondolier speaks a word of English, it is yes, which is one of two words in the

708
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:14,600
language to contain so many disparate categories of sadness.

709
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:22,920
I mean in the whole of one syllable, half a universe stays afloat, sinks, swims back

710
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:30,520
up with too much liquor or wine in its blood, and in drowning or its opposite, a life doesn't

711
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,800
flash before your very eyes.

712
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:40,880
But if I say the multitudes of ghosts put to sleep by centuries of conquerors awaken in

713
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,880
your veins.

714
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:48,120
And you must answer them with a grief that is neither famous nor deadly.

715
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,360
It's even simpler than that.

716
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:55,800
One Saturday night you sit under the slant ceiling of your cramped kitchen in a winter

717
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:02,480
that's lasted a few extra days into spring, doing precise damage to a bottle of coconut

718
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,400
rum that will pay you four times back.

719
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,400
You turn up the sad tangos your lovely shit-talking father used to sing, he who could dream in

720
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,360
the steel language of flight, and you weep.

721
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:22,760
Your lamentation counts you squarely among the living.

722
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,280
Get either.

723
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:31,600
I'm sorry a beautiful young man you once laughed with under the near blaze of a foreign sky

724
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:38,520
while an opera singer slammed her melismatic eyes into the stone and glass of a city sinking

725
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:43,040
into its shallow glacial canals is dead.

726
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:48,000
We can't call up all the wreckage of generations.

727
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,040
Do not forget you are witness to a scent.

728
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,640
Tonight sleep well.

729
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:01,800
When solitude calls it doesn't mean to kill but offers the kind of sight one earns when

730
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:07,400
you've lain a long time still.

731
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:15,000
It's a beauty.

732
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:29,040
Let me read Despely d'Ardiente.

733
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,960
I was teaching at an MFA program in the hall.

734
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,760
You can teach a line.

735
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,800
You can teach meter, you can teach rhythm, you can teach form.

736
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:44,440
There's a lot of things that you can teach.

737
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:53,480
The hardest thing to teach, maybe it's impossible to teach, is how to make a poem blaze.

738
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:00,000
This is my urging towards my students to make it blaze.

739
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,440
Despely d'Ardiente.

740
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:11,160
Dear feverless, dear poets, dear love sick ones now cured.

741
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,840
There are bloodless battles to be won, but stout your maw with your finest curses.

742
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,400
Yap your demons to their proper graves.

743
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,400
O meek weepers, asymmetries, be kissed.

744
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,280
Let the trash stack in the kitchen.

745
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,720
Keep your lover a full day from work.

746
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:36,360
O sweet neglect, O nectarine, those bitter pits are meant for more than nibbling.

747
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,240
There is a holy jump off.

748
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,240
There is a funky genesis.

749
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,240
There is a reason love and jive kind of rhyme.

750
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,760
You oblong fruit not three days ripe.

751
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:53,720
Somewhere in you lies the science of typhoons, a dream of strings.

752
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:59,840
Oh dirty word, oh first murder, oh cocoa butter whiff on a smoky bus.

753
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:05,680
There are theories were made of mostly nothing but motion.

754
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,680
Oh dap tooth guitar.

755
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:14,320
Oh sound hole, you far away drum, you slang mouth blessing, you long time, you chamberless

756
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,320
sex step.

757
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:20,400
Let me leave you with a few last words.

758
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:29,240
When mad dogs break chains to run at you, charge back.

759
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,240
Bear your very teeth.

760
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,360
No monster I promise outruns you.

761
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,040
Let them on the ankle with a stick, chase the bastards down.

762
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:43,600
Listen, this vertigo, this wreckage, this bad ballad straining the thickest tendons of

763
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,600
your legs.

764
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:49,520
Oh darling sleepers, may you wake in the middle of the night strange.

765
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,640
Sounds you champions of laughter.

766
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,480
All you have to do is speak simply.

767
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,360
Your business is the truth.

768
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:01,120
Your hearts catastrophe is just a little a histories twisted bulwark.

769
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:07,880
If there were not a sky within your chest worth breaking, believe me, you would have

770
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:11,120
stopped all this singing by now.

771
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:17,040
Hey, that's so great.

772
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:43,840
I guess I could tell a story about that poem.

773
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:49,160
I was teaching at the University of Texas at Austin at the time.

774
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:57,040
One of my colleagues was doing a project in which he was getting several different people

775
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:04,000
to record song of myself, every line.

776
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,520
I think there might have been six or eight of us who did it separately.

777
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:16,760
I went into the studio and for one day in one session I performed song of myself out loud

778
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,600
all the way through.

779
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:24,600
I didn't take any breaks but I would flub a line occasionally.

780
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:32,080
It's remarkable how easily his long lines sort of fly.

781
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:41,240
You can imagine the physical intensity of doing that poem I was exhausted.

782
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:46,000
I fell asleep by 8.30.

783
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,160
But I woke up at 1.30 in the morning and this poem came out.

784
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,720
That's one poem that did come out.

785
01:02:54,720 --> 01:03:03,800
And I know that the spirit of song of myself was in that poem.

786
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:08,840
That's a great story.

787
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:16,480
I'm sure he's glad.

788
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:22,120
That's wonderful though about how the spirit and the body are one and you can get into

789
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,160
someone else's spirit and body.

790
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,400
I'm going to go home and do that.

791
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,840
See if I can get something too.

792
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,840
Yeah.

793
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,840
Oh boy.

794
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,840
We could all do that.

795
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,840
Yeah.

796
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:41,200
I have a theory that poetry does on maybe molecular or sub-molecular levels and maybe

797
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,640
there's research already done about this.

798
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,000
That it changes the body.

799
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Do you believe that too?

800
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Yeah, I do.

801
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Yeah.

802
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Yeah.

803
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Like music does.

804
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Right?

805
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Yeah.

806
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:01,320
I suppose that's one reason why we love it so much.

807
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,320
You think?

808
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:06,280
I mean even when we're little kids we love it so much.

809
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,280
You're poetry.

810
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:13,360
Come in and change our bodies and make us feel better.

811
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,360
Yeah.

812
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,360
Yeah.

813
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,360
Yeah.

814
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:34,160
You know people always talk about Emily Dickinson as being Emily Dickinson and Jean Valentine.

815
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,280
Did what men play a part in your reading life?

816
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,280
Does he continue to?

817
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:44,680
I mean they're always sort of posing them apart as these kind of binaries right?

818
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,680
Emily Dickinson.

819
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,680
And what women?

820
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,680
I think that's crazy.

821
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,680
Yeah.

822
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,120
They say he's the man and she's the woman.

823
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,120
Yeah.

824
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:57,920
No I think they're very much, I think they're very much, I mean they're called the mother

825
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:02,720
and father of our poetry and all that but I mean that doesn't do any harm I suppose

826
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:09,360
just to think we have one but you know or two but I don't see that myself.

827
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:17,360
You know I think they were both going right to the heart of what was going on and coming

828
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,360
out different but.

829
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:27,360
They were both.

830
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:45,120
I mean I suppose it would be like thinking, I don't quite what I want to say but like

831
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:52,080
thinking men and women are different than we are but we are so much the same.

832
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,080
You know much more the same.

833
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:59,320
I also think you know they don't sit out to do what they do they just do what they can

834
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,320
right?

835
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,320
Just like all the rest of us.

836
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:07,280
I think Dickinson just did what she could and he did what he could and they were called

837
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,440
differently but I don't see them as opposed to each other at all.

838
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:18,720
I feel like they give us ourselves and lucky us, lucky us you know.

839
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,040
It's just beautiful.

840
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,520
What if we only had one of them?

841
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,520
Wouldn't be as rich.

842
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:29,240
But I think that kind of opposition is silly don't you?

843
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:35,920
I think it makes everything smaller instead of what we got.

844
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:41,040
We could have only had one of them but somebody had to dig up Emily's poems out of the drawers

845
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,200
and make sure we got them.

846
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,640
She didn't try to get them to us.

847
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,640
That's right.

848
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,640
At the beginning I guess you tried to.

849
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,320
I guess it didn't show anything away.

850
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,400
That's true.

851
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,400
I think.

852
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:05,520
That you probably put there was probably a great deal of feeling involved in the way

853
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:10,040
she strung the poems together into those little booklets.

854
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,040
Oh yeah.

855
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,040
Oh absolutely.

856
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,040
Yeah.

857
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:24,960
So did you want to share some new poems with us?

858
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:30,600
You said that you might.

859
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:37,040
Those were some together.

860
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,200
Mine are stuck together with white out.

861
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,160
All of the part.

862
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,160
All of the part.

863
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:47,160
I take out and write something else over.

864
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,440
You know what white out is?

865
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:57,240
I don't know if in this age you use it anymore but that's my sad state anyway.

866
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:04,640
Let that one go for the moment.

867
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,600
This is a strange one.

868
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,440
They're all strange to me anyway.

869
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,760
They're strange when they come to us don't you think?

870
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,760
If we're lucky.

871
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,120
They are.

872
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:24,120
This is called for Robert Lowell who was a teacher of many of ours of my age and younger.

873
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:28,040
And I'll just read it.

874
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:36,280
I looked and there he was my father in poetry, my guide to the underworld.

875
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,840
I was shy to speak.

876
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,560
He said here take my hand.

877
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,840
We cross here.

878
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:47,440
And I said what you went to earth for.

879
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,400
Did you find it?

880
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,000
He was tall in a blue shirt.

881
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
He pointed across the street.

882
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,920
Over there he said that was the last time I saw Delmore.

883
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:06,520
And I shared it said at the beginning Delmore Schwartz was a good friend of his and died

884
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,240
before Lowell then.

885
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,880
So that's how he came into that.

886
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,440
And I don't know if you read him anymore.

887
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,440
You do?

888
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,440
Yeah.

889
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,920
I think he's wonderful.

890
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,760
I also love his name.

891
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,600
So you know both those things got him in there.

892
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,000
I wanted the sound of Delmore as much as I wanted.

893
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,320
Not as much but also you know.

894
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:35,320
It's to me that you were describing a dream.

895
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:39,320
It felt like you were talking about a dream of being with Robert Lowell and saying that

896
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,080
you were doing that.

897
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:45,160
Maybe that's some of the oddness of...

898
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,480
It is odd isn't it?

899
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:52,000
Yeah I think between dreams and poems I'm not sure where one ends and the next begins

900
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,080
you know for me anyway.

901
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,040
The three words I often mix up are poem, memory and dream.

902
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,040
Yeah.

903
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,040
They slip into each other's categories.

904
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,040
Yeah.

905
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,040
Yeah.

906
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,040
Yeah.

907
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,200
Do you ever read that book?

908
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,000
Memories, dreams, reflections.

909
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,320
I love that one too.

910
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:17,760
I read one more it's called song.

911
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,760
I was...

912
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,760
Oh this...

913
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:25,480
This has a little back reference which isn't going to be in the poem but since we're sitting

914
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:30,920
here together it's another untaught artist.

915
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,680
Gee what's his name?

916
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,680
Finster.

917
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,840
I don't know if you know Finster.

918
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:45,840
It's Howard Finster and there's also an echo poem you'll hear it.

919
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,120
Stevie Smith, very famous line of hers.

920
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,560
I was not waving but drowning.

921
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:58,480
It's very famous so I thought I could echo that without people being lost.

922
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,480
Song.

923
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:10,520
I was asking pardon who am I of them who I am, pardon, of the slow wearing gown, of

924
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,120
the window, the sun.

925
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:24,000
I was asking forgiveness, of the crocodile, that good hider, of the heron, that good feeder

926
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,400
and of Christ the Pelican.

927
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:36,600
Christ said over a thousand pages of scripture and I was not reading but dreaming.

928
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,360
It's the same right now he said.

929
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,840
He just stood there.

930
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:47,320
I was not painting but watching the animals.

931
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:51,720
I was not copying but dreaming.

932
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:59,640
Over one thousand newborns in this clearing we started to lick some clean, dreaming one

933
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,640
by one.

934
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:06,640
Thank you very much.

935
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,840
Patrick did you want to say anything on the first hearing?

936
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:14,720
We get smarter.

937
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:23,680
I was thinking about the Neruda epigraph in my book and both of us have a relationship

938
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,160
to the dead.

939
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:32,760
Not necessarily in a Macaw way but in a way about how to think about who we are in history

940
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,760
and where we go.

941
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:38,680
I think even in your book you talk about you trouble time also.

942
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:46,480
Time and matter, run into one another and the straight hour of time gets confused in

943
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,840
your poem.

944
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:57,600
If time is reoriented or redefined then so does our relationship to death has to do.

945
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:04,720
So the dead, the dead, like Lowell in this particular poem is allowed to come back and

946
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,640
instruct us where to cross.

947
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:18,040
The other thing I love about your poems is that some of the matter that remains after

948
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:26,040
I read the poem are questions like who is the cheetah or what is the cheetah.

949
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:31,240
You have the space cheetah in your book.

950
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:35,280
This is an exercise that I asked my beginning poetry students do all the times.

951
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,720
I would say anything authoritative about a poem right away.

952
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,240
Ask questions.

953
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:44,240
And so with your poems I find myself with the questions and I'm able to sort of hold

954
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,360
on to those questions for a while.

955
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:53,600
And they're often very interesting questions about how to live, about time, about space,

956
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,240
about the dead.

957
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:04,920
They invoke other lyric lines for me too.

958
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:11,840
So you find that when you're writing too, that you're asking questions, maybe when

959
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:16,000
you finish something, like where did that come from?

960
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,800
Yeah, I'm sure you do because I can hear it in your poem.

961
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:27,200
I showed this Lowell thing to somebody and they said, oh yeah, he's showing you how to

962
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,240
cross the street or something like that.

963
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,360
And I said, yeah, I was surprised when he said that.

964
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,320
It was like I think it sort of spoke some or something.

965
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,680
But I was surprised when that came, when I was writing it.

966
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,920
You know how come?

967
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,440
It sounded okay.

968
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,440
It's interesting.

969
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:54,600
I think when I'm having a hard time writing, the questions are happening, but I don't hear

970
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,360
them or I am refusing them.

971
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:02,480
And so when I have the silence that you were talking about earlier, it's like I can make

972
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:09,480
space for the questions and the unknown and the uncertainty of the poem.

973
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,480
All you and I need is a do we know castle.

974
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,480
Yes.

975
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,480
Good day.

976
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,480
You and I and everybody else here.

977
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:18,320
You can buy one, let's go get away.

978
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:23,120
Just get quiet for a while.

979
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,480
Yeah, and then all the terrible angels will arrive.

980
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,080
That's true they will.

981
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:33,480
They will say hello.

982
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:40,680
So maybe we can open things up to the audience and they can begin to participate out loud.

983
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,480
Anybody want to ask a question or make a comment?

984
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:57,480
Yes.

985
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:12,320
My question is why do you say the poem changes the body?

986
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:20,000
I always thought the poem changes probably the mind, the spirit, maybe the soul, but it

987
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,680
definitely gets you away from the body.

988
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:30,400
And I like mics because in a mic, with the mic, through a mic, the poem even gets away

989
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,600
from the human voice.

990
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:40,440
It gets into a life of its own and stands in the room by itself, away from the poet because

991
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:47,680
ultimately the poet is also a body is part of this earth and the poem gets us away from

992
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,880
all of that.

993
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:54,440
So that's why I was wondering I never heard that the poem changes the body.

994
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,440
So that's my question.

995
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:02,320
It's a theory that I have that the poems change the body.

996
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:11,080
I know that when I've gone to poetry readings, the poems are really good.

997
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,280
I feel something in my body.

998
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,040
I don't have a description for it.

999
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:22,440
Emily Dickinson said that it feels like the top of her head comes off.

1000
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,440
And she used the body.

1001
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,440
She didn't compare it.

1002
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,440
It feels like the sky.

1003
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,960
It feels like something in her body is happening.

1004
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,760
For her, the top of her head is coming off.

1005
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,720
For me, I don't know.

1006
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,880
Sometimes my hair stands up.

1007
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:41,880
Sometimes I've felt so moved by a poem that I want to jump up and run.

1008
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:46,080
I've felt that many, many times.

1009
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,880
I don't know if it's true or not.

1010
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,920
There's something about it.

1011
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,760
I think also that deep memory resides.

1012
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:02,440
I think that I believe that geneticists are going to find out that deep memory gets handed

1013
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,480
down across DNA.

1014
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:13,640
And if that's true, then what role does intense language like poetry have in the making of

1015
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,760
the human body at the DNA level?

1016
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,760
We don't have tools to measure that yet.

1017
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,480
I'm just proposing that.

1018
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:24,160
Maybe somebody with $75 billion to do the research.

1019
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,920
But I put the question out there.

1020
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,040
I suspect it.

1021
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:36,280
And I think it also goes back to something that Jean said that early on, poetry as a

1022
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:43,400
written art is much younger than poetry as a bodily and performed art.

1023
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,360
It was meant to be in the body.

1024
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:49,640
It was meant to be performed and shared in a room full of bodies.

1025
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:52,040
Many times those bodies were dancing.

1026
01:18:52,040 --> 01:19:02,520
And so I think that you can't just erase that very old and persistent tradition of the body

1027
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,400
and its relationship to poetry.

1028
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,240
Well, the meter is dance steps.

1029
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,240
Exactly.

1030
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:14,520
And that's the fundamental aspect of the sound of poetry is meter in some way.

1031
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:19,760
Or the notion of plowing a field, right?

1032
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,960
The work of the body in the field, going along the lines.

1033
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:32,920
So it's just an idea.

1034
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,760
I also think of singing, the mother singing to the baby.

1035
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:37,760
Oh, yeah.

1036
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,160
That's a very fundamental kind of poetry, whatever's going on, I think.

1037
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:43,160
Excuse me though.

1038
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,160
You go ahead.

1039
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:47,760
I just want to weigh in on that.

1040
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,080
I think the poem has a life of its own.

1041
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,080
Okay.

1042
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,680
Patrick, two questions.

1043
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:02,440
Is it fair to ask you the Tagalog word for suddenly seized by affection?

1044
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:07,120
Yes, Tagalog word for suddenly seized by affection is gigal.

1045
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,120
Spell it.

1046
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,120
G-I-G-I-L.

1047
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,720
Gigal.

1048
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:16,120
And pronounce the second syllable, emphasize?

1049
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:18,200
That's the first gigal.

1050
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,000
No, it's the first syllable.

1051
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Gigal.

1052
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Gigal.

1053
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Yeah.

1054
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Yeah.

1055
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,480
So if you see, I just saw a video of my god daughter last night.

1056
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:33,520
And so I felt a gigal towards her and she's Nakaka Gigal.

1057
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,640
But the L isn't pronounced like an L in English, right?

1058
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,640
It's close.

1059
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,640
It's close.

1060
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:42,400
There might be a slightly different, yeah?

1061
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,400
Okay.

1062
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:51,800
The other question for you is when you read that poem, how to make a poem blaze.

1063
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,800
I love this line.

1064
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:54,800
Still it.

1065
01:20:54,800 --> 01:21:05,360
When a bad dog, when bad dogs break chains to want you, bite back?

1066
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:09,320
When mad dogs break chains to chase you charge back.

1067
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,080
To change, okay.

1068
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,480
I love, I just revise it.

1069
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,480
That's pretty good, not one hearing.

1070
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,480
Bite back.

1071
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,080
I wrote bite back.

1072
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,080
Yeah.

1073
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,080
Okay, good.

1074
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,000
So we'll use that.

1075
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,360
And I can always look that up to sighted great.

1076
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:34,000
Jean, I was very moved by our meeting when I spoke to you about having been studied with

1077
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,840
Marie Ponceau.

1078
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,120
And you said, I'm not worthy.

1079
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,120
You did that gesture.

1080
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,120
I'm not worthy.

1081
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,320
We were so pleased.

1082
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,920
And then I said, I'll give her your regards.

1083
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:49,640
And after I said that, I thought, well, when in hell am I going to see Marie?

1084
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:58,400
And then you said to me, she's right behind you.

1085
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:02,080
So that was really a great moment for me.

1086
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,520
Chekov is somebody I've been studying.

1087
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:09,320
I mentioned to Marie, I'm studying with Professor Tom Bird, who's a doll.

1088
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,480
He's been at Queen's College.

1089
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:17,520
I think since the 1950s, long time, and still teaching.

1090
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,160
And we studied short stories of Chekov.

1091
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:26,520
So I remember there was a short story, they had a fairy boat.

1092
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,920
Do you happen to remember the story?

1093
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:29,920
What is that?

1094
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:30,920
Easter Eve.

1095
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:31,920
Easter Eve.

1096
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,920
May I have lost my mind.

1097
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:34,920
It's called Easter Eve.

1098
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:35,920
Easter Eve.

1099
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:36,920
Great.

1100
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:37,920
Thank you so much.

1101
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,920
Wonderful story.

1102
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,920
Anyone else want to thank the comment or ask a good question?

1103
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:52,920
That's for the obvious.

1104
01:22:52,920 --> 01:23:06,240
Gina, if you could, I'd like to ask you to talk a little bit about how your work might

1105
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:17,360
have evolved in a way that in Lucy, for example, you have these very small intersections of

1106
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:24,640
awareness that the speaker of the poem that you have of a moment of a relationship with

1107
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,880
Lucy.

1108
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:29,320
And they're so simple.

1109
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:37,320
And yet in that simplicity, you find such poignancy that I wondered if that type of a

1110
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:45,040
trained eye was something that you found over the course of your writing career, an ability

1111
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:53,400
to distill or find the more critical essential bits and pieces and pair away more of the

1112
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,800
unimportant parts of a poem.

1113
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:04,280
In other words, do you define that your work became sparrow more essential if that's clear

1114
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,920
or is it poem by poem maybe different?

1115
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:15,320
Does that make sense?

1116
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:25,720
I think I started out more sort of saying everything in a more grammatical way than I

1117
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,720
do now.

1118
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:35,800
And I've noticed over the years I take more out, you know, I might write a lot and take

1119
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:42,840
a lot of it out and ask my friends, you know, if it still makes sense.

1120
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:46,240
But that's more a way I work now.

1121
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:52,560
And I've also come to love sequences because I might write something and it doesn't amount

1122
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:57,040
too much, but then if I put twelve of them together, it might, you know, so that's something

1123
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,960
I came to later.

1124
01:24:58,960 --> 01:24:59,960
Yeah.

1125
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:04,000
But I'm not so big on sense as I used to be.

1126
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:12,760
And I think it was really being able to be with other poets and read more also.

1127
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,880
And boredom, boredom can be your friend.

1128
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:22,480
You know, if you just are writing something that you've written before or you've seen

1129
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:26,120
written before, you might not have any interest in it.

1130
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:32,760
So you might go somewhere else, you know, even if it's what you feel.

1131
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,520
But it doesn't have any life for you.

1132
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:37,400
Do you know what I'm saying?

1133
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:41,760
It's not that it isn't true, but it isn't alive for you anymore.

1134
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:48,000
And so I don't mean just to put something in a new way for newness's sake.

1135
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:54,160
That's another thing I would try out to do because that's boring too.

1136
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:57,680
But it can be when I try it sometimes.

1137
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:04,080
Just to kind of feel your way and see how much you really need, you know.

1138
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:08,720
And then I couldn't live without my poet friends because then I asked them, you know, do you

1139
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:12,920
think this is there or not, you know?

1140
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:13,920
Okay.

1141
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:14,920
Thanks.

1142
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,920
Is that kind of answer?

1143
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,400
Yes, very much.

1144
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:25,160
Also if I could just add, they did do a study, I don't know if it cost 75 million, but once

1145
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:29,920
you've been in the woods for three hours, your body physically changes chemically.

1146
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,840
So I'm sure the same would be true of reading poetry.

1147
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:39,120
Yeah, that's great to know.

1148
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,520
Wow.

1149
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,800
Please.

1150
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:49,120
I don't like these things, microphones.

1151
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,720
But I love your presentation.

1152
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:58,400
And it's really an honor to be here and hear you both talk about writing poetry and reading

1153
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,840
so much poetry.

1154
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,360
It was wonderful.

1155
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:10,040
And I agree when I've only been writing poetry for about seven years and, you know, like

1156
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:13,400
not full time, but a lot.

1157
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:19,800
And when I write, I feel the same thing with the spirit and the soul, you know, that is

1158
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:26,120
there that was in your Lucy poem and in your dog poem.

1159
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:31,280
And, you know, I mean, it's just, it's wonderful.

1160
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,080
It's wonderful getting out of the body.

1161
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,480
I don't know what it is.

1162
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:40,640
It's supposedly like other artists tell me that that happens when they paint a painting

1163
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:45,880
or whatever, you know, they're, I don't know because I can't do anything else.

1164
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,480
You know, I can walk.

1165
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:48,800
And my spirit.

1166
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:56,040
I feel, you know, my soul is happy when I'm walking, but it's not like, you know, I don't

1167
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:01,880
know that nitty gritty, you know, deep down soul changing.

1168
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:04,880
And it comes out on the page, which is so exciting.

1169
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,200
And I don't know what's going to come out on the page, you know.

1170
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,720
And that is, that's the thrill, you know.

1171
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,880
I wish I could do more.

1172
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:18,640
But thanks for giving me the idea of the sequence thing because I never did that.

1173
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,560
And I think I might try that.

1174
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:25,880
That Lucy is so wonderful the way you brought her to life, you know.

1175
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:30,120
When you read the first piece, I said, oh no, you know.

1176
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:35,640
But as you went on to each other piece, I said, oh, this lady has something going.

1177
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,640
Yeah.

1178
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:37,640
Thank you.

1179
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:41,680
You know, it's interesting because if you read other sequences that can get you kind

1180
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:45,760
of maybe towards it.

1181
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:49,520
I was reading The Orpheus Sonnets when I was writing Lucy.

1182
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,280
And I didn't sit down to do that.

1183
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:53,800
It just happened.

1184
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:59,600
But I think it's like, you know, it can help you.

1185
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:05,640
If you read other people's sequences, whatever you're looking for, you know.

1186
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,560
It seems like you were saying about Whitman too.

1187
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,600
It can help you out.

1188
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,320
Not being directly imitative in any way, you know.

1189
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,840
But just like soul to soul.

1190
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:19,840
Yeah.

1191
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,000
Who's your wife in the game?

1192
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
We are.

1193
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
We are.

1194
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Which one are you?

1195
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,400
I'll be you.

1196
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,600
Okay.

1197
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:38,880
No, it's so much fun because we didn't get the chance to do this before.

1198
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,400
I've admired you from that part of the room.

1199
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,320
It's so much fun to do this.

1200
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,920
Thank you, David, for asking us to read together.

1201
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,800
Well, I'm very glad we're coming in a real pleasure.

1202
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,920
I'm sure for everyone.

1203
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,480
So our time is up.

1204
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,320
So we'll stop for this afternoon.

1205
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:59,240
And we'll do something like this in the fall.

1206
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,240
Excellent.

1207
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,240
Thank you.

1208
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,240
Thank you.

1209
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:12,040
I've got to stop right now, let me go.

1210
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,040
Thank you.

1211
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,040
Thank you.

1212
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,040
Thank you.

1213
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,040
Thank you.

1214
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,040
Thank you.

1215
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:25,040
Thank you.

1216
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:55,040
Thank you.
