1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I want to first start by thanking all the participants for this roundtable, some of whom have come from far away.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And I very much appreciate their willingness to come and participate in these two and a half day event.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I also want to thank the Helix Executive Board that has been involved with the planning and the Associate Director of the Centre, Robert Penzev.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Finally, I want to thank Julia Bontain, who has been instrumental in first having the idea of this roundtable and then being extremely active in organizing it.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It has allowed for a very seamless relationship between the two organizations and I'm very thankful to her.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I will now pass the mic to her. Thank you.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you, Ed.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
As Ed mentioned, this has been an amazing collaboration between the Centre and the Helix Centre.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
My name is Julia Bontain. I'm the Founding Director of the Centre and I'm so thrilled that you can all be here tonight to join us in this conference of conversation.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We have digital attendees as well, so welcome if you hear us on the live stream.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Tonight we're going to be talking for the rest of the weekend about art, science, culture, education, technology and our collective futures.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So I had the idea for this weekend about a year and a half ago after attending a conference where all the discussion was very wonderful, but there was very little time for kind of free, spontaneous conversation.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So what we're going to do here this weekend is a little bit different than your typical conference as you may have gathered.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:19,000
With the goal of evolving a collective conversation over the course of three days, we are cutting out prescripted presentations entirely and we've invited 36 innovative leaders in the art, science, technology and education realms to share their current work, talk about the problems they're facing,

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:33,000
solutions they may have come up with to common problems, talk about issues big and small, talk about where we are and where we want to be, not only in the worlds of art and science, but at the points where they converge.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So importantly, and I want to emphasize this from the start, the interaction between art and science and technology in our culture, industry and education is well established.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We're not here to justify that interaction. I think it speaks for itself.

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Rather, we're going to, over the course of six round table discussions on three central topics, be talking about questions like what are the potentials of science art collaboration beyond art about science?

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How do we build models for education in the 21st century?

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
How do we repair and build upon the multi-directional relationship between art, science and society?

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So I'm so grateful to have found the perfect partner for this type of conversation, the Helix Center.

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The Helix Center's motto encourages us to engage in an unhurried search for wisdom, and I think it's high time guided by wisdom to really evolve these conversations that we're going to have to the next level.

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So I hope you enjoy this evening and join us for the rest of the weekend.

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We will now, we have invited up our round table participants, they're already there, and I will introduce them to you all.

25
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But yes, thank you for being here. Okay.

26
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And please raise your hand when I say your name so everyone can know who you are.

27
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We have Mark Rosen, who is a professor of physics at Porett, and he's also the director of Gorilla Science.

28
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Shane Mayak is the director of the Lago Project.

29
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Tyler Voke is a professor of biology and environmental studies at NYU and is also an author.

30
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Noah Hutton is the director of the Beautiful Brain and is also a filmmaker.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Jamie McCray is a conservation scientist and a dancer.

32
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And Monica Iello is the co-founder of Eureka's and also an artist.

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So this first panel, as you guys know from your handout, is all about science art collaboration.

34
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So we're just going to jump in here with some questions about what is the nature of art science collaboration,

35
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
who's the owner of a collaborative project.

36
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Does art need to influence science as science influences art?

37
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Those are the questions.

38
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So you're going to answer them all of us now.

39
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, well do you each take turns and you know, oh jeez I feel like the place where I always like to start asking these.

40
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
These are really big questions, but I am curious to hear from all of y'all.

41
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What isn't good in collaboration?

42
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think starting from a place of like criticizing what can go wrong from a collaboration,

43
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
because I've been into too many events like this and I've seen too many collaborations happen

44
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
where it almost seems like when a science and an artist come together,

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
magically we receive less than the sum of the parts somehow.

46
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Both things get diluted and I'm being negative to start here, but yeah, but like both things get diluted,

47
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the scientist ends up feeling like they have to dumb down their work to reach somewhere in the muddy middle,

48
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and the artist feels like they have to give a sketchbook account of the science

49
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
or somehow just given aesthetic rendition of scientific objects.

50
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And as a result I'm not sure what's added. I'm always interested in interdisciplinary that ends up feeling like it's more than the sum of its parts,

51
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and I just wonder if you guys feel the same, or if you've seen anything, if you've seen what I'm describing happen,

52
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
where there's a diluting process to this kind of muddy middle ground.

53
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well I think that happens to some degree in any interdisciplinary collaboration.

54
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you.

55
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't know what to do about that.

56
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why?

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Is my mic not on?

58
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There again.

59
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay, so what I was saying is I think that can happen in any interdisciplinary collaboration,

60
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and I think part of the problem is a lack of resources to a lot of what we're doing that makes some of the work

61
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:29,000
difficult to sustain, and even begin to some degree, even though a lot of us are trying to begin it.

62
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Does that make any sense?

63
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So you're saying lack of funding creates an environment where it's tough to even get going to a rich level.

64
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah.

65
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah.

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't think you need funding to create a rich collaboration.

67
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I really like the term transdisciplinary, because with that it's not,

68
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
hey I'm going to bring my art and you're going to bring your science and we're going to walk along to parallel paths

69
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
together for some time and then we're going to split up.

70
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But where we're going to work together and build a collaboration.

71
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So how and why are you going to do that?

72
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Because of the grand scheme of things.

73
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The questions that we're trying to answer now are so large that one discipline can't handle it.

74
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No, absolutely.

75
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Right.

76
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So that's why we're going to, that's why we want to collaborate together.

77
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So now we're going to have to take time to build relationships.

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And you know that, I mean time is a resource that can be short, but it's not necessarily a resource that you always need a grant for.

79
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So if you have trust, if you have a scientist sharing their process and their knowledge and an artist sharing their process and their knowledge.

80
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So one is not more than the other.

81
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I feel like you can create a space where both of them are creating something wholly new that you wouldn't be able to get alone.

82
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, I agree with all of those things. But I do think it's a bit idealistic.

83
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Not, and I don't want to focus this whole discussion on funding because I think that would not be beneficial.

84
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But that in the grand scheme of priorities that all of us in this room have, it's very, very difficult to support rich, meaningful work without having a financial structure to do so.

85
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, I would agree with that. I wouldn't, I would frame it slightly differently and say that.

86
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's probably useful, thank you.

87
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I would say that the incentive structure is such that in science there is a wealth of funding and there is a professionalization of sharing your work.

88
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It is part of your formal duties as a scientist to disseminate your work into the wider community where the people actually do that in practice or not is by the by.

89
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Whereas for artists as a kind of early or mid-career artist, there isn't a formal infrastructure that will pay you to do that work.

90
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And so when the norms of the scientific community are brought into an artistic realm and people ask you to as an artist do things for free because it's assumed it's part of your professional work, then it's, there's an inequity in that situation.

91
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And so there's a disincentive for the artist to, I guess, to contribute at the same level as the scientist.

92
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And that is fundamentally, I think, tied to funding and kind of the resources that are tied with those professions.

93
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And there's, can I keep speaking or am I monopolizing?

94
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So I think that's true. I think like there's an inequity in resources and that creates an incentive structure that's imbalanced.

95
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And so I really like the term incentivization too. I think that's like an excellent way to put it.

96
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So I think that you'll find because of that financial incentive structure, there are artists that need money and they are going to basically be chasing money.

97
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:01,000
They may, in the worst case scenario, they may be known as referring to you, they may try and retrofit their work to access a pot of science funding to allow them to do a project they want to, in a worst case scenario.

98
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Does that make sense? I'm seeing blank faces.

99
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But it's also a problem on the science side, right? Where there isn't any or very little incentivization in academia in science to be part of these sorts of things.

100
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You don't get any, if you're trying to get to the next level in academia, you don't get points for working with an artist.

101
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You don't. So it's not part of the incentivization structure.

102
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But I feel like we're trying to fix that. And NSF, broader impacts, right? There's, there are line items in grants that you can use.

103
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Now you need to use them creatively. But that can be a way for you to have those broader impacts and that is a structure that has been set up.

104
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That we can make use of now.

105
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Or like, let's, how do we do this creatively? How do I not say my broader impacts that I'm going to, you know, give a talk to some school children again?

106
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And have that be the way that I'm disseminating the information?

107
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So, let me bring up an example because Noah was asking something about difficulties in collaboration and the funding.

108
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So, so something that really struck me and maybe it relates to a lot of the audience.

109
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If you saw El Gore's original movie, the original movie, not the newest one, but the, the inconvenient truth.

110
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:48,000
A lot of people saw that. So that really struck me. I'm scientist, do work on climate and the carbon cycle primarily,

111
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:58,000
but I'm interested in levels of organization and pattern formation on different scales and I, I, I love art and working with artists when I can.

112
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But that particular movie was very popular, you know, and it, it, it had, it struck, it changed, you know, got people waking up to issues about global warming.

113
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't think they covered the carbon cycle quite as well as I would have liked.

114
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Not how you would have done it.

115
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Of course it is.

116
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But, but it really struck me that there was a collaboration, you know, if we include filmmaking as art as the artist, right?

117
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And it struck me, so okay with that.

118
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And it struck me that, you know, Gore had this power point that he was going around and giving talks with and he had developed over a series of time.

119
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But how much more powerful that was when the artists, when the professional filmmakers came in and, and thought about scripting that in a certain kind of way.

120
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And it still had a certain Al Gore on stage with his power point, a little bit aspect of it, but then he had all these other things that were coming in that were, I just, I just was really blown away at the skillfulness of the artists that were coming

121
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
onto that situation in which, and where the science was probably no more detailed than it had been.

122
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I mean, I'm sure there were some changes.

123
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't know what the original power point was.

124
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But that really struck me as a great example of the kind of communication that could happen to millions where the scientist is going to, you know, if I write books and they sell them to thousands, let's say, right?

125
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's not reaching, you know, the millions that I think are needed to be reached with the problems, with the global problems that are going on.

126
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And the amount of ignorance in the United States scientifically that happens, the amount that needs to be changed is so vast.

127
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So to me, that kind of thing, the Gore film as an example is important.

128
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And there's been a lot of environmental films now about fish, about ice, about, I mean, it's almost like a genre that's coming out as a result.

129
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So I'm just putting that out as an example of something that struck me as particularly powerful instance of success.

130
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Good. That's a positive example.

131
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So I don't know what, I guess, I guess, how can more of that happen, how can the funding for more of that happen?

132
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Right.

133
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah.

134
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I mean, I think, I'm going to just be really brief because you're here.

135
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But I don't think that any of this should be taken as negative.

136
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I think that particularly a group like this should be thinking about the barriers.

137
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And I think one barrier is how do you get people to be really invested in these collaborations?

138
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's a huge barrier.

139
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And if we don't think about it, everybody in this room, we're not doing our jobs.

140
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Why would you agree with that too? Because I have to say, just being invited to do something like this is so exciting because when we started doing art and science,

141
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
programming, artwork, engagement activities 15 years ago, people's eyes would glass over.

142
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:17,000
They would ask us why? And we spent most of our early part of our careers just convincing people of the relevancy of this conversation.

143
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So assuming that most people in this room are interested in the topic, then I do think bringing up challenges and the nitty gritty is a real key aspect.

144
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I will say from the artist's perspective, artists are really used to doing things for no money.

145
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Like we put in all of our sweat equity and our capital up front and artists that are working with scientists, you know, go out there and try to find a scientist that's going to like give us their time so we can ask the crazy questions and come up with things.

146
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And then a lot of times the economic reward comes at the end whether you're selling a piece of artwork or doing an exhibition or for us kind of distilling that into a public engagement forum.

147
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But what I find to be the most challenging from my standpoint is institutional barriers.

148
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Working with institutions, whether it's art museums, science museums, libraries, schools that don't yet have that framework in place to foster the collaboration.

149
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Or fund it in a way that really makes sense.

150
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So you're really largely depending on other people that really have similar objectives and goals in life to give their good will.

151
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And not to switch this up too much, but I did want to speak to your point about transdisciplinary because that's definitely a word that is very much the language we're trying to foster because I think that is really the point of what you bring up

152
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:50,000
when the sum of the parts are greater than it's actually transdisciplinary, you're creating something new out of that experience.

153
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah, I totally agree.

154
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And, Chan, I just wanted to respond to what you said because I do agree that barriers are everywhere and they're institutional and they're funding, of course.

155
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But I just think that we are at a place now in this conversation where we can actually maybe say that there's some good collaborations and bad collaborations because I think we can get more, we can have more barriers lifted if we articulate better what this is all about, like what the hell are we doing with transdisciplinary projects.

156
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What can we, is it about awareness, like is it making products like maybe they're all good.

157
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I mean, I mean, maybe they're all good.

158
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I disagree.

159
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
They're not all good.

160
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll give it to the goal is.

161
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It depends on what the goal is.

162
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I agree.

163
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I totally.

164
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So I think maybe we should talk about goals a little bit of what, why do a collaboration?

165
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What's the utmost goal?

166
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I think Tyler brings up great.

167
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Well, in that example, right, the artist comes in as the guide to the communication, as the one that's going to translate the visuals into public communication in a meaningful way or a way that's acceptable to the human brain that sort of fits our receptivity.

168
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But there'd be another aspect of something Julia was asking about the mind of the artist, you know, that might have different ideas about something totally.

169
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And that, I don't know if that's a different avenue to this transdisciplinary.

170
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't, what do you mean by transdisciplinary?

171
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm okay with the term.

172
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm curious.

173
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I think lots of people have that question.

174
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Wait, you brought it up.

175
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I brought it up and I think your definition was very, very succinct.

176
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I looked it up today.

177
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Wait, so what was your definition?

178
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Okay, so I looked at transdisciplinary and or disciplinary, multidisciplinary.

179
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And of course, there's argument on what all this means.

180
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But transdisciplinary is supposed to be about transcending discipline.

181
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And so that when you have people coming from disciplines together, you're creating something that's new, as opposed to just fusing disciplines or somebody being a scientist and me being an artist and us using our individual practice together.

182
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
We're actually trying to create something that hasn't existed out of that mix.

183
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Right.

184
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And I think a good piece of that.

185
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And I think that's a fantastic, as part of that.

186
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And not having within it that hierarchy that we've been talking about where, you know, we're had the sciences is bringing the artist to come, you know, and help with the science, but.

187
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's the communication.

188
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Right, and I mean, that is a part of it.

189
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:56,000
As an artist, as well as a scientist, as an artist, you are, I look for something to base my work on.

190
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You know, I think both disciplines at their heart are looking to express a truth of the universe.

191
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You know, what is, how are we describing things?

192
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What is, you know, how can we distill it?

193
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And some of the questioning happens in different ways, but if you are like, okay, we're working towards this thing together, how can we meld our disciplines in transdisciplinary manner?

194
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
To get at the truth of the universe.

195
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So I feel like that's what a lot of scientific questions are asking.

196
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Right, we want to explain the world that we live in.

197
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Right, a specific truth.

198
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah, so a specific truth in science frames those with hypotheses.

199
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And artists have a little different language, but they're both modes of questioning what's happening.

200
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And so I think you can have those really work well together.

201
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
May I make what I think is an empirical observation about like the landscape?

202
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And that observation is that the majority of the work that I'm familiar with at this interface is from the scientific institution's perspective about building science literacy.

203
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So the example you gave, the justification for that is building science literacy in the general public.

204
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Please, you don't understand the functions there.

205
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's how the NSF justifies funding the projects it's funded.

206
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's about building science literacy from the scientists, scientific institutions they call it.

207
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's not searching for truths in the kind of scientific questioning sense.

208
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And from where I sit, that is a much smaller piece of this intersection.

209
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And I think we're going to hear a bit about it tomorrow, like where scientific research meets artistic practice.

210
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But I think the main part of what I'm familiar with is not about those questions.

211
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's about kind of some outcome in the broader public.

212
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So my question kind of for the more practicing artists is what is the artistic institutional motivation for doing something like creating a nice movie that's trying to tell a scientific literacy story?

213
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Or you know, like your work, no, I like.

214
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:26,000
What is it that you get out of it when the brain institute might be getting something about the public understanding the brain?

215
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Does that make sense?

216
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah, absolutely.

217
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Because you're saying my goals might be different than theirs.

218
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah.

219
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But yeah, I mean, I'm not going to assume artistic goals are about building scientific literacy in the general public.

220
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
They might be, but I don't assume it's not.

221
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So are those your goals?

222
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
No.

223
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
They're part of my goal.

224
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Part of your goals.

225
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

226
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But not entirely otherwise I would just be making promotional videos for the institute.

227
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So I assume a role, which is I think a little different, which is I play the role of this outside independent critic who comes in to film interviews and ask questions that they wouldn't be asked in promotional video shoots.

228
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And then I go and I ask other projects, similar questions to get them talking to each other.

229
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And then I try to construct a film out of that that arrives at a truth that is mitigated by my own subjective approach to the story.

230
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's not inconvenient truth because I'm not trying to get the word out there about this press.

231
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'm actually just trying to show a side of science that doesn't usually get shown because I believe that a lot of the projects that I've been in,

232
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:55,000
shooting with for my film, for example, have, I feel an ethos that has had gradually shifted more towards Silicon Valley than the kind of like original,

233
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:14,000
call, neuroscientists, let's say. There's kind of this ethos that in the projects that I follow that is super technocratic is believing that computers are the end all be all for understanding the brain and that simulations will soon reveal the truths on super computers.

234
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Anyway, that, all those murky issues aside, I just feel like we're giving a free pass too often in mainstream culture to science when in fact,

235
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,000
there's been great criticism of Silicon Valley recently. I just like some of the same criticism applied for some aspects of present day science.

236
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And I just worry that there's a pervading ethos of science is cool and great and we just need to parse that a little bit because there is kind of scientific,

237
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
the scientific question in the beginning, the origin story of science is good. There's so much good science going on.

238
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But there's also science that's serving other aims in this world. You know, I just want to mention very quickly, there was a conference that Julian and I were at,

239
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:09,000
and there was a presentation by someone from a large arts body in Europe that had just done a collaboration with a drone technology maker.

240
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And one of the outputs of this was a big display over a town square in Europe set to music. And then I also saw in their slides that they were also doing Pepsi logos over the Super Bowl and stuff with the drones.

241
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And I just thought like this is interesting because this is being built as a really, as a great technological collaboration, scientific collaboration.

242
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:46,000
At the very same moment, it's being just served right into this corporate advertising culture. And so these are the things I want to parse a little bit about collaboration because there are many aims.

243
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So this would be another one. If I'm trying, I would tend to start looking for types of, a typology of collaboration, right? Maybe this is sort of too specific.

244
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That's good. That's good of you though. But it's good to do this. Okay. They don't know. They've been an entire field of research.

245
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Can I ask a question? I'm kind of a concrete person. And so I would be interested in hearing from you guys of giving like an analogy of a collaboration that you have done within the arts and sciences that maybe was successful or had value, but kind of epitomized what your role or your goals are with the type of work that you do.

246
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:38,000
So that we have something to kind of ground maybe our conversation. Because what he just described, I would do, I would class as a, the art, the artist as a critic almost.

247
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Great, great. So rather than a communication in the Al Gore film, now it's artists as a critic.

248
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So that's number of being, that's our second. Yeah. But I think they're connected. And of course this is all how we individually define what collaboration is or what we're doing.

249
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But I would have never viewed it as a promotional thing. In fact, I think that's what we want to get away from. Because the PR arms of all the academic institutions, I mean, they're fine.

250
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But of course they're serving a purpose. Like we want a critical eye. We want a secondary view, particularly from someone who can create a narrative that we as scientists.

251
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Aren't that good at creating? I mean, it's absolutely not about being a promotional video or promotional arm.

252
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But I think if I can just segue into your question, I mean, I think what for LIGO project. So in case interview are confused, I'm a scientist by training.

253
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And I work at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center during the day. But then I also started a nonprofit that's interested in connecting science art and community.

254
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And so in that work, in terms of collaborations that we've had with artists and scientists, I think the ones that have been the most successful, if you will, are those that have focused on the process of science.

255
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And what science means, what science does, what is the process, what does the scientific method mean, how does one start from a question and get to an answer?

256
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I think those have been the most successful. I would still argue that we've also had a lot of collaborations that have resulted in pictures of beakers.

257
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And I mean, I would honestly argue if your goal is to communicate something to the public about what science is and what science does, there's some of the public that doesn't ever see a beaker.

258
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And maybe that's interesting and informative in some way. And that though in a way where the judge and the jury maybe we're not, we shouldn't be the judge of the jury.

259
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And that we have to be sort of open even within our own work and our own collaborations to what the results of that ends up being.

260
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It seems like you're doing some really cool work with those residency programs that I was looking at the website.

261
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And what I loved most about it is it seemed like you're giving that space, that enriching space for the collaboration.

262
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But there's also that practicality aspect too of you need this format, you need funding, you need space, exhibition, opportunity, whatever, so that it's a fully thought out collaboration, engagement and community outreach scenario.

263
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah, absolutely.

264
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Mark, I have a question for you. Gorilla Science is such like on the ground level of this stuff, you're like in the streets with collaborations.

265
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Literally.

266
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So we're asking for a concrete example. I don't necessarily have one because I just described what I do and I don't think it's a good example to give really.

267
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Although I think I collaborate in some way. But my question for you is, what's the goal, what's the most goal of Gorilla Science?

268
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:31,000
What's the best thing that you've seen happen? And what is the question of like, you know, meaning convenient truth example, which was a great example.

269
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But what's your example of something that's happened that's great?

270
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:49,000
There's a project I really like called the Intergalactic Travel Bureau, which is part theatrical production and part exploration of kind of techno-optimistic space science.

271
00:32:49,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So the project, it's a pop-up travel agency and we've worked with Shoshama Elohd to take over spaces in the fashion district in New York.

272
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And we take over a shop and we set up what looks like a retro-futuristic travel agency, where you, you know, I think most of us are old enough to have remembered to go to a physical place to buy a ticket somewhere.

273
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So the aesthetic is kind of think Jetsons meets Mad Men.

274
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So you go into this place as a person off the street and it looks like a travel agency. You interact with a travel agent and you'll have a dialogue which will kind of know what kind of vacations do you like.

275
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It's scuba diving. Okay, scuba diving, great. So, you know, you might be interested in buying a package to go to like I.O.

276
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's a great destination, got lots of like liquid material to go scuba diving, you know, you'll die of hypothermia, but you know, whatever.

277
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It's a little much softer.

278
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But so is this kind of this world building around future space travel, but it's very heavily drawing on interactive theatre and like the dramatization and using scientists kind of part of the story world.

279
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So kind of almost science fiction and it involves directly both like theatrical elements and actors and life scientists who play the role of these travel agents.

280
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So that's a really good project. It's got like it ticks a lot of boxes. It's like really creative. It's open ended.

281
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Like there's a lot of respect given to both the theatrical elements of it as well as the like scientific and scientific integrity is key.

282
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Like it doesn't work if you get your facts wrong. It doesn't work if you're not like respecting the fact that speed equals distance over time and that's how long it takes to get to and from.

283
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So that's a really good project. I like that one a lot.

284
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And I think it's got a really good element in it, which is like it's very democratizing.

285
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Like it's accessible to all. It's free. It shows the relevance of science to everyone's life. Like everyone can imagine taking a vacation.

286
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Like even if no one's ever going to be able to afford to take an Elon Musk shuttle to the moon, like it's easily identifiable.

287
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And so I think like in the way that like part of the power of art is to like inspire people and to see relevance to their lives, it does that quite well.

288
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And what was the process behind the collaboration? So was there a structure that you guys came up with for how the science and artists work together?

289
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Yeah. So Gorilla Science, kind of the structure of the organization is kind of semi curatorial.

290
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:52,000
There's like a core team of about 10 people and a lot of us come from like museum backgrounds or I'm trying to remember what is called in the UK.

291
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But it basically like exhibit development backgrounds. And we often come up with like a core idea and then bring together these other people from like a scientific discipline or an artistic discipline and have them kind of flesh out and explore that story world.

292
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But it's definitely like a guided process. It's not just like a free and we just ran a 20 person eight week residency program where we didn't provide much structure and we just tried to pair people and gave them resources.

293
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And that the outputs of that were not as from the public's perspective as successful.

294
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So it's a guided process. What are the things that you feel like you need to make sure happen for a fruitful collaboration?

295
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So we're writing a guide to that. Come back in two years time and I will tell you.

296
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
One takeaway.

297
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The Cliff Knoll version.

298
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Actually there's a reference. I don't know, Julia, if I send you a link can you tweet it?

299
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We've written a conference proceedings about this that I'm happy for Julia to share.

300
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So I guess Julia will tweet out some of like there were 10 key lessons for how to do the kind of collaborations.

301
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I think the one that was that stuck best was advice for a collaboration is don't try and force it.

302
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Like everyone needs to be want to be in it.

303
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Like if you've got a pot of money and you're a science institution don't like insist you have to spend that money

304
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and like get an artist and try and shoehorn them into what you want to do.

305
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And if you're an artist and you desperately want to do your project, don't just look around for any pot of money

306
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
that will let you do your project because you might upset the people who fund you if they're a scientist.

307
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So that was the one that stuck most in my mind.

308
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Let's start with a core idea such as this intergalactic travel agency.

309
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Would these an organizing idea or?

310
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yeah, there's a theme that guides it.

311
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I don't know a ton about how science gallery works, but I think they also work off themes and then there's an open call and it works off that.

312
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But so what's the feeling you want people to like what is the thing you want people to walk out of there?

313
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
What's the best possible result?

314
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
For someone because you also mentioned that the other project didn't go so well from the general public's point of view.

315
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I would curious to hear why if you can, but the start with like what took the intergalactic travel agency.

316
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Someone walking out of there.

317
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Is it like a young audience to get into a career later on or is it could be for any age and what do you want them to feel?

318
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So I'll answer this, but then I'm going to stop it because I feel I'm dominating.

319
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But so our vision is like to make science for the people.

320
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So it's like a democratization of science.

321
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's going back to like there's like an enlightenment ideal that like asking questions in the way that science does is a good in of itself irrespective of the answer.

322
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So it's not like techno optimism.

323
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Like you're just critical of the world in a like really good rationalist way.

324
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So that's kind of the vision in terms of the kind of science literacy building elements.

325
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It is not about like building work capacity.

326
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Like there's no economic justification from what we do. It's like very much about the value that science brings as an element of culture.

327
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You know in the same ways you want people reading the great works of literature.

328
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You know people should understand that space is varied and interesting.

329
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's about what are the four strands of science literacy.

330
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Economic development, cultural development, empowerment.

331
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It's very important for people to feel empowered in their lives to make the best decisions for them in their community.

332
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So I think these are the kind of things that matter to me.

333
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And I'm please trying to give up the floor.

334
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Well I will take it.

335
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I wanted to talk about the superhero clubhouse.

336
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It is an organization of theater artists and scientists that I worked very closely with.

337
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I came upon them through the magic of Google because I was looking for a space that provided some structure for collaboration over relatively long time.

338
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
That was focused on asking environmental questions.

339
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So they have a science and stage fellowship open call.

340
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We want you guys to come up with a theater piece about climate change.

341
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Now climate change is huge and we all know the discussions that usually happen around climate change.

342
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
They are more like these are the facts.

343
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
No you are lying.

344
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And it's not fruitful.

345
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So the idea behind superhero clubhouse is to put on performances that have people ask questions.

346
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So it's not didactic but it is science based.

347
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And in the fellowship three theater artists, three scientists, four months.

348
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And the structure of the program is basically based on models for building good collaboration.

349
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So forming, storming, norming and performing if you've heard of that is the model.

350
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So you come together and you spend time together.

351
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You build relationships.

352
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The scientists, like I gave a talk about my research on sea turtle lighting laws and other people talk about their research with genetics and genetically modified crops.

353
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Artists also gave workshops.

354
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So we are learning about each other's disciplines and we are creating some common language.

355
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And so once you have that common language and your friends with people you can then start to build something together.

356
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And lots of brainstorming.

357
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
What part of climate change are we going to talk about?

358
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And we ended up 30 minute theater piece.

359
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:07,000
We've got, you know, there are songs about climate change in there and the video will be tomorrow if you guys want to check out some of that.

360
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But in that we've got a piece that has a narrative but is also grounded in science.

361
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So what does the world that we're building look like?

362
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Like you were saying and having that be true to the facts that we have come up with through scientific research.

363
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But also having a good artistic value as well.

364
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But the process, you know, it takes a lot of face time, I think.

365
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And so I really think that the superhero club house is a space that allows people to come together.

366
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And you want to come out with something but what that thing looks like isn't super specified.

367
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It's like, you know, we, I guess we could have done a mind piece or something.

368
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
You know, what it is is could be different for a different group.

369
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:28,000
But having activities that allow you to form a collaboration with another person is something that I think is really, really important.

370
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I also, I would also really love to see that space become more normal.

371
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Do you know what I mean? So there are more pockets of, okay, let's work together over a long term and let me try and understand what your artistic perspective is.

372
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah, I think people can be so siloed.

373
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Exactly.

374
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And it sounds like you're really, you're like, you want to create a community center almost that can go anywhere.

375
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And I think that's what good, effective collaborations are. There is micro, micro communities.

376
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Shane, a question for you.

377
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Yes.

378
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You ran this pretty hip conference space in between, new school this year.

379
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
What, part of what you did with that was you kind of asked for policy out.

380
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
You asked for outputs, takeaways from these working groups.

381
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
What was your thinking with constructing it that way?

382
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
As an output, why did you want to do it? And what's come of it maybe since then if there's been any reverberations?

383
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yes. So I mean, my thinking in doing that is because I think it's really important as this conference does for those of us working in this space in between as I refer to it.

384
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Or many of us have referred to it to kind of come together and talk about what we're all doing as individual organizations or practitioners.

385
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:19,000
How we can more effectively work together, especially those of us working in New York City, but even beyond that, I just think there's such a big group of us in New York City who are doing things that sound and look alike.

386
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:40,000
That my thinking was that we could potentially be a much more powerful voice if we came together and work together more effectively while still keeping our own individual practices, whatever those are.

387
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And so that was the idea. I think what's happened since then is I hope it's spawned a lot of other ideas for bringing this community together more often.

388
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:14,000
There was afterwards a push to kind of form a coalition called a space in between, which Daniel Cone who's here somewhere spearheaded and exists kind of as a platform.

389
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And they continue to meet?

390
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:43,000
We were all continuing to meet for a while, and I think we're I anyway, I'm open to continuing that. And I think, again, that's why I held that conference and that's something I'm still interested in potentially even more interested in than doing science and art collaborations

391
00:47:43,000 --> 00:48:07,000
because I worry and or potentially I've become really focused on how we take all the work that everybody in this room has already done and all the great things that have come from that and really create a larger voice and a larger impact with it.

392
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And I think one of the ways we do that is by really coming together some sort of coalition or force or however you want to label it.

393
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And I'd be happy to talk to anybody about moving forward with that.

394
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I feel like we should do we do questions from the audience? I don't know.

395
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Well, maybe Monica could say a few words about your educational work.

396
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Oh, you can see with it.

397
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Does anybody else work in the K-12 community on the group?

398
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yep, I do like that work in across.

399
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Can you say? Yes, so my I don't know my role is kind of weird and I'm listening to a lot of the conversations and think, you know, gosh, we self initiate almost everything we do.

400
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Like there's no format. We're always out there, you know, thinking of new ideas.

401
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:15,000
In our world, I'm a painter who works with the NASA community exploring space science and I painted Ira for the last 12 years.

402
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So it's really funny you brought that up working with IOS scientists.

403
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I was really cool guys. And working with David Grinspoon, who's going to be talking tomorrow.

404
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
But there's been these loose coalitions of the, you know, artist and space scientists and NASA working together.

405
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
They have an education and public outreach component to what they do at NASA.

406
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Although funding is kind of tricky right now.

407
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So my role is really as an artist but also as a distiller is to work within the space science community and then distill that into engagement programs for K-12.

408
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Lifelong learners. And I can never really expected to be an education, right?

409
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
But somehow this is taken on a life of its own with our group Eureka's.

410
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And now that's extending into other aspects of science.

411
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And so I very much feel as artists we're still about science literacy.

412
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But we're doing it through the lens of art and culture.

413
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And I think it's not just about the student learner. It's about the adult learner.

414
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Because if you can get the adults in the room excited about open inquiry, transdisciplinary investigation, then that filters down to the youth and the room too.

415
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And so we do everything from maker nights in Pinedale, Wyoming with ranching communities to boys and girls clubs to teachers in LA.

416
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And so that network that you're talking about, I feel like this is really a national thing.

417
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And that was one of the questions I wrote for the group was, I feel like there's almost like a thought renaissance happening with this conversation.

418
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And I was curious if any of you guys experienced or thought the same.

419
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And if so, why? Like why is there this renewed interest that's permeating all facets of society, education, artist,

420
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:13,000
scientist, and in working and thinking differently about this type of collaborative work?

421
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:22,000
So I have an opinion on that, which is based on a lot of conjecture and not a ton of facts.

422
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Perfect.

423
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So what I would love is if there is an international historian of science in the room to go do a deep literature dive.

424
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So I have a transatlantic perspective, having spent the first half of my life and training in the UK and done a lot of work through Welcome Trust and then moving to the United States.

425
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:56,000
So Britain is about 15 years ahead of America in the institutional support that is provided for this kind of work,

426
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,000
driven largely by the Welcome Trust, which is then pressured the government in the UK to support analogous things.

427
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So I think that is the main driver. It's kind of come from one big player in the country.

428
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
The Welcome Trust is the second largest nonprofit in the world after the Gates Foundation.

429
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So it's huge. So I think that's the driver. I'd be really curious to know if the reason the United States seems to be doing more of that is because like

430
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:32,000
carefully and the Sloan Foundation, recently the Simons Foundation and people like this are starting to really push it out there and they're a good example.

431
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So I think that's one thing. I think there's also it's to do with kind of the justification and the raison d'etre for scientific research.

432
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I think if you look at the justification in the United States for doing science, a lot of it is to do with it being an economic driver.

433
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And so the reason you might want to fund science communication or science literacy building has also got to be tied to that economic driver,

434
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:12,000
whereas in Europe, for example, debatably, like it's got more of a cultural raison d'etre. It's not kind of quite as like nakedly capitalistic.

435
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And that means that it's easier to translate it into an artistic format. So that's my really like not that well informed, but not totally ignorant opinion.

436
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I'd love it if someone actually had done a literature review or a sociological study of this and they can refine or correct me.

437
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I'm going to get on the mic so all of our live streamers can hear us. We'd love to open it up to the audience for questions now.

438
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:52,000
We have a lot of time for questions if whoever wants to be the brave first person. Got a volunteer over here.

439
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:03,000
All right, just come up to the mic and state your question clearly and loudly. This was set an interesting panel. I love the idea we kind of touched upon.

440
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I wanted to emphasize it now the collaboration of organizations who are doing art science collaboration work.

441
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It's very interesting. And I think we should revisit it at some point this weekend. So yes, open to questions now.

442
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Maybe people could say who they are if they want to.

443
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Hi, I'm David Teapal. I'm a sculptor. I work with water in the last and late. I create these environments utilizing the car to solve refraction to create phenomenological environments to

444
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:54,000
work with the ideas of the psychological, the psychology of perception really and what kind of experiences we have.

445
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So I have an interest in water and I'm working on teaching a class, co-teaching my first class this year at Hampshire College on watershed hydrology.

446
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,000
So I'm not a watershed hydrologist. I'm not a scientist. I have a lot of interest in science.

447
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:23,000
But I was invited in to two of the things that really hit it in this conversation. For me, our science literacy and transusciplinarity.

448
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:37,000
There are two very different things. One is how do we communicate ideas of science. One is how do we maybe use the processes and the language and the dialogue and the materials and of art and science and find the commonalities.

449
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:46,000
To help each other find more truths or more interesting elements.

450
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
So I want to just describe a little bit and then I will have a question.

451
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:02,000
So Chris, the professor asked me to come in and after the data was collected and helped visualize the data.

452
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And I said, let me come in the beginning of the course and I want to show my work and my process and how I think.

453
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And then I want to get the students to start thinking about how they're going to approach the experiment to go out and measure these two watersheds in the area.

454
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:39,000
So that all happened and I said, why don't you go out there before you do anything and do some meditation or if you play the flute, take your flute out, dance, do some writing, do something, engage with the environment before you start collecting data.

455
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:48,000
They did that and they came back and they brought some really interesting stuff back. One in particular, someone who did these watercolors and they were gradients.

456
00:56:48,000 --> 00:57:03,000
And it was really critical for me to understand gradients and how the idea of sedimentation or importance of information in gradients, somebody did a board game which was fascinating.

457
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And then somebody came in, two people dressed up in waiters and they were doing a camp lesson. And then the third part of this is that I'm going to engage by making a sculpture that articulates what I've seen in what I've learned in this process.

458
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:41,000
So just two things that really stuck out. One is the stream distribution patterns. So I'm going to take those patterns and sandblasts them on the glass and then do this other element to it using glass.

459
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And then when I talk to Chris about, she's a professor, when I asked her about this, what are the critical things? What are you trying to do or what are you really trying to get the students to do?

460
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:59,000
She said, I want them to understand flow and I want them to understand what's going on with water.

461
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And I'm asking them to go into the environment and before they collect data, that I have experienced the environment, which is a different way than a lot of scientists would say, go in and collect the data.

462
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:18,000
We want turbidity and we want the flow rates and we want the sedimentation and the plant life and all these different things. And that's really critical information.

463
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:35,000
So to the question, can you articulate you and the crew articulate what motivates you to want to merge science and art? So the artist, why do you want to work with scientists and the scientists?

464
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Why do you want to work with artists? Are you looking for the science literacy or you're looking to change the dynamic of scientific process and questioning at its core?

465
00:58:48,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I think it's really interesting, your point about going into an environment and experiencing it and viewing it at first.

466
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:28,000
So as a scientist, how I ended up coming up with my dissertation project was because I was experiencing the beach environment, doing a tagging study with sea turtles, walking up and down and having that experience and then coming up with a question about it.

467
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:42,000
So I feel like for a lot of the environmental sciences and the natural sciences, there's that naturalist history in there that does get up at some of what you were talking about.

468
00:59:42,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So that's science hat. As a dancer, I am looking to interface with other scientists to explore and think about what their research is and what does that look like on the body in sort of an abstract manner,

469
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:18,000
but also looking at it in terms of how can we use the body as a vehicle for learning, like a kinesthetic learner.

470
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:37,000
So I feel like I kind of bounce back and forth between those two, so it's science communication, but it's also exploration of different environments and different scientific research.

471
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I was going to say that I started because I've always been interested in planets, but I've always been interested in art too, and everybody always said growing up.

472
01:00:49,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I grew up in central Texas, so both were like weird, right? So they're like, you can't fuse those, but I started because I personally, as an artist, was interested in a subject, space science.

473
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:13,000
As I started to explore that and working with these NASA scientists, I got so excited about the types of conversations that were emerging.

474
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I'm also a parent, and then when I started kind of translating those into the classroom and seeing how engaged learners could get about science, if they looked at it through a different lens, that they might not be able to address a technical topic

475
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:42,000
with the confidence that they could, unless they had that creative lens, I felt like it was so transformative that it actually, that collaboration transformed my identity as the artist.

476
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So instead of now, instead of being interested in creating what I want to create, I'm interested in hearing the question that the learner has, and then taking that back to engage with the scientists to try to come up with an experience

477
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:12,000
that everybody can learn. So my role, I feel, as an artist, has shifted to really being more interested in how I can facilitate the creativity and learning of others.

478
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:20,000
So collaboration has completely changed my identity really as a being.

479
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:33,000
So it sounds really good to me. I fully agree with this concept of getting people into, I try to do it with students sometimes, but it's harder in Manhattan, but still possible.

480
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:49,000
But getting them into the reality and experiencing it before too much knowledge comes in, because then it helps ask the questions that you're talking about, Monica, you know, kind of formulate the questions that deepen the personal quest for the inquiry that could come later.

481
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Rather than just expecting a lot of data is going to naturally do that. It sounds great what you're doing.

482
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Thank you.

483
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I want to ask about situations in which I haven't heard too much about here, where the artist's contribution has a real impact on the scientists.

484
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And I have two things in mind. One is visualizations that were done inside cave environments. Do you know what we're talking about here?

485
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Computer sort of thing. And I know when those were done maybe 20 years ago of the beginning instance of the universe, there were things that were found in that visualization, which suggested to scientists to look at various points

486
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:55,000
in which they looked and actually found things that they had not otherwise found. So that the point about a different type of representation was helpful to them and exploring because it was a different way of exploring

487
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:01,000
than the grids on which they were already exploring. And another.

488
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
No.

489
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:20,000
In the cave is like a virtual reality environment. And there used to be where you go in and it's like, yes, you have to wear a headset and it's a separate sort of kind of room.

490
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:31,000
And this was like a long ago when, I mean, now they're more sophisticated than they were, but some of the very early uses of these, the first one was the University of Illinois, Champaign.

491
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:48,000
So what do you do with them and some scientific visualizations as the beginning of that kind of practice as well was using some of the data around how do you envision the beginning of the universe as it was being told, the story was being told by physics at that time.

492
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And so the assumptions that she was making as a graphic artist to put this up were different than the ones that they were using, but she was obviously using their data.

493
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And what would happen is that what the visualizations was put up had things in it that weren't directly obvious in their data and led them to go look for things that they hadn't looked at before, and they then did find them.

494
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
So that's what I'm talking about.

495
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Another example is Diana Taimina-Eccarnell, who used crochet to make hyperbolic forms that were not possible to, for instance, make on a computer for reasons that David Hilbert explained.

496
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:46,000
So this is, she has an entire project now with people who are doing making fake coral reefs sort of by this kind of crochet procedure, right?

497
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So again, this is a way of somebody coming in with that.

498
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
She's also a mathematician, right?

499
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:04,000
But this particular thing that she's doing is making this crochet, which is useful to mathematicians who have not actually envisioned this particular kind of shape before, which they were now able to do.

500
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
And people who aren't mathematicians are able to grasp in a non-mathematical way.

501
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:23,000
So I think that it's not just somebody coming in to serve scientific literacy like you tell me what you know, and I'll tard it up for you, right?

502
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I think that there's also the point about there's different ways of knowing things that people can bring forward that actually has an impact on scientific knowledge itself.

503
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
That's on the same. Thank you.

504
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Yeah.

505
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Yeah.

506
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:50,000
No, there's another example, and I'm blanking on who does this, but there are a couple of TED talks where dancers are given...

507
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:59,000
instructions where they're able... it's like modeling of molecules.

508
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
So these... you can only do this.

509
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
You can only do that.

510
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
And then the dancers interact.

511
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And the scientists are able to much more quickly see what would happen in given situations.

512
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And so it happens at a faster rate than if they were to then have to go back and do the computer programming.

513
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:28,000
So they can work on things quicker and then, you know, create the longer mathematical models that happen.

514
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:33,000
So there are definitely some other good examples of that as well.

515
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I think kind of to provide a slightly conceptual framework, the literature that I'm kind of familiar with would kind of cite the benefit of art as a way of knowing in terms of its benefits to driving scientific research forward.

516
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And so I'm kind of thinking of the kind of framework that John Dewey put forward in terms of the benefits of an artistic education.

517
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:16,000
There's a good conference preceding that came out of the Exploratorium a few years ago called Artis a Way of Knowing by Semper, Bevan and McDougall that kind of touches on some of these good things.

518
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And I think David Rupurnstein is there's a review paper that a lot of people on the seed network are pulling together now that I think has a lot of good examples, but I've not actually seen it.

519
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,000
But I think that's like a good conceptual framework to think about these kind of things.

520
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
But I'm sorry.

521
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I was just going to say I have a family of antidote not to go back to IO, but say we were working with NASA scientists to develop this kind of curriculum where you use the

522
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:49,000
elements of art, line shape, color, value, texture, the basic elements of art.

523
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,000
The basic elements of art to analyze and understand geologic stories on planets and moons.

524
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And I was working with this IO scientist and we were working with a group of learners and these learners were working on pieces that kept referencing some shapes that were very interesting compositionally.

525
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And she looked at it, the scientist and said, wow, why do they keep drawing that?

526
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I'm like, well, look at the composition. It's very interesting compositionally. She said, that's a region we don't study because it's not hot.

527
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:32,000
So IO is covered in volcanoes. The scientists are studying the regions that are hot, but the composition that was interested to the artist students in the room that was not hot.

528
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:42,000
But then she's like, wow, we should look at that closer because the layers were actually very interesting in terms of understanding geologic time and the history of lava flows on the planet.

529
01:09:42,000 --> 01:10:01,000
It just wasn't something that was active currently. So using the observational skills through the drawing process, having artists in the scientists in the room, I thought that that was a really interesting place where both were informing each other equally at that moment in time.

530
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:21,000
So I just wanted to add that these are really beautiful concrete examples of how our can influence science, but that I think it's important for us to remember and appreciate the less concrete examples, right?

531
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Science in particular can work very, very slowly. And the dialogue between the scientists and the artists and the infusion of a different way of thinking about a set of questions or a set of problems is really, really profound.

532
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:52,000
You may not immediately be able to put concrete language around what that resulted in, but I think that we should not forget that these are happening in everything that we're all doing.

533
01:10:52,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Great question. It kind of preempted a little bit of what I was going to ask, but I love this idea that got brought up earlier about a taxonomy of different types of collaborations.

534
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:27,000
And I found it very conceptually helpful, especially because this conference is going to continue into the weekend and have more discussions. So as far as I understand it, the taxonomy that's kind of been presented today by all the people doing actual collaborations seems to be one that the

535
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:46,000
scientist helps in a sense helps to promote some sort of scientific idea, maybe like a movie like Inconvenient Truth would be a bit of an extremely blunt example of that, but to some degree that happens, or alternatively, maybe the artist as a critic to some scientific

536
01:11:46,000 --> 01:12:07,000
idea or process seems also like a legitimate form of sire to me at least. And then third, possibly the idea of almost an artistic project like the Intersteller Travel Bureau, which in a sense like a pop-up interactive experience is a little bit more on the artistic side, but it's drawing very much from science.

537
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:24,000
And then the fourth, which was just brought up, which is exactly what I was going to ask about, which is when the scientist, it's almost like science forward instead of art forward, and the scientist gets something out of this artistic collaboration, maybe noticing something new or having their thinking changed.

538
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And I just wanted to ask two things, one of which was this taxonomy that I've kind of walked away from from this conversation, does everyone kind of, does those categories make sense to people as possible modes to interpret what we mean by sire?

539
01:12:44,000 --> 01:13:02,000
And then two, are there any extra categories that you can think of? It might be a little bit of a reach, but I just wanted to kind of see what your opinion of that was, given that this is kind of what I've taken away from this and what I'm going to be thinking about as people

540
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:15,000
continue to present and talk about sire over the next few days.

541
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:36,000
When I was following the conversations that I didn't keep bringing up other examples of classes of collaborations, but I would have come up with the four that you just had. The third about the, which Mark and Jamie brought up with these, the intergalactic club

542
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I just forgot your title. The superhero clubhouse. I guess, yeah, even though you said they were in a way started with art, I almost saw them as starting with life or something about engaging people in a holistic way about issues of life, almost ethics and

543
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:19,000
a transdisciplinary mind that was maybe neither science nor art. Maybe I would put it a little bit as you framed it on the, more toward the outside, but almost a goal for doing scenarios about life, expanding people, consciousness expansion, maybe

544
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:38,000
more broadly construed. And then the fourth one, I would say yes, you framed it well, the artistic mind is having new insights and I agree that science has to do that themselves, but some, the idea of multiple minds thinking

545
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:55,000
patterns in different ways. So I would say you're saying four. Whether there's more, I don't know, I don't see it at this point, but I'm definitely open to it. But I think that's really great that you saw the four that I saw also.

546
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I'd like to just add a little bit on to your fourth category, I think it's really good, but I think we should not just think about that, the collaborations as an artist. It can be any member of the community. It can be anyone who comes to a scientist with something.

547
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:33,000
And I just want to throw an example out, which is, I'm going to do this film, this short film about this lab in Nova Scotia led by this awesome scientist named Max Lebouron, and she is an ocean plastics lab. And what she does is she actually begins the process of hypothesis creation with a community meeting in the town

548
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:45,000
where the lab is, and sort of gives her like rough presentation of what she is interested in, what they can do in the lab. And then they just have an open hypothesis generation session.

549
01:15:45,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And it's super engaged in the community. And part of the thing that's come out of it is they've created these little trolls that can go behind people's fishing boats that can collect plastic. And then they can, each person as a boat can do their own experiments at home and feed data back into the lab.

550
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:11,000
But all of that, like all the interests in those kind of experiments come from the community members. And I just think that's such a great model moving forward. It both gets scientists out of their silo a little bit.

551
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:29,000
And to Shane's point earlier about like how do we have a bigger impact above and beyond meetings and ivory tower collaborations. It's that stuff. It's like getting scientists to come out into the community a little bit more.

552
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And also going to them and bringing it to them. But I just love what they're doing up there.

553
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I mean, I would add to that a little bit and say, and I don't know if this is a different category or a nuance of a category. But that, I think another really important thing for this group to be thinking about and talking about is how do we reach people were not currently reaching, right?

554
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Because I mean, I'll just speak for a LIGO project. We've amassed a really wonderful community of people. But I think to some degree we're speaking to the choir. And how do you start to reach beyond that group of people?

555
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And that I do think in a way is a special category because potentially we have to work or think or at least talk a little bit differently about what we're doing in order to engage some people that we're not currently engaging.

556
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:32,000
For example, the word transdisciplinary. There are some people that that word is just going to lose immediately. There are a lot of people that that word is going to lose immediately.

557
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
So.

558
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Thank you so much.

559
01:17:39,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Hey, my name is Nick. I'm a scientist most of the time. I'm an artist, very rarely, and I've done a little bit of art science collaboration. I thought it was really interesting discussion, but something that struck me about it is also something that struck me about my interactions with the art community.

560
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And especially the interactions between scientists and artists is that a large majority of them are very science focused. So the subject of the whole thing is science.

561
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Whether it's science communication or the artists bringing some observation that helps the scientist understand things, it's the science that we're trying to understand over somehow the question of the universe that is the science that we're trying to understand.

562
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Rarely is, do we see science doing science of art and trying to use science to understand art. Now this does happen, but it's a lot rarer than art trying to serve science.

563
01:18:46,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And I wonder why if you have any opinions on why that is. I think Mark touched on it a little bit with the inequality between funding, but also I think maybe the science of art is sometimes seen as a little bit frivolous in science.

564
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:21,000
You know, it's not a serious question that scientists are asking. So I wonder if you have any kind of opinions on that. Maybe it's like a fifth category to your turn. So I can make a empirical observation because I work with and know lots of people who work in conservation science.

565
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:36,000
This is chemistry that is looking at art preservation. So fine art. This is not a well respected or well funded subfield of chemistry and spectroscopy.

566
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:53,000
For whatever reason I don't understand, but it is an empirically true statement. This is not something where there is a ton of money and a ton of respect heading. I would also kind of kind of caveat it and push back against this conception that like science doesn't do a lot of job and art.

567
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I think it's really easy to lose sight of our place in history. When we forget that many of the kind of tools we take to be every day run of the mill things were in fact 20, 30, 50 years ago, cutting edge science and they've now been so democratized and mass marketed

568
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:28,000
that we don't even realize that this is fundamentally like a scientific product. It's probably more technological now and these are completely ubiquitous.

569
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Like the Met is digitizing its entire collection. Like Google is transcribing every work of literature onto the web and it's somewhat semantics. But you could argue that science is doing a really good job of like disseminating and promoting art. It just doesn't sit within the academies in the way it does it now.

570
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I mean, just a thought. Yeah, to comment on that, I guess it's not cutting edge anymore. So it's not, you know, it's become engineering, not science.

571
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's why I said maybe it's semantics.

572
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Just a quick response is to some degree science as a process is more confined in a certain way than art. But in general, I would class your question under

573
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:29,000
cognitive science. And it was just asking, asking how people think and why they think and how they respond. And that is being investigated in different ways, obviously in a big, big way.

574
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:37,000
But I know it was a year or two ago where there was some artificial intelligence is also investigating this. Like what makes people respond in certain ways.

575
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:50,000
And there was some pop song that was created by a computer and in a way that I don't know if there's a negative side of that. And if there's a side that scares me when the human mind is understood in that way.

576
01:21:50,000 --> 01:22:06,000
And the artistic process is well, depends on what kind of art you're talking about. But in this case, it was a song that contains properties to it that they think will be popular to the mind.

577
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And I don't know whether that fits with your question at all. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think music is the one is one of the areas where this is most prevalent.

578
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Yeah, also scientific understanding of music. But it is so it seems that, and it's not that this doesn't happen. It just seems very one. It's very unequal. Right. There is this imbalance.

579
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:31,000
And I wonder if it's to do with funding or to do with the lack of respect for those kind of fields of science. It's hard to find a good fit in hard science.

580
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Yeah, I mean, another reason might simply be that in a way it's the opposite of what it feels like that the artists are actually more evolved and have already come to the table. And part of the discussion is how to get the scientists to the table.

581
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
And therefore, there may be a little bit of a focus on the science.

582
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Okay.

583
01:22:51,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I just want to add one more thing from like the artist's perspective, you know, as an artist, you have a subject, right? And so many artists are interested in the subject of science.

584
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:18,000
And that subject in art can be so varied, whereas often in science, you're an expert, you're a master in a certain field or question. So you don't necessarily have the breadth in your starting point.

585
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:31,000
So one example would be Eric Candel wrote a book about Mark Rothko in trying to understand from a neuroscientist perspective what makes Rothko's art.

586
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,000
So it is happening. I mean, you're saying it maybe is not happening as a formal way, but yeah.

587
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:44,000
So I'm happy with that as another category that needs to be expanded more, maybe even more consciously to be more conscious.

588
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:53,000
And just really quickly, from my perspective, and I might just be too caught up in it, and I write all about neuro-esthetics and my website, the beautiful brain.

589
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:03,000
And I just feel like it is happening a lot. And there's like the Max Planck empire, for example, just created the Max Planck Institute of Empirical Studies.

590
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:12,000
And it's all about that. And there's kind of, I went to the International Association of Empirical Aesthetics meeting here at Hunter College a couple of years.

591
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:26,000
These are big bodies, they're only studying what happens when you look at a painting. And it really is going on, but it's a lot of the rubs artists the wrong way for good reason.

592
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,000
But there is an issue of the artists having an intuitive understanding of what they're already doing.

593
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:38,000
This is a longer conversation. I just said, there is a lot of work out there.

594
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
So if I could just add to that a little bit, and I am talking tomorrow, sorry.

595
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:58,000
But there is actually a science to the arts. And I think oftentimes that's overlooked. And there is a lot of work being done on aesthetic science, but there's also a lot being done on the neuroscience of what happens in the brain when you're making stuff.

596
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Even looking at when did civilization really take off with knowledge. And there's a professor, and I forget what university that's actually having people flint knives and spears and seeing what is happening because there was a point in human civilization

597
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,000
where the use of simple machines in building these things actually led to more knowledge.

598
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And I think oftentimes what's happening at least in this country is that we look at art in many ways as vocational skills.

599
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And if you look at metallurgy or ceramics or chemistry, you know, that there are really hard sciences there.

600
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:43,000
How do you build? How do you engineer? Typically the artists were the ones that were doing that.

601
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:53,000
100 years ago we really started dividing up disciplines. And so I think that was kind of the thought behind this whole weekend too.

602
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:03,000
And some of you talked about the transdisciplinary nature, but in many ways people have become so specialized in their fields that they're not looking at the bigger picture.

603
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I'm not going to say scientists in general because I would say that what we have is we have a problem with how we value knowledge and things in this country.

604
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And so it's not necessarily the scientist, but its culture as a whole places things at different levels.

605
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
And so I would like to think that it's more about our values.

606
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I'd second that. My name is Cynthia Pinucci and 30 years ago I started an organization called Art in Science Collaborations.

607
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:51,000
So I think we have to look at the fact that art education in this country is valued nil.

608
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:58,000
It's just not funded. So that means that the scientists don't have an appreciate.

609
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:06,000
The scientists to be the ones that are in control now don't have an appreciation of the arts or what an artist can bring to the table.

610
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
They don't know anything about it. They don't know how to craft, engineer, visualize.

611
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I mean some of them do. Yeah, of course.

612
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:27,000
This is an exception. So we have to look at the fact that funding, the NEA funding is just pitiful.

613
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I mean in the UK it's the lottery that funds the Arts Council.

614
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I mean forever. That's why they can do these wonderful collaborations and the Welcome Trust, you know, the most highly funded medical institution in the world.

615
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Yeah, they're way ahead of us in Australia is catching up really nicely.

616
01:27:50,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So education, if it doesn't come fundamentally and the parents don't value that I happen to think after school programs are an incredible place because the structure of the classroom is impossible to do project learning.

617
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:21,000
And I think that's where art and science has to be, to be appreciated and to bring the science alive in ways that the scientists normally don't do.

618
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:27,000
So, but after school programs are, everything is so structured.

619
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:33,000
So it's got to be a passion of yours and the part of the artist.

620
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And the scientist has got to love art as well. I mean I've traveled all over the world and I can't tell you how many times I'll be sitting down on a bench in a city I don't know and there'll be a woman sitting there and we're talking.

621
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Yep, she's an artist. Yeah, and her husband is a scientist.

622
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I mean I could probably write a book about this. There is this natural connection. It's very, very interesting.

623
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:14,000
It's really there and I think the reason why it's happening, these collaborations are happening more and more, more projects like LIGO are happening.

624
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I get it through my email. I mean practically once a month I hear about new artists and scientists don't need institutions or organizations anymore.

625
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:33,000
They need to be passionate about the science they're involved in and respect and enjoy art.

626
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:47,000
And then if it takes 10 years to form a personal relationship over this concept that they want to bring about through a transdisciplinary collaboration, well you just work on it and you just do it.

627
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I mean it's not like, you know, anyway, but I wanted to say that I think digital tools, they're more children born digital.

628
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Many of us are older so we weren't born digital but I think it has been a big enabler.

629
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:16,000
So scientists like Tyler Voke, if I was doing a project I could find his email and I know his books and I can email him and ask him a question.

630
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:27,000
So that kind of accessibility to scientists was never around in the olden days unless you were there personally going to the university.

631
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:45,000
But it's there today but you've got to build as an artist a body of work that people that's not so obtuse that the general public and that people can really understand their own

632
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:55,000
and really understand and appreciate it and that that scientist is going to really get into, you know, and want to work with you.

633
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
So that mutual respect has totally got to be there and that takes time.

634
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:10,000
You can't put a graduate student together with a scientist and expect that, you know, anyway, I'm a little off the topic.

635
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Thank you very much.

636
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Thank you for your comments and I feel like you touched upon a lot of the things that we talked about tonight, especially what makes for a good collaboration.

637
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Definitely dedication, passion.

638
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Our evening is over. It went really fast.

639
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Thank you guys so much for the panel tonight.

640
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,000
We are starting at 9.30 tomorrow. The doors are going to open at 9.

641
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:40,000
So come in with your coffee and I look forward to seeing you all tomorrow.

642
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Thank you very much.

643
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Can you get the talk about your book?

644
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I feel like we could talk a more theoretical about this.

645
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
We could talk a lot more about this.

646
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
We could make terms of matters,

647
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
and patterns for the matter.

648
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
And patterns for the matter.

649
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:30,000
And patterns for the matter.

650
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And patterns for the matter.

651
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:56,000
And patterns for the matter.

652
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I don't know about that.
