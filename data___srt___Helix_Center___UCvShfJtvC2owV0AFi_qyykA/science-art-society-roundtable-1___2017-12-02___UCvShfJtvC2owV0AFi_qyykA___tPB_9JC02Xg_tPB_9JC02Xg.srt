1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
Table discussion before lunch.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,000
So if you're feeling a little hungry, I promise we won't starve you.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,160
We are going to talk for the first time in this conference specifically about the relationship

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,920
between science, art, and society.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,160
So we added this subject in because we've been talking a lot about specific examples

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,840
in education, in collaborative working groups, et cetera.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,560
But there's this larger issue which encompasses everything that we're talking about.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,440
And that's the multi-directional relationship between science and art, art and society,

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,880
and science and society.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,760
And my argument, and I'm happy to hear otherwise, is that all of those relationships are damaged

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,280
or dysfunctional.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,500
And so what can we do to solve that and to build upon the relationships that we envision

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,240
to kind of go towards the future that we envision for ourselves?

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,960
So I will let Zach introduce the panelists.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:06,520
All right, so participants, if you could raise your hand as I call your name.

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,360
Eric Hull is a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and a writer whose works

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,840
have appeared in the Atlantic, American Fiction, and other publications.

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,520
Seeing us again, Alana Quinn, Alana is an exhibit and program organizer at the Cultural

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,560
Program at the National Academy of Sciences.

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:36,840
Ben Lilly, Ben Lilly is a high energy particle physicist and co-founder and director of the

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,520
story collider as well as a contributing editor for TED.com.

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,120
He has founded a space called Kaviat, an intellectual events venue.

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:57,080
David Grinspoon is an astrobiologist, award-winning science communicator, and prize-winning author,

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,520
as well as an advisor to NASA on space exploration strategy.

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,800
Elizabeth Demore.

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,960
Elizabeth is a fine artist working in sculpture, digital media, and e-Go art to explore the

27
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,680
interface between the built and natural environments.

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,520
Stuart Feierstein.

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:28,840
Stuart is a professor and former chair of the biology department at Columbia University

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,240
where he studies vertebrate olfaction, as well as an author and advisor for the public

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,880
understanding of science to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

32
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,240
With that, let's start the roundtable.

33
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Ben Lilly.

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,840
So something that occurs to me is that this conversation wouldn't have felt as necessary

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,640
a few decades ago.

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,840
One of the reasons why is that historically, of course, artists and scientists have been

37
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:06,040
very separate, there was a very important book called The Two Cultures by C.P. Snow about

38
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,040
exactly how separate they are.

39
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,680
But I feel that something kind of important began to happen in the 60s and 70s, which

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,120
is that the public profile of science began to grow and moved out of just being something

41
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,400
academic.

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,960
And for instance, there are now science accounts on Twitter with millions of followers.

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,640
And that simply did not exist prior to science popularization.

44
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,280
The New York Times has a science section of its website.

45
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,200
It didn't use to.

46
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,680
So I think a lot of this is that science as a cultural institution, if Martians came

47
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,960
to our planet and they were sociologists and they asked, what are some of the growing

48
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,040
really important driving institutions to our culture, they would very quickly hit upon

49
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,080
science, this collection of individuals and institutions and the ideas it's producing.

50
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,040
And notice that it's been growing in relevancy.

51
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,600
And I think at this point it's grown to such a degree that it's kind of colliding with

52
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,760
art and all these other things that suddenly people are realizing, well, they not only

53
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,920
have to deal with this, they have to come to some sort of understanding, whether it be

54
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,720
of criticism, whether it be of support or whatever, but they have to do this.

55
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,200
And so I just want to remark that what I see a lot of here is basically this kind of new

56
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,960
error of collision because quite simply science has gotten so big and so important that art

57
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,040
just has to deal with it.

58
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,440
So I just wanted to chime in on that.

59
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,040
So I do art and science collaboration, I'm a sculptor, but I'm a professor at Rutgers.

60
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,880
And I teach in the engineering department and the computer science department in addition

61
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,280
to the art department.

62
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,960
And one of the interesting things I think about this sort of moment is that in so many

63
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:13,040
different ways in genomic engineering, in AI, computer science, scientists, you know,

64
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,480
once upon a time there was this idea of like the pure science says, right, you'd go and

65
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,040
you'd study the natural world.

66
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,000
And now even the quote unquote pure sciences are making the things that they're studying.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,280
So it's become sort of an applied practice.

68
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,000
And in many ways I see similar kinds of activities happening in the science department that you'd

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,880
see over in the art department.

70
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,640
In other words, researchers are making the things that they're studying and then they're

71
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,320
looking at sort of the emergent properties that are coming from it.

72
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,840
So I think that that might also be sort of one of those other kinds of bridges that we're

73
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,120
sort of seeing right now.

74
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,800
It's interesting that I agree with everything you guys both just said that the historical

75
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,000
perspective on the two cultures, this division.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,480
Of course, if you go back farther in history, there was no such division.

77
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,720
Science didn't exist as a separate professional endeavor more than say 150 years ago, give

78
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,960
or take.

79
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,760
Certainly more than 400 years ago, that was a no such thing.

80
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,600
Science was a branch of philosophy, it was natural philosophy, so it was a part of the

81
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
humanity.

82
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,800
So this professionalization, this splintering of our professional communities out of the

83
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,480
specialization of knowledge, you know, it's easy to get down on that.

84
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,760
In some sense that it's also been very necessary, we wouldn't have been able to learn and achieve

85
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,160
a lot of what we have without that specialization.

86
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,880
But then we've lost a lot too in our ability to reconnect.

87
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,840
And I think in a way the same thing is true of art.

88
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,520
Art has become a very professionalized endeavor, certainly fine arts.

89
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,360
And that leads to some problems too.

90
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,040
A word that hasn't come up, I don't think explicitly this weekend yet, but I think it

91
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,800
has been implicit a lot in our discussions is elitism.

92
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,680
And I think both art and science have a problem, have an elitism problem.

93
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,440
And it hinders our ability to do in both areas what we feel we want to do, which is

94
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,640
connect, foster wider connections.

95
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,720
And I think the good news is that the kinds of collaborations we've been hearing about

96
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,280
and talking about can really help.

97
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,760
Both art and science can be helped with their elitism problems by working with one another.

98
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,000
And I've experienced this somewhat in my collaborations.

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,080
I primarily identify as a scientist, although I have been involved in a lot of collaborations

100
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:54,160
with artists and I'm also performing musicians, so I get my art kick that way as well.

101
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,720
And I found that one of the many values of these kinds of collaborations is they get

102
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,880
us, and I mean us, collectively artists and scientists, out of our normal boxes and force

103
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:16,480
us to extend beyond our normal audiences and present our work beyond our normal spaces,

104
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,320
places where the presenting art in places that are not places where fine arts is normally

105
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,800
presented as often one of the outcomes of these collaborations.

106
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:34,800
And force scientists to expand our vocabulary in communicating with quote the general public,

107
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,760
quote the non-professional non-science public.

108
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,920
So I think we need each other to fight our elitism problem.

109
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,280
And the good news is there's sort of a natural breaking down of those barriers that comes

110
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:53,280
when we do this transdisciplinary work of working beyond our normal professional boundaries.

111
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,720
I'll take a just look.

112
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Nice.

113
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,720
We're going to already start?

114
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Yeah, right.

115
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,760
I'll just take a not entirely orthogonal point of view to that, but just sort of a little

116
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,600
off to the side.

117
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,520
So I just came back from a two-day symposium with the Santa Fe Institute on the limits

118
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
of understanding.

119
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,400
All I can tell you is I understand less now than less now than less.

120
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,960
So whatever that's wrong.

121
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,720
Yes, whatever the truth is highly successful.

122
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,640
Highly successful.

123
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,560
But one of the things that did come out of it, even though it was largely a science-oriented

124
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,080
sort of symposium, was the idea of a plurality of methods of understanding.

125
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,560
And I think we don't want to smush everything together.

126
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,840
I do think there's a value to boundaries and borders.

127
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,880
Good fences make good neighbors and things of that nature because there are a lot of

128
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,200
ways to understand things.

129
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,400
There's paintings are away, novels are away, scientific experiments are away.

130
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,120
And I don't think we want to dismiss any of those ways or try and mush them all together.

131
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,800
What we really want is to develop a more pluralistic approach, if anything, where not only—and

132
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,320
I don't just mean diversity.

133
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,160
I mean pluralism is, in my opinion, more than simply diversity, it's the ability to allow

134
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,560
more than one thing to go forward, even though those two things are, as they say, incommensurable.

135
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,200
They're at odds in some way or another.

136
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,360
But they're both important ideas.

137
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,800
There's a great quote of you don't mind.

138
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,360
When Neil's board said the opposite of a fact is a falsehood, but the opposite of a profound

139
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,120
truth is often another profound truth.

140
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,720
And that, I think, really hard to hold in your head a little bit, but a very important

141
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,080
idea to hold in your head.

142
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,840
So I'm not entirely against some of the boundaries that we have with art and science.

143
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Now, the failure to communicate or whether the elitism or things like that, I mean elitism

144
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,520
is a second issue which we could talk about.

145
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,560
I'll just give the floor to Ben.

146
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,160
But I think we do have to be a little—this came up a little bit in the last panel, the

147
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,600
idea of expertise.

148
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,960
And so elitism grows, unfortunately, is a little bit of a weed or a lichen on expertise.

149
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, we don't want to lose expertise in the fight against elitism, which I agree we could

150
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,760
all do with a little more humility in this world.

151
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,840
I'm actually going to pick up on the expertise thread first, which is one thing we've learned

152
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,920
is—okay, so what I do now, I open an event space.

153
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,760
And our notion is to provide a home for what we call intelligent nightlife.

154
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,400
And we want a place where people can come out and have extraordinary things happen in

155
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,200
the context of drinking with friends.

156
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,940
But more than that, when I pitch to producers, what I want is a space where we have blending

157
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,720
discussion of the academics with knowledge from the performing arts.

158
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,600
And there, it's—what is key to us is recognizing the expertise that exists in all of the domains

159
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,160
that we're bringing in.

160
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,800
So for example, we bring in comedy groups and we ask them, you know, okay, you're really

161
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
great at comedy.

162
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,320
Can you do something that fits our space?

163
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,960
Can you do something that is in line with our mission of, you know, exhibiting thought

164
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
in new ways?

165
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,040
We're still searching for good ways of saying this.

166
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,600
But so we've had a couple great successes with that.

167
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,080
Just last night we hosted a group there called North Coast.

168
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:22,560
They're a hip-hop improv group and they improvised a musical in the style of Hamilton and it

169
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
was brilliant.

170
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,440
These people came in, they executed.

171
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
It was gorgeous.

172
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,160
A while ago we brought in another comedy group.

173
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,080
They run what's known as a very supportive open mic, trying to develop new comics.

174
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,640
And so we're like, great, we will bring them in.

175
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,240
We'll give them the mission of doing shows that involve science or other think-y thoughts.

176
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,400
And they said, yeah, yeah, great, we'll do that.

177
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,520
And the show had nothing to do with that whatsoever.

178
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,640
And there was somewhere along the line we forgot to look at what they were doing and

179
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,400
say, oh, this is what their expert in.

180
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,640
Let's work with their own expertise instead of trying to put what we want to have happen

181
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
on top of it.

182
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,160
Whereas with North Coast they have developed their own expertise and now our job is to

183
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,760
pair them with historians and people who are going to really make that sort of thing shine.

184
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,120
But more broadly when you're talking about elitism, and this is a lesson we're learning

185
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:24,320
and really trying to teach ourselves, whether you can get outside of the box by going trans

186
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,840
disciplinary, it's not automatic and you have to do it very intentionally.

187
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,000
And so part of that comes from what other expertise you recognize.

188
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,040
If we're going out and we're working with comedy groups, are we only going out and working

189
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,760
with ones that already serve sort of in elitist audience?

190
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,560
And I've seen this happen, I've seen us do it.

191
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,720
Or are we going out and looking for groups, I have a group coming in that organizes intellectual,

192
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,520
it's called drunk education, he gets experts drunk and has them give talks about subjects,

193
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,480
but one of the first things he said is great.

194
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,280
It used to be called drunk TED talks but they sent him a cease and desist.

195
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,640
I was great by the way.

196
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,240
But one of the first things he said to me is that he organized one of his most successful

197
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,720
events ever that brought in the most people was an evening of discussion of Carly Rae

198
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Jepsen.

199
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,520
A lot of people in this crowd are going to look at that and say, is that really the

200
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,640
arena we want to be playing in?

201
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,520
And the answer is if you really are serious about breaking through this barrier and not

202
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:38,960
just reaching the other elite crowds, yes, you have to be willing not just to go beyond

203
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,040
your own disciplinary boundary but outside your own comfort zone in the social arena

204
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
as well.

205
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,680
And that can be the big challenge for really getting out and really having this discussion

206
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,280
with the kinds of audiences that aren't naturally invited in.

207
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,160
Yeah, presenting in non-traditional spaces is really good for that.

208
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,720
And part of what I was saying before is that these collaborations often force scientists

209
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,400
to present science in non-traditional spaces because I mean I've given talks in art museums

210
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,600
which is where I don't usually give talks because of these collaborations.

211
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,880
And vice versa, I had artist friends come in and do things in science museums and planetariums.

212
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:21,560
And so just by the nature of reaching across those boundaries you find yourself in front

213
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,600
of non-traditional audiences for your discipline.

214
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,840
And that alone is I think very valuable.

215
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,080
So a C.D. Snow is actually the one who first brought up the idea of a neutral space and

216
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,320
you already brought up C.P. Snow's two cultures.

217
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,520
I wanted to ask you, Alana, since you work at the National Academy's but part of the cultural

218
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,320
programs, what's your experience there of bringing in a very well-educated but generally

219
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:51,560
lay audience into a science institution where you're doing very art and science things?

220
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,040
I'm not sure how to answer that.

221
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:03,480
Well I get my question is do you feel like people come in with certain expectations that

222
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,960
are met or aren't met?

223
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,120
Do you feel like people have to dumb down their art or their science in order to reach

224
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,880
a certain audience?

225
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,400
Because some of the questions we're skirting around are like, okay, we talked a lot about

226
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,880
science communication in the last couple of panels but can we communicate, complicate

227
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,680
science to a lay audience?

228
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,840
Can we connect science and society through communication or do we need to reframe the

229
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,600
way we're thinking about it?

230
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,360
I think when people come into the space they really are expecting scientific accuracy.

231
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:45,240
Actually we really try not to dumb down anything that we do and one thing we're really focused

232
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:52,840
on is presenting examples of intersections of science and art that are really exciting

233
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,920
and actually are solving some problems that we're facing today so we can get a really

234
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,520
wide audience of people interested.

235
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,080
We definitely try to invite all of our speakers to bring in hands-on objects that they can

236
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,320
share with the audience.

237
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,080
We think a lot about accessibility.

238
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,640
We try to engage all the local universities.

239
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,760
We have a partnership with Gallaudet University, School for the DAF and we have ASL interpreters

240
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,480
at all of our events.

241
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,240
All of our events are free and open to the public so that breaks down some barriers that

242
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,840
might exist for some people.

243
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,760
I'm sorry.

244
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,360
One of the things I think would not be such a bad topic to talk about for a little bit

245
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,120
here because we're all involved in somewhere in other ways.

246
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,840
What we mean by scientific literacy or scientific accessibility or this dumb down versus not

247
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,520
that how you present complicated science to an audience and things like that and whether

248
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,360
there's any value whatsoever in that or...

249
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,520
There's no value in what?

250
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Well, sorry, you said any value in doing that and actually working really hard which many

251
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,760
of us are doing.

252
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,040
I think there is but I would also like to suggest that the scientific revolution, if

253
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,320
you think it was important, which I do, but if you think the Renaissance and the Restoration

254
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,080
world, I think the Reformation were important.

255
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,800
I think the scientific revolution is probably important.

256
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,600
What was important for a new way of thinking?

257
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,520
It was important for a way of thinking that said you don't get knowledge from authority,

258
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,720
whether that authority is Aristotle or the Good Book or whatever it is, that's not where

259
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
knowledge comes from.

260
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,520
It's a whole new way of understanding knowledge and it seems to me that's what we're not communicating

261
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,200
so effectively by doing physics for poets kinds of things or looking for those things.

262
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,760
We're not communicating the fact that what science is based on, if you'll pardon a kind

263
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,080
of a half-assed plug here, ignorance, failure, doubt and uncertainty.

264
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,200
I wrote about those things.

265
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
But especially notions of uncertainty.

266
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,800
I mean, why uncertainty is so crucial to science?

267
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,840
Not that it's a failing, but it's crucial to good science, that you can't have science

268
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,800
nor art for that matter in my opinion, but I'm not an artist so I won't say that.

269
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,840
But that's what needs to be communicated, it seems to me, not just here's a way to understand

270
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,040
quantum physics simply and easily.

271
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,560
I think one of the key things there is the lens that you view the rest of society.

272
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,960
So I'm a huge fan of never using the phrase dumb down.

273
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,960
I think that's a destructive way to look at what we're doing.

274
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,600
Yes, but the sort of lens that you use shapes how you're thinking about the activity.

275
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,800
So you're talking about how do we communicate ideas and so the statement is, oh, then we

276
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,000
do this physics for poet and maybe that's not helping with uncertainty.

277
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,360
To me, there's a sense in which that's mind blowing.

278
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,960
If you want to talk through issues of uncertainty, you could do a whole lot worse than talk to

279
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,200
a group of poets.

280
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,200
And so if you're not doing that in a physics and poet thing, it means the lens through

281
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,000
which you are viewing poets is as the stupid people who don't know the science.

282
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,320
And that is a very destructive way of doing it.

283
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,320
I'm agreeing with you.

284
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:20,600
It's very unclear and uncertain, as always, but it's really, this is where we need to

285
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,000
turn the mirror inward and ask ourselves, how are we viewing society?

286
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,680
And if we view society as the unwashed masses that need to be educated, that's how our

287
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,000
work is going to come out.

288
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,400
And this is why I keep harping on about expertise and recognizing it out there with the other

289
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,720
people that we're interacting with and going into these things not as authority disseminating

290
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
information.

291
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,680
It's ironic that most of our sitcoms are exactly that, but going into it as a partnership.

292
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,440
There are different ways to think about scientific literacy, for sure.

293
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,080
I think it's a good question to ask.

294
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,000
What do we even mean by that?

295
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,760
And before in the previous panel, people were talking about not liking the acronym STEAM.

296
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,120
I've never liked the acronym STEM, Science, Technology, Engineering, Math.

297
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,080
Not because I don't think it's a reasonable summation of some corner of knowledge that

298
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,480
sort of fits together.

299
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:19,840
But it's so often used in this narrow, almost cheerleading role.

300
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,880
We need STEM education because we need to prepare people for jobs and vocations and

301
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,800
increase American competitiveness.

302
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,560
These are not the reasons why I'm excited about teaching science to people.

303
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,920
I mean, I recognize those are important, but it is a way of seeing the world.

304
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:45,560
There's a more profound, deeper sense of connection to the world than just, here's a way to get

305
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
a good job.

306
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,080
That's why we need to get people into STEM careers.

307
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:57,400
So I think of science literacy as spreading a way of interrogating the world, seeing ourselves

308
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,200
in relation to the world.

309
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,040
And when you think of it that way, it's not just something that's like sort of a good

310
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,400
idea or enrichment.

311
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,840
It's actually crucial, I think, for human survival right now.

312
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,360
We have learned some things about our relationship with the world and the way it's changing right

313
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,760
now and the role that we find ourselves in this world that we need to deal with collectively

314
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
as a species.

315
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,320
We can't deal with it collectively if only some of us are aware of this.

316
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,440
And it doesn't do any good to just have the scientists be aware of it and not really

317
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,880
effective at communicating.

318
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,920
We need obviously a larger collaboration to do that.

319
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,880
So to me, this is survival skills for humanity.

320
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,520
We've learned some important things.

321
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,960
We have to figure out how to include more people in that knowledge and in our response

322
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,160
to that knowledge.

323
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:52,440
And so I do see that in a way science literacy, but it's not like here's the facts we know

324
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,240
and how do we get people to understand.

325
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,520
But I agree about dumbing down.

326
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
It's not dumbing down.

327
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,200
It's smartening up.

328
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,640
It's about if you cannot communicate what you think you know, maybe you really don't

329
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,280
know it all that well, or maybe it's not coherent.

330
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,360
So it's about improving our communication skills as much as it is about lowering some

331
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,840
perceived level that we're communicating at.

332
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,080
And in that in an art sense, it's really, really vital work and the collaborations we're

333
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,160
talking about I think are absolutely essential.

334
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,960
I just wanted to follow up, Stuart.

335
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,320
I would love to have an art symposium sometimes titled The Limits of Understanding.

336
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:38,160
Understanding art can be very difficult, but I just will, following up on the comment

337
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,360
about sort of like what we need now instead of this moment, this anthropocene moment,

338
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,120
so many people don't really understand that science is the creation of factual knowledge.

339
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,880
That's even that sort of basic beyond sort of-

340
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,720
You want a factual uncertainty.

341
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
Yeah, okay.

342
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:04,720
But it's a little problematic at this particular point in time when we really, I feel like

343
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:12,040
as a society we really need to start helping people understand what our certain ecological

344
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,440
moment is.

345
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,960
And you know, following up on that, it's also interesting to me to see the way that humanity

346
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,000
can, you know, the quote unquote humanities can support that.

347
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,320
There's this really great organization called the AS, the Association of Environmental Science

348
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,800
Studies, and they're really dedicated to connecting like the hard sciences to the social

349
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,960
sciences to the humanities.

350
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,040
And I wandered into, I was presenting there, but I wandered into like the wrong symposium

351
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,520
and I sat down for a while and I realized this is at American University and I realized

352
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,840
that the symposium was on geoengineering.

353
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,040
It was at American University so it was a whole bunch of policy people, their governmental

354
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,400
policy people, they were talking about geoengineering.

355
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,520
And the other thing that astounded me was that at the front of the room there was a theology

356
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:12,280
talking, a theologian talking about the way that different cultures viewed playing God.

357
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Right?

358
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Like God.

359
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Playing God.

360
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,280
God.

361
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
God.

362
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:28,560
But you know, but it was this idea that, you know, like if, you know, I mean, that these

363
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,000
kinds of considerations about like sort of what we're able to technologically do really

364
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,440
need to be supported by, you know, the sum total of, you know, human cultural production

365
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,480
in terms of what we, the understandings that different cultures have come to in terms of,

366
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,000
you know, the role of us humans in the world and it could equally apply to genomic engineering.

367
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,560
I mean, there's all kinds of different things that those sorts of questions.

368
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,600
Well, but exactly on your point, I think what the most difficult problem in, at least for

369
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,240
scientists now, I mean, we should get back to the art part of this as well too.

370
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,680
But it's a commonly quoted statistic that 48% or something of Americans don't believe

371
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
in evolution.

372
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,880
And this has taken us some terrible critique of our abject scientific literacy and there

373
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,840
were a bunch of stupid people, mostly, and things like that.

374
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,440
There's a statistic behind that that's almost never mentioned.

375
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,000
And that is that 90% of those 48 people, 48% understand evolution, at least to the level

376
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,280
of a high school, decent high school education, which is about as well as many biologists

377
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
understand it frankly.

378
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,680
And I'm going to biology department so I can tell you that first hand.

379
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,400
The point is these are people who understand evolution.

380
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,160
They're literate about evolution.

381
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,640
They're not illiterate.

382
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,400
They have made a kind of a Pascal's wager.

383
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,480
And I think it's important to understand what kind of a wager that is, what the cost is

384
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,240
of not believing in evolution.

385
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,680
The costs are considerable for many people.

386
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:59,320
Community, church, deeper held beliefs, morality, ethics, lots and lots of things.

387
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,520
And what do you get for believing in evolution?

388
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,880
Anybody tell me in here what you get for believing in evolution unless you're a biologist doing

389
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,120
a certain kind of experiment?

390
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,480
So that's not to defend intelligent design or any of the rest of that.

391
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,560
But it is to, I think, suggest that this is the deeper problem.

392
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,600
That is not just a literacy problem.

393
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,880
It's a question of why it's better, why it makes more sense to think scientifically than

394
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,200
some other way, why this makes a different kind of a world, and why we'll solve our problems

395
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,360
in the other way, we'll not solve our problems, for example, and things of that nature.

396
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,800
So far, a lot of this conversation has been about this notion of science communication,

397
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,960
I mean effectively.

398
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,680
And one of the reasons for that is because of this growing popularity, and as people were

399
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,840
talking about last night, that's clearly one way in which art and science can kind of intercept.

400
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,240
But it's by no means the only way.

401
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:10,960
I think that as the cultural volume of science continues to grow and butt up against art,

402
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,960
a lot of interesting things happen that aren't just how do we communicate a scientific idea

403
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,640
to the public in some appeasing way.

404
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,760
I mean, that's a really important question.

405
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,360
And as we say, we're in the Anthropocene age, like these questions become ever more important.

406
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,800
At the same time, there's just this cultural phenomenon that's happening.

407
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:42,440
And I'm a neuroscientist who's also a writer, and something about neuroscience kind of fundamentally

408
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:48,120
inspires me because as was mentioned earlier, scientific fields provides kind of metaphors

409
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,200
for thinking.

410
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,280
They provide a certain frame and type of language.

411
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,480
And I actually think something very, very interesting is happening here at the outskirts,

412
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:06,080
kind of in some of what we just saw, for example, those statues that used quantum superposition

413
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,280
or to kind of as a dominating metaphor.

414
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:16,200
And what that sort of work reminds me of, and that work's purpose isn't to necessarily

415
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,680
communicate anything.

416
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Right?

417
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,720
I mean, in fact, the whole point of art, and possibly as Kant said, the defining property

418
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,520
of art is that it's not normative.

419
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,880
It's some form of intellectual play.

420
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,080
Who knows exactly why we do it, but for some reason, we think that this is really, really

421
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,480
important.

422
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:40,280
And in previous historical periods, one of the things that happened was that the art reflected

423
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,320
the important and rich ideas that were out there in the culture.

424
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,360
And one example of this is art based around religion.

425
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,920
I mean, if you go to any museum, there's so much in that art that you don't understand

426
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,400
that I don't understand because we're not nearly as well versed in like deep doctrines

427
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,160
of, say, Christianity to really get what's going on in that painting and what it means.

428
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
And that meaning-

429
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Social people paid for it.

430
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Right?

431
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Well, it's also-

432
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
Exactly.

433
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,640
But for example, people, you know, if you look at frescoes or like anything else, there's

434
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,240
all these deep, deep meanings.

435
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,360
And that's because artists play around with deep meanings that are out there.

436
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:25,480
And it used to be the case that possibly, you know, name the most semiotically loaded

437
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,880
symbol of the last 500 years, you know, in Western culture, and you probably named the

438
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
cross.

439
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
Right?

440
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
What would you name today?

441
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,920
Because another alternative competing symbol for something that's just as loaded with concepts

442
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,920
and history and knowledge is the double helix of DNA.

443
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,960
And so I think that what's happening is that science, and especially as science becomes

444
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:54,720
part of the larger culture, people have developed quite literally the concepts, symbols, signs,

445
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,240
and language of science.

446
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,160
And something very interesting that's happening is that artists are beginning to play around

447
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,040
with that, just like they used to play around with the fact that everyone knew the Bible

448
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,680
backwards and forwards or all the big stories, and then they would make art based around

449
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
that.

450
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,840
And so it provides this rich vocabulary.

451
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,080
So I think that's not maybe that is in a sense elitist, it's not science communication, but

452
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,120
it's certainly something that I see happening as this science bubble expands and then it

453
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,960
kind of frogs up against the art bubble in the social sphere.

454
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,560
It's also helping us to process things that are happening in our world, new ideas, new

455
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,880
realities, new concepts we're coming across.

456
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,520
You know, you mentioned Christianity, you mentioned DNA.

457
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,520
Now we've got, you mentioned the Anthropocene, and we're trying to come to grips with ourselves

458
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,440
as a planet altering force and figure out if we can survive with that knowledge and actually

459
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,760
thrive as a part of the Earth system that we are, whether we like it or not.

460
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,800
And I do see artists now responding to that challenge.

461
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,480
It's very disturbing this notion of the Anthropocene and it's also kind of essential.

462
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,960
And so another iconic image is the image of the Earthrise from the moon, you know, has

463
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,200
gotten into our consciousness now and that's, you know, I think almost up there with DNA

464
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,440
and the cross.

465
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:19,840
And you know, this notion that we're grappling with our planetary nature is something that,

466
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,440
you know, I think is obviously there's a lot of science that we need to understand and

467
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,360
learn and communicate, but it's necessary, but not sufficient.

468
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:34,000
And I think the artistic response to that reality as a way to help us process our situation

469
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,120
and somehow gain the global maturity to deal with it is really essential.

470
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:48,480
And one thing that I see happening that I think is very exciting in that vein is the

471
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,480
tools of connectivity which are very fraught these days and are leading to all these kinds

472
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,160
of fragmentation that we're all freaked out about on the news are also being used to facilitate

473
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,480
global collaborations in really cool ways.

474
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,440
What is that, what is that, that playing for change project where people are doing these

475
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,400
musical collaborations all around the globe?

476
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,720
And you know, there are things like that where there are these sort of glimmers of some kind

477
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,680
of global aesthetic response to our inherently global problems and global reality.

478
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,360
And that is completely a new kind of artistic response that, you know, wouldn't have been

479
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,920
possible 20 years ago because we didn't have the tools to collaborate across boundaries

480
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,320
in that way.

481
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:37,080
So I think art simply as a response, like you say, to emerging ideas and emerging realities

482
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,040
that help us to process the things that maybe problems that are originating with science

483
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,120
but go so far beyond that domain.

484
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,320
So I want to jump in here but I'm going to kind of direct it towards you.

485
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:55,920
So, well, I'm directing it towards the artists in the writers in the room or in the panel.

486
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,720
We've talked a lot about science literacy, we've not talked about art literacy.

487
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Please talk about that.

488
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,400
How do we, I mean, yeah, science literacy, people make a choice to not believe in evolution.

489
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,920
Okay, that's tricky, you know, how do we deal with that?

490
00:34:10,920 --> 00:33:55,920
But most scientists at S

491
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,800
We've talked a lot about science literacy.

492
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,720
We've not talked about art literacy.

493
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,680
Please talk about that.

494
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,240
How do we, I mean, yeah, science literacy, people make a choice to not believe in evolution.

495
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,920
Okay, that's tricky.

496
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,880
You know, how do we deal with that?

497
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:16,200
But most scientists at Sitis Room don't know a darn thing about art.

498
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,000
They don't care because it doesn't affect them on a day to day basis or at least they

499
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,280
don't think it does.

500
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,320
And yet on the walls of their office are paintings that some, you know, administrator put there.

501
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,960
And if it weren't there, then they would say, huh, there's nothing on that wall.

502
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,440
You know, so how do we get not only scientists to care more about art as something that's

503
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:45,000
not like functional, something that's, you know, conti and not functional, but important.

504
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,840
And Elizabeth makes a really interesting art that merges with technology and kind of forces

505
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,960
you to confront it in a lot of ways, whether you want to or not.

506
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,760
It might be a robot plant that travels around and bumps into you.

507
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,000
So, so yeah, hearing from the writers and the artists in the table about art literacy,

508
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,160
I'd love to hear more about that.

509
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Wow.

510
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
Art literacy.

511
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,160
Yeah, that's so interesting.

512
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:18,360
And I named here I was going to talk to you about the loss of religion and art taking

513
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,160
the place of that.

514
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,200
Well, you know, one of the things that I think is really interesting and this hasn't really

515
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,040
been part of this conversation, and I'm sure I missed the conversation last night, but

516
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,360
I'm sure that a lot of this was about, you know, how art science collaboration broadens

517
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,800
the audience for science.

518
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,440
And I think also for art.

519
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,720
The thing that I'm really interested in in terms of what art can do is, you know, there's

520
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:54,120
these wonderful, Soluit wrote this great document, 25 sentences on conceptual art.

521
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:02,480
And in sentence two and three, he says, rational ideas beget rational experience.

522
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,800
And number three says, but irrational ideas lead to new experience.

523
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,600
And I really think that that's one of the things that that's one of the kind of spaces

524
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,120
that art sort of inhabits.

525
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:21,800
It sort of allows us to be in a poetic or a metaphoric or an irrational space that can

526
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,040
lead to new experiences.

527
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,720
And I just, I don't know, I find myself as an artist working with scientists, often in

528
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,280
collaboration with scientists, on asking really irrational questions.

529
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:40,720
And I think that that can really lead to all kinds of wonderful different sorts of directions,

530
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,520
both in art making and in scientific endeavor.

531
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,680
So I just kind of want to throw that out, which is that innovation, especially when

532
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,280
you're looking at different disciplines that are bumping up into each other, you know,

533
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:02,160
those kinds of irrational sorts of, you know, irrational kinds of questions or ideas are

534
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,280
such a wonderful result of that.

535
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,040
But I just kind of want to make sure that art sort of has a place at the table in terms

536
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,400
of innovation from that perspective.

537
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,680
In terms of art literacy, you know, how do you get people to look at art more, you know,

538
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,680
that I don't know.

539
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,360
I mean, maybe, you know, I feel like I'm sitting here talking about the importance of everyone

540
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,680
learning science.

541
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,400
Maybe you scientists have some thoughts about, you know, the importance of people looking

542
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
at art.

543
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:45,520
Certainly, I think that there's really no sense in which scientists have a huge literacy

544
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,040
concerning what's going on right now in our world.

545
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:53,040
I think most of it's completely opaque to them.

546
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,960
Some of that is simply because I'll be quite frank and say that a lot of the concerns of

547
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,120
art are very insular.

548
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,360
And I get to say this as a complete outsider to the community and someone who has no, you

549
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,440
know, serious background as an artist.

550
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,320
So this is just my personal opinion.

551
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,440
But I think for about 30 years, the subject of art has been art and that's a relatively

552
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,000
boring way to go without it.

553
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,120
And one of the things, one of the reasons why I'm so interested in what's going on here

554
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:36,400
is that science seems to provide, and I don't mean it in some sort of, in some sort of

555
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,560
worshipping way.

556
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,240
And I'm not actually even, I don't even mean it in terms of a communication way.

557
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,320
I mean it in terms of a, there seems to be a new set of public symbols, metaphors, and

558
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,920
so on that have come into existence that art has not spent much time playing around with

559
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,020
yet.

560
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,560
And art is really great at that.

561
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,200
Art is great at criticism.

562
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,880
Art is great at representing things in new ways.

563
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,800
And all of those are things that science needs.

564
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,040
So I think, you know, if you want to get scientists interested in art, one of the easiest ways

565
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,760
is start doing art about science and don't just do it in a way that's just, wow, this

566
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:24,000
is so amazing, do it in a way like, okay, what, you know, let me to do my interpretation

567
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,640
of what this means, right, or something along those lines.

568
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,120
Or, you know, a lot of the pieces that we saw up there are really, I think, really wonderful

569
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,920
examples of that.

570
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:41,560
But so I think part of it is on the responsibility of artists to kind of publicly engage with

571
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,800
some of these things, and I wish there was more support, open support in the artistic

572
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:53,920
community for things that are maybe a little bit more new and a little bit more out there,

573
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,200
even though, of course, given what I said previously, I think that this is a very old

574
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,200
conservative notion.

575
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,440
I mean, that in the best sense, as in, you know, art has been about nature, art has

576
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,720
been about human institutions and religion, art has been about politics and art has been

577
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,320
about art.

578
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:16,720
And, you know, art about science is, I think, very much in line with some of the things

579
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,560
that have produced some of the best art ever in the history of humankind.

580
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,440
One problem, and I think this gets to your question of, you know, why we focus so much

581
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:32,240
on communicating about science rather than communicating about art, and this was alluded

582
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:39,480
to in the panel yesterday, is that a lot of the support for these kinds of collaborations

583
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,200
comes from, certainly that I'm familiar with, comes from the world of science and this notion

584
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,840
of broader impacts, or EPO education and public outreach, where this art is kind of treated

585
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,800
as an add-on to a science project, and it doesn't come for free.

586
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,240
You have to satisfy the funding agency, why you're doing this, and a lot of it on some

587
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,520
level or another is that I'm going to, this artist is going to help me communicate the

588
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,320
science to a broader audience, and there's nothing wrong with that.

589
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,400
I'm in favor of that, but it does tend to cast things as that's the purpose of the art

590
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,160
is to teach about science, and then what about, you're asking about, well what about just

591
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,760
teaching about art?

592
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:20,080
One remedy for that, or one alternate model that I've seen being very successful is, artist

593
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,200
and residence programs.

594
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,200
NASA for a long time had this artist and residence program, I don't think they still do.

595
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,840
It's an association, they can't say residence anymore.

596
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,080
It still exists.

597
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,800
For a long time it was, I think, very successful.

598
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,440
They had this not too long ago, they had this 50 years of the NASA arts program traveling

599
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,240
exhibit that was wonderful, and they had people like Robert Rothenberg and Andy Warhol and

600
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,840
a bunch of different kinds of folk artists doing really cool stuff.

601
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,320
I don't know if it's true, but the rumor is the last one they had was Laurie Anderson,

602
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:01,160
and the art that she did was so hostile to NASA that they were like, you know what, we're

603
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
not going to do this anymore.

604
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,040
I don't want to spread rumors, but I heard that.

605
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,560
But for whatever reason, I think it's a shame.

606
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,520
I think that where you're encouraging an artist to be for a year or whatever in that environment

607
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:20,200
and respond, and there's the legacy of that is some incredibly deep work where artists

608
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,240
just responded to what NASA and what scientists were doing.

609
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,800
And the other benefit of that is that then you had these, you know, when you go to NASA

610
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,880
Ames Research Center, a place of science, you see these Rothenberg paintings of, you

611
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,920
know, of the Apollo project hanging on the walls there, you know, so it's also, so artists,

612
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,680
scientists get their hit of art from the fact that these, the legacy, the residue is still

613
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:53,200
hanging in these places, and I think that kind of project is a little bit more open

614
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,720
than the sort of broader impacts mentality at really getting artists to respond to science

615
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,120
and increasing what you might call art literacy.

616
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,480
I'm not even sure what that is among scientists and among the general public.

617
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:11,600
I was just going to ask what, I'm not absolutely clear what we mean by art literacy.

618
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,840
I'm always suspicious of it because it sounds like somebody's going to explain a joke to

619
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,400
me and now it's not going to be funny.

620
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,040
And if somebody explains a piece of artwork to me, it's not going to be really inspiring

621
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,040
to me anymore.

622
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,040
I would say I won't say a joke to you.

623
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,400
And I actually, I don't have a good answer for that, but I would start by saying you

624
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,440
guys, please build upon this.

625
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,280
What's the difference between a print and a painting?

626
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,240
Some people don't know that.

627
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,120
And I would argue that's decent information to know about.

628
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,680
I think this is where it's worth looking at the discussions that I've been having in

629
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,480
the science literacy world.

630
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,000
What David brought up and Stuart, that it's worth interrogating very closely.

631
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
What do you want people to know and why do you want them to know it?

632
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,760
And if you sort of look at the science literacy discourse, for a long time it was about people

633
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,160
need to know these facts and they need to know things.

634
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,400
And you just start adding up the sheer number of things that experts in every field feel

635
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,280
like everybody should know.

636
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,960
And very quickly it's more than you can anybody can learn in any lifetime.

637
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,440
And so you have to start asking yourself this question of like, what, when we say people

638
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,320
should know stuff, why?

639
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,560
What's the purpose of that and what are we expecting them to get out of it?

640
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,080
And taking very seriously the notion that the vast majority of people are not going to

641
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,720
know the vast majority of things.

642
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,080
And that's a math problem.

643
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,280
That is not a society problem.

644
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,760
And so I haven't been part of these discussions but I suspect that's the place to start attacking

645
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,640
this art literacy question.

646
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:44,120
So as one answer, so my answer of what bit of art literacy do I want scientists to know,

647
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,960
the one that I've chosen to attack that I want the people who work with us to understand

648
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,360
is I want them to understand the process and the training that goes into it and I want

649
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,920
them to understand it in a visceral sense.

650
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,440
And so I've been going around giving talks where I ask this question, why don't more

651
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,560
people go to science lectures as an evening activity?

652
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:08,440
And as part of this talk, I add up the number of hours of stage time that a stand-up comedian

653
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,680
accumulates before they're good enough to be invited to be the first guest for a show

654
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
for a real headliner.

655
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,440
And it's literally months standing on the stage doing this work over 10 years of time.

656
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,120
Okay, so that's the thing I want to get across but the broader point is you have to pick

657
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,200
and choose and you can't want people to know everything.

658
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,200
Well, isn't also the issue of usefulness.

659
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,880
So if I'm in a certain field where knowing between the difference between DNA and RNA

660
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,760
doesn't matter to me, I don't have to know the difference between DNA and RNA.

661
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,800
So if I'm not in a field that print or painting matters to me, why should I know about it?

662
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,560
And I think this is why process and method questions are often much more interesting

663
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,880
than specific fact type questions because those tend to be more broad and universal.

664
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,480
Yes, I would say that the place where it's most applicable, and this is something we've

665
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,160
been talking a lot about where things are applicable in science art collaboration, what

666
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:13,920
are the things that you want your scientist collaborator to know about you and vice versa?

667
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,200
At a conference about a year and a half ago with some of the people in this room, we started

668
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:23,000
to talk about is it possible and then I would have control, is it possible to create a list

669
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
of terms that every single human should know?

670
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,360
And it gets just so we can all get along better.

671
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,840
But it's unmanageable.

672
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:38,040
So how do we deal with the jargon issue is part of an issue between art and science,

673
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,920
but especially between art and society, science and society?

674
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:47,840
Speaking to your point about the art that's getting made, I think that there's a lot of

675
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,040
things, there's a lot of trends that are happening in art right now that you don't necessarily

676
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,840
see in the art market, that you don't necessarily see in galleries and that you don't necessarily

677
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,800
see in museums.

678
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:07,000
I was just at the National Socio Environmental Synthesis Center, it's a big mouthful, but

679
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:15,800
it's one of the NSF synthesis postdocs supported synthesis centers down at University of Maryland.

680
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:23,760
And I found myself telling people there's this amazing new area of community art, where

681
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,400
artists go into communities and work within communities to make stuff.

682
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,240
There's this wonderful area of relational aesthetics where people are going into place

683
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,440
and working with the things in the places.

684
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:42,920
In order for some of these postdocs who are working in applied practice, so they're modeling

685
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,840
and they're using statistics and all kinds of good stuff, but they're also trying to

686
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:52,120
figure out sort of applied practices that are applicable to their research.

687
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:59,320
And so sometimes I also find that people who need this information are not necessarily

688
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,440
interested in this information until they figure out that it's specifically applicable

689
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,000
to them or their process.

690
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,880
But lots of amazing things are happening that maybe we're not seeing in terms of what's

691
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,680
called quote unquote art in a gallery or in a museum.

692
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,880
The New York City Gallery Circuit.

693
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:24,360
Yeah, yeah, so you don't necessarily see, and yet these are how many artists today are

694
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,840
practicing.

695
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:32,840
These are some of the kinds of art that we're trying to showcase at the National Academy

696
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:38,400
of Sciences in our exhibitions and also in the Daser series.

697
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:45,840
One example that I love to talk about is the work of Matthew Schline, who is a paper engineer

698
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:50,560
and has an expertise in origami and kirigami.

699
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:56,600
And he decided he wanted to try to work with some scientists at the University of Michigan

700
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:03,720
and he was moving there and he emailed something like 30 scientists and out of that a collaboration

701
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:10,680
began where he's working with a solar panel engineer to apply the kirigami and origami

702
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:17,720
techniques to make the solar panel track the sun throughout the day and it's about 150%

703
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,520
more efficient than our regular solar panel.

704
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,400
This is the type of thing that you wouldn't see in a gallery.

705
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:30,360
You know, it could be a very meaningful collaboration that scientists would be interested in.

706
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:37,640
Another one was this video game called Fold It that anyone can play that's about the way

707
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:44,360
proteins fold and people outside of the scientific community started to play this game and were

708
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:49,720
able to actually solve some problems, I think, related to the HIV protein that scientists

709
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,760
had been puzzled by for close to 40 years.

710
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,840
So these are some of the kinds of impacts that we're trying to show to maybe make scientists

711
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,000
care a little bit more about the arts.

712
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,440
Well I think, you know, as a scientist, both in my own experience in observing the experience

713
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:16,400
of other scientists, whenever we genuinely collaborate with artists, whenever I have,

714
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,280
I always learn something new about the science, it's not just about like, oh, I'm going to

715
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,720
find a new way to tell my story.

716
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,800
And I think this is common.

717
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:32,960
When I first encountered the art of Monica and Tiger Ayala, both of who have spoken here,

718
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,000
I was really blown away because as a planetary scientist and astrobiologist I think a lot

719
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:44,760
about, you know, trying to understand comparative planetology, planetary surfaces, and comparative

720
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,520
biology life on other planets.

721
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:53,760
And then when I saw Monica's artwork where she's responding deeply to not just trying

722
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:59,480
to depict what it looks like on other planetary surfaces in a photo-realistic way, which is

723
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:05,160
what a lot of space art is, but actually trying to understand the processes and the over time

724
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:11,000
how a landscape is built up and then using different materials to somehow duplicate or

725
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,760
synthesize that in building up these 3D, you know, canvases, when I started understanding

726
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,640
her process and looking at it and thinking about it, it really made me realize new things

727
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,160
about the way planetary surfaces work and the way I was seeing them.

728
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,640
So it made me not just, I think, better at communicating but better at understanding

729
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,640
through seeing things through her lens.

730
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,440
Same with Tyler's sculpture.

731
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,560
He does these 3D amazing.

732
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,880
If you haven't seen his work, check it out, look online.

733
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:43,600
But he'll do these giant metal sculptures of some really tiny biological thing that

734
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:49,800
in real life is like this big, you know, a blade of grass or some insect piece, but

735
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,120
they don't make it, you know, 20 feet high.

736
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,560
And it looks like some alien thing and I'm like, oh, what is that?

737
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,240
And it's like, well, it's an actual duplication of this thing on just on a completely different

738
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,240
scale.

739
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,520
And it made me think about scale in a whole new way.

740
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:08,160
And when you think about life on other planets, which is what I do for a living in part, you've

741
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,080
really got to think about scale because the physics is such with a planet with different

742
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:17,520
gravity and different atmospheric pressure and all this, that some of the same shapes

743
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:23,720
and the same forms are going to manifest to solve the same biophysical problems as they

744
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,720
are solved here on Earth.

745
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,320
But it will be at different scale in response to different physical domains.

746
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:34,000
So simply seeing his artwork not only moved me in the way that I think art just for its

747
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,240
own sake does, but it made me think, wow, you know, that could actually exist if you had

748
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,600
a planet that was like that.

749
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,080
And this initial impression has led to a long and fruitful collaboration that I've had

750
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,160
with them that I think both the art and science has benefited.

751
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:53,920
So it goes so much more beyond just like a tool to communicate what we know and what

752
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,680
we think the masses need to know.

753
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,480
I was going to change the discussion completely.

754
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,880
It's might as well.

755
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,400
All right, maybe not.

756
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:13,640
So what I want to know in terms of my own personal artistic literacy from artists are

757
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,000
the kinds of things that I think are actually common to science.

758
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,520
I don't believe in the scientific method.

759
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,200
I don't believe there's any such thing as a crock or shit that we dreamt up.

760
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,360
So there's no thing where you put stuff in and you turn a crank and outcome gadgets

761
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,520
and cures and things like that, right?

762
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,640
The way scientists work is with intuition, inspiration, curiosity.

763
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,720
They make choices.

764
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,720
They rehearse.

765
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,840
They do all kinds of things that I think you would say any artist does as well.

766
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,640
I want to know how they do it.

767
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:47,880
I want to know how they treat these same sorts of ideas, these same sorts of processes, because

768
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:53,800
I think that's where there's a real connection to be made in a way that's where not only

769
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,800
for its usefulness, but because I think it's again a kind of a pluralistic approach to

770
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,040
these things that would provide value in both directions.

771
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,120
I assume artists would like to know the same thing about scientists.

772
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,680
Science is a little bit of an art.

773
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,040
Well, it's a great deal of it, really.

774
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,360
No matter what we may pretend.

775
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,480
So we've been talking, for example, mostly about, I think when we say art, we somehow

776
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,160
or another in our head get painting and sculpture, but it does include things like theater and

777
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,640
writing and performance in general dance and so forth.

778
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:33,840
And I think the uncertainty of a performance, the uncertainty in a live performance is extremely

779
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,840
important.

780
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,720
The experimentalism of a live performance especially is extremely important, although

781
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,880
I think graphic artists experiment too.

782
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:47,600
The notion of rehearsal is a kind of, to me, has a great deal in common with what we do

783
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,520
in the lab for weeks and weeks before we publish a paper on opening night.

784
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,520
You know?

785
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,600
I think it's true.

786
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:03,200
Science is in a way good because it's useful to us, but the arts are really what most of

787
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,080
us are engaged in.

788
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,120
There's a lot more engagement in art than there is.

789
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,840
In other words, everybody in this room is, I'm sure, engaged in one way or another with

790
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:18,480
art, but not everybody in this room is interested in science.

791
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,280
So art is a much bigger part of our life.

792
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,080
Well, it might be a bigger part, but it's easy to take for granted.

793
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,080
Well, that may be.

794
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,560
Like Eric was saying, you know, we've been doing art forever.

795
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,000
We don't really know why.

796
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,520
Maybe some of the neuro-esthetics fans in the room can shed light on that, but...

797
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:43,920
Certainly, everyone in this room is extremely engaged with entertainment, but it's not

798
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,920
always art.

799
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,920
I mean...

800
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,640
It's on the entertainment.

801
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,960
Yeah, absolutely.

802
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:58,160
But just very, very briefly before we move on to the next topic, it was to say that one

803
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,320
of the things that I think is important is not just saying that, okay, you have this

804
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:07,160
relationship between scientists and the public, and then you do that through science communication,

805
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:11,600
and then you have the relationship between artists and the public, and you do that through

806
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,840
science communication.

807
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,280
But I think it's very, very important to put the scientists and artists in communication

808
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,800
together, because regardless of whether or not we immediately go out and talk about the

809
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:29,680
findings, I do think that this creates a trickle-down kind of effect where the moment you have intellectual

810
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:35,480
fields put in contact with one another, there will be, at some future point, there will be

811
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,280
communication about it, there will be ideas about it.

812
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:44,800
So, you know, I think it's just as important to ask, how can we get a very good artist

813
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:50,160
and a very good scientist working together, and how can we get scientists to understand

814
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:55,480
what artists are doing and artists to understand what scientists are doing without immediately

815
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:00,760
then going to this next step of what's going to be this outcome of that?

816
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,320
How will you know a very good scientist and a very good artist?

817
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,960
I can tell you about, I'm sure the artist could tell you that.

818
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,560
It's not super undefinable.

819
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,960
So I just, I have to tell you guys, when I saw that I was on a panel called Art and

820
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,960
Science in Society, I thought, oh no, because we're going to be asked to answer, you know,

821
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,760
we're going to be asked to, you know, cure all of these societal ills.

822
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,760
I thought, ah, this is going to be really rough.

823
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,600
And then I noticed that there were two panels.

824
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,640
I noticed that there was one before the other one, and I thought, ah, the first one has

825
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,240
these wonderful opportunities to bring up all these problems.

826
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,240
And then you get out here.

827
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,520
And then you kick into panel number two.

828
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:45,280
So I'm just curious, like what are you guys, I mean, you know, in terms of society, what

829
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,320
do you guys think that we can answer?

830
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,560
What should we be answering right now in terms of art and science collaboration and, you

831
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,320
know, society at large?

832
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,000
What could be, what could we or should we be doing?

833
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,440
Well, people, I mean, we have some real problems in our society, and artists in science

834
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,800
collaborate and cannot solve them all, but I think we can actually play an important

835
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,800
role.

836
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:14,960
People are alienated from these sources of creativity and these sources of knowledge.

837
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:21,440
And we also are at a time of somewhat of crisis in our world right now.

838
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:28,160
And so if we can, you know, any form of communication where you're getting people to think about

839
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:35,160
the big picture of our existence and how we relate to the planet and the universe is,

840
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,440
we're contributing to the solution.

841
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,800
We're helping to save the world, I think.

842
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:46,280
And I'll just give you an example of something I've been involved in.

843
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,680
I have this group called the House Band of the Universe.

844
00:58:51,680 --> 00:59:00,880
And it's a band, a musical group, but one of the band members is a visual projectionist.

845
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,440
And we only play in planetariums.

846
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:13,080
And the part of the content is, well, we use a software called Uniview where you can drive

847
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,880
through the entire universe through any data set.

848
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:20,760
It's very powerful from the cosmic microwave background right up to the latest information

849
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,480
from New Horizons at Pluto and Solar System and seamlessly drive through it.

850
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,520
This has been used a lot in educational programs, which is great.

851
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,680
But when we get the band in there and we do this spoken word component about the history

852
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:38,240
of the universe, we tend to get a different kind of crowd in there.

853
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,680
And I think it's very successful.

854
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:46,760
People are thrilled and I think they learn some science, but that's not really the goal

855
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,200
is like they should go away knowing some facts.

856
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,680
In fact, we've evaluated it in that way because it helps us to get some funding.

857
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,000
But they also, clearly, people are inspired.

858
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,320
But also the musicians, the artists have an outlet.

859
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,720
And they get to be in an environment where they don't normally play.

860
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:09,560
And then a sonic environment too, because a sphere is a very weird and challenging sonic

861
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,840
environment as well.

862
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,800
I mean, a hemisphere, a dome.

863
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,520
And I think it's a case where the hall has been very much greater than the sum of the

864
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,520
parts.

865
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,760
And people leave their feeling inspired and they've learned something and they've been

866
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,240
exposed to some art.

867
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,000
And there's a sort of ecstatic thrill of like, well, I was going to this thing.

868
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,600
I didn't know what it was going to be.

869
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,880
It wasn't a science lecture.

870
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,400
It wasn't a normal concert.

871
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,440
Now I'm leaving and I still don't know what it was.

872
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,360
But I feel great.

873
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:48,120
And I feel maybe even a little bit more committed to trying to spread the word that we live

874
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:52,120
on a planet and we have to deal with it as a planetary species.

875
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,120
So I don't know.

876
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:59,000
I just think that when you actually do these things, that magic can happen that is very

877
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,640
useful.

878
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,640
We are...

879
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,800
I hate to cut you off.

880
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,720
We are going to open it up for questions now from the audience.

881
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:12,240
If you have a question, please line up at the microphone behind me.

882
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,080
And emphasis on the question part.

883
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,880
We love, love your comments.

884
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,280
But you can comment all you want over at lunch, too.

885
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,680
We want to get in some good questions before we take a break.

886
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,680
Great.

887
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,680
Hi.

888
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,680
I'm Patricia Oléna.

889
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,960
I'm the director of the Graduate School of Art at Washington University in St. Louis.

890
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:40,000
And I co-host the Leonardo laser events with Ellen Levy here in New York every six weeks.

891
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,840
And I'm also part of this group called the Alliance for the Arts and the Research Institutions.

892
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,160
So for those of you who have sort of seen me at some of these meetings, you know that

893
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:54,040
what I'm really passionate about is kind of articulating a position for the intrinsic

894
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,960
value of the arts.

895
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:04,480
There's so much talk, particularly in academic circles about arts service to other disciplines.

896
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:10,560
And although I understand why, you know, the kind of quantification and the data that goes

897
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,120
with that is very important, especially if you're writing a grant.

898
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:19,800
I do think that the other side of that has to be balanced out in the art that we as artists

899
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,560
have to do a much better job of articulating what it is that we do.

900
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:27,960
So getting back to, I'm sorry, your name.

901
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:37,960
Eric's comments about, you know, art being sort of focused very inwardly on itself and

902
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,400
the example of the sort of the painting on the wall.

903
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,320
I think this is a common kind of misconception, especially within academic circles, the function

904
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,280
of artists to beautify walls, right?

905
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:52,520
Nobody ever really talks about what art does, right?

906
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:57,840
It's the more, it gets relegated strictly to the realm of the aesthetic.

907
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:03,400
And there's not enough focus, in my opinion, on what it is that art does, not what does

908
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,200
it look like, but what it actually does.

909
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,960
And I think if we can focus more on that, I think that this will really help to expand

910
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,840
the conversation.

911
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:16,120
So I'll be speaking at 215, a little bit about my role in a medical humanities program as

912
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,120
well.

913
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,640
But I'm wondering if any of you want to comment on the institutions that you work at and how

914
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:28,400
focusing on what art does, I hope that wasn't me, what art does rather than what art, you

915
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,240
know, what the aesthetic properties are, but what it does, especially when it comes into

916
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,680
contact with other disciplines.

917
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,440
I would love to hear other comments on that.

918
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,960
I would love to think that, and actually this is something to something I wanted to mention

919
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:48,680
this to you while we were talking in terms of like, you know, the importance of art.

920
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,480
As an artist, I always feel like I can't function.

921
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:57,120
I'm an advisor at the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Rutgers, which is a platform

922
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:02,040
for the artistic use of computer vision and machine learning.

923
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:08,280
And I can't make my art unless I have collaborators in other fields that allow me to function.

924
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:13,600
So I can't even make art unless I have all of this other wonderful support.

925
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:19,320
So I always kind of feel like I'm sort of in this weird situation where I am really appreciative

926
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:23,560
of all of these other wonderful disciplines that allow me to even function.

927
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,640
But in terms of what art does, I was just kind of, when we were talking about this, my

928
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:31,720
undergraduate background is cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

929
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:36,280
But I realized that when you make a piece of art, you can communicate things that are

930
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:39,560
very difficult to communicate otherwise.

931
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,600
You can make a statement that is contradictory.

932
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:48,080
You can make something that is simultaneously beautiful and ugly at the same moment.

933
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:53,080
And you know, conceptually, I just, when I figured that out, I was so extraordinary

934
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:59,520
that you can communicate things and in ways that you can't do in other kinds of disciplines.

935
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,280
So that's just one of the things that I wanted to sort of offer up as this funny little

936
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:07,880
thing that might be a little different.

937
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,200
I don't know if anybody else wants to take Patricia's question.

938
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:19,880
As a biologist, don't you think there is some connection between art and emotion?

939
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:26,480
I don't think you have to be a biologist to feel that.

940
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,840
You know, being elitist now.

941
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:35,240
There was no, but when there was the Matisse show at the moment a couple years ago.

942
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,240
There was what?

943
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,000
Matisse show at the moment.

944
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:44,160
And I heard from a number of people that no matter how you felt when you got there, by

945
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,880
the time you left the show, you felt calm.

946
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,400
You felt peaceful.

947
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:57,360
So I'm just wondering that what that role of art is an important role in our lives.

948
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,520
And I just wondered from your perspective what?

949
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:05,680
I mean, I don't have an answer to that, but I feel it's a little bit of telling the person

950
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,360
the meaning of the joke problem.

951
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:10,240
I mean, in a way, we should be happy that that's the way it works.

952
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:15,880
So I don't know that we need to understand the underlying neuroscience of why it is that

953
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,480
I don't think that we'll add to art one.

954
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:20,840
I mean, I think it's one of the big problems right now with the neuro-hyphen everything

955
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:26,720
in the world that neuroscience is about to explain law, ethics, humanity, arts, writing,

956
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,080
all this other stuff.

957
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,920
And I'm not interested in those explanations for the most part.

958
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:35,560
I mean, they may be okay, but I don't think it will add any one thing at all or an ounce

959
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,560
of anything to any of those areas in my opinion.

960
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:46,480
But in terms of evolution and in terms of the presence of art in the history of mankind,

961
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,320
there is a particular role that that plays.

962
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:55,040
Well, I mean, I think there are a lot of people that make the case, and I think it's generally

963
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:01,440
maybe even well accepted now, that graphics preceded language necessarily.

964
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,040
That you first paint a deer on the cave before you have a word for deer, which is a significant

965
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:09,520
abstraction from just representing the deer.

966
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:14,400
But representing the deer is the beginning of an abstraction and that we could never

967
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,720
have developed the language that's allowing us to have this talk today without it.

968
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,800
So yes, you could say that it precedes it.

969
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:26,440
I want to just very briefly say that there's a bit of a linguistic thing going on here

970
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:32,480
if we say that the aesthetics of art is just how something looks on a wall.

971
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,240
Saying that art doesn't have to have a function doesn't mean that it's non-causal.

972
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,280
It doesn't mean that it's epiphenomenal.

973
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:43,480
It means that there doesn't have to be an express outcome for this thing that you're

974
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,240
generating, and it doesn't have to have a particular use in the world.

975
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:51,080
And many argue that is the fundamental definitional aspect of art.

976
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:56,440
Of course, it ends up causing experiences, causing change in the world, causing all these

977
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,440
ramifications, right?

978
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,960
But it is definitely true that at least if you look at the history of art, there was

979
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:11,240
a period where both representation of just other things kind of really went out the

980
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,040
window for a period of time.

981
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,880
And one of the things that's happening with science and art is that because science is

982
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:21,280
literally the stuff out there in the world, definitially, or, well, I could talk about

983
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:25,800
arguing about that, but clearly we think of things that way.

984
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:32,320
It provides this new way that you representational art that I think is really unique and novel.

985
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:37,040
So I think we're at the dawn in a lot of ways of understanding what the actual impacts

986
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,040
of art are on learning, on behavior, on emotion, on lots of things.

987
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:46,280
But I want to put out a little bit of a model here to ask you to react to it.

988
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:53,000
So if we take as a point of departure, Eric's point at the beginning of this panel, about

989
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,640
the explosion of science and the impact of that, let's take that a step further and say

990
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:04,840
that we live in a world which is heavily and increasingly defined by the products of science.

991
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:10,080
And that shapes our experience, our life, our culture, many, many things about how we live

992
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,640
and how we behave.

993
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:17,920
Okay, so in that environment, there are maybe, here I'll kind of borrow from Rogers fuzzy

994
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:24,080
taxonomy a little bit, there may be three ways that we might think about that, how art fits

995
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,160
into all of that.

996
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:29,480
The first is that art can kind of help us understand it better.

997
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:34,080
And so that embraces, but it's not limited to science communication because it also then

998
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:38,600
touches on understanding what the implications of that are and what that might mean to us

999
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,040
as humans.

1000
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,320
And so then there's the second level.

1001
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:48,040
So this world that we're living in where science is and its products are driving our

1002
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:54,560
society is requiring behaviors of us which we don't necessarily have high levels of

1003
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,280
skill and development for.

1004
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:00,440
And in some cases, maybe at odds with our evolutionary heritage.

1005
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:06,960
So art, and as we begin to understand more about how art actually impacts us, we'll learn

1006
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,920
more about this.

1007
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:12,400
Art can help us with that in lots of different ways.

1008
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,640
And so there's that second level.

1009
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:20,000
Then of course there's the third level which goes beyond that which is so if the products

1010
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,240
of science are driving us in directions which are beneficial but also troublesome in many

1011
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:30,680
ways can co-creation between art and science be a way of addressing that.

1012
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,720
So I think of that as a little bit of a framework and I kind of want to throw that out there

1013
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,880
and see what you think about that.

1014
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:42,360
I'll take that a little bit and tie it to the answer of a couple previous questions of

1015
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:47,280
what the function A function of art and society is.

1016
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:53,360
Which is I think one of the things that gets missed a lot in the sort of the traditional

1017
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:58,600
psychomart mode, particularly the ones funded by science agencies, is that one of the best

1018
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:05,160
things art can do for science is to critique and to critique and to ask very hard questions.

1019
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:12,360
I agree with your premise that, and Eric's, that one of the defining features of now is

1020
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,000
that our experience is mediated by science and technology.

1021
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,200
And I would go a step further and say it is absolutely essential that art engage with

1022
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:25,280
that in a way that really wrestles with important questions.

1023
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:29,440
And if you want to, you know, you can point at very specific things where, you know, you've

1024
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:33,640
got Elon Musk building a program to send us to Mars.

1025
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:38,440
And this whole discussion happens very often in a science and technology environment where

1026
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:43,520
you're not bringing in people looking at the social aspects of that and the ethics of it.

1027
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,640
And so I feel like there's two functions art can do that in that environment.

1028
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,480
One is the direct critique, you know, make a parody of Elon Musk or whatever.

1029
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,560
I come from the comedy world.

1030
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,560
That's what I would do.

1031
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,160
But I, there's other ways to do it, obviously.

1032
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:00,120
And then, but the other thing to do is to try and chip away at this barrier because one

1033
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:05,120
of the reasons we don't critique science and engineering is that it is viewed as this thing

1034
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,480
that is walled off and that there is no access to.

1035
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:12,400
And that's where the value of the access oriented part of this science communication

1036
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:17,440
and art, et cetera, stuff comes in is making it possible for those critiques to happen

1037
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:31,360
by convincing people that it isn't this high priesthood that can only comment on these

1038
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,520
things.

1039
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:38,480
Hi, again, as a member of the next panel on science and art and society, I'm going to

1040
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,720
feed forward to what we would feed back later if we had time machine development.

1041
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:46,280
There's anyway, so thank you for the provocation.

1042
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,880
So what do you think of this?

1043
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,880
I'm putting together how to deal with the jargon issue, the knowing too many things,

1044
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:59,360
lists of everything someone should know issue, together with preaching to the choir issue,

1045
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:03,000
which is no matter how wonderful it is, we still do.

1046
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,320
And the alienation from science and art, these are all kind of related to me.

1047
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:17,880
So coming at it this way, ethno science, the things that people have done way before even

1048
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:23,000
writing was invented that make things work for us, ecologies and so forth.

1049
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,280
NASA and other agencies have had some projects with this in the past where, for example,

1050
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,200
they worked with people in the northern regions and the arctic regions to figure out different

1051
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:36,080
ways of seeing snow and ice so they could then better map and model using the data from

1052
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,080
satellites.

1053
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,160
Great, how was that done?

1054
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:42,160
And this is the answer to all those previous questions, the public.

1055
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:47,600
They basically hung out in the community for months, weeks, whatever, to get through lots

1056
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:53,360
of things like what's the problem here, what's life, and then finally getting to even metaphysical,

1057
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:59,280
maybe epistemological question, and then finally getting to the sea and the ice and all that,

1058
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,560
the actual ice colors.

1059
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:06,760
They were working with people who were not scientists and not artists, but they came

1060
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,840
out with some really good stuff.

1061
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:11,360
And that's kind of the answer to what I'm thinking here.

1062
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:19,480
The best context for art and science coming together is the public one.

1063
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,720
And that brings me to the other thing I left out.

1064
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:25,840
Art is free from rationality, which is the beautiful thing about the public.

1065
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,480
The public is free from the rest.

1066
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:34,240
Because we see so much today, very free from rationality, and they can say contradictory

1067
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:38,040
things and it becomes a news story and it becomes a president and that's just the way

1068
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,760
we live.

1069
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,480
And that's normal, that's totally has always been that way.

1070
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,120
So you know, work with it, right?

1071
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:51,600
So anyway, I'm thinking the public sphere, those synthesis center kind of things.

1072
01:14:51,600 --> 01:15:00,520
So how would that work if we were to at every scale find some public that wants something

1073
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:05,000
done with their community and they know their community and whatever the hell that is that

1074
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,120
they would like?

1075
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:09,680
And then artists and scientists get together around that and then kind of work with these

1076
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,360
people and whatever the result is, who cares?

1077
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,360
You don't know that in advance.

1078
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,600
It's going to be messy and stupid and then something's going to come out of it and everyone's

1079
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,520
going to be happy if they listen to the public.

1080
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,560
And because the brilliant scientists and artists have time to talk to each other about all

1081
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,760
that.

1082
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:30,920
So I think the keyword or a keyword, it's a great point.

1083
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,200
You make a great question.

1084
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,680
A keyword is listen.

1085
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:44,200
And we can do those community projects in different places where we don't normally maybe

1086
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,920
do science projects and work with communities.

1087
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:54,160
But we have to get away from a mindset that I think is pretty endemic in the scientific

1088
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:59,960
community and shed some of our arrogance and shed some of our sense that we're bringing

1089
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:06,640
the word from on high to work really successfully with the community like that requires a lot

1090
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,640
of humility and requires a kind of radical listening where you're willing to not be

1091
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,840
efficient and that's a little hard where you're getting paid to do something.

1092
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:20,440
You're going to spend some time being purposely a little bit aimless and just listening.

1093
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,160
I'll give you an example of something that I think was very successful.

1094
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,920
I was part of something for a few summers.

1095
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,560
I wish it was still ongoing.

1096
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:36,960
Called the NASA and the Navajo Nation Summer Space Camp with middle school students.

1097
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:37,960
And we collaborated.

1098
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,680
We had a few NASA scientists.

1099
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:48,800
I was one of them and a few Navajo elders and a medicine man and about 20 middle schoolers.

1100
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,400
And we spent a couple weeks traveling around the Navajo Nation together going to different

1101
01:16:53,400 --> 01:17:01,320
landscapes, learning the cultural stories of the land, teaching our perspective on the

1102
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:06,240
scientific stories of the land, listening a lot, everybody learning a lot.

1103
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:12,880
And then in the middle school kids synthesized all of this with art projects in which they

1104
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:19,280
combined the stories, the scientific and the cultural stories.

1105
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,360
And they were really, really powerful.

1106
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,560
Like one group of, and the kids collaborated to do this.

1107
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,040
So one group of middle school kids made a, you know, the Navajo cradle boards when a

1108
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,120
child was born is this whole symbolic thing.

1109
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:35,360
So they made the cradle board, but it was also the story of the universe with, you know,

1110
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,040
the big bang and all this stuff.

1111
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:41,920
And another group of these middle school kids, they synthesized this volcanic site we went

1112
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,640
to, which we told them about basalt flows and this and that.

1113
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:49,000
But their traditional story is that the basalt flows are the giant's blood because they're

1114
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,480
with these, this battle of giants.

1115
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,840
So they did this diorama that had the giants battling in their blood spilling out.

1116
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,600
And then it was also basalt flow.

1117
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,560
And it was just, it was tremendous.

1118
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,720
We all learned so much.

1119
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:04,400
But it wouldn't have worked if we had gone in there with the attitude like, these are

1120
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,560
the points we're going to teach.

1121
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,280
And this is our time scale.

1122
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,720
And at the end, you will be able to be quizzed on this knowledge and you'll be able to learn

1123
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:11,720
it.

1124
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,800
You know, you have to listen and you have to be open to the fact that you're going to

1125
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,800
learn as much as anybody else.

1126
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:23,040
Just a quick comment about artistic literacy.

1127
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:27,880
I ran a little round table a couple of years ago about art and science at Emory University.

1128
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:32,440
And one of the people at the table, the surgeon, and said, you know, well, I'm an artist as

1129
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,440
well.

1130
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,040
I'm an artist at the table got infuriated.

1131
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:41,760
That's like me saying I've dissected a few frogs, so I'm a surgeon.

1132
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:48,400
And so without getting into the realm of elitism, I do want to point out that the elephant in

1133
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,560
the room is that art and science are not on a level playing field.

1134
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:56,160
And an example of that is that we teach science K through 12 and into universities.

1135
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:59,440
And it's required in most of those grades.

1136
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:04,560
And we stop teaching art in what, maybe fourth grade depending on the whatever the school

1137
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,680
district is.

1138
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:09,520
And if you look at funding amounts, the National Endowment for the Arts and National Science

1139
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:14,960
Foundation, you can add zeros to NSF and to DARPA grants.

1140
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,400
So that's my comment.

1141
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:25,120
So my question, sort of reflection, is sort of picking up at this topic of listening.

1142
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:29,400
I'm starting up an art and science residency program in the Appalachians called Art Science

1143
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,120
in Field as if center.

1144
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,600
You can go there as if dot center.

1145
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,360
Our residency program starts this March.

1146
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,520
That's my little plug.

1147
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:41,220
And it's in a sort of cosmopolitan part of the Appalachian that's very near to Pennland

1148
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,640
School of Crafts, where right over the mountains from where Black Mountain College used to

1149
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,000
be, Matthew Schline was actually at Pennland this summer.

1150
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,320
There are a lot of makers in the area that come from other places.

1151
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:55,840
But nevertheless, that 48% of people who don't believe in evolution, a lot of those people

1152
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,200
are my neighbors.

1153
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,160
And so it presents a problem.

1154
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,800
I don't want to exist in a vacuum.

1155
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:06,080
I don't want to be this jewel of wonderfulness in the middle of, quote unquote, nowhere.

1156
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,560
I want to actually have relationships with the community.

1157
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:14,920
And so one of the things I'm thinking about approaching this is, well, there are three

1158
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:15,920
things.

1159
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,200
This is an area that's sort of tribal.

1160
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,560
I thought, you know, I'm from the south.

1161
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:22,640
I can just breeze right in and I'll blend in after a couple of years.

1162
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:27,000
But actually, people have been in that community for like eight to ten generations.

1163
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,200
They all know each other.

1164
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,840
They're like 30 last names that are in the county.

1165
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,440
And there's like this real sense of, you know, not from here.

1166
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,160
And so there's this tribalism.

1167
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,440
And I've thought like finding an ally within the community who's from there who can sort

1168
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:47,960
of like help to, you know, approach people and help tell our story and present our work

1169
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,280
is a real important thing.

1170
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:54,640
And then the other two things are that people are more the older generations than younger

1171
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:55,640
generations.

1172
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,960
They're tied to the land, tied to place.

1173
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:03,760
And that's a lot of what this art science center is about is like art science plus nature,

1174
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,000
you know, being this southern Appalachians, which is incredibly biologically diverse and

1175
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,200
interesting geology.

1176
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,800
So that pride of place is another way to tap in.

1177
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,400
And the third one is that, you know, there's a sense of independence.

1178
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:22,760
And like as much as people from that region are they value authority from the church,

1179
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:25,560
they do not value authority from the federal government.

1180
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,800
And this kind of goes back to their Scottish roots and, you know, a lot of history.

1181
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:35,280
But that sense of DIY that, you know, makers have and that scientists have and trying to

1182
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,280
use that.

1183
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:43,080
And so I guess my question is like looking for wisdom about dealing with difficult, almost

1184
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:49,520
sometimes hostile audiences to science and like what are some approaches for tackling

1185
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,120
that challenge?

1186
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:58,120
Anybody up for it?

1187
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:05,840
There is a growing literature on this that is run by people who describe themselves as

1188
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,120
studying the science of science communication.

1189
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:14,640
Dan Kahan, Yale, I am utterly blanking on everyone else's name, but he has a blog where

1190
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:15,640
he lists these people.

1191
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:21,520
And there's no magic bullet, of course.

1192
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,440
You know, it's lots and lots and lots of hard work.

1193
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,520
But they have identified things.

1194
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:30,240
And it's like David's point or no, sorry, Stuart's point about people actually do understand

1195
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:31,320
how evolution works.

1196
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:37,080
And so learning things like, you know, if your approach is to teach them evolution, you're

1197
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,240
going to fail.

1198
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,920
And so they've learned a number of things like this.

1199
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:46,920
And to be honest, it feels like they're about 2% of the way we need to be, but it's growing.

1200
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:53,200
I feel like we need a panel just for that question.

1201
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,200
Honestly.

1202
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,080
I'm Patricia Miranda.

1203
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,720
I'm an artist and an educator and curator.

1204
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:03,000
I've done a lot of work with my own work with art and science.

1205
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,160
And I teach in a BFA and MFA program and also develop K through 12 programming, steam-based

1206
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:11,000
programming in New York City and the tri-state area, especially.

1207
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,300
But I wanted to just push back a little bit on some of the art conversation, which I thank

1208
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:20,400
you for Patricia's starting that pushback.

1209
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,280
I felt a little bit like the conversation about art in this panel has been kind of like

1210
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,320
a poor stepchild or the poor relation a little bit.

1211
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:31,600
And I just want to echo what Patricia was saying about art having a value of its own.

1212
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,400
I think you've mitigated some of those since she got up and said that.

1213
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,600
But I also think this idea of artistic literature.

1214
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,120
I want to, literacy, I want to push back on that too with all due respect.

1215
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,320
I don't think it's the artist's fault.

1216
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:47,200
I don't think that artists are making art about art and that that's an isolated thing.

1217
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:51,880
I think that the aesthetic and the formal are always unfolded by the social throughout

1218
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,320
history in every instance of art making.

1219
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:58,840
So those frescoes that you may, that we may not understand is not necessarily only because

1220
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:02,760
we may not understand all of the Christian symbolism, but also because it's unfolded

1221
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,560
by the social of the time.

1222
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,400
And so there's an entire culture built into those paintings which were didactic and they

1223
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:13,320
had certain functions that it's invisible to us and we'll never know because we can't

1224
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,480
enter a medieval mind or Renaissance mind.

1225
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:20,840
And I would also say that I could take any of you to Chelsea tomorrow and give you an

1226
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:24,680
well, tomorrow, not tomorrow, it's Sunday, but I could take you to through Chelsea and

1227
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:29,440
show you artists that are deeply, deeply engaged with the issues of the day and that

1228
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,280
maybe it's not getting out into the mainstream culture in that direct way, but it filters

1229
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:38,600
down even to like Doho Se's painting work appearing in like a Drake video or something

1230
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,600
like that.

1231
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,000
So I think that there are artists that are in conversation with each other, they're in

1232
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,720
their conversation with art history and they're in a conversation with all of culture.

1233
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:50,800
So you can just think of the Carol Walker, sorry not the Carol Walker.

1234
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,760
Well, yes, you can think of Carol Walker as an artist who's done that, but the Dana

1235
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:59,520
Schutz Emmett Till painting controversy if you know about that or the Sam Durant scaffolding

1236
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,840
at the Walker Art Museum, these are two things that created enormous, enormous discourse

1237
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,720
that bled out.

1238
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:09,880
Maybe it is this kind of core community that's having the depth of the conversation, but

1239
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:14,400
it does filter out and I've had these conversations with my students over and over again.

1240
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:19,120
So framing it as the aesthetic and the formula always unfolded by the social is one of the

1241
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,960
sort of pedagogies that I've developed.

1242
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:24,600
And I developed a pedagogy of critique based on, you know, critique is something that in

1243
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,640
the art world we do all the time.

1244
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:31,840
But to help artists and professional artists I work with a lot in developing a critical

1245
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:37,160
language to be able to communicate what they're doing in their work without it dissecting,

1246
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,280
trying to do the thing where you're like, what does this mean?

1247
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:40,280
Well, who cares?

1248
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,280
Right?

1249
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,000
It's not about why, it's never about why, it's about what?

1250
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
What is happening?

1251
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
What is the art doing?

1252
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,120
Because even a painting on the wall is a verb, right?

1253
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,800
It's in action, it's in dialogue and it's in discourse.

1254
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,800
And I think that people don't understand that about art, not because artists are not doing

1255
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:59,800
it, but because we don't teach art in the schools in such a way that discourse like

1256
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:04,640
someone just said before that science is taught K through 12 and art is not.

1257
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:09,040
So it's a constant, constant conversation that we're having.

1258
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:13,560
And I think in the pedagogy that I work in, it is about developing a critical language

1259
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:19,160
that communicates those things without dissecting them into sort of, you know, if you dissect

1260
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,120
the frog you understand the frog, right?

1261
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,120
We don't.

1262
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,120
You can dissect the frog and understand many things, but you still don't understand the

1263
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,920
frog, so the same thing is true of art.

1264
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,640
So I just wanted to push back on that.

1265
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,640
Sure, sure, sure, absolutely.

1266
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:35,240
We'll have a good short time.

1267
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,440
Yeah, let me briefly comment on that.

1268
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:44,520
So you know, I completely agree, I was speaking specifically to science literacy among, sorry,

1269
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,920
artistic literacy among scientists.

1270
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,920
So you know, it is certainly true, I mean, there are many-

1271
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,640
But that's a cultural thing, right?

1272
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:56,720
It's not embedded in the culture of education in a way that a scientist would come up.

1273
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:02,400
So I worked in Europe this past last semester and it is much more-

1274
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,120
Art's not perfect, of course, but much more embedded in the culture that people are learning

1275
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,240
about art the same way they're learning about wine or food, you know what I mean?

1276
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:15,000
It's considered this kind of larger conversation that you're all a part of as a citizen.

1277
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,160
And so, yeah.

1278
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:18,320
It's not here.

1279
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:22,960
It's very siloed, you know.

1280
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,080
Hey, hello.

1281
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:31,480
So I wanted to push on for a second the society part of this panel and, specifically, unfortunately,

1282
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:36,480
politics.

1283
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:46,000
So as was just said, artists are very engaged in political issues these days and more than

1284
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,160
ever.

1285
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:52,640
But I'm curious, my question for the panel is, what is the responsibility, the unique

1286
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:56,240
responsibility of scientists politically?

1287
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:03,080
In my opinion, very quickly, is- There's sort of too often a sort of view from nowhere

1288
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:07,640
in neutrality that's mixed with a little bit of elitism.

1289
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:13,600
And I worry sometimes that the best we can do is like make signs for the climate march

1290
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:20,480
and get out in kind of a way that could be construed as elitism when you're just sort

1291
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,520
of presenting the facts and hoping for the best.

1292
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:29,080
And then one other example I want to mention was last year during the campaign, the heat

1293
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:35,200
of the campaign, Neil deGrasse Tyson, made this unfortunate idea, I think, called- Why

1294
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:39,000
why don't we all just live in a world called Rachinalia?

1295
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,320
And then I think some of the new atheist people made T-shirts and it was this whole thing.

1296
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,320
Like really?

1297
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,120
Okay, so anyway, that's my question for you guys.

1298
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:52,760
I thought that was bad and I think it speaks to a certain kind of elitism that was talked

1299
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,160
about earlier.

1300
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:59,560
What should scientists be doing politically or what should they not be doing?

1301
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:05,200
Yeah, it's a fair question and it's a difficult one, of course, and something I- A lot of my

1302
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:10,040
colleagues have been involved in discussions of that for a long time and you're right,

1303
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:14,840
we were sort of trained, brought up with this idea that science is value neutral, which

1304
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,240
of course is- it's not.

1305
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:21,920
And it gets us off the hook in a way that we're really not.

1306
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,960
But the opposite extreme of that is an interesting question.

1307
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,320
Should scientists be activists?

1308
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,400
And there's danger there too.

1309
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:36,200
You don't want to enslave your- when you're actually practicing science, you don't want

1310
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:40,880
to enslave, you don't want to have an outcome that you're seeking to try to make a point.

1311
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,040
I can give you examples of science that is aired in that way because- oh, if I only had

1312
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:48,440
this result, it would help strengthen this political thing that I think is important.

1313
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:49,720
That's dangerous too.

1314
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:54,080
So there's no simple answer to this, but it's obviously not we just pretend we're from

1315
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,720
on high disengaged.

1316
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:06,440
One thing that I will say is that there is a genuine power and I think radicalism to

1317
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:10,240
telling the truth about the world the way we really see it.

1318
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:15,720
In other words, when you see the Earth from space, you don't see national borders.

1319
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:24,280
You know that macroeconomics as it is described by economists is wrong fundamentally because

1320
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:29,920
it doesn't include ecology and notions of natural limits and so forth.

1321
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:37,560
You understand that the world is a place of deep cycling, of elements and energy that

1322
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,200
we're embedded in those cycles.

1323
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:45,480
So there is a radicalness to just simply teaching things about the world that we've learned

1324
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:49,640
that we need to integrate to be successful as a species.

1325
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:52,920
And if that's a political act, then I'm guilty of it.

1326
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,680
Something very quickly about this?

1327
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,680
Okay, very quickly.

1328
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:56,680
We're at time.

1329
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:00,040
I actually don't agree with you largely about this.

1330
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:05,480
Some of it's okay, but I think the job of science and society now is to be optimistic.

1331
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:10,400
That may sound like a crazy thing to say today, but I think we completely blew the climate

1332
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,400
change thing.

1333
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,280
I think it's a scientist fault that it's as screwed up as it is because we took this

1334
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:21,960
thing, we have made it a kind of a finger wagging problematic issue for everybody.

1335
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:25,160
You've got to get on board with this or there's something wrong with you.

1336
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,520
My opinion is we should have said, you know what?

1337
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:31,760
We have these amazing new technologies from space and geology and elsewhere.

1338
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,000
We have learned that the planet is warming up.

1339
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,920
This is potentially dangerous.

1340
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:36,920
Guess what?

1341
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:37,920
We're great at this.

1342
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:38,920
We can solve this.

1343
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:39,920
We got to the moon.

1344
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:40,920
We can solve this too.

1345
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,360
We just need to work on this.

1346
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:46,880
And then it's a kind of a, you know, there's a sense of optimism, maybe it's foolish optimism

1347
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,040
or whatever.

1348
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:51,560
But to me, this is the way you garner social activity with science.

1349
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,320
I actually agree with you completely.

1350
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:57,800
Perhaps you misunderstood me that I do think that there is also kind of an optimism that

1351
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:02,800
comes from that global long-term view that you can see that we've actually confronted

1352
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,720
problems like this before.

1353
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:06,720
And many times.

1354
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,760
I'm going to have to go off to the street before people are starving.

1355
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:15,200
But a great conversation over lunch and to be continued for sure.

1356
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,400
Everyone, we don't have time.

1357
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:18,400
Very quick.

1358
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:23,400
Oh, questions for lunch.

1359
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,400
Questions for lunch.

1360
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:28,760
So I have a really provocative question.

1361
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:34,920
If we're not really, if we're being honest with ourselves, is it not the role of art

1362
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:41,680
in science, collaborations to glorify and help us worship science?

1363
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:44,760
Science has kind of taken the role of the church in our society.

1364
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:49,480
And we erect these huge buildings with magnificent architecture that we get architects in.

1365
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:54,720
And we commission sculptures and statues like the ones we saw that sit in and around our

1366
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,360
scientific spaces.

1367
01:32:56,360 --> 01:33:00,520
And they become these behemoths that society can worship against.

1368
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:04,920
And art enables that worship in the same way as it did with the church.

1369
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,120
It does that, but it also does the opposite.

1370
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,880
There's the critique and bringing it down to science.

1371
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,280
Questions for lunch.

1372
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:17,080
But the part that I wanted to include is that the common vocabulary here would be art history.

1373
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:21,640
And the fact that technology made art change over the years.

1374
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:24,280
And so you start with charcoal and caves.

1375
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:30,080
And then you go into ate-tempere, you go from Mesopotamia to Egypt to Greece to Rome to,

1376
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:33,000
that's a Western focus view for sure.

1377
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,280
But in that, that's the vocabulary that we could use as commonality to cross over.

1378
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:41,320
The technology would be used to basically progress all of this.

1379
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,320
Okay.

1380
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,240
Thank you so much, everybody.

1381
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:48,200
We're going to be here with this.

1382
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,440
We are going to be back here at 215 Sharp.

1383
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:55,640
The next roundtable people, please come 10 minutes early to set up your mics.

1384
01:33:55,640 --> 01:34:07,720
So grab lunch, continue these discussions, see you in a bit.

1385
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:33,360
Bye.
