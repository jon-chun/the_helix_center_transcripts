1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
So, as you know, this is our last roundtable event.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,360
Now, we are going to do a sort of group-wide wrap-up

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,160
after this roundtable, so don't feel like this is the last chance

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,720
to ask a question or a voice, an opinion, et cetera.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,920
So, the last panel is another Science Art and Society panel,

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,040
our first panel on this topic.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,920
We talked about how to overcome elitism in the arts and sciences

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,880
and better connect with the people.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,680
You know, the people are who, you know, look at art

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,480
and engage with science, and it's important that we repair

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,520
this kind of broken relationship between science

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,480
and art, science and society and art and society.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,680
We also talked about literacy or lack thereof

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,160
for the arts and for the sciences, and so, you know,

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,480
there might be some panelists who want to continue

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,880
that conversation because I don't think we quite finish it.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,160
And we also talked about, you know, how to maintain the integrity

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,880
of art and science while trying to connect with people

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,960
who might have different ideas about what we should be studying

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,040
or what we should be making work about.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,640
So, anyways, I am going to plant a seed question as soon

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,720
as I sit down, but I will let Zach introduce our roundtable

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,360
panelists.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,240
If each panelist could raise their hand

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,120

With that, I think Julia is going to start us out

92
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,560
with a question.

93
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,600
OK, thank you, Zach.

94
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,880
So over the last couple of days, we've

95
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,600
been talking about a lot of things,

96
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,280
and I'm going to mix some of our subject matters here.

97
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
So I want to start by asking you all,

98
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,080
since I think you'll all have a kind of informed opinion

99
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,200
about this from one aspect or another.

100
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,200
How can science art collaboration help

101
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,280
repair the relationships that we're

102
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,600
talking about between art, science, and society?

103
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,480
So feel free to approach this question, as you will,

104
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,000
but with a focus on art and science working together

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,600
to do this.

106
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
I'll start.

107
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,360
Hi.

108
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,480
Just want to actually have a look at each of the people

109
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,080
that I'm talking about.

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,320
Because I woke up this morning thinking

111
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,960
how strange it was to be going to have a conversation,

112
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,480
fairly personal conversation, because that's how it feels

113
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,920
to me with people I didn't know.

114
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,720
And so for me, I find myself in the last couple of days

115
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,360
really not knowing whether I belong here.

116
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,200
I'm not sure why I'm here and whether I belong.

117
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,680
I don't know if I'm a scientist, and I don't

118
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,320
know if I'm really an artist.

119
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,840
I don't.

120
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,120
I don't know if I belong here.

121
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,600
And then I thought, well, maybe that's exactly why I belong.

122
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,000
Because if I can find a way of feeling that I belong,

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,120
then we've done our job.

124
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
And so for me, it's really about how

125
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,840
we listen to one another.

126
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,320
So most of the work that I'm involved in

127
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,880
is looking at the space that exists between people

128
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,440
and what occupies that space and what

129
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,040
shapes the space and how we can unclatter the space.

130
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,000
So when we look at art and science,

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
the question is, what is the space?

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
Is there a space between them?

133
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,720
And what can we do to take out whatever obstacles there are

134
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,320
for them to coexist?

135
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,480
So I realize people ask me, what do you do?

136
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,240
What kind of psychiatrist are you?

137
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,480
What's your specialty?

138
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,440
And I have a really hard time answering,

139
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,720
because I grew up in South Africa

140
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,000
knowing that I wanted to be an actor.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,720
And so I went to medical school.

142
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,800
And finished medical school.

143
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,560
And when a year out of medical school

144
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,280
gave that up and went to drama school in England

145
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,960
and became an actor.

146
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,760
And my life has been this endless back and forth

147
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,080
between am I an artist, am I a guest scientist?

148
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,800
Because I am a psychiatrist and I think

149
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,520
one of the big struggles of psychiatry

150
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,080
has been that it wants so badly to be a science.

151
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,280
And I don't believe that it is.

152
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,520
I mean, there are aspects to psychiatry which are science.

153
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,200
Do you know, do psychopharmacology?

154
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,320
But even that is not a science.

155
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,440
How you interact with the person

156
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,440
in such shapes whether the medications are going to work?

157
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,880
So I start with that and I say that what I would love

158
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,280
is if this conversation rather than us talking about how

159
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,440
we could create generative conversations out there,

160
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,840
if we could create one right now right here,

161
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,240
that would be great.

162
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,880
I don't like what people say.

163
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,120
And I think that there are a number of threads here

164
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,520
we can pick up on about the antagonisms really

165
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,960
between art and science.

166
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,880
Scientists like to think that if they are sort of engaged

167
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,880
in art practice, it makes their science more humanistic.

168
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,520
And for artists, if they are engaged in scientific ideas,

169
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:19,400
it makes their intuitive kind of gestures

170
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,560
more palpable to a general audience.

171
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,280
But I don't think we're going to solve this problem here.

172
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,640
This is an ongoing problem.

173
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,160
And it's a problem that may even go back

174
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:40,320
to epistemological issues about knowledge and its production

175
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,480
and its measurement.

176
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,720
In science, there's consensus.

177
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,000
There's consensus based on mathematical kind of rules.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,080
They may be bogus, but there is a methodology.

179
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,640
There is a scientific method.

180
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,520
There is no method in art.

181
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,280
Every method is an individual method.

182
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,720
It's more or less a dialogue with art history

183
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,920
and speaking to the dead.

184
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:17,880
So I think the bigger arches here,

185
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,480
not that they can't overlap somewhat, and they do.

186
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,320
But trying to put them one on top of another

187
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,280
is not in our interest.

188
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,480
I mean, some people have talked about a third culture.

189
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
And I think that's another bad idea.

190
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,120
I think there are three people on top of each other,

191
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,680
generally better than two.

192
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
Sometimes.

193
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,720
That's who they are.

194
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,440
In the spirit of generating conversation,

195
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,800
contradictions always a good place to start.

196
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Absolutely.

197
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,640
So as you contradicted Paul, I'm going to contradict

198
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
part of what you said.

199
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,760
I didn't feel like I contradicted Paul.

200
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,480
I just sort of picked out some threads.

201
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,840
Well, the scientific method thing part of yesterday,

202
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,600
a couple of the panels, some of the scientists said,

203
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,120
there's a scientific method.

204
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,960
There is no such thing.

205
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,080
I think one of them said it's crap.

206
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,440
That was the olfactory scientist.

207
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,240
But anyway, whether it's crap or it's not there

208
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,200
or it's looser than it is.

209
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
And I think you could probably find a few scientists.

210
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,280
I mean, confusing artists with scientists.

211
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,680
A few artists who would say that there's a lot of method

212
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,080
in what they do, even if they change that method

213
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,200
when they get to the next piece.

214
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,640
Having said all that, I'm going to contradict myself

215
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
on top of that.

216
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,800
Well, that's OK.

217
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,160
I mean, in science, you aim towards repeatability.

218
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,080
In art, if you repeat yourself, if someone repeats yourself,

219
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,880
then they're either a plagiarist or an appropriationist.

220
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,640
So the consensus in art is not based on repeatability.

221
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,200
Is there a consensus in art?

222
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,280
Yes, of course.

223
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,600
I'm going to have to jump in there and say,

224
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,320
I have never seen a like Paul.

225
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,600
I feel pretty strongly like an imposter in this crowd.

226
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,880
When I was hearing my short bio read,

227
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,360
I thought, so what's the skin I have in the game here?

228
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,200
I've been writing about art for about 30 years.

229
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,920
A part that I usually don't put in.

230
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,080
My biography is that I've been married to a neuroscience

231
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,120
for those 30 years and more.

232
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,880
So I've been following very closely

233
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,680
the relationship between the arts and the sciences, which

234
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,720
has gotten a lot better.

235
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,240
30 years ago, there was very open hostility.

236
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,640
So I think one question that hasn't really

237
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,480
been addressed that I'd like to introduce at some point

238
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
is why, historically, culturally, socially

239
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,360
has led us to this point of greater intersection

240
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,520
than we had 30 years ago when postmodernists were saying,

241
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,120
scientists were the enemy.

242
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,960
They were searching for absolute truths.

243
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,000
Only postmodernists understood that no such thing

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,880
was attainable at the same time.

245
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,520
So I'm going to go with the spirit of contradiction,

246
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,800
including self-contradiction.

247
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,520
I really firmly believe that what is most fruitful

248
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,560
about the sciences and the arts talking to each other

249
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,200
is understanding how important the boundaries between them

250
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,400
are.

251
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,720
This came up yesterday, I think, Stuart Feinstein brought it up.

252
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:40,040
Boundaries are crucial, I think, in our current political climate.

253
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,120
We really have reason to understand

254
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,120
how ethically important the search for facts are

255
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,880
for alternate facts.

256
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,840
I'm sorry for facts that are not alternate, that are not.

257
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,640
Somebody's hope or somebody's political ambition.

258
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:06,440
So I think on that level where artists and scientists

259
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,640
are aimed is fundamentally different.

260
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,560
I think artists are disruptors a couple of times

261
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,600
over the course of this weekend.

262
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,840
Artists have been enlisted in the role of clarifying

263
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:29,200
of making science understandable to everyone, which

264
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,680
brings us to the issue of populism, which has also

265
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,800
gotten a very complicated politically in the past year.

266
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,200
And I think that I guess the biggest difference

267
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,480
between, or at least, that's the way it seemed to me

268
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,600
over the past few days, between how science

269
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,160
and art operate, is that art is fundamentally communicative.

270
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,400
It's fundamentally about reaching from inside out.

271
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,200
And scientists aren't, that's not a first order of business.

272
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,920
Scientists are interested in figuring things out.

273
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,960
And so this idea has arisen that artists can then

274
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,440
be kind of brought in to take the figuring out and explain it.

275
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,080
But the most interesting art I know that reflects ideas

276
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,360
from science uses them in a kind of poaching way.

277
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,040
You sort of go into somebody else's territory,

278
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,280
take what you need, you're not explaining it.

279
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,600
You're communicating something entirely else that

280
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
can't be reduced to words.

281
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,200
So I'll stop there.

282
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,760
In the spirit of contradiction, I would say that one thing

283
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,160
I've picked up from this conference

284
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,160
is the similarities between art and science,

285
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,840
that if they're both sort of an investigation of the world

286
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,440
as we know it, and so little of what we do in school

287
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,680
and in society is really talk about the real world,

288
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,280
the physical world we live in.

289
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,320
And so both art and science are largely

290
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,440
self-directed, people choose there, if not specialties,

291
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,400
and whatever draws them, the big question that draws them,

292
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,360
and then explore it usually in an iterative way.

293
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,200
So even if an artist isn't doing the scientific method,

294
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,320
they're working through things over and over

295
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,520
to get to something that they're trying to say,

296
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,240
whether it's in or out or so.

297
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,880
I think from that point of view, they're

298
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,960
sort of using different tools to get to some sort of reality

299
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,240
or some sort of view of the world,

300
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,640
that is more in common than a lot of other things that you do.

301
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,080
Yeah, I think there is basic epistemological differences.

302
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,160
And certainly as far as art being a pedagogical tool

303
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,240
for science, I think it's something

304
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,600
that's necessary in the world.

305
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,280
I think somebody brought up yesterday,

306
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,960
48% of the population in the United States

307
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,000
does not believe in evolution.

308
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,880
And there are people out there that believe the Earth is flat.

309
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,400
So we need as much science and art as possible.

310
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,600
Train of thought that came up with something,

311
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,560
I think Nancy said.

312
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:35,000
For me, in art school, I found the conceptual underpinning

313
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,960
that I wanted to have from my work did not fit in with the postmodern

314
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,400
theory that was going on at the time.

315
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:50,200
And I think this is a way that artists can refer to something

316
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,240
that is an objective truth.

317
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,200
Postmodernism, when I was in school,

318
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,440
I couldn't talk about something being beautiful

319
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,360
and conceptual at the same time.

320
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,440
If it was beautiful, it could not also be smart

321
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,400
and have conceptual underpinning.

322
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,520
And the conceptual art at the time,

323
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,040
I didn't find visually interesting.

324
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,600
I find science to be the ultimate conceptual adventure.

325
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,480
And so I kind of had to quietly, secretly build a methodology

326
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:30,080
for making work that science was the underpinning to what was going on.

327
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,240
But it enables us now to talk about a truth that is true,

328
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,400
whether we believe it or not, and whether we know it or not.

329
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,800
And I think that's really an important thing.

330
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,400
So I have a question for you guys.

331
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,280
We're talking about the differences between them

332
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,400
and then the similarities.

333
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,040
Let's jump on the similarities a bit, or at least the points

334
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,640
of convergence where there's a functional, meaningful relationship.

335
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,440
And how do we address some of these kind of societal things

336
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,600
that we've been talking about, whether it's not as specific

337
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,240
as how do we make people believe in evolution

338
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,840
through an art science partnership?

339
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,440
But this is the meat of what we're talking about here,

340
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,760
is how can art and science band together to really do something,

341
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,240
to bring us into the future that we envision for ourselves?

342
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:31,280
I think that is being on the scope of essentially our thoughts here,

343
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:40,440
because as I said earlier, this is an age-old kind of discussion.

344
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,880
The esteemed art historian, Lee of Steinberg, wrote an article a number

345
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:52,080
of years ago, whether art and science should be linked together.

346
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,600
And he brings up Leonardo, of course, who is the master icon in this area.

347
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,400
And he said, although Leonardo's scientific discoveries were very important

348
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,000
at their time, that even without him, they would have been discovered.

349
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,800
But his works of art had to do with the work of the man itself.

350
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:24,240
And I thought that that was some of the most intelligent conversation

351
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,040
about this subject.

352
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Now, what wasn't mentioned in my introduction is I'm chair

353
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,400
of the Fine Arts Department at the School of Visual Arts.

354
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,840
And in 2011, I built the first bio-art laboratory

355
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,600
in a fine arts department in America.

356
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,040
And we have been on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.

357
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,600
We've been on community TV.

358
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,800
Etc. And the idea here is to use the tools of science to make art.

359
00:20:53,800 --> 00:21:00,080
And tools of art also include metaphor.

360
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,920
They include irony.

361
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,440
They include cultural critique, et cetera.

362
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,680
And you're not going to do that in science.

363
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:21,760
OK, so I think that the question of comfortability between disciplines

364
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,160
is about territory.

365
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,840
And there are many programs that invite artists, and particularly

366
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,960
in Europe, to work with scientists.

367
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,040
And sometimes they're accepted, and sometimes they're not.

368
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,640
Well, we've reversed it.

369
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,160
We have now invited scientists to work with artists.

370
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,600
And it's the same kind of apprehension

371
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,520
that these scientists feel about artists.

372
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,720
It's what they come into a bio-art laboratory.

373
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,360
They're stunned.

374
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,920
It doesn't look like anything that they're familiar with,

375
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,960
because it's a cross between the 19th century.

376
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,200
Sciences such as live animals, plants, et cetera,

377
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,360
and molecular biology.

378
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,840
So it's been a subject now that is brewing

379
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,560
in many other educational systems, University of Dundee,

380
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:25,680
University of Albany, Windsor University, and Canada, et cetera.

381
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,200
So this is a growing phenomenon.

382
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:35,360
And I think education is perhaps one of the key points of this conversion.

383
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,120
And I think it's important to recognize

384
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,160
that an essential element of the conversion

385
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,640
is always going to be technology.

386
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,400
And it's about sharing tools.

387
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,880
Every medium in art is a technology, painting is a technology,

388
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,240
sculptures the technology.

389
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,320
Books were a technology that were cutting edge

390
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,920
at the time that they were introduced.

391
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,360
And that it's at that level, I think,

392
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,800
rather than there's been a lot of talk about transdisciplinarity,

393
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,760
which I think Suzanne, you and I both are suspicious of.

394
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,960
Maybe there's a lot of suspicion around the table

395
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,200
about whether or not there's this third way that actually is fruitful

396
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,680
and constitutes a path forward.

397
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:28,800
I think to bring the society piece into it, Julia, which maybe we're all

398
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,880
a little bit suspicious of, can we do that?

399
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,920
Can we change the world?

400
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,880
At the same time, points to something that I think is more prevalent now

401
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,280
than perhaps once was, which is all of these things have ethical dimensions.

402
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,440
So it's something that I think scientists are thinking more about.

403
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,960
I think artists are just assuming as part of the project in a way

404
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,720
that maybe wasn't true 40 years ago or 50 years ago.

405
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,200
Yeah, especially when you consider we're experiencing exponential growth

406
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,040
and technology, whether or not we're going to have artificial intelligence

407
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,680
in 50 or 100 years is relevant.

408
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:21,480
It's coming, and the moral and ethical implications for that are ambiguous.

409
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,480
And because of this advances in technology, it's also we live in an age

410
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,280
where I think religion is losing its relevance.

411
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:39,800
And I think that the arts can step up and be the moral conscience of our species.

412
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,520
I think it's a duty, in fact.

413
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,600
In what way?

414
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:52,680
Critique, we can build a nuclear weapon, we could build artificial intelligence,

415
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,360
but should we?

416
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,080
And if we're going to build artificial intelligence, what kind?

417
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,520
You know, there's a lot of talk about this.

418
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,600
I think some people have talked about it.

419
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,600
That's going to have a huge implication on society,

420
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,320
depending on what type of artificial intelligence we make.

421
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,880
It could be a time of human flowering of humanity,

422
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,800
or it could be something quite different.

423
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,920
And how art is going to fit into that, I think.

424
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,560
Art is in a bit of a state of crisis now.

425
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:36,680
And if that's the case now, what will it be when a human-level artificial intelligence

426
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:44,520
can print out an artwork that will fool a human being into thinking another human being made it?

427
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,040
And beyond that, find it interesting.

428
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:57,040
And as well as if 3D printing is getting better and better and cheaper and cheaper,

429
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,840
we'll be able to print out exact replicas of great master paintings,

430
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,600
or even living artists' paintings.

431
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Have huge implications on the gallery system.

432
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,720
Perhaps galleries wouldn't be necessary in a situation like that.

433
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,480
You could just print out a version of the painting and live with it for a while.

434
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,040
And if you wanted to buy the real one, you could.

435
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,560
It's sort of what happened with the music industry, streaming of music.

436
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,320
Art was always different because there was a reproducibility problem.

437
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,680
But this would be a big change.

438
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:46,000
It's not enough thought is being given, but there are people who are starting to work on it.

439
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,080
Max Tegmark has written a book on it.

440
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:59,000
How to get ready for artificial intelligence when it actually goes to a point where it can,

441
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,400
in fact, function better than we can.

442
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,520
Which he says will happen very quickly, which is why we need to have the conversation now.

443
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:13,360
I mean, it's been possible to fake paintings and do reproductions of things for a long time.

444
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,120
Take you back a moment, could I ask if you are so interested in the boundary between art and science,

445
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,560
why build the bio lab?

446
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,120
Why build the bio lab?

447
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,520
Why paint with acrylics when you had oils?

448
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,120
Because it expands the artist's palette.

449
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,200
Can you pinpoint enough?

450
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:40,080
I think there's so much going on here.

451
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,480
I don't know where to start, so I'll just start with science.

452
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,640
The products of science don't last, but those of art last, that's a fantastic distinction

453
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,960
that is true and good until we get to AI where you can reproduce it.

454
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,640
That messes some things up and brings chaos in an interesting way.

455
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,440
But fundamentally, the products of science shouldn't last.

456
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,880
Could there be ironic science the way there is ironic art?

457
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,800
That would be interesting to see.

458
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,600
I think in the long run, historically, it is ironic because it does contradict itself.

459
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Well, there's also junk science.

460
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
And there's junk science, yeah.

461
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,080
I mean, a lot of the stuff in a lot of the journals is just a way to pad things, and that's

462
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,120
junk, and even if it's true.

463
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:39,160
But there are things that what's interesting about science is that the itself-correcting

464
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:48,960
nature is able to cast out what it felt was true and beautiful and move on.

465
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,240
And that's great, and that's to its benefit.

466
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,840
We don't have to throw out Leonardo's artwork ever.

467
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:02,360
That's a real clear distinction, I think it's important and absolutely true.

468
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:11,520
So what do we learn from that is part of the question of the boundary, I think.

469
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,960
There's clear boundary on that point.

470
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:22,280
So taking a scientific point of view on this, when you set up an experiment, you have to

471
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,600
really make sure the boundary conditions are tight so that you know that the results you

472
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,880
got are because of this.

473
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,520
And if you did all the boundary conditions, you get other results from the same sort of

474
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,360
experimental setup.

475
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,800
And that kind of thing is basically improvisation.

476
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,480
And Andrew Pickring writes about this, the mangle of practice.

477
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,520
It's basically, you do one experiment.

478
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,000
It's not coming out exactly.

479
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,160
The results are not exactly what you thought.

480
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,000
So you can did all the boundary conditions, or you can do your theory.

481
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,880
And keep basically messing around with both until you're not breaking the instrument totally,

482
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,680
but you're modifying it and you're stretching it to its limit.

483
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,320
And you're not totally breaking the theory either.

484
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,320
You might.

485
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,320
You don't care.

486
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,320
You can do that too.

487
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,280
That sounds exactly like art.

488
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,560
Methodically speaking, you're willing to take risks, do improvisation.

489
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,240
You don't know exactly where you're going.

490
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,200
You're pleased with whatever might come out of it's useful to you if it's fun.

491
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,360
And in that way, they're, again, a lot alike because of how they're playing with boundaries.

492
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,560
In both cases, you have to know what the boundaries are very tightly in the case of science much

493
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
more tightly.

494
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,760
But in the case of art, too, you created an effect.

495
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,800
You kind of want to know how you did that.

496
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,320
You don't have to go down to the micron, but it's good to know.

497
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,360
So there's a lot of similarity there in the spirit of the improv.

498
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,400
And so then that brings me to the social part.

499
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,480
And this is the part that's really crazy because the current administration is playing

500
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,040
fast and free with facts.

501
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:03,960
They are improving the shit out of the political context, international context.

502
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,040
And how is that different from art and science?

503
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,840
They've taken the stuff that we teach in colleges about how, well, it's interpretation.

504
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,440
And you can really alter the boundary conditions, all the stuff I just said.

505
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,080
You can use that to create absolute bullshit.

506
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:25,840
So what is the difference between being rhetorical and improvisational with your facts and your

507
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,240
method of creating facts?

508
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,320
And what seems to be happening now, I'll suggest one thing that I'm interested in hearing

509
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,560
what you think the difference is.

510
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:42,000
They're just doing it for maintaining power and money where it should be, territory.

511
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,360
If you don't do that, then you're in an other territory.

512
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,600
You're doing other stuff.

513
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,640
And I think that's where the sublime and transcendent nature of art and science goes

514
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:58,040
to not just keeping more power and money, but to discovery.

515
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,440
Other than that, it seems a lot alike.

516
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,440
It seems like...

517
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,680
Well, I think this is a huge area of concern and complication.

518
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:17,600
The legacy of prioritizing improvisation and prioritizing flexible thinking and acceptance

519
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,680
of contingency, all that stuff.

520
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:26,880
I think one important or useful distinction is between cynicism and irony.

521
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,840
To know that you're being deceptive and to go ahead with it anyway is very different

522
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:40,320
than being open to a range of interpretations of a dataset, whether it's in the arts or

523
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,640
in the sciences.

524
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,240
Also an aesthetic component.

525
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,640
What they're doing is so ugly.

526
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,760
I mean, it's as age people.

527
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,760
I think both science and art are the truth and beauty thing that we're trying to look

528
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,200
for something deeper.

529
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,880
I mean, is it a matter of motive?

530
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,640
So is it a matter of what purpose is being used for?

531
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
And is it art?

532
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
Is it science?

533
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,360
When I hear that there is a distinction, so epistemologically, they're different systems.

534
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:24,880
But when it becomes an identity that you start saying, I am an artist, he is a scientist.

535
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,480
What concerns me is then we become, we stop being able to really see the other because

536
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,160
we have so many assumptions about what it is to be an artist, what it is to be a scientist.

537
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:42,240
There are limits, our capacity to be, just to be.

538
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,200
And so I'm thinking as we're having this conversation, I'm thinking, is this conversation

539
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,920
a scientific conversation or an artistic conversation?

540
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Is it either?

541
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,160
Because if it's an artistic conversation, then anything is possible in the conversation.

542
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,640
That's the way I feel about it.

543
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,160
That's how it occurs to me.

544
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,320
It's a scientific conversation.

545
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,240
What happens for me is that I think there are experts.

546
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,720
There are experts and I'm not one of them.

547
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,960
I should leave it to the experts to talk about.

548
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,160
And I think that's harmful, I think that gets in the way of a generative conversation.

549
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:31,080
So for me, contextualizing this as an artistic conversation gives me freedom to just to belong,

550
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,480
to feel like whatever anybody is saying will add and build something.

551
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,920
So I'm interested to know how you relate to this conversation for yourselves.

552
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Is it artist?

553
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Is it scientist?

554
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,960
I think in relation to that, I think we need experts.

555
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,360
But then there are experts that connect the dots.

556
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,440
Gregory Bates talks about the pattern that connects.

557
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:02,280
And finding similarities between these experts and connecting in a way that's interesting.

558
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,720
We've divided things for so long and we've found success with that.

559
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,240
But there is value in connecting, I might think.

560
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
Interesting.

561
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,320
I come from two fields.

562
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,400
One is narrative therapy and the other is narrative medicine.

563
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,800
And both of them essentially believe that the person who's consulting the doctor or the

564
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
therapist is the expert.

565
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,960
They're the expert in their own lives.

566
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,920
And that does not mean that the practitioner hasn't got a particular scientific or therapeutic

567
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,280
expertise that is necessary, but it really is a shift in the power relationship.

568
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,080
There's Brian Eno, who's known as a musician.

569
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,840
He also has an interesting idea.

570
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,560
He's also a great collaborator.

571
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:58,200
He has this notion that he calls cenius, where we live in a society that's obsessed with

572
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,960
the individual achievements, the genius.

573
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,920
And we almost have a cult of ego.

574
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,400
And I think we need to move past that.

575
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,240
And he talks about we may obsess over Picasso or something like that.

576
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,800
We don't really look at the scene that he came from.

577
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:26,480
It's an ecology of ideas, a conversation about ideas that forms the ground from which a person

578
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,400
like that can emerge.

579
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,880
I think we've obsessed so much on the individuals that we need to think about the entire ecology.

580
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,080
I was thinking about that just today, too, that a lot of the examples of SciArt successes

581
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,560
are these rock stars.

582
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,880
And they're great.

583
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,160
And they just like, just bam.

584
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,640
And then there's everybody else.

585
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,280
And so with reference to society, again, how many of these geniuses can we spread around?

586
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,120
A similar conversation in history of science, too.

587
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,840
We pick these heroes.

588
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,360
And then there's all this other stuff going on, legions of people doing.

589
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,520
But we only have a very small handful of names.

590
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,680
So in reference to society, how can we basically what we want to do?

591
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,960
I think it sounds like we want science to be more widespread.

592
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,680
We want art to be more widespread.

593
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,680
Generally, that would be good regardless of how.

594
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,640
Although we don't want to turn art into a propaganda tool for science because science

595
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
keeps changing.

596
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:34,920
It's like monkeys out of artists and scientists to be really good at propagandizing today's

597
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
science.

598
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,840
That's happened so many times already.

599
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,760
So instead, what do we do if we could harness the power of many ordinary individuals, which

600
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,520
we are mostly, through a generative process?

601
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:55,480
So this is the idea for a SciArt project that doesn't involve too many geniuses, but

602
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,880
it involves lots of non-geniuses.

603
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,880
It's going to be a disaster.

604
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,560
Chaos is generative, too.

605
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,440
So it would be something like this.

606
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,800
You have some large scale, literally, I'm talking scale now, large scale in space and

607
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,840
time thing that you want to, what do you call it?

608
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,200
It's not an exhibit, it's not going to be any museum, but event, or maybe you want it to

609
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
last.

610
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,240
Maybe it's a mural that covers several square miles or something.

611
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,680
And then the bits of it are going to be done by individual people.

612
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,240
There's things like this before.

613
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,760
I don't know the examples of it, but it's through some kind of combinatorial analysis

614
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,920
too that you can do this.

615
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,520
It's not just you're going to make a grid and you guys are going to be responsible for

616
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,920
these things, so hold up the blue plaque.

617
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,520
It's more like the improv element comes in.

618
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,240
It's more like, okay, there's a problem.

619
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,480
You all have to solve it.

620
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,880
Here's your boundary.

621
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,880
You solve your problem in here when I say go.

622
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,440
And so they're all going to be solving.

623
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
It's like parallel processing.

624
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,080
That's what I'm trying to say.

625
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,680
Instead of serial processing in the computer, a lot of people are solving the same problem

626
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,640
at the same time, in the same area.

627
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,160
They don't know exactly what they're going to get when they hook up.

628
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,440
But it's done by a bunch of small, slow processors.

629
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:24,840
This is like when you hook up a bunch of little computers, 256 of them in a big array, you

630
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,960
can do a lot of great things that a supercomputer can do where you take a bunch of really low

631
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,520
res lenses and you wire them together in an array like a dragonfly.

632
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,160
You get very high res, comparable to it.

633
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:44,920
So this is getting a bunch of low res people, non-geniuses, something that they understand

634
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,360
in their locality and then the product is something that's great, even though individually.

635
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,560
And then sort of some way that's happening.

636
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,280
I mean to go back to Paul's, this is a very good question.

637
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,480
Is this a, I'm going to be thinking about that for a while.

638
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,600
Is this a science conversation or an art conversation?

639
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,360
I think one of the things that has fostered a better relationship between the arts and

640
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:11,760
sciences is the trend in the arts toward collaborative and participatory work.

641
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,160
I mean that's something that's been on the rise.

642
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:22,400
For decades now and I'm thinking in terms of this idea of lots of low res people, none

643
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,600
of us are going to identify ourselves as those, lots of low res people.

644
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,960
There is work that sort of enacts that.

645
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,320
I'm thinking of Tino Segal, although he's just one artist who's done that kind of participatory

646
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,440
work where you know he had to show it that some people here are familiar with his work.

647
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:52,880
He had to show the Guggenheim that was about having his collaborators stage conversations

648
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
with visitors to the museum.

649
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
They were scripted.

650
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,720
He walked into the museum.

651
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,840
He did this also in galleries and other places around the world.

652
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,000
And the conversations that took place were the art.

653
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,160
And they were scripted in the beginning.

654
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,840
But then after that it was, you know, it was a real time, real life conversation.

655
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:21,680
So that is a kind of artwork that sits on this boundary.

656
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:32,160
As do a lot of more sort of conventionally definable collaborations between artists and

657
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
scientists.

658
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:38,680
I'd like to pick up on collaborations in the visual arts.

659
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,520
And there are some.

660
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,640
And there are more now coming.

661
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,080
I agree with you.

662
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,320
But artists, visual artists are not great collaborators.

663
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:55,560
They're not going to sit there and take instruction about, you know, from geniuses or non-geniuses.

664
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,640
It just doesn't happen that way.

665
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:05,920
But I do want to bring this back to society because I think that's the triangulation that

666
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,320
we need to concentrate on rather than the dyadic structure, art versus or art and science,

667
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
et cetera.

668
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:21,600
In 2004, I wrote this book called The Molecular Gays, Art in the Genetic Age, published by

669
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:27,040
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, which is an august scientific institution.

670
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,240
It's the first time they produced an art book.

671
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:37,320
It's a collaboration with the late Dorothy Nelkin, who was a sociologist of science.

672
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,400
And unfortunately, she died before the book came out.

673
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:51,360
But when we teamed up together and I said to her for every sociological aspect of science,

674
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:57,120
you can come up with, I will come up with a visual constituent image.

675
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:07,640
So there is a certain kind of possibility here of not essentially patronizing scientific

676
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:14,880
companies or whatever, but really looking at the data bank in art history of how people

677
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,920
were thinking about some of the things that are prevalent in society now, such as genetic

678
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,920
engineering.

679
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,760
Now, this is very similar to the concept of collage or cut and paste techniques.

680
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,720
This goes back to 3000 BC.

681
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,040
So it's not a question that this is all new.

682
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,240
It's not new.

683
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:45,600
It has this kind of creeping build up that includes innovation, includes accident, includes recognition.

684
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:53,560
Last time I was here and I was on a panel with you, Galasi was here and Barbara Stafford

685
00:43:53,560 --> 00:44:00,320
and several others who quite a high res group, I must say.

686
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:08,960
And Galasi is the scientist who discovered mirror neurons by accident.

687
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:17,080
So that is one of the things I think is part of discovery that may join these two forces,

688
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:24,520
but it's about recognition of the accident and being able to extrapolate it.

689
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:30,600
And the reason I went into design originally was that I was interested in art and interested

690
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,440
in science and it seemed to me that design was the combination of the two.

691
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,720
So therefore, the perfect thing, but then you have designed somewhat subservience to

692
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,920
commerce, that you're making a living, you're doing propaganda in some ways.

693
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,840
And that's why when started thinking about the environment and we have to change our

694
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,600
whole energy system, what's a new energy system going to look like?

695
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Or how is it going to be better than the hodgepodge we have now?

696
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:08,840
So I guess I think there are ways that art and science can impact the future, whether

697
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:17,400
it's having something to say about AI or energy systems or where we're going.

698
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:26,080
I think actually looking forward in the future, I think design and architecture really have

699
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:32,200
high possibility of blurring the line between fine art and science.

700
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:41,160
I was, we were in a symposium last month called Strange Attractors and I spoke to some scientists

701
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:50,960
there that felt that neuroscience or neuro-aesthetics is, there's nothing to it that, you know,

702
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:59,720
it doesn't have real science behind it yet, but with three decades plus of making art

703
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:07,560
under my belt and the subjective experience of that, I think personally I can say absolutely

704
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:14,880
my thinking and my creative problem solving skills have been enhanced by both the product

705
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,920
that I have made and the process of making it.

706
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:26,400
And when we think about the architecture that we have around us being dictated by profit

707
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:37,280
and margins and costs, where if we could study further neural-aesthetics and find the pattern,

708
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:44,600
I think it was in the newest book by Max Tegmark, he says, you know, it's not matter that matters,

709
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:50,320
it's the pattern, it's the structure that gives intelligence.

710
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:58,960
And if we can extrapolate from that structure that we can surround ourselves in our civic

711
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:08,640
design and architecture, you know, we could build a city, an urban design, an interior design

712
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:16,080
that could potentially have a small part in making us better thinkers and problems.

713
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:21,800
architecture and building has been often a joint venture all along.

714
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:29,520
Yeah, if you want to go back to Plato with that too, if I just design the ideal republic,

715
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,880
then the citizens will naturally be good.

716
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,400
That's the idea, right?

717
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,400
And if we add science to that and get some really good artists, not push the poets out,

718
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,680
but bring them back in to work with the scientists, then we can make this ideal republic that

719
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,080
not only is designed well but also produces.

720
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,400
The only thing that, and he was being kind of ironic and metaphorical all that, and we

721
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,440
should take him as that when he pushed the poets out, but I think it points up one really

722
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:06,440
good thing that I think Plato does express very well.

723
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,640
Collaboration's not enough.

724
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:13,080
If we get really good at science art collaboration, we could still do some really heinous things

725
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,080
that look beautiful.

726
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,600
I mean, intelligence by itself is not enough.

727
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:23,120
We can do some horrific things with better intelligence and make it palatable with art.

728
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,440
So it leaves the moral component that many people brought up the other day about how

729
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:34,960
what are the social values, where social justice, how does that work into this picture?

730
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:42,440
And there we don't want of all places to be elitist in the sense that, well, we'll design

731
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:48,000
the size of the room and door and window for you, and we'll also decide for you, what are

732
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,680
the best moral values for you and you're all so much alike and all that?

733
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,680
So that can't be done.

734
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,680
So how do we do it?

735
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:01,440
Instead, it goes back to the ground layer of working, listening to each community and

736
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,640
letting those values come from them.

737
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,600
In other words, trusting its chaotic again, but trusting in the sub-low res, whatever

738
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:15,040
community, which already has pride of place as the person who mentioned Appalachia the

739
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,320
other day yesterday, people have pride of their, they know their place, they know their

740
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,080
land and they know that community many generations.

741
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:32,160
They're in the best position to express something beautiful about it artistically as well as

742
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,920
other values as well as knowing what the problems there are.

743
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,480
So applying just raw intelligence to what we think are the main problems of some part

744
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,760
of West Virginia, not the best way to go, but the participatory research stuff that you

745
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,240
mentioned, that's the way.

746
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,560
And when you do that, you can add to that participatory art as well as participatory

747
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,280
science as well as participatory social value and social justice.

748
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,160
So you're listening more and letting it come up and really all you're doing is creating

749
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,320
the context.

750
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:08,080
Is this an art adventure, is this a science adventure, is this a government adventure?

751
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,360
Well, no, we're just going to set up a context, not sure what to call it, but then it'll

752
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:18,640
be something the community can define as it goes and redefine and redefine and redefine

753
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,400
as it goes.

754
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,440
And from that will emerge something better than a top-down design that's done by intelligent

755
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,600
people, which fails utterly.

756
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:35,560
Yeah, well, you now have do-it-yourself bio labs internationally.

757
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:43,240
In New York, it's GenSpace and Bioacres Without Borders.

758
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:52,640
And this sort of theme is an expansion of what computer hacking was in the 90s to now

759
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,360
engage in hacking biology.

760
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:05,160
And the general public is invited in to take very short courses in whether it's genetic

761
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:11,560
engineering or cloning or painting with bacteria, et cetera.

762
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:21,240
And this is a very interesting construct because if you look at the do-it-yourself bio community,

763
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,240
you'll see it's almost in every country in the world.

764
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,600
I don't know what the repercussions are going to be with this.

765
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:36,080
Alan Jorgensen, who's one of the founders of GenSpace, and comes in as an invited scientist

766
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:42,920
to do my lab, is also friends with the FBI, okay?

767
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,920
That's so many times.

768
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
Friends, right.

769
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,520
How do you do that?

770
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:53,480
Well, they were very taken by her.

771
00:51:53,480 --> 00:52:00,440
And she has never received any intrusive kinds of arrests.

772
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,440
She knows it.

773
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,240
She's a PhD in molecular biology.

774
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,960
She's a member of TED.

775
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:16,640
And this is sort of her forte is to bring science to the community, from children to

776
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:22,920
adults to even scientists who do not have an institutional affiliation.

777
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:28,680
By doing science at home, I mean, you need a lot of equipment.

778
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:34,840
So I think we need to fold that into this conversation as a fact that science has spilled

779
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:43,680
out of the laboratory into our everyday lives in many ways, and to articulate some of those

780
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:51,480
things from the clothes we wear to the food we eat to the medicine we take, et cetera,

781
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:59,840
et cetera, that this is a revolution in the transformation of materials, human materials,

782
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,360
animal materials, the sale of materials, blah, blah, blah.

783
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:09,080
And this has been going on since the late 80s.

784
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:16,240
So I think those are some of the areas that people could be engaged with when they go

785
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:23,400
to the supermarket and their food is not labeled as a GMO, and that's another thing we do

786
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,640
in our lab is we do GMO testing.

787
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,480
So we get to see what's what.

788
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:40,400
And so, for example, when you're on delta airlines, don't eat the cookies.

789
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:47,120
And other things like that that are GMOs, whatever that means.

790
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:57,000
I mean, that's a whole conversation for the social order that people are hidden.

791
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,840
I mean, that people are hidden, but products are hidden in terms of what they consist of.

792
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,840
Okay.

793
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:11,120
It's interesting to me that you say people are hidden.

794
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,320
People are hidden too.

795
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:19,840
Some of the more rewarding work that I've done in the last several years has been working

796
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:28,200
with people who are marginalized for some reason and who are trying to, a part of movements,

797
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,920
trying to change the narrative around them, around who they are.

798
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:40,600
And they resort to pseudo-scientific language, trying to explain to people, for example,

799
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:49,080
an example would be people in Croatia with intellectual disabilities are often institutionalized

800
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,080
from birth.

801
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:55,240
For a whole lot of psychosocial reasons, there aren't enough resources that people are put

802
00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:02,440
in these draconian institutions and never see the light of day are very poorly treated.

803
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:09,040
So there is a movement to de-institutionize people and reintegrate them into the community.

804
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,440
And so there was a whole body of knowledge trying to teach people that people with intellectual

805
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,800
disabilities deserve to live in the world.

806
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,760
They don't need to be locked away.

807
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,680
But with opinion, what you get is opinion.

808
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,160
So when you say, when you try and bring facts to people and say, if people don't belong

809
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,360
in institutions, people say, but they do.

810
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,000
And it becomes an argument.

811
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,600
So we were hired to come in and work with an organization of people with intellectual

812
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:46,960
disabilities, training them to tell their personal stories and they're not stories about living

813
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,440
in institutions.

814
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,080
They're ordinary stories about living in the world.

815
00:55:52,080 --> 00:56:00,640
And just so in order to be accepted into this organization, I needed to speak about

816
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,280
my credentials.

817
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:09,680
So I had been told before I went to Croatia that I should speak about my credentials as

818
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:17,000
a doctor, as a psychiatrist, and I should definitely not mention my own personal story,

819
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,480
which is if you go Google me, you'll find out that most of my work has been around my

820
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:30,440
own personal journey about being a gay man living with HIV and that my storytelling was

821
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:37,240
a way of before there was the science of surviving, really, of finding a way of making

822
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,560
sense of my experience as a person with HIV.

823
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:46,600
I was told, do not mention this in Croatia because no one will listen to you.

824
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,520
So I arrived at the organization and they said, welcome, we will not introduce you to

825
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,160
the people you're going to work with yet.

826
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,680
They're a vulnerable group till we feel safe with you.

827
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,680
Who are you?

828
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,120
I said, well, I'm a psychiatrist.

829
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:10,880
I don't even mention that word because in institutions the psychiatrists were the people

830
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:17,280
that participated terrible harm on the people in institutions.

831
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,880
They said, can you tell us something personal about yourself?

832
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,120
And I said, well, I like to hike.

833
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:33,840
And first of all, it got more and more difficult until the simple in my performance partners

834
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:40,160
was another whole story of a 20-year collaboration with someone, which is not easy, I can tell

835
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,160
you, really collaborating.

836
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:46,920
But he said to me, listen, if we don't speak the truth, we're not going to get to work

837
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,920
with these people.

838
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,480
So I told my story and the social workers who were the interface with the organization

839
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,520
ended up in tears and saying, well, that's why you're here.

840
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,840
Come on in.

841
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:05,600
And so what we did was teach people who really some didn't have language, some were beyond

842
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,400
terrified to sit in front of a group.

843
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:14,400
We eventually taught them to sing and to tell stories about very simple stories.

844
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,640
One woman told the story of her niece and she showed a picture of how much she loves

845
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,680
that little girl, plays with her in the park.

846
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,720
She's a woman with dance syndrome.

847
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:31,360
And they then used these stories as part of a campaign that is you can find as part of

848
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,280
their organization.

849
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,280
And it was the art.

850
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,880
It was the art of storytelling, it was one of the women couldn't speak at all.

851
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,880
She just danced.

852
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:47,920
It was the art that communicated what this, I would say the science couldn't have.

853
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,520
And honoring those people as experts.

854
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,560
So I think what you're saying is allowing it to come from the people, what it is that's

855
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:04,200
needed, is a particular kind of consciousness that we can bring as artists and as scientists.

856
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:10,040
I think that is a really good point to pause at and invite the audience up for questions.

857
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:14,160
I'm going to emphasize again, people come up for questions.

858
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,080
Please ask questions for this panel because we're going to do an open group session where

859
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:23,600
it's going to be more like pass around the mic, talk about your reflections for a minute

860
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,360
or two and what you want to see next and that sort of thing.

861
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,720
So more commentary things we can save for a little bit later.

862
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,720
But let's get some questions going.

863
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:36,240
Can I just say to your point that we throw out science and keep art?

864
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,800
I mean Newtonian physics works really well for most of the world.

865
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,480
Darwinian evolution.

866
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,480
There are some things that we build on.

867
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,640
I was going to say something very similar.

868
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:57,040
I'll expand on that a little bit on this notion that science is always discarding itself.

869
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:03,960
Whereas we keep Leonardo, but we don't keep all scientific ideas.

870
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,120
It's not quite true.

871
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:10,440
It's true that science is in an important sense self-correcting.

872
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:17,080
But it's not disposable in the sense that whatever version of the truth we have at any

873
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:23,520
one moment is path dependent and knowing that path is very important.

874
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:32,200
We need to understand Aristotle's cosmology and what was wrong with it and what we learned

875
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,680
about the universe that made us realize that that was limited.

876
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,240
Like you just said, we need to understand Newton's laws.

877
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,720
In fact, we can't teach science without teaching Newton's laws.

878
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,200
And then we teach why they don't quite apply fully because of what we've learned since

879
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,200
then.

880
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:56,320
We teach science and to know science without knowing that history of ideas that are wrong.

881
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,080
I mean in a certain sense limited.

882
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:06,480
And so maybe keeping Newton and keeping Aristotle is not that different from keeping Leonardo.

883
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,960
You don't teach artists.

884
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,960
I mean artists have to learn about Leonardo, but you don't teach a professional artist

885
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,960
now.

886
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,560
Go out and make art exactly like Leonardo.

887
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:20,120
Any more than we teach, go out and do Aristotle's cosmology.

888
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:28,600
As I understand, art, which is not fully, there are also movements and things that, you know,

889
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:33,400
ways that are things are done and you don't go out and do art the way it was done 20 years

890
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,400
ago.

891
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,880
So there is that sort of revision too.

892
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,320
It's not quite the same sort of linearity.

893
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:43,240
But maybe there's a little more commonality there than was represented.

894
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:48,040
The other quick point I wanted to make was about this notion of not having everything

895
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,520
just done by geniuses.

896
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,760
I thought it was a very interesting part of the conversation.

897
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,840
And there is this question of who owns art and who owns science?

898
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,120
Who's it for?

899
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:02,240
Is art just for professional artists in art departments or is it for everybody?

900
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,400
And we can ask the very powerful thing about science.

901
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,000
And so this notion of having projects that everyone can do and you were kind of crowd

902
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,320
sourcing and all that, you were kind of feeling it.

903
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,880
There's a really good model in science now for citizen science where there are these

904
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,840
projects where it's not just because it's cool as an outreach thing to involve people.

905
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,360
In fact, the science is better.

906
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:26,080
There are certain kinds of science where having lots of people out there recording and sensing

907
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:31,280
and contributing gives us an ability to do kinds of science that we couldn't do when

908
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,920
it's just the genius.

909
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:37,280
And so the idea, and you mentioned a project at a museum that maybe kind of hinted at

910
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:43,120
this too, but the idea of sort of citizen side art where we use some of these same platforms

911
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:49,400
to really be collaborative in some way that it's not about the genius vision of the great

912
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,600
ego, but the contribution of the masses.

913
01:02:53,600 --> 01:03:00,000
And maybe there's a way that the citizen science model can be further applied to side

914
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
art.

915
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,920
And also, I mean, in that language, the maker movement, which is something that's going

916
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:08,880
on where, and you mentioned these bio labs, just kind of like that where you really are

917
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,600
bringing in lots of people.

918
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:15,320
And it's not just about the lone genius vision, but like getting people involved.

919
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,800
So I think that's a very useful direction we can think of in this conversation.

920
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:28,000
As far as Leonardo, I'm reading the new biography by Isaacson.

921
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,360
And it's maybe, you know, the thought that I had was not that we should paint like him,

922
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,800
but we should think like him.

923
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,800
He was an integrator and brought disparate things together.

924
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:43,280
And I think that's where his real inspiration is.

925
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,760
Mr. Foden question.

926
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:54,960
I was asked yesterday by this gentleman to say some of my artwork out there.

927
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:08,480
I noticed the ongoing difficulty we have with correlating art and science, et cetera.

928
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:15,360
I was fortunate enough to, when I flashed paint and mixed paint with other paint, et

929
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:21,120
cetera, et cetera, to discover the formation process of the vertebrae, et cetera, et cetera.

930
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:27,720
Those are out there and I would like you to give me some feedback as to if you can agree

931
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,720
to that.

932
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,640
I mean, I just think I discovered the formation process reverted by an other important like

933
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,000
horseshoe crab splashes, exactly.

934
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,680
They established the fact that the physics of liquid formation correlates to biological

935
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,600
formation processes.

936
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,800
And yeah, give me some feedback if you would.

937
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,800
Please, I'll be here.

938
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,800
Thank you.

939
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,800
Thank you.

940
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,960
I just want to say you had a lot there.

941
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:57,720
I didn't want to gloss over the value of art, which probably you have a whole conference

942
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,520
on that question alone.

943
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:06,320
But I think something I've been thinking about a lot is that we emphasize the product that

944
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,320
is art, the noun of art.

945
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:16,360
But I think we should emphasize and put as much value, perhaps an education on the verb

946
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:22,040
of art, the process of art, the thinking that is art.

947
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,600
But again, that's a loaded conversation.

948
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,600
No, no.

949
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:31,000
So thank you all for your wonderful thoughts today and on other days.

950
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,480
I had, I guess, two questions related to authorship, which I think came up a lot in

951
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,680
this discussion and it was part of the first question.

952
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:48,080
Even as kind of the model of authorship in sciences versus arts, I think in science publications,

953
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:52,520
there's a long history of many authors being on the publication.

954
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:58,080
And less so with humanities and artists, although we have fields within the arts that know how

955
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:05,480
to credit many people, theatrical performances, the film industry, animations, there are hundreds

956
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:10,480
of people listed as producers in a larger work.

957
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:16,840
And I'm wondering whether these kind of considerations of authorship might also affect how we think

958
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:23,480
about science, art production and collaboration and whether changing our models for authorship

959
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:30,160
when we have a participatory piece, we're actually crediting the low res people in that piece

960
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:36,040
and not just saying, oh, this is a Nick Cave sound piece that happened to be sown by 100

961
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,560
people found on Craigslist or whatever.

962
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,200
So one is this question of authorship.

963
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:46,640
I'm curious about your thoughts about changing models of authorship within the fields of

964
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:51,080
art science and art science and psi art, whatever.

965
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:56,800
The other is a question about, in particular, participatory art.

966
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:05,760
And you kind of put forward this model of the grand mural with small components fabricated

967
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:12,480
or designed by other people and we have this idea of seenness, which as opposed to genius,

968
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,120
which I thought was very interesting.

969
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,720
And I think there's another interesting strand that I would be curious for the group to comment

970
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:28,000
on, which is sort of trends in evolutionary art where the participant is part of the aesthetic

971
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:36,400
where I think one of the kind of standard examples, we have electric sheep where people

972
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:43,240
are voting on the aesthetic direction of a digital artwork and there's genetic algorithms

973
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,800
involved in its production.

974
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:50,200
Another interesting example is comar and melamine who kind of say, you know, this has some

975
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,640
problems to it.

976
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:57,520
When we ask everybody to participate and vote, you get something that's pretty dreadful

977
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,520
and everything that we get.

978
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,000
But that's painting of every country that is a landscape and it has George Washington

979
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,880
in the corner and kind of like a deer on the side and everybody is happy.

980
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,240
But the end result is something that is not all that satisfactory.

981
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:21,880
And so I guess the second question is in this question of authorship intersecting with the

982
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:27,240
people or the public or the low res people, whatever you want to call it, how do you also

983
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:35,480
preserve this aspect of novelty search that is so important in art making and finding outliers,

984
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:41,440
you know, artistic visions that do not come about through a democratic process.

985
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,240
That is such an important question.

986
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,560
I mean, two questions, three questions, many questions.

987
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,200
And I'm glad you brought comar and melamine into the discussion.

988
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:55,840
I'm sure most people in this room know about this series of town hall meetings they had

989
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:02,520
where they would ask the attendees to vote on elements that should be in the best picture

990
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,920
and they varied according to region of course.

991
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,480
But there's always a lot of blue because blue is everyone's favorite color.

992
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,160
It's like an extraction to people like landscapes.

993
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,160
So there's all.

994
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:18,560
So, you know, on the one hand, you know, I think it's really important that people who

995
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,760
are involved in the creation of artwork be credited.

996
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:26,960
This has resulted in a lot of wives being acknowledged as co-authors of work that used

997
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,200
to be attributed only to their husbands.

998
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:37,040
You know, we're looking at the Keene Holtz and Christo and Klaus Haldenburg and missing

999
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,040
a lot of people.

1000
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,880
But so these are, you know, these are good things happening.

1001
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,680
There are artists who acknowledge their assistance very explicitly.

1002
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:49,840
There are artists who don't.

1003
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:54,800
On the other hand, and I think this is really important and I'm not going to be proposing

1004
01:09:54,800 --> 01:10:08,960
a hard and fast rule here, there is tremendous danger in, I think, seeding the initiative

1005
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,880
for producing the work to the public.

1006
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:18,640
And I think it's suspect because it's, you know, it's a way that institutions have boosted

1007
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:23,640
their audience, you know, this sort of drive toward everyone's a winner, everyone's an

1008
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,480
artist, everyone's a participant.

1009
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:31,520
You know, your expertise is as valuable as mine and it's particularly prevalent in the

1010
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:38,200
arts because really everyone does feel in their hearts of hearts that they're artists.

1011
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,200
Why not?

1012
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,520
What do you need to be an artist?

1013
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,920
Not much, just an opinion, right?

1014
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:56,080
I think being clear about negotiating those two, you know, kind of irresolvable perspectives

1015
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,080
is really important.

1016
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,080
I'm not sure who it was.

1017
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:02,840
It might have been Thomas Jefferson that said democracy only works with that educated

1018
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,800
public.

1019
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:10,400
And saying it's true with the status of art education in this country, we can't expect

1020
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,120
people to know how.

1021
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:18,600
I mean, there are certain basic teaching that needs to happen.

1022
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:25,840
And as far as authorship, I think if there's a matter of prioritization, if we have a priority

1023
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:32,520
more on the product and what the product is, the thing and the product as the thinking,

1024
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:39,320
what it is doing for us, there'll be less of a need to want to have authorship.

1025
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:43,520
I don't know, I think it's important, but I think the focus should be on what it is

1026
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,520
and what it's doing.

1027
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,080
Yeah, I have two comments.

1028
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:51,480
One, one, distance on the wall under his name.

1029
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:55,680
But let's take this expression, everyone's an art critic.

1030
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,640
I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.

1031
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,800
What if I go into a scientific laboratory?

1032
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,600
And I say, I don't know much about science, but I know what I like.

1033
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,640
And that's what's happening.

1034
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,560
I know what facts I like.

1035
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:17,720
I use that as a segue for my question.

1036
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:23,360
So I wanted to ask a question based on Farzad's parallel processing question.

1037
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:30,280
And whenever I come to some of these conferences as a guest or whichever on this side or this

1038
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:35,240
side, I always wonder how can we harness the power of the people in the room?

1039
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,720
And so you're talking about science and science in society.

1040
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,640
This is a micro-society.

1041
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:47,200
And we often, and these are great conversations to listen to and be part of.

1042
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:53,960
But I wonder how can we also use our experimental processes that we're going through finding

1043
01:12:53,960 --> 01:13:00,760
out how to collaborate and how to collaborate in these new ways that are not genius-centered,

1044
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:10,280
that are about looking at other people and listening to them and taking time and doing

1045
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:13,040
things in parallel and then coming back together.

1046
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:18,840
And so I'm curious, just in terms of having you as a smaller group, iterate about the

1047
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,760
next panel in terms of like where or not panel.

1048
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,520
The collective discussion is where do we go as a community?

1049
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,080
Are we a community?

1050
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:34,440
And do we have processes that we can start to put into place so that we always make sure

1051
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:40,240
that even if we don't harness the power of the room today, we leave the room knowing

1052
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:44,600
that the power of the room is going to be, that there are processes in place, whether

1053
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:50,240
they be online, offline, about meeting at the next cafe, next week or whatever.

1054
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:53,080
I'm just curious to have you play with that.

1055
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:58,560
I think that's a great suggestion for the final panel, for the structure of the final

1056
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,000
panel to do that.

1057
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,200
And can you figure that out between now and then?

1058
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:10,920
It reminds me of in family therapy, there used to be, well, there still is in some context,

1059
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:16,800
a one-way mirror in which the expert sat on the one side and watched the family working

1060
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:23,880
with the therapist, there was a phone and the experts would call in and the therapist

1061
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:29,760
would pick up the phone with the family sitting there and go, okay.

1062
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:40,480
Thank you, and say they want to know why you're so angry or whatever it is.

1063
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,800
It sets up the unknown invisible experts.

1064
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:52,160
I think his name was Tom in 1987, decided to do away with the one-way mirror and he took

1065
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:57,280
down the mirror so that now the people could see the experts and it changed everything

1066
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,360
because behind those one-way mirrors, people would say things to each other about the family

1067
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,800
that the family would never hear.

1068
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:10,160
Suddenly, anything that God said was heard and that became known as a reflecting team.

1069
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:14,760
And what it did was it broke down the power relationship.

1070
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,560
So I think the question is really important.

1071
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:23,560
I think that what can happen here is even when you're having questions directed at us,

1072
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:30,680
we become somewhat, we are the experts in the room and everybody else is an outsider,

1073
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,640
witness group really.

1074
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:40,360
If we don't turn, if we all shut up and listen to reflections from the room that don't necessarily

1075
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:46,720
have anything to do directly with what we've spoken, we would get a whole other body of

1076
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:52,840
knowledge that would arise and then it would end with us reflecting on what we'd heard.

1077
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:58,200
And that's a standard practice in narrative therapy using communities and then outsider

1078
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,360
witness groups and then reflection.

1079
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,200
I think that's a wonderful way to go.

1080
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:07,280
Well, clearly I should have just asked you to introduce the last, you know, collective

1081
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,880
session because that is exactly the idea.

1082
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:15,040
There's not going to, when we meet again in 20 minutes or whatever, there aren't going

1083
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,240
to be people sitting in the middle.

1084
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,920
It's just going to be kind of, you know, as we are and the thoughts that we can squeeze

1085
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,720
in, you know, in the time that we have, which will continue.

1086
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:27,560
And there are a lot of ideas floating around which we'll discuss a little bit later about

1087
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:34,040
how to continue this online offline in person over there over here sort of take yours.

1088
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:41,080
So I want to give a little contribution to this therapy session.

1089
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:45,800
I actually, I'm a long term collaborator with Tala Volk.

1090
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,040
I'm a scientist.

1091
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:55,720
I'm retired, but I'm still active and I always crash at his apartment and makes it very convenient.

1092
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,360
So he invited me here.

1093
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,880
I came Friday night.

1094
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,840
My name's David Schwartzman, by the way.

1095
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:08,480
And I want to start with a quotation, which I don't know if it's been used yet because

1096
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,840
I wasn't here yesterday.

1097
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:17,600
Art is not a mirror of reality, but a hammer with which to shape it.

1098
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:23,440
And that's attributed to Bertolt Breck, but there's some controversy whether it's Mayakovsky

1099
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,440
or whatever.

1100
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:30,000
But what it brings up is art as a technology.

1101
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:37,360
And I think that the technology part has been alluded to, but it's the intersection of art

1102
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:41,080
technology and science, I think is really critical.

1103
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:48,160
So yes, art is a mode, there's a mode of production technology to make art.

1104
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:55,840
But art itself is a technology like a million's design, so a design.

1105
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,000
And obviously architecture and so on.

1106
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:06,720
So it's technology, but it's also, and let me make a quick point about the conflation

1107
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,960
of science and technology.

1108
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:15,840
If you're critical of GMO, then you're anti-science.

1109
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,280
You've heard that.

1110
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:25,320
If you're critical of a technology which appropriates molecular biology, then you are immediately

1111
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:33,920
out by those in that, let's say, business, your attack as being anti-science.

1112
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:44,280
And I was very influenced by Lewis Althuss's philosophy works, in particular, brought as

1113
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:52,480
a mode of aesthetic production, which I think some of his followers already also wrote about.

1114
01:18:52,480 --> 01:19:02,120
And not only brings in the mode of production of making art, but how art interfaces with

1115
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,800
social movements.

1116
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:13,040
The Swat Sticker is an obvious example of a fascist aesthetic, which had a powerful,

1117
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:21,120
I think it had a real powerful influence in empowering the fascist movement, that symbol,

1118
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:26,440
which of course was appropriated from India or in the Navajos, whatever.

1119
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:32,480
But I would share with you two a more positive example.

1120
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:38,040
I, as a scientist, I went to the science march.

1121
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:44,680
And of course, I'm a climate justice activist and all the rest.

1122
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:52,400
But there was science saying science has brought us the cell phone and a cures for, I don't

1123
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,360
penicillin or whatever.

1124
01:19:54,360 --> 01:20:00,000
No one held up the science saying science brought us nuclear weapons.

1125
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:09,720
So the, what I pose, I guess there's a question here, what I'm posing is the great potential

1126
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:17,400
of art being a part of progressive social movements to change the world.

1127
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,360
Going back to Brex quotation.

1128
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:25,240
I'll sort of make a comment to that.

1129
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:32,360
Well, art is a way to engage in the cultural imaginary.

1130
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:42,120
And if we go back to Aristotle, he talks about the poetic epistemag, which is the role of

1131
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:49,720
images, objects, words, et cetera, to essentially get towards that.

1132
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:55,920
That it's the idea that is expressed through this materialization.

1133
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:06,600
And the influence of art as an icon within social practice is a thesis in itself.

1134
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:10,520
We can take it on both sides.

1135
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:19,680
Another image that the Nabam, young girl running naked with burnt body from Vietnam

1136
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:25,160
or the Abu Ghraib images or Michael Jackson.

1137
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:32,440
These are icons that then carry with them huge social dimensions.

1138
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:41,000
And that's in many ways what an icon does, whether we go back to Russian Orthodox religion,

1139
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:46,400
et cetera, that it encapsulates all of the social surround.

1140
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,720
And it has not changed.

1141
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:58,320
Yeah, and art also could be a simulation for the full spectrum of the human experience.

1142
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:04,960
Science is mostly objective, but there's this huge subjective part of us, motions.

1143
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:10,960
And art can be a stage in which we can put these things together and run a simulation.

1144
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:18,560
I think that's another valuable way to think of it.

1145
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,600
My name is Cynthia Panucci.

1146
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:27,360
So I founded art and science collaborations here in New York 30 years ago.

1147
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:33,720
And I've watched the field slowly develop over these years.

1148
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:38,120
After being an art student and coming to New York to start my art career in the early

1149
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,120
70s, I worked in the top print gallery in New York.

1150
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,640
The AAA gallery doesn't exist anymore.

1151
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:49,200
But I saw the elitism of the art world.

1152
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:54,560
And then I see my family members who mostly they're not artists, and people that I know,

1153
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:02,440
galleries are incredibly off-putting to the common person, the common man.

1154
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:10,480
So science, yesterday I said we have to sort of sneak in science and surprise people with

1155
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:15,280
it because you mentioned the word and people turn off their eyes glaze over.

1156
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:24,360
So I think that the people in this room, we represent a really privileged, rarefied environment.

1157
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,600
And I just went to Thanksgiving with my family in relatives.

1158
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:36,960
And I cannot talk about my work because there's no talking about, they feel they're not experts.

1159
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:41,920
And they feel because I've been in this field for x-men years, maybe I'm somewhat of an

1160
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,480
expert anyway.

1161
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:50,540
I like the ideas of crowdsourcing information and citizen science because it's sort of a

1162
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:57,360
natural way to bring people into the issues that we're all really concerned with, I think,

1163
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,720
in this world.

1164
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:04,840
We want to make the world a better place to live, one that's environmentally sustainable

1165
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,840
for future generations.

1166
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:15,960
And we have the privilege of thinking about the implications of AI or genetic engineering.

1167
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:23,000
Most of the people in my family and the people on the common man, they come home, this is

1168
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:30,240
how my brother explained it years ago, we come home, we have three children, we do dinner

1169
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,240
dishes, we make their sandwiches.

1170
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:40,400
We do their homework with them, we read stories to them, we're exhausted, we go to bed.

1171
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,440
We have hybrid minds.

1172
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:51,360
I think we have a responsibility to our society, to put our energies together and to work on

1173
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,640
some of the very, what do they call the complex problems of our time, the stubborn issues.

1174
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,640
What is that term?

1175
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:02,600
The wicked problems.

1176
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:09,600
Anyway, it's sort of for the next rooms panel, but it sort of addresses the crowdsourcing

1177
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:14,600
information, the elitism.

1178
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:22,040
Thinking that the local person, like an Appalachia, wherever, or my brother lives in Michigan and

1179
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:27,400
there are invasive species going into Lake Michigan, and that's why the water is crystal

1180
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:32,920
clear, you can drink it practically, it's beautiful, it cannot sustain life.

1181
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:41,720
And the fishing where tourists like to come and fish, it's seeded by the forestry biology

1182
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:45,800
department at University of Michigan, they put the fish in there every year.

1183
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:51,520
I mean, what type of environment do we want to live in, a totally artificial environment?

1184
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:58,880
But we are the kind of hybrid minds that can be the visionaries, the leaders, and I'm not

1185
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,600
meaning to be elitist.

1186
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:08,000
I think we have to listen to the problems, but the people in Michigan or Wisconsin, the

1187
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,280
whole border, Chicago area, they're not thinking about this in the future, what it's going

1188
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:20,040
to mean for the tourist industry and for just enjoying the lake.

1189
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:26,480
I think that is a great place to end and is kind of giving us the impetus to not let this

1190
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:30,440
fizz out as things so often do after conferences.

1191
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:35,720
Okay, so we're going to have our last artistic interlude of the weekend, we're going to hear

1192
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:44,000
from Dr. Shirley Mueller, who is a neuroscientist, but we're going to hear how neuroscience can

1193
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,680
interact with museum exhibition, which is a kind of new trend I see happening around,

1194
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,640
especially at places like Peabody Essex Museum in Massachusetts.

1195
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:56,760
So we're going to watch a short video, we'll take a break, reconvene for the wrap up.

1196
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,760
Okay, we got through.

1197
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:02,400
We have a fun chair dance turn around and thank you panelists for a wonderful panelist

1198
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,400
morning.

1199
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:10,000
I was still mic'd.

1200
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:19,280
If we could get the lights turned down a little bit on this side, it's perfect.

1201
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:23,980
Yeah.
