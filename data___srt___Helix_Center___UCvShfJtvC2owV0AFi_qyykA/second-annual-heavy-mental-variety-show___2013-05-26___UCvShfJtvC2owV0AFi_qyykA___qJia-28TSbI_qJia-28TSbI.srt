1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Thanks for coming. We've got a good crowd tonight and we'd like to welcome you to the

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,840
second annual heavy metal variety show. We're going to have a lot of fun tonight and we're

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,400
especially glad to be here at the Helix Center and the New York Psychoanalytic Institute.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,960
Before we start I want to thank Ed who runs the Helix Center for putting this together and all

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,640
the people involved, Sharon Weller and others who helped make all this happen. There was a lot

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,520
of logistical details and Miguel and the sound crew because this is not obviously a sound room so

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,480
we're very pleased with what they've been able to put together and we hope you'll enjoy the show.

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,520
We're going to be doing some songs about mind and brain and mental disorders and talking a

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,440
little bit about it. We want to start with a kind of big question. Who are you or what are you? Are

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,640
you a body, a mind, a soul, all of the above, none of the above? Everybody has a different

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,880
opinion about this but it's a pretty ancient question. The oracle of Delphi told Socrates,

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,280
know thyself and you know this was a kind of deep thing because he also told Socrates he was the

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:23,600
wisest man on earth. So some two millennia later, a fellow named Renee had a different idea. He said

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:32,000
well dude I already know this stuff right? Not only do I know myself that's the only thing I can know.

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,880
All I know is what's in my head. So with his famous Kajito Ergo Sum he became the godfather of

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,880
consciousness. This of course is Renee Descartes and he's the grand poopov of consciousness and

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,400
tonight we're going to celebrate Renee by starting out with a song in his honor. The first two songs

18
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,160
will be about mind and brain and consciousness in particular and the first song is called

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:14,080
Inside of Me and it's a direct tribute to Renee Descartes. Okay let's try it now.

20
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:41,520
I think so I am. I feel so I must be. Sometimes I don't know. It used to be me.

21
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:53,840
I see your eyes. They're staring at me. They're sharp as knives.

22
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,360
What do they say?

23
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:19,680
Inside of me.

24
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,200
My soul has passion.

25
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,800
It's trying to feel.

26
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,720
Searching for desire.

27
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,640
Nothing is real.

28
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,640
My will is weak.

29
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,480
Not very free.

30
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,320
Nothing to get hung about.

31
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,320
Well that's just the deal.

32
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
It can't seem.

33
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
It can't seem.

34
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Inside of me.

35
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Inside of me.

36
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
That's the way.

37
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
For me I can be.

38
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,720
You can't see.

39
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Inside of me.

40
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Inside of me.

41
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
That's the way.

42
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Oh me I can be.

43
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,720
I can be.

44
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,640
I think so I am.

45
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,280
I feel so I must be.

46
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,040
Sometimes I don't know.

47
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,640
It used to be me.

48
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,840
I think so I am.

49
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,840
I feel so I must be.

50
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,840
I sometimes I don't know.

51
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,840
It used to be me.

52
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,840
You can't see.

53
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Inside of me.

54
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Inside of me.

55
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
That's the way.

56
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,840
For me I can be.

57
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,840
For me I can be.

58
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
For me I can be.

59
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,840
For me I can be.

60
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,840
For me I can be.

61
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:13,840
For me.

62
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,840
All right thank you.

63
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:25,840
So now we're going to move to

64
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
another mind song, consciousness song.

65
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,840
This one's about that eternal struggle between

66
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
mind and matter specifically about that.

67
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,840
And it's called Mind Over Matter.

68
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Mind Over Matter

69
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,840
Something I'm trying to do

70
00:06:45,840 --> 00:07:09,840
I guess it's only physics

71
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,840
It keeps me apart from you

72
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Mind Over Matter

73
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Something I'm trying to do

74
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,840
Break down space and time

75
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,840
We meet together with you

76
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,840
I'm trying to wheel you here

77
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Find you wherever you are

78
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Locate your body your soul

79
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Pull you in from afar

80
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Are you still in my time?

81
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Have you slipped away?

82
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
Have you gone?

83
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,840
Have you gone?

84
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Well it's about living in another day

85
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:25,840
We're aware of my journey

86
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Different path to another on the sea

87
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,840
In the air, life free

88
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,840
In the place, life free

89
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Wherever you are now

90
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Is my much fun

91
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,840
No amount of space or time

92
00:08:51,840 --> 00:09:05,840
It keeps you from being alive

93
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Mind Over Matter

94
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Something I'm trying to do

95
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,840
I guess it's only physics

96
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,840
It keeps me apart from you

97
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Mind Over Matter

98
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Something I'm trying to do

99
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Break down space and time

100
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,840
We meet together with you

101
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,840
We meet together with you

102
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:25,840
We meet together with you

103
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,840
We meet together with you

104
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Thank you

105
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,840
We've talked about consciousness

106
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,840
We know it's important

107
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,840
To think about consciousness

108
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,840
You know your conscious mind

109
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Is in there and says to you

110
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
Damn why did I say that?

111
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,840
I've got to stick to it now

112
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840
It's too late to backtrack

113
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,840
I've got to stick to that thing

114
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,840
The thoughts are coming out

115
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,840
It's all about the things that

116
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,840
We've been sitting on in our brain

117
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,840
The Oracle knew this

118
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,840
But he needed to school Socrates

119
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,840
Because Socrates didn't realize he was the wisest man on earth

120
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,840
And so he said, you know, if you wanted it, they're the

121
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Oracle said, if you wanted to know the truth, just got to look inside

122
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,840
And the Oracle said, hey, I didn't say it was going to be easy

123
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,840
You got to get in there and dig deep to find out what's going on in there

124
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,840
So, you know, this takes us to two songs about digging deep into the unconscious

125
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:00,840
But before we do that, Tyler's going to do a short reading on something that is relevant

126
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Yes, so I told Joe I'd find something from...

127
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,840
This is from the kathau panna shad

128
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,840
And I just want to say a few words after I read it

129
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Thus develop, this is a advice to everybody, thus develop a super conscious

130
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Way of knowing

131
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Meditation enables you to go deeper and deeper into consciousness

132
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,840
From the world of words to the world of thoughts

133
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,840
Then beyond thoughts to wisdom in the self

134
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,840
So what I take from that is that

135
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,840
When you go beyond the stream, sort of typical stream of consciousness

136
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,840
There can become a super consciousness because the stream of consciousness itself

137
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Is a certain unconscious aspect to it, we think it's conscious

138
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,840
But in many ways when you start meditating you see that there's a lot of automaticity to the mind

139
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,840
So that brings us to the song, the automatic mind

140
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:04,840
This is a song by Tyler

141
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Welcome to the automatic mind

142
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Door is open to remember time

143
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Images are conjured like a dream

144
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Guiding actions on the waking screen

145
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Even though I realize that the light is so bright as I contemplate

146
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:37,840
The automatic mind

147
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,840
We live in the automatic mind

148
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:51,840
In introspection opens in our eyes

149
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:59,840
We seem advanced yet hardly in control

150
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Illusion of the will is comfort

151
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:17,840
Even though I realize that the light is so light

152
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,840
As I think about

153
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,840
And can't live without the automatic mind

154
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Pop, blink, drink, think

155
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,840
You think

156
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:24,220
I'd love to vote.

157
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:31,220
I love you.

158
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:37,220
I love you.

159
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,220
I love you.

160
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,220
Even though I realize it's still I feel so blind

161
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,220
As I think about it.

162
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,220
And can't give me back.

163
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,220
The automatic mind.

164
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,220
All right. Tyler Volkam guitar.

165
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,220
Daniela Schiller on backup vocals.

166
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,220
Thank you.

167
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
Mandathar from base.

168
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:08,220
Jonathan Kanan on Saxon flute and Hamas Madaras on cello.

169
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,220
Okay. Well, we can't talk about the unconscious without, of course, mentioning

170
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,220
Sigmund, especially here in the New York psychoanalytic Institute.

171
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,220
You know, when many of you probably know this, but when Freud visited the US,

172
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,220
one of the main people that he visited with was Abraham Brill, who was one of

173
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,220
Freud's American devotees and disciples, and one of the founders of the New York

174
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,220
psychoanalytic Institute.

175
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,220
So when here being in this room and thinking about the unconscious mind,

176
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,220
you know, as a neuroscientist, I think of the unconscious in terms of how the brain works

177
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,220
and especially in terms of memory.

178
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,220
So, you know, you've probably heard that there are different kinds of memory.

179
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,220
For example, there's explicit memory, which is memory you can consciously retrieve

180
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,220
at will.

181
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,220
It's in your brain.

182
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,220
It's stored in a part of the brain called the hippocampus.

183
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,220
You want to remember what you had for breakfast.

184
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,220
You can reach down in there and out comes the memory.

185
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,220
Or maybe, you know, remember a birthday.

186
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,220
Hi, Christina.

187
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,220
All the way in the back.

188
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,220
So you can remember these conscious things, and Christina Alberini is about to come in

189
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,220
as an expert on these kinds of memories.

190
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,220
But you can dig in and pull this stuff out.

191
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,220
What you do is you retrieve those memories from explicit memory and explicit long-term memory.

192
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,220
Put them into something called working memory, which involves the prefrontal cortex.

193
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,220
And I think that's really what Freud had in mind when he talked about the preconscious.

194
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,220
Memories that were, you know, that are available to be retrieved but aren't being retrieved right now.

195
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,220
But more interesting is the, you know, the true unconscious, the dynamic unconscious.

196
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,220
How can we understand that in terms of the brain?

197
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,220
Well, that's a more complicated thing.

198
00:18:51,220 --> 00:19:00,220
But, you know, a lot of what may be thought of as repressed memories may not quite be like that.

199
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,220
So we know that, for example, certain kinds of very stressful situations will release certain

200
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:11,220
hormones like glucocorticoids, and these will be released from the adrenal gland, go into the brain,

201
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,220
go to our friend the hippocampus and shut it down.

202
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,220
And that takes about an hour to do the full thing.

203
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,220
So during that hour, you might have some memories that will be kind of fragmentally or incompletely formed

204
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,220
and could still be in there, but you won't have the full-blown memory.

205
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,220
So in a situation like that, under severe trauma, you might have an amnesia for the event,

206
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,220
not because you necessarily repressed it, which may happen, but I'm not going to talk about that.

207
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:44,220
But because of the effects of purely the mechanical effects of the stress hormones on the hippocampus,

208
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,220
preventing it from forming a fully-blown memory.

209
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,220
Now the patient may then go to therapy and try to retrieve those memories, and in the process,

210
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,220
may be able to dig out those features and fragments and put together some kind of memory.

211
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,220
And that may be enough, but on the other hand, that opens up the possibility of a lot of false memories.

212
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,220
So we just have to be aware that there are situations where memories can be unavailable,

213
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:17,220
things that were conscious at the time, but become unavailable because of these mechanical effects of stress hormones,

214
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:23,220
and that can maybe account biologically for some of what has been called repression.

215
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,220
That's not to say repression does not exist, I would not say that, but it's not something we understand

216
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,220
from the point of view of the brain.

217
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,220
So now we're going to do a little tune about another aspect of the unconscious.

218
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,220
You know, you can't always trust what you think you know.

219
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,220
You think you have something in your mind and you understand it, you're so sure about it,

220
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,220
but then your mind deceives you.

221
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,220
Things that are in our mind's eye aren't necessarily accurate.

222
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,220
They're just in our mind's eye, which is the name of the next song.

223
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:59,220
Take it away Tyler.

224
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:35,220
If you look into my mind's eye, you would see the way that I cried.

225
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:52,220
Deep inside in my mind's eye, we had love, it was good.

226
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,220
You were there, you understood.

227
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:06,220
Everything, yes everything.

228
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
Here we go.

229
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,220
You can't always trust what you think you know.

230
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,220
You can't trust what you believe.

231
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:22,220
Sometimes your mind just puts on the show, his silly disease.

232
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:31,220
In my mind's eye you were mine, my mind's eye.

233
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:45,220
If you look into my mind's eye, you would see the way that I cried.

234
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:58,220
Deep inside in my mind's eye, you can't always trust what you think you know.

235
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,220
You can't trust what you believe.

236
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:16,220
Sometimes your mind just puts on the show, his silly disease.

237
00:23:31,220 --> 00:24:00,220
Deep inside in my mind's eye, you were mine, my mind's eye was blind, my mind's eye was blind,

238
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:10,220
my mind's eye was blind, my mind's eye was blind.

239
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:16,220
Okay, thank you.

240
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,220
You know the Greeks had a dramatic device known as the Deus Ex Machina.

241
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:35,220
This was a thing where the drama got at its worst where it seemed that the mortals couldn't figure out a god would descend from above and solve the problem.

242
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:46,220
So a long time later a philosopher named Gilbert Ryle sort of rifed on this idea and talked about consciousness as the ghost in the machine.

243
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:55,220
A bit later the cognitive science comes along and tries to understand the way the ghost, the machine underlying the ghost is working.

244
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:01,220
And especially in the field of cognitive neuroscience we're trying to work out the way that machine does its thing.

245
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:07,220
All right, now we're going to do one, another one about the mind and going deep inside.

246
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,220
And this one is called Map of Your Mind.

247
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:20,220
It's about how you know two people get together and you're trying to figure the other one out and look inside what's in the other's mind and try to find the way to work it all out and to be together.

248
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,220
So this one's from our wife Nancy.

249
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,220
All right.

250
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:42,220
I've made a map of your mind.

251
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:47,220
I've charted my course.

252
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:59,220
Sailing deep inside.

253
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,220
Got the heat of your heart.

254
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,220
Keep me from the cold.

255
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,220
Got the currents of will.

256
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:19,220
Take me to your soul.

257
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:29,220
I'm on a journey that I knew I'd made.

258
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:44,220
It's a trip that I had to take.

259
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,220
And excursion of need and design.

260
00:26:49,220 --> 00:27:00,220
So you're a source of art.

261
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:07,220
You'll buy a fire.

262
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,220
Made a map of your mind.

263
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:21,220
I've charted my course.

264
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,220
I've got the winds of horse.

265
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:30,220
Got the heat of your heart.

266
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,220
Keep me from the cold.

267
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,220
Got the currents of will.

268
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,220
Take me to your soul.

269
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,220
I'm just loving that.

270
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,220
My sails will be true.

271
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:03,220
And they'll take me straight to you.

272
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:12,220
Let the winds of strong but sweet.

273
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:34,220
So when I land on my side, my homie.

274
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:52,220
Got the heat of your heart.

275
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,220
Keep me from the cold.

276
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:02,220
Got the currents of will.

277
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,220
Take me to your soul.

278
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,220
Made a map of your mind.

279
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,220
Take me to your soul.

280
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,220
Made a map of your mind.

281
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,220
Take me to your soul.

282
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,220
To your soul.

283
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,220
To your soul.

284
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:40,220
To your soul.

285
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:45,220
Okay, thank you very much.

286
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,220
Okay, now we're going to do another one about memory.

287
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,220
And this is about how hormones help sort of glue your memories together.

288
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,220
It's called, in fact glue.

289
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,220
I still have some crackling sounds there.

290
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:06,220
Okay, Tyler?

291
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,220
So here we go with glue.

292
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,220
I saw you leaving.

293
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,220
You saw me too.

294
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,220
Smile at me.

295
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:31,220
I saw you leaving.

296
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:36,220
You saw me too.

297
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:41,220
Smile at me.

298
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,220
That's what you do.

299
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Tied to follow.

300
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,220
But you are gone.

301
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,220
Now you wait.

302
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,220
Taking home alone.

303
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:10,220
I can't think about your smile and eyes.

304
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:18,220
I can't believe your words were lies.

305
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,220
You make me happy.

306
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,220
So very quiet.

307
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,220
I can't forget those times we had.

308
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:39,220
There must be something in my brain.

309
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:46,220
There must be something in my veins.

310
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:56,220
There must be some primal glue.

311
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:05,220
That needs my other wrist, I got you.

312
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:13,220
When I saw you go, I didn't know.

313
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:19,220
But you'd be back in a week or so.

314
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,220
It's so hard.

315
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:34,220
Realizing that, I wasn't really where you're at.

316
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:42,220
I dream about you, most every night.

317
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,220
I dream you're back.

318
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,220
Everything's alright.

319
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:59,220
I keep my dreams so come true.

320
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:06,220
I'll wake up right next to you.

321
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:14,220
There must be something in my brain.

322
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:22,220
There must be something in my veins.

323
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:29,220
There must be some primal glue.

324
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:49,220
That needs my other wrist, I got you.

325
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:08,220
There must be something in my brain.

326
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:28,220
There must be something in my brain.

327
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:36,220
There must be something in my veins.

328
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:44,220
There must be some primal glue.

329
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:51,220
That needs my other wrist, I got you.

330
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:57,220
That needs my other wrist, I got you.

331
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:09,220
That needs my other wrist, I got you.

332
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:15,220
Okay.

333
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:21,220
And now we get to the part of the evening that Mark was talking about, the fear part.

334
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:28,220
Fear is something that some of us are here were.

335
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,220
John Moss.

336
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,220
I just live in fear.

337
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,220
The time works on the environment, that's a kind of fearful time.

338
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:41,220
The first song we're going to do, Fear is called When the Night is Dark.

339
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,220
When I was a kid, I used to really like vampire movies.

340
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,220
The song was written about vampires, before vampires are really cool.

341
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,220
I'm not like riding the bandwagon.

342
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:02,220
Here we go, When the Night is Dark.

343
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:21,220
When the night is dark, I lose my fear.

344
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:29,220
When the night is dark, I never shed a tear.

345
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:44,220
When the night is dark, I feel so free.

346
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:57,220
When the night is dark, I feel so free.

347
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,220
I feel the peace

348
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,220
Then the day like that

349
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,220
Scares me away

350
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
Gives me away

351
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
When the day like that

352
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
Day like that

353
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,220
Day like that

354
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,220
Day like that

355
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,220
When the night is dark

356
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,220
Night is dark

357
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,220
I come alive

358
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,220
When the night is dark, night is dark

359
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,220
I begin to thrive

360
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,220
In the daylight sun, daylight sun

361
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,220
Scares me away, wears me away

362
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,220
When the daylight sun, daylight sun

363
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:40,220
When the daylight sun, daylight sun

364
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,220
Scares me away, wears me away

365
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:48,220
When the daylight sun, daylight sun

366
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,220
When the happy face

367
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,220
Alright, thank you

368
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:08,220
Thank you

369
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:14,220
Alright, just in time, let's skip all the notes

370
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,220
It's getting late, so we don't want to keep you too long

371
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:24,220
So we drop one song at least and go on to a song that I wrote called Memory Pill

372
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:32,220
This is moving into the topic, the last era general topic for the night, which is, is there a pill for that?

373
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:37,220
I wrote a song called Memory Pill, which is about some work that some of us up here,

374
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,220
Daniela's worked on, John's worked on it too, called a re-consolidation of memory

375
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,220
Daniela's going to tell us a little bit about how that works

376
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,220
No? No? No? No? Okay, that's that

377
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,220
Alright, so...

378
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,220
It's just Israeli accent

379
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,220
No, no

380
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:58,220
So, you remember how in 2004 there was this movie, Turnout Sanction of the Spotless Mind

381
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:03,220
So that was such a great idea, you know, you want to get rid of a memory, you go to the doctor, zappigone

382
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:09,220
So it turns out it was actually based on a true study that happened in Joe's lab in 2000

383
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:14,220
Joe's student, Karim Nader

384
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:21,220
What he found is that, actually, you don't have to target the memory just as it formed

385
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:26,220
You can actually target old memory, so whenever you reactivate a memory, it's unstable in your brain

386
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,220
And this is a window of opportunity to block it

387
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:35,220
So he did this experiment in red, and the red's going to remember the fear, and he gave them a drug, a pill

388
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,220
Not a pill, actually, an injection, and the memory was gone

389
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:43,220
So another question is, can you do it in humans? Can you remember something, get a pill?

390
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,220
And your memory will be gone? Well, we don't know yet

391
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,220
But that's what we think, how memory works

392
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:56,220
There's a twist, though, we can use pills to erase memories when we want to get rid of them

393
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,220
Especially when they're traumatic and bad

394
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:05,220
But what we discovered in the last few years is that you can actually use this mechanism of reconciliation to update memories

395
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:12,220
So whenever you retrieve a memory, it's actually changing and you incorporate new information available at the time of retrieval

396
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:18,220
So really, you don't remember the original event, you just remember your last retrieval of it

397
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:22,220
And with that, Tyler, take us away on memory bill

398
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:41,220
We're in C, right? Yup, great

399
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:47,220
We're in C, right?

400
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:54,220
We're in C, right?

401
00:41:54,220 --> 00:42:14,220
We're in C, right?

402
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:27,220
Oh, yes, oh, please, just give me a pill, wash away my memories

403
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:41,220
Yeah, yeah

404
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:47,220
Birth trauma and childhood stress, chicken pox, what a mess

405
00:42:47,220 --> 00:43:00,220
Baby sitters and nuns and priests to whom I confess Oh, girlfriends and algebra, playground bullies and achievement tests

406
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:06,220
Yeah, I want to get rid of them, yeah

407
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:13,220
Each Tyler, I remember, I'll take a pill

408
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:32,220
Block that storage, make my memory nil, just give me a pill, whoa, yes, oh, please, just give me a pill, wash away my memories

409
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:51,220
I want to get rid of them, yeah

410
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:26,220
Took a stroll through my brain, oh what a cluttered place, my old neurons, low on synaptic space

411
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:55,220
Stop in the hell that I need, that I need to erase, just give me a pill, oh, yes, oh, please, just give me a pill, wash away my memories, just give me a pill

412
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:15,220
Oh, yes, oh, please, just give me a pill, wash away my memories

413
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:21,220
Alright, memory nil

414
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:27,220
Show the new song, okay, so we're gonna do two more songs

415
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:56,220
One is called Brainstorm, and it's about something really bad happening in my life

416
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:38,220
It's raining in my brain, I'm feeling okay

417
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:49,220
Everybody thinks I'm insane, but I'm just on my game, I don't see the harm

418
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:59,220
Just have a brain touch, walk the race and cause it's my magic's in the air

419
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:27,220
Embers and flash, and legs are flashing, all I've again, don't have a cat

420
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:41,220
Brain keeps coming out, thoughts are more profound, everybody's stand clear, hope I'll dissapear

421
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:54,220
I'm not alone, it's just a brainstorm, heart to be, no more despair

422
00:47:54,220 --> 00:48:04,220
Muscles and grandmets are down, oh, I'm on a tear, oh, I'm on a tear

423
00:48:54,220 --> 00:49:23,220
Star's picking up steam

424
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:33,220
There's a lot of times in the dream, there's tons of stand-in still

425
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:38,220
I've got a chill, maybe that's just the norm

426
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:47,220
When you're in a brainstorm, the foster is in, callers are flying, magic's in the air

427
00:49:47,220 --> 00:50:01,220
I'm not alone, I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more despair

428
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:12,220
Muscles and grandmets are down, I'm on a tear, I'm on a tear

429
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:26,220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more despair

430
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:45,220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more despair

431
00:50:45,220 --> 00:51:00,220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

432
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:15,220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

433
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:30,220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

434
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:45,220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

435
00:51:45,220 --> 00:52:00,220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

436
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:30,220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

437
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:45,220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

438
00:52:45,220 --> 00:53:00,220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more despair

439
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:24,220
Muscles and grandmets are down, I'm on a tear, I'm on a tear

440
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:32,220
Brainstorm! All right, we're gonna close it out with one last song

441
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:55,220
This is called Fittingly the Mind Body Problem

442
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:15,220
I've got a mind body problem, I don't know what to do

443
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:24,220
I've got a problem, I don't know what to do

444
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:32,220
My body wants you so, my mind's a no

445
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:42,220
Is such an old love me, to me it'd be true

446
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:51,220
Is such an old love me, to me it'd be true

447
00:54:51,220 --> 00:55:00,220
Oh now you're gone, I'm down and blue

448
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:08,220
But now you're done, there won't be you again

449
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:18,220
But now you're done, there won't be you again

450
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:26,220
If I relent, I lose in the end

451
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:34,220
I've got a mind body problem, he's got a problem, I don't know what to do

452
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:43,220
He don't know what to do, I've got a problem, he's got a problem, I don't know what to do

453
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:49,220
He don't know what to do, my body wants you so

454
00:55:49,220 --> 00:56:13,220
My mind's a no, no, no, no, no, no

455
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:29,220
I even tried religion to get over you

456
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:38,220
I even tried religion to get over you

457
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:43,220
Well, holy dualism

458
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:48,220
Couldn't solve my schism

459
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:52,220
Now you've got the truth and the shaking

460
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:56,220
He's got a problem, I'm craving you

461
00:56:56,220 --> 00:57:01,220
Don't know what to do, I'm craving you

462
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:05,220
He's got a problem, oh I don't know what to do

463
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:10,220
He don't know what to do, oh I'm feeling the pain

464
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:36,220
I miss the sound

465
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:46,220
Oh, I've got a problem

466
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:51,220
I don't know what to do

467
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:55,220
I've got a problem

468
00:57:55,220 --> 00:58:00,220
I don't know what to do

469
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:05,220
My body wants you so

470
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:10,220
I'm on so no

471
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:15,220
Good night

472
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:18,220
Manda Thorpe of Beeth, your yellow shiller

473
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,220
The boss mother of his gun-cannon Tyler Vogue

474
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:24,220
Thank you very much

475
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,220
Joly-Doo

476
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:34,220
Thank you very much
