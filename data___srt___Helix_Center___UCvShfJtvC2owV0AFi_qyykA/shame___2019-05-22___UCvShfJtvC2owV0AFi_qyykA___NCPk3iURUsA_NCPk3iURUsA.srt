00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
I'm Ed Nursecien, I'm Director of the Centre.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,880
Today's program is on shame.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:13,240
Before I introduce the participants, I should tell you that the next program in June is

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:22,240
on status, status, and then in September we have a program on a round table on lying,

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,840
and then we are working on other round tables, including on the suicide.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:39,440
So, I'm going to be very brief with the introductions.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,040
The full biography of the participants is on the website, but I have a printed version

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,640
here that I can send a round and you can just pass it a round if you want.

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,040
Joseph Adamson is Professor Emeritus of English from McMaster University.

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,920
Richard Schweider is the Harold Higgins Swift Distinguished Service Professor, Department

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,880
of Comparative Human Development University of Chicago.

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,000
Michael Lewis is the University Distinguished Professor of Pediatrics and Psychiatry, Robert

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,640
Wood Johnson Medical School.

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,200
The program was suggested to me by Cathy O'Neill, who is there, and she is a mathematician

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,440
and founder of ORCAA.

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,040
So open for you to start.

17
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,560
Well, thank you guys so much for coming.

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,080
Can everyone hear me?

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,920
I think it's very important to speak loudly and clearly.

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,400
And I'm going to be kind of like the dumbest person here because I am a mathematician and

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,080
an author and a data scientist.

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:53,520
I wrote a book about how data science is fucking up democracy, and then I decided to

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,680
write another book about shame, and I have really no right to do so.

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,600
And I'm so grateful for these distinguished professors to come tell me what I've got

25
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,560
it wrong about it.

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,920
So I was just hoping that we could start by talking about what we mean by shame, the

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,800
definition, and then I would love to jump in and say all the bad ideas I have about

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,480
it so I could be corrected.

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,600
But maybe we'll just start by, if you guys are into it, talk about what we mean by shame.

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,120
And for me, it's probably the best to say that I think of shame as something I am rather

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
than something I did.

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,400
So it's not guilt, guilt is something I feel bad about.

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,400
I could apologize and it would be over, potentially.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,240
Shame is something that is sort of a deeper meaning about my worthiness and my worthy

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,800
of something.

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,280
So for me, the sort of deep experience of shame probably came from my parents fat-shaming

37
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,680
me.

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,120
For years and years, I was told I was unattractive, would never get married, would never be worthy

39
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,600
of attention from men.

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,160
And that was sort of my first sort of inhabiting of shame, which I think of, I sort of think

41
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,560
of there as being a sort of four stages of shame.

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,760
The first stage is just inhabiting shame, feeling ashamed on a daily basis.

43
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,160
It's not always terribly shame to like sometimes worse than others.

44
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,000
But just sort of feeling, yes, I am unworthy.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,120
That is inhabiting shame, the first stage.

46
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,360
The second stage happened when I was a teenager and I met people who didn't mind my body and

47
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,720
thought actually I was attractive.

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,760
And sort of like a different context, a different group of people around me that didn't have

49
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,880
the norm that I was unattractive.

50
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,800
And I went back to my family and to my high school friends and they shamed me again for

51
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,440
my body.

52
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,640
It provoked a different kind of experience for me, which I call outrage, outrage and

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
denial.

54
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,880
I was outraged by that.

55
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,240
I was like, I don't deserve that.

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,040
And yet it did make me feel ashamed.

57
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,880
So it sort of both pushed me back into stage one and also gave me this new experience of

58
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
stage two.

59
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:11,320
And I'll just briefly say for me, the stage three, which I call facing the facts, is

60
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,480
we came much later when I was an adult, when I had three children and I had all the sex

61
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,040
I wanted from all the men I wanted.

62
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,880
And I was like, wait, hold on a second.

63
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,840
They actually were lying to me.

64
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,480
It was wrong on its face.

65
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,680
The facts were wrong.

66
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,760
So that's called stage three for me, like facing my personal facts saying, wait a second,

67
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,760
turn off the noise, turn off the Weight Watchers, the industries trying to profit from me, the

68
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,000
people trying to maintain power because I'm very attractive and I'm not, ignore all that.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,840
What are my actual facts at hand?

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,520
And that's what I call stage three facing the facts.

71
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,080
And then stage four for me is when I ultimately think, it's not about me anymore.

72
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,520
It's about saying what the what the heck are we doing to people, to children, by shaming

73
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,160
them for their bodies?

74
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,040
That's when you sort of see it from the outside.

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,720
And I'll stop there because I've already provoked, I'm sure you guys have all such

76
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,360
a yeah, go.

77
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,240
Can everyone hear me with this device on?

78
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,960
Well let me try a definition that I think overlaps with yours and then I'd like to put

79
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,400
out a proposition and give an illustration.

80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,800
And I also think we're going to have to introduce different kinds of societies because your

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,760
description of your experience and relationship to it, I think comes from a particular kind

82
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:38,680
of subculture in which creative individualism, liberation and a big focus on self is privileged

83
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,880
over a lot of other ways of thinking about society.

84
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,360
I take it your parents were actually trying to instruct you in success and status and

85
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,680
the norms of society when they were doing that.

86
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,680
And the capacity to actually reject it, it seems to me a separate issue from analysis

87
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
of shame per se.

88
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,480
I would say shame is something like the fear of being seen as defective by others and it

89
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,400
can take many variations and what the defects are can vary.

90
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,840
I want to propose that shame and perhaps embarrassment are more powerful motivators of behavior

91
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,960
than the fear of death.

92
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,280
And the example I would give would be let's say, you know, if you go back to 1889, there

93
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,800
were the Zulu wars in South Africa and the British had machine guns and knew how to fire

94
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,320
rifles and they killed a lot of Zulu's.

95
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,040
But those Zulu's who went on and fought them for six months would start with a group of

96
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,360
five buddies in a village.

97
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,880
They would create a bond between themselves.

98
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,760
They actually would vomit into a pit, put the vomit, the collective vomit in a gourd which

99
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,880
each of them wore around their necks and would run in beautiful coordinated ways into battle

100
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,880
fifteen miles away to shore death.

101
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,520
They knew they were going to be killed and the machine guns were there and mowed them

102
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
down.

103
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,760
Gallipoli is another example in which I think the fear of shame or not showing courage or

104
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,560
not being there with your buddies is more powerful than the fear of death.

105
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,040
There are lots of social situations of course in which shaming is extremely powerful.

106
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,400
Lois Peake who has studied preschools in Japan for example describes the classroom in a

107
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,800
you know four and five year olds in Japan.

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,840
The teacher walks in, the kids are sitting there and say, teacher we are ready to learn

109
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,320
mathematics and the teacher could look around and say, but so and so doesn't have his book

110
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,640
with him today.

111
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,360
No one can learn mathematics today.

112
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,760
And that night the mother or parents of that kid who didn't bring his book are going to

113
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:53,720
hear from every other mother around and be powerfully shamed into making sure that they

114
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,680
bring that book to school.

115
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,840
And of course this is one of the ways in which the social order is carried forward.

116
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,160
People have a sense of shame.

117
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,000
We don't want someone to be shameless.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,200
In fact in the community I work in in India which is an orthodox Hindu temple town to be

119
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:20,200
full of shame is to have propriety to be civilized to understand the rules.

120
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:28,160
It's an extremely powerful and positive kind of cultivation of self restraint for example

121
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,240
and an understanding of the state instructors that are there and a willingness to play the

122
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,280
part within this choreography of a hierarchical interrelated set of statuses.

123
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,920
And you're going to hear about it if you start deviating from that.

124
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,240
But anyway that's my first pass.

125
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:56,760
Yeah I'm very struck by what Catherine is saying because I'm working on The Mill and

126
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,640
the Floss right, George Elliott.

127
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:08,120
There's a little girl focused on the story, the novel, and she's relentlessly shamed

128
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,800
a child because her complexion is the wrong color.

129
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,040
Her hair is too dark.

130
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,440
Her personality is too big.

131
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:25,200
I mean she has very intense emotions and strong attachments.

132
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,840
So she's breaking all the norms in that society.

133
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,720
Richard Rick was saying.

134
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,240
And it's become very crushing for her.

135
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,280
It's actually an amazing novel in terms of how shame works and how destructive it can

136
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
be.

137
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,080
Although it can be a very positive effect too.

138
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,160
It's a correct, it can be a correct situation.

139
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:02,800
And then her family has an economic downfall, social disgrace.

140
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,920
So it's a kind of piling on of shame.

141
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,680
Because she's a girl, she's restricted.

142
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,760
So she's constantly being shamed just for her gender.

143
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,720
The novel ends very tragically because she finally experiences that kind of outrage you're

144
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:30,880
talking about and acts on it impulsively and elopes with a young man who is, you know,

145
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,720
she's from a lower class.

146
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:42,280
She elopes with a higher class gentleman and basically the idea she disgraces her family.

147
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,360
She's ostracized.

148
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,960
She can find no way of getting out of this impasse in her society and the novel ends

149
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,680
quite tragically.

150
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:58,520
But there are more positive versions of that story in Elliot too where it is a motivator,

151
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:06,880
very strong motivator for what Sylvan Tompkins calls, you know, restoring the good scene.

152
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:16,080
I find his work quite interesting because he sees it as the least punishing of the negative

153
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:22,640
effects as long as it's not magnified because it, you know, inherent in it is a desire to

154
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,960
get back to those good feelings, though that there's sort of positive feelings in the positive

155
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,520
scene.

156
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:37,520
So it could be a remarkable motivating force in human life.

157
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:45,360
I think the real problem is when it becomes toxic, when it's relentless and magnified

158
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,400
when someone's growing up, then it becomes problematic because you internalize it and

159
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:59,720
it's very difficult to break that internalization and to find a new way to be.

160
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,640
So it struck me very much.

161
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,760
You're the story you were telling there.

162
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,560
It's very much like you might enjoy.

163
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,160
I don't know if you've read it, Elliot, but I have.

164
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Yes.

165
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Yes.

166
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
You know what I'm saying?

167
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Go ahead and go.

168
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,960
These are tough.

169
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:25,680
Well, it's, as Yogi Baris said, it's a deja vu all over again.

170
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:33,200
I was in this room perhaps 25 years ago and the topic was shame.

171
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,400
So it's a persistent and an important topic.

172
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,120
Well, because, as I mentioned earlier, I think we're becoming a massive shame culture and

173
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,440
that may be why it's back.

174
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,080
Well, it's certainly the case.

175
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:56,240
I had written a book called Shame the Exposed Self, which in the area of human development

176
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:07,160
and psychology and emotion, not a work and it was of both a synthesis and an attempt

177
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:20,560
to produce theory, a testable theory because the coinage that gets you ahead in my part

178
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,960
of the world is you need to subject this to proof.

179
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,320
It could be logical proof, but more in empirical.

180
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:41,400
But it's a topic, an emotional development, which interestingly enough, Darwin, I just

181
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:51,640
wrote a chapter for someone, on Darwin's treatment of shame, a new Sylvan well, and

182
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,440
we spent the year having lunch together.

183
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,880
Sylvan only ate two orders of coleslaw for the entire year.

184
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,360
And I also tell you another thing about Sylvan.

185
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:15,600
And Damian Uranian, the professor who goes to the horse races is Sylvan Tompkins, modeled

186
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
after him.

187
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:27,080
Sylvan was a wonderful creature, he wrote two of the most incomprehensible volumes that

188
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,680
had read, but it generated a lot of thought and interest.

189
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,320
But I really think if we want to, from an historical point of view, we should go back

190
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,600
to Darwin and read Darwin.

191
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:47,520
When King Close, the major problem Darwin had, is he could not create a theory of the

192
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,880
mind cognition.

193
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:58,720
So even in motion, he moved to the measurement of blushing, which he claimed was a good measure

194
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,800
of it.

195
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:08,240
Part of Darwin's problems, as we know, was he had trouble with a gradualism.

196
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,080
He had trouble going from animals, for primates, to humans.

197
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:23,280
And in fact, he toyed with, and it's in his time, was considered not inappropriate, but

198
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,680
we do.

199
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:35,240
Both people of color and people with an intellectual disability, he saw as a middle group between

200
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,640
great apes and humans, and he toyed with that idea about the emotions.

201
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:48,100
His major problem was he couldn't distinguish between what he called, and I call the self

202
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:54,520
conscious emotions, which we've touched on, which includes guilt, which includes embarrassment,

203
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,520
which includes shame.

204
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:05,800
And if we like, we could also include a hubris, which turns out to be, you know, in the English

205
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,920
language, we have one word for pride.

206
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:17,920
And that's pride goeth before the fall, which is a negative attribute, and proud of one's

207
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,360
accomplishments, which is consider a motivator and a positive.

208
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,520
We only have one word for it, so hubris is probably an attempt of mind to try to move

209
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,800
us away to have two words for the pride we're talking about.

210
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:41,360
It turns out that within the fact, on a Linux tradition, the confusion between shame and

211
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,360
guilt has been enormous, and it probably wasn't until the periods when I was writing

212
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:55,600
and several analysts for writing, Nathan said it was a derivative or a think up, but he

213
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,880
clearly was catching on to the idea that you had to make a distinction between them.

214
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:13,480
In the meeting that I attended, I sort of sat back, unusual for me, and let the analyst

215
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,560
talk about what they meant by shame and guilt.

216
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,640
And of course, if we did this with what we mean by shame, we wouldn't come up with many

217
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
definitions.

218
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,920
So we know it's important, and we know more over that there's we have to take culture

219
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
into account.

220
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:42,760
And Darwin had another idea, and he talked about things which he called action patterns.

221
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:51,320
So I'm going to make a ridiculous proposal to suggest that we don't learn shame.

222
00:17:51,320 --> 00:18:02,360
Shame is an action pattern, and it's set off by the instigators or thoughts about the self.

223
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,920
And thoughts about the self are called self attribution, and that self attributions of

224
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:15,520
a certain kind are likely to lead to certain emotional states, motivators of action.

225
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:28,400
And I think Rick picked up that the idea of shame as an extremely negative emotion is

226
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
questionable.

227
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,120
Shame has clearly a very definite function.

228
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,480
Having one of the functions of shame is it stops you dead in your tracks.

229
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:49,840
You suddenly became suddenly developed a damaged self, and you have to do something about that.

230
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:57,120
Guilt on the other hand does not lead to a damaged self, it leads to reparation.

231
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,560
And so if you wanted to measure it, and since I'm interested in how it starts, I look at

232
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:12,040
the children, I can measure what a child does when they fail at something, they know they

233
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,600
failed, and there's some children who try to repair the failure.

234
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:24,000
There's some children who collapse, and there's some children who in fact don't show any of

235
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,080
these self negative self conscious like emotions.

236
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,520
And I want to tell you about the action pattern is specifically.

237
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,320
Okay, what is the action pattern?

238
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
I would have said it's hiding.

239
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,200
Well, I think I think you're absolutely.

240
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,760
But it's stopping.

241
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:51,160
And they're so been had some idea he called it interruption, but it's not interrupting

242
00:19:51,160 --> 00:20:00,320
as the consequence of the act that's the consequence of the action pattern is to stop you hiding

243
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,600
is another way is part of the stopping.

244
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:12,920
So I would certainly agree that hiding we measure it by in fact the collapse of the body,

245
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,000
which is an attempt to hide the self.

246
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:26,800
The phenomenal logical experience is I want to die, hide and disappear or die.

247
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,360
So it is clearly a self inhibit.

248
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:42,320
But let me give you this example because one of the things that I discovered in 60 years

249
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:49,680
of studying this is it's very, very tricky.

250
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:56,560
And I've come to a much greater appreciation with people trying to think about it in a

251
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,720
more dynamic way.

252
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,280
When you're studying it, you have to stop it and look what just happened.

253
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:11,720
So let me give you a story that years ago a patient told me is driving a car.

254
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
It was at night.

255
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,000
It was on a lonely road.

256
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,120
It was raining and very hard to see anything.

257
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:28,280
And as he's driving, he hits a door, runs in front of him and he hits that door.

258
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:35,440
He slams on the brake and his first thoughts are what a horrible person I am.

259
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,800
I've just killed a dog.

260
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:44,600
Now he doesn't like to have that thought and the action pattern associated.

261
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,040
So he says, how do I get out of this?

262
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,480
I mean, it isn't safe, literally.

263
00:21:50,480 --> 00:22:00,360
But very quickly, he decides, one, he's not the cause of this mishab, this failure.

264
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,520
Why?

265
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:10,920
Because it's raining and it's dark and moreover, the owner let the dog run wild.

266
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:20,520
So all of a sudden, he starts up with this powerful self-crunching action pattern.

267
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:28,080
But given the flexibility that we humans have, we can change our mind.

268
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,440
We can reinterpret it.

269
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,240
And indeed, what he does is he blames another.

270
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,800
Now the interesting thing, if it becomes a personality, namely, one constantly in a

271
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:48,560
situation in which the self might be injured.

272
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:55,440
Constantly, we interpret into other attributions.

273
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,800
Essentially, it's either not my fault.

274
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,880
By the way, males are much more likely to use it than females.

275
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,240
The attribution is it's not my fault.

276
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,800
I'm sorry, it's not my fault.

277
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:17,560
Females tend to use the attribution and is my fault more.

278
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:29,360
But the fact of the matter is that I think the example characterizes that in front of

279
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,720
us is what I call standards, rules, and goals.

280
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,160
These are cultural events that are taught.

281
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,040
These have no unique content.

282
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:53,760
However, when one has in the self attribution the capacity to think about oneself.

283
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,920
That's a whole other story on the development of that.

284
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:08,680
But having that capacity, you enter into a chain, a process, and depending on the outcome

285
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:16,040
of that process, you end up with the kind of action pattern that you're trying to describe.

286
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,000
So, let me stop.

287
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,480
I think this is going to be one of several cases where we're going to have to be very

288
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,920
clear about the boundary conditions we put about any generalizations we make.

289
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,680
Because the mode of control that you just described is not going to be readily available.

290
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,920
For example, in that Hindu temple town where I've been working for several decades, because

291
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,120
there's not going to be the capacity to blame others or to see yourself as a victim, the

292
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,720
reasoning is going to be you always reap what you sow in life.

293
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,880
And anything that happens is a consequence of your prior actions.

294
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,560
And you come into the world with spiritual debts.

295
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,840
And what you're doing constantly in life is trying to reduce the spiritual debts you

296
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,120
have because the more spiritual debts you have, the more likely you're going to be in the

297
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,880
kind of circumstance you describe.

298
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,920
The very fact that it was a rainy day and someone let their thing happen to you, why

299
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,400
did that happen to me?

300
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,000
It happened to me because of my past behavior and the spiritual debts that I bring in.

301
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And so you're constantly trying to reduce those spiritual debts to various means that

302
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,880
are available to you that could be living a righteous life, could be eating the correct

303
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,880
food.

304
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,560
But in any case, this whole mode of causal analysis of which you say, I'm not responsible,

305
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,960
is not going to be available as a construal.

306
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,360
There's mostly many problems with what I've said.

307
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:49,000
One of them is a kind of a backward backtracking in cognitive science.

308
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,040
They've caught on to backtracking.

309
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,120
For those of you who don't know, a year ago, people wanted to discover how come an animal

310
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:08,320
eat something and 24 hours later get sick from it and has learned not to eat that thing.

311
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:15,600
And the argument is that we can move time, space, and an interesting way, forwards and

312
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:23,040
backwards, our associative systems allow us to move backwards and forwards in time.

313
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:29,080
So it is absolutely the case.

314
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:36,840
If we could talk about religions as well, I want to step up a little bit because as

315
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,240
a mathematician, I think very axiomatically.

316
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,160
And I think we all are actually kind of agreeing.

317
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,720
I want to go back to what you said.

318
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,760
It's like there's a norm here, right?

319
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,200
You shame someone with respect to a norm.

320
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,840
I was shamed with respect to a body norm.

321
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,640
What you're describing is when there is no other norm.

322
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,480
Those people did not have access to a community where it was okay to be fat.

323
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
It wasn't fatness.

324
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,240
It was like this concept of a debt to the gods.

325
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,840
If they had, let me imagine if some of them had gone on a study abroad program.

326
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,320
It's actually not the gods.

327
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Okay, the nature.

328
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,520
My point is that they were ensconced in this norm group.

329
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,680
So of course, they're not going to see a different way of thinking about it.

330
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:34,400
And I just want to say, like to another point you made, we are living in a shaming culture.

331
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,040
So I'm just going to throw on another layer here.

332
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,880
I also had another experience of shame.

333
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,000
When I worked in finance, I worked at a hedge fund during the crisis with Larry Summers.

334
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,120
And I said, oh my God, we screwed up the world.

335
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,440
I felt ashamed.

336
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,520
I quit my job.

337
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
I joined Occupy Wall Street.

338
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:02,040
And I attempted to shame the government to improve financial regulation.

339
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,120
And that was shame.

340
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,000
I think shame is great.

341
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,720
Shame is very, very useful.

342
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,880
You were punching up.

343
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
I was punching up.

344
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
Right.

345
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,280
So I like to think of shame in three categories.

346
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,920
Punching up.

347
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,240
Punching down.

348
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,240
And I think shaming someone for their body, something that they can't control, is punching

349
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
down.

350
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,800
What about the usefulness for shame just for the person, independent of, because you're

351
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,920
only talking about being shamed or shaming.

352
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Yes.

353
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,880
But what just feeling of having shame or feeling shame?

354
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,480
I mean, shame, as you point out, it can be very useful for cohesion in a culture.

355
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,680
I shame, for that matter, I shame my children when they don't do their chores.

356
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:53,920
It's a lubrication to get people to follow the rules without having to explain the rules

357
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,640
every single time and actually have to administer punishment when they don't.

358
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Let me just finish my framework and then I'll let you guys respond.

359
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,360
I think there's a third type of shame that's getting more and more prevalent in this culture.

360
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,560
There's punching up, shame, there's punching down shame.

361
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,040
The third type I call punching nowhere, shame.

362
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,960
And punching nowhere, shame, is when we try to, we sort of performatively shame people

363
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,320
that will not care.

364
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,280
And what I'm thinking here, emblematic example, is when people on the left, because I'm on

365
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:30,040
the left, when I go to Twitter, I'm seeing my lefty friends, they are retweeting Trump

366
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:36,200
or Trump's son and saying, and sort of saying something to him in their retweet to sort

367
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,960
of try to shame Trump.

368
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
It's ludicrous.

369
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
It's ludicrous.

370
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,600
Like, do you think they are going to care what you're saying?

371
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,040
But it's definitely an attempt to shame.

372
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,440
It's a failed attempt to shame.

373
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,160
It's a performative thing.

374
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,680
And my question is, what is the end result of that?

375
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,440
And my feeling is it's not just a waste of time.

376
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,280
It's actually a problem.

377
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,480
And I think the anti-vaxxing movement is largely a product of that.

378
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,080
And I think the incels, which are the young, mostly white men who are misogynistic online,

379
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,800
talking to each other about how terrible women are, and actually going at sometimes and killing

380
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:22,920
people, killing women, is a very direct reaction to this shaming, performative shaming punching

381
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
nowhere called charity.

382
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,720
People call this virtue signaling also.

383
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,600
It's that's what I mean by performance.

384
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,080
I'm performing righteousness by shaming Don Jr.

385
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
Everyone retweet me.

386
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,480
But, you know, it doesn't actually, in number one, it doesn't shame him.

387
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,680
And number two, it just makes the other people more dehumanized.

388
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,400
It dehumanizes them.

389
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,600
It sort of focuses on us versus them.

390
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Right.

391
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,720
Well, there's a sense in which, you know, I mean, I think there's a certain picture of

392
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,360
shame as oppressive, which comes from people who don't like living in closed communities

393
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,440
where there are these norms that everyone shares.

394
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,800
And they feel oppressed by it, and they want out.

395
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:09,880
It's sort of the creative individual who is willing to be transgressive with regard to

396
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,200
the norms, and they go to New York City, okay, rather than live in the small community.

397
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,760
Now it seems to me what's happened, however, is that the surveillance that goes on in small

398
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,360
communities, which produces shaming of all kind, often to maintain social order, and often

399
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,840
quite effectively, has now returned in the form of Twitter.

400
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,640
It's now reformed in the terms of newspapers that are constantly looking to invade and

401
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,680
get information that people think is private.

402
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,040
And if they can expose it, it becomes now the equivalent on a much larger scale of these

403
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,480
small communities.

404
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,120
And ironically, that's what we're doing.

405
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,680
The technologies have broken down the private public distinction.

406
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,960
The idea that you could find an area where you couldn't be shamed because you could draw

407
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,160
the shade, you could close the door.

408
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,280
It was in a private realm where you could be experimental with transgressive behavior,

409
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,120
and leave it there, is no longer possible.

410
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,840
And that reaches the essentially, we found a way to have a technology that turns us into

411
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,840
a small community again with all of these kinds of attempts you're describing.

412
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,400
Well, to humiliate people.

413
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,000
You can do a text on me of shame.

414
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:32,760
But there are anything can shame you if you have a standard or rule, a goal, and you don't

415
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,680
– and these are cultural determinant.

416
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:46,240
Although there was some argument, historically, that shame or charm, the German for back or

417
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:53,800
back side was in fact, and the early attempts at trying to address it was around toilet

418
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,520
training and shame was there.

419
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:06,000
Having lived a long life, when I was six or seven, I needed glasses.

420
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,960
And it was shameful to wear glasses.

421
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,080
You were called for eyes.

422
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,640
Now we're not ashamed of wearing glasses.

423
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,440
There's a – as you age, there's a hearing loss, okay?

424
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,600
And I wear hearing aids.

425
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:35,480
And hearing aids are designed, the technology, mostly that they should be hidden because

426
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,800
wearing hearing aids is shameful.

427
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:46,280
So we can change readily what is or isn't shameful.

428
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:53,240
The idea to be helpful is there has to be some cultural standard or rule.

429
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,680
Now interestingly enough, you could have a rule to be shameful.

430
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,000
That is, it's good to be shameful.

431
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,440
And so you could find many things that you might need to sweep away because you would

432
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
step away.

433
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,160
You can't eat a plant that's a root because there might be insects and destroy.

434
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:20,360
So I don't know how useful it is.

435
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:27,480
I think it is useful if we want to go contemporary to look at what's happening in not only our

436
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,200
culture, but everywhere.

437
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:36,440
To begin with, when I got a bad grade as the son of parents born in Europe turned to the

438
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:44,160
century, but nonetheless, I was ashamed for their shame that I didn't get a good grade.

439
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:51,800
I was not only ashamed for myself, I was ashamed that my parents' shame, well, that

440
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,880
doesn't seem much the case anymore.

441
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:07,560
But it seems to me that we need to not talk about the different kinds.

442
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:14,360
Let me just tell you what the observation in these meta-analyses are.

443
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:22,120
One, amount of narcissistic behavior has enormously increased.

444
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:30,840
Any scale or the various scales that supposedly measure it show an increase in this country.

445
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,440
Two, an increase in perfectionism.

446
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:46,360
That is, being overwhelmed by the concern for making an error.

447
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:52,080
Three, decrease in empathy.

448
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:59,440
All of these are an emphasis.

449
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,640
I think these things come about.

450
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,600
Rick has hinted at it.

451
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:14,840
These things come about because the self has become an increasing object to the self.

452
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:27,040
So that selfies, tattoos, communication, it's a common knowledge especially in the age group

453
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:34,320
in this room, that you watch a couple sitting, each taking a picture of their dish, sending

454
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,400
it to other people.

455
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,800
These are very technologically advanced, very complex behavior.

456
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,200
The more you pay attention to yourself, the more trouble you ultimately get in.

457
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,840
It's a pretty safe hypothesis.

458
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:02,640
A baseball slump occurs because you start to think that you are in a slump and thus

459
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:10,040
the kind of physical timing that you need to hit a ball, a swing at something before

460
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,960
as it's leaving the hand of the pitcher gets disrupted.

461
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,560
I have the problem when I have to shift.

462
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Do self-conscious.

463
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,000
Well, I think the quote is, if you think you stink.

464
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
That's right.

465
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:32,440
So fundamentally, on a steep hill, when I'm driving a shift, which I learned to drove

466
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:43,680
most of my life, I was in Berkeley on Cedar Avenue, which has some steep hills that, and

467
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,880
now you have to put it in neutral, and there's a car behind you, and you've got to shift

468
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:56,840
into first and very steep, and you just start to think about, I may have trouble shifting,

469
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,160
you're going to have trouble shifting.

470
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:07,280
The whole point in motor action is to get it out of the operating system because there

471
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,880
are better things in your head to be doing with.

472
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:19,680
The point is, if in fact it is the case that we have become more self-involved as a way

473
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,440
to be happy, I don't know what the goals are, that fundamentally you would get an increase

474
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:33,600
in shame because you're paying attention to yourself, and therefore you would need mechanisms

475
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:40,080
to get away from it, which is narcissism, a very powerful mechanism.

476
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,000
It's not my fault, or I didn't make a mistake.

477
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,480
It's a defensive mechanism.

478
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,920
Well, they're essentially, yes, they're defensive mechanisms for the increase.

479
00:38:51,920 --> 00:39:00,360
So the decrease in empathy is it's their fault, their poor, it's their fault to be poor.

480
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,080
They are quite handsome.

481
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,640
They should live all the way with Shamer and Chief in the country right now.

482
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,200
That's what he's talking about.

483
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Well, Kathy, you are...

484
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,200
I'm sorry, I disagree.

485
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,740
I mean, we're wrong like Darwin thought that getting a red in the face was meant your

486
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,740
shame.

487
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,740
It's too easy.

488
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,560
It's not about selfies.

489
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,120
Selfies is narcissistic.

490
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,600
I just, obviously, it's vain, obviously.

491
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,920
I think people who do that are more vulnerable.

492
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,400
They're more vulnerable to shame.

493
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,960
People who take selfies, like just defining that way.

494
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:36,520
They are more vulnerable to shame, but I think the worst aspect of modern social media is

495
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
are not the selfies.

496
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,200
They're just annoying.

497
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:48,160
The worst aspect are the self-righteous shammers who are dehumanizing others and who are working

498
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,800
actively to decrease our empathy.

499
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,600
I think the empathy is the key.

500
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,280
We are decreasing our empathy to people we don't agree with.

501
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,400
We were like, if you think that, you must be a monster.

502
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,680
And honestly, we say that about people with whom we agree, 85% of the time, but we found

503
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,680
the 15%.

504
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,600
Social media helped us find it.

505
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,920
The 15% where we disagree and we're like, oh my God, I thought I liked you, but you're

506
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,920
a monster.

507
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,720
Now I know.

508
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,520
That's the kind of performative self-righteous shaming that is a problem.

509
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,080
Selfies is a small thing.

510
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,120
It's an interesting difference between shame and guilt in this sense because you do need

511
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,800
the cooperation of the other person to feel guilty if you try to, you might shame them

512
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,640
and hope they feel guilty about something they've done.

513
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,000
But to simply shame, you just need to leave a mark.

514
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,880
It doesn't need to be reciprocated.

515
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,800
Anyway, I think you need the cooperation of the other.

516
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,120
I would have thought that guilt could be just between you and your ego ideal and if you

517
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
don't live.

518
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,640
No, I mean, if you need the other to confess, if that's the way in which you're going to

519
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
unload your guilt.

520
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,760
If you're posting online and you want to leave a shame mark on someone, you don't need them

521
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
to reciprocate.

522
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,720
That's why it goes on and it goes on despite its utility.

523
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,320
What do you think the response is when you're the receiver of that?

524
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,360
If you know that you've 85% agree with the person and they're accusing you of being a

525
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
monster.

526
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
I personally feel terrible that happens, but I'm afraid.

527
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
What else would you feel?

528
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
What else would you feel?

529
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,360
You'd feel angry.

530
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,440
You'd feel outraged and you would say, no, you're the monster.

531
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,440
And that's the point, it becomes a feedback loop, a dynamical system where I guess I was

532
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,000
getting at the idea that it doesn't require as much empathy or back and forth for you

533
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,720
to simply leave a mark that intends the shame versus to engage someone and to make them feel

534
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
remorseful.

535
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,720
It sounds infantile, right?

536
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,800
I know you are, but what am I?

537
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Yes.

538
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
At that level.

539
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,960
I'd like to pick up something you might go and just said, because I do have this sense

540
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:48,520
that there are certain pre-potent areas that it's easier to shame than other areas, that

541
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,840
it's just any arbitrary rule.

542
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,280
And I'll get to this way.

543
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,880
If you look at the explanations of illness around the world as an anthropologist, why

544
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,960
people think they're suffering, there are very, there's a big three.

545
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,360
The most frequent thing people do is point interpersonal influences on themselves, like

546
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:13,080
witchcraft, evil eyes, sorcery, some things be friends and neighbors who envy me who are

547
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,040
making me feel sick.

548
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,880
And then there end up being moral explanations in which they blame themselves for their suffering

549
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,720
and they think they've transgressed in some way.

550
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,480
And then there are of course biochemical explanations, which it turns out are not the most frequent

551
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,520
on a worldwide scale.

552
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,440
The other two are an interpersonal or far and away the most common.

553
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,000
But in the moral domain, when you look at what transgressions lead people to think,

554
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,240
I did that and that's why I'm suffering right now.

555
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:47,880
There's a small number and they end up being sexual, food and authority relationships.

556
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,560
So if you kick your father and six months later you go blind, you're not going to fail

557
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,080
to wonder whether you're blind because you kicked your father.

558
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,440
There's something about those areas of experience in life that somehow are pre-potent and I

559
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,720
wouldn't be surprised shaming could work that way.

560
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:13,880
I think it's a perfectly reasonable hypothesis indeed that there may be pre-potent, that

561
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:24,560
is failures or evaluations of one's behavior vis-a-vis some kind of standards, unique ones

562
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,160
may be pre-potent in fact.

563
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:37,360
And there would be good reason to suggest that these should be very important and frequent

564
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:47,360
enough events so that you protect against violating the rules because it really is going

565
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,720
to hurt you.

566
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,280
One of the problems is now we're going to introduce embarrassment.

567
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,200
Let me say a word about it.

568
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,760
If I sat down with anyone in this room and said, tell me about things that embarrass

569
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:08,960
you, you would, if you knew me for a while, you would tell me about embarrassing things.

570
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,600
If I said, tell me about the things that shame you, you don't.

571
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:20,200
And so it's been said that shame gets you into therapy but prevents you from getting

572
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
better.

573
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,640
There's no comparison because the lesson tends to operate.

574
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,760
We know that there's two kinds of embarrassment.

575
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,680
There's embarrassment of being the object of others' attention.

576
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,440
Darwin talked about it and it is certainly the case.

577
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:43,080
I could show you if for example the group around the table decided we would all simply

578
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,280
point at another person in unison.

579
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,320
For no reason we randomly selected it.

580
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,800
That person being pointed to would get embarrassing.

581
00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:00,160
For example when you're introduced and the introducer says very nice things about you,

582
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,640
you certainly enjoy it but you are certainly embarrassed.

583
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:11,720
Now you could argue you should be embarrassed but I can show you in 18-month-olds, to 24-month-olds

584
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,040
when this embarrassment comes in.

585
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,000
People play a game of pointing to each other and they tend to embarrass.

586
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,200
The object of attention turns out to be a very early form of embarrassment.

587
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:35,160
It also starts to involve body because the early forms is may he.

588
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:43,480
So if you point to a child at 20 hertz who recognizes itself in a mirror by touching its

589
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:50,360
nose and you point to it, the child will show you embarrassment.

590
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:57,720
If you ask children, how many of you have children, grandchildren and the parent says

591
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:04,800
show grandfather or grandmother the new thing you do and the child shows embarrassment.

592
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,200
Why isn't that just changed, the mild form of shame?

593
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:14,160
Well because it seems by the reporter not to be shameful.

594
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:21,880
People have trouble interpreting this because it also turns out to be an individual difference.

595
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:33,040
Shy people are in fact those people who over respond to being the object of others' attention.

596
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:40,920
So there seems to be a distribution in the population of people who when they have the

597
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,000
object of attention show embarrassment.

598
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:53,200
This is a fair thing that people have different thresholds for shame, lower hires.

599
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,520
Yes, they're wired that way.

600
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,440
It's a way, we're wired that way.

601
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,760
Yeah and so there must be a usefulness to shame.

602
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,760
Most of the conversation has been about shame as a problem that you can shame.

603
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,380
You gave the example of your school, they shamed you and you felt ashamed about your

604
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,380
parents.

605
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,120
But there must be some reason why we have this emotion of shame.

606
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,480
It's absolutely very important socially for one thing.

607
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:32,520
You know if you do something let's say you're at a dinner party and your host is going on,

608
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,040
this won't happen tonight.

609
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:44,200
And you're irritated about something, maybe not even something to do with him.

610
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,280
And you lose it, you lose your temper.

611
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,040
And you insult it.

612
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,120
Exactly and you're right.

613
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:05,880
Now you know, I think a lot of us have done something like that.

614
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,160
And you feel terrible, right?

615
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:13,560
The feeling is you just feel like you're, like there's this sort of sickness sinking, right?

616
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:19,280
You just feel so ashamed of what you've done.

617
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,440
Because you have shamed him.

618
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,720
Well I think more you've, yeah, more you've acted in an entirely inappropriate way.

619
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,120
It draws attention to you.

620
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:37,320
And you there, and so you, you know, we've all done this, I've done it.

621
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,720
You know, you go away, you feel terrible, the next day you go over and you want to make

622
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,720
it right.

623
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:48,000
I think this is what Tomkins is talking about when he says that shame and here it in shame

624
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,600
is a desire to restore the positive feeling, right?

625
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,280
To restore what he calls the good seed.

626
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,840
And you apologize.

627
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:02,600
And you say, I don't, you know, I behaved so inappropriately, I'm very sorry, you know.

628
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,600
So look at the way.

629
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:09,040
And so that's highly functional because it's a highly functional.

630
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,640
Well it's more functionally if it prevented you from doing what you did.

631
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,000
Well it often does, right?

632
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,400
I mean it often prevents you from it.

633
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,440
You know, let's say the person is, and they correct themselves before they do it, right?

634
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,440
They control themselves.

635
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:29,800
It's a very important mechanism to reduce shame, confession.

636
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:35,760
You say, just as you indicated, I'm sorry I did that.

637
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,240
Forgive me.

638
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,520
So clearly there are mechanisms to reduce it.

639
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,640
One of them is displacement to blame the other and become angry.

640
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,920
And other is to internalize it and move toward depression.

641
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,800
I am a worthless creature now and in the future.

642
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:03,960
And the other one is to make fun of yourself, interestingly enough, especially in embarrassment.

643
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,040
So Michael, what you make of socialization techniques designed in some subcultures to

644
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,040
induce them.

645
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:17,360
So for example, Heidi Fung has done observations of children and families in Taipei, in Taiwan.

646
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:25,400
And the mother when she's around other associates or relatives or friends will bring in her

647
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:33,560
young child who has transgressed in some way like you was describing and has them narrate.

648
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,200
Their transgression.

649
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,280
Tell them how bad you were.

650
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,960
And it's not a confession.

651
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,960
It's not really there to get rid of some feeling.

652
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:49,880
It's there to recapitulate it and to have this child essentially cultivate a sense of

653
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,800
shame by inducing it in a very public way.

654
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,680
Presumably that's going to be relatively effective in having it not happen.

655
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:06,560
And when she shows the video tapes at an American Psychological Association meeting, everyone

656
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,400
views it as child abuse.

657
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,400
And she has to stop showing it because it provokes such a discussion.

658
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,720
So public shaming was a thing in this country.

659
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,680
There was a book called So You've Been Publicly Shamed Written by John Ronson recently.

660
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,680
Or maybe Ron Johnson.

661
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,360
I can't remember how he says his name.

662
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:32,880
But he did a study about this, a sort of New England early America, sort of scarlet letter

663
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,760
type stuff.

664
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,520
And he researched sort of the history of it.

665
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:46,840
And it stopped eventually, not because it became less useful, but because it was so harsh.

666
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:53,000
Like the public view, the people who came to see the public shaming were so into it that

667
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,320
it was embarrassing to the authorities.

668
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,520
That's why they stopped doing it, not because it didn't work.

669
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,400
So I have a mini example of this.

670
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:04,760
I lived with a six year old daughter and 10 year old son in rural India for a year and

671
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,280
they went to a local convent school.

672
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,440
And one day my son said to my wife, I don't want to go to school today.

673
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,440
And she explored it.

674
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,680
Why didn't you want to go to school today?

675
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,760
Because he had seen when you didn't do well on a math exam in that school, they pinned

676
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,640
it to your back and you wore it all day long around the school.

677
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,560
That was their technique for public shaming.

678
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,120
Which, you know, it's a complicated thing.

679
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,560
We can view that as harsh.

680
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,880
He obviously was, we come from a subculture where we weren't going to let that happen.

681
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,440
Nevertheless, internally, I'll bet those kids are all over the world doing really good math

682
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,440
down.

683
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:58,440
And Zimla has several books that are 25 years old that documents very clearly spare the

684
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,160
rights, spare the rights for the child.

685
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,160
Fundamentally, the theme to teach moral behavior.

686
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,880
You teach, you will forgive me, that you were born in sin.

687
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:21,240
Okay, and that's what we have in Christianity, the belief you are born in sin.

688
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:28,080
It's a different form, but you come into the world with a long history of transgressions

689
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,080
and friar lives.

690
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,360
You're not innocent, blank slate.

691
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:41,440
There will be there are techniques which, for the most part, we've given up as publicly

692
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,800
acceptable, but in fact are employed.

693
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:51,520
How many parents, if you watch them with their children and the child does something, switches

694
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:59,240
up their nose, for those of you who can see my face, which is a semi-discussed face.

695
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,240
That's disgusting.

696
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,240
You're disgusting.

697
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:10,680
Discussed is a very, very powerful shame-a-listener.

698
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,400
And so we were talking about, and I wanted to hear you tie together what you believe is

699
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,400
the connection between embarrassment and shame before you do.

700
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:25,280
I just wanted to add this extra ingredient, which is these do all have biological rudiments.

701
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,600
Like disgust, expression, the early stages of which embarrassment can be elicited in

702
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:37,360
children, etc., suggest to me that these potential, I would say, components of shame start even

703
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,160
on a very biological basis.

704
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,680
Before they're co-opted by society and form shame.

705
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:54,400
The study divorce in couples in trouble has pointed out that when one member of the couple

706
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:01,320
exhibits a shame faced toward the other for some action or some statement, the consequence

707
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:10,200
of that is either the one receiving the disgust face shows a depressive reaction or, in fact,

708
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,960
gets angry back, you know, how dare you shame me.

709
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:25,800
So clearly, we're going to have to worry about shame publicly, but also shame privately.

710
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:33,800
But there's a shame between the same, which I'll, that's disgusting, and that's, you

711
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,000
know, that's shameful or shaming the child.

712
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,080
I think there's a significant difference between the two.

713
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,080
Well, okay.

714
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:46,720
You know, I think we have an issue with shame which says fear of being perceived as disgusting.

715
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,720
That's actually what we'll be.

716
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,720
Well, it depends on what we say.

717
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,720
It's certainly.

718
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,720
Don't eat that.

719
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,720
That's disgusting.

720
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,720
That's different from your disgusting.

721
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,720
Yeah.

722
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:00,200
It's a question of whether you should be ashamed of yourself.

723
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:05,120
It doesn't seem to me to be as toxic as saying that you're disgusting.

724
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:09,640
You're a disgusting person because a disgusting, that's very rejecting.

725
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,640
Yes.

726
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,640
Right.

727
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,880
That's like, that's very distancing.

728
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,640
Where in shame, there's always a bridge back.

729
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:22,920
But how it's heard may defend may depend on the child to a degree.

730
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,960
I would like to add something a bit different.

731
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,200
I would like to add something a bit different because it is, from everything you are saying,

732
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:39,800
the implication is that you become frequently ashamed because you have been shamed off

733
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,520
and growing up.

734
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:47,400
That's not necessarily, I don't think it's the experience of psychoanalysts and generally,

735
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,600
certainly not my experience.

736
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:54,480
Some people have more shame, some people have less shame and it's not based on to what

737
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,480
degree their parents or their teachers or the school shamed them.

738
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:04,920
Well, it seems to do and the psychoanalytic idea that has a lot more to do.

739
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,920
Sorry.

740
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,800
You become victimized if you are repeatedly ashamed and becoming victimized means you

741
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,000
become the victim.

742
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,680
And so the report was that I really was shameful, not that my parent necessarily did that to

743
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,680
me.

744
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:29,680
Indeed, what I would like to say if we could do such an experiment is to say in a high

745
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:37,120
shaming family, what does the child do when the child finally becomes in charge and the

746
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,240
parents are now old?

747
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:48,720
They don't talk about old people being abused but a sweet revenge to a lifetime of being

748
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,080
ashamed.

749
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:57,760
So I wanted to get back to Kathy's observation about the historical change that took place,

750
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:03,000
let's say from the Massachusetts Bay Colony or 17th century Puritanism and its morality.

751
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,800
Because I do think in some sense the cyber stocks are back right now and we're very much

752
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,080
like that period once again given the technologies that we have.

753
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:20,080
But I do feel that it's important to think about societies that liberate individuals

754
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:24,520
from communal ethics of community type structures.

755
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,920
And when that happens I think they begin to see those techniques as harsh even though

756
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,360
they were effective.

757
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,960
But here's a triad that think about the following three emotions.

758
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,720
Happiness, shame and anger.

759
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,200
And if I ask you which is most different from the other two?

760
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,040
Happiness, shame, anger, which is the odd one out?

761
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:49,120
If I do that in a University of Chicago class the response is either going to be happiness

762
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:56,080
is the odd one out is most different or some people will say shame is the odd one out.

763
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:00,440
And it's largely based on a hedonic view of the emotions.

764
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,720
Does it feel good or doesn't?

765
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,720
It feels good.

766
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:09,920
It feels good to be happy, doesn't feel good to be shamed or angry.

767
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,840
Let me finish.

768
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:19,360
Some people say shame because they think that means the ego has been diminished whereas

769
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,080
if you're happy and angry you're full of yourself.

770
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:26,880
If I do this in the Indian community I work in the overwhelming response is anger is

771
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,240
the most different from the other two.

772
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,960
Which is a very rare response in our subculture.

773
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:39,280
And for them shame and happiness are the glue of social relationships and anger is destructive

774
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,400
of social relationships.

775
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,000
And that's a totally different way of viewing it.

776
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,120
And I think it has correlates in the way in which their society is organized on the

777
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:54,520
degree to which individualism versus some form of collectivism is a part of the organization

778
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,800
of social life.

779
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,720
And that puts boundaries on a lot of the generalizations we make about whether something's useful

780
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:06,240
or not what our own evaluative reactions are to it and so forth.

781
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:16,560
Let's come back to what's broadened if we can to bring in the other kinds of self-conscious

782
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,800
emotions which you were starting to do.

783
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:26,880
Such as I've claimed that there are two kinds of embarrassment one is a very basic early

784
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,040
does not require elaborate cognition.

785
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:37,840
The child shows it soon after it's thought using personal pronouns like me and mine and

786
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:44,480
that is an individual difference in their reaction to being the object of attention.

787
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,320
That's easy to do an elaborate story setting.

788
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:55,440
You bring the kid in and you start complimenting the child on how pretty they look or how handsome

789
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:03,120
the look or whatever you ask the child to do things like dance to or banging the tumeric

790
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:11,000
and what you see in the children being the object of attention they show embarrassment.

791
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:18,440
About a year and a half later when you now start to incorporate the standards the rules

792
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:25,640
of the goals of your family and the society at large you now have another embarrassment

793
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,920
which is embarrassment against some kind of standard.

794
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:41,160
I mean that starts to move us toward shame but I put to you that least in the sculpture

795
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:47,040
where we have two words if I ask you to tell me something that abasses you you would have

796
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:53,600
more readily willing to do it than if I asked you about something that changed you.

797
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:59,440
This is not just intensity we also have the word humiliation which is a very intense form

798
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,960
of shame.

799
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:10,720
Or mortification which as you mentioned earlier you're dying of shame.

800
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:16,440
I mean I think people experience embarrassment of some kind or another every day on a mild

801
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,440
form.

802
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:24,640
Sure but there are certain things that really define you okay so if someone says Michael

803
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:29,400
your parallel parking is really atrocious.

804
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:36,240
I may not like it I may feel yeah you're right I'm going backwards it's become more

805
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,400
difficult as I've aged.

806
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:55,840
But if they said Gee your last book is absolutely horrible it would elicit more embarrassment

807
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:59,240
of shame with a bad reveal.

808
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:04,520
So clearly there are different aspects of ourselves which are more important.

809
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:10,560
I'm going to if you guys don't mind layer on one more layer to this conversation which

810
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:15,440
I'm fascinated thinking about because I we've talked a lot about the individual experience

811
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,680
of shame you've talked a little bit about norms within a culture and how that changes

812
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,680
it.

813
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,200
I want to talk about group shame.

814
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:30,240
Group shame and I'll just throw out an example the Catholic church.

815
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,640
You know remember I talked about the phases of shame.

816
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,880
You're sitting in the shame there is outrage and denial of the shame then there's facing

817
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:43,920
the facts and then they're saying stepping outside and saying this is this is what happens.

818
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,280
You know I'm just going to throw that out the pope came out and he started talking about

819
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:52,480
oh you know sexual abuse of children is a terrible thing it's really terrible isn't

820
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,080
a terrible.

821
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:58,120
He didn't actually say this is what happened in the church this is what we're going to

822
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,120
do about it.

823
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,560
He never really cleaned house.

824
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,040
He never really went through stage three.

825
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:09,320
He kind of jumped to stage four like you can all forgive me this is an apology quote unquote

826
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,040
of course I'm putting my take on it.

827
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:18,440
But my point is that I want to talk about how groups inhabit shame how they get outraged

828
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:23,840
by accusations and how they come to see the truth see face their own facts clean their

829
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,840
own house.

830
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:29,760
How do they how do they navigate shame as groups.

831
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,360
Well did they navigate shame was only when we told them you should have felt shame about

832
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:38,600
this then they thought oh yes we did something shameful and possibly didn't.

833
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:44,720
See individual let me give you another example there's a very widespread habit in this country

834
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:49,720
of shaming children when they don't have enough school lunch money and what will happen is

835
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,840
that the children will either not be fed they will just be not fed at school or their lunch

836
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:59,480
will be thrown away in front of them and they sometimes even get branded on their arm.

837
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,080
I don't have enough lunch money.

838
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:07,880
The individuals who work at the lunchrooms sometimes refuse to do this policy and they

839
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,760
get fired.

840
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:16,680
So I'm not claiming that I think of that as a sort of systemic shame if you will it is

841
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:22,160
created as a policy and it is perpetrated by groups not every single individual in the

842
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:27,240
group has to agree with it as a policy because they might actually find it to shaming.

843
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,120
But for that matter I mean obviously lots of priests were doing terrible things but not

844
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,720
every priest thought that was a good idea.

845
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:40,360
Like we can't assume that it was like a unified attempt right but at the same time it is a

846
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,560
group thing.

847
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:47,760
It is a sort of a group navigation led by the Pope perhaps but like what is happening

848
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:53,000
there and when are we going to actually see them get to stage three cleaning house tell

849
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,760
us what the consequences are cleaning up their act.

850
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,920
And who is it the same process as for an individual?

851
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,920
That's what I'm saying.

852
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:01,920
Yes.

853
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:10,120
I mean you know the thing about it that is it's good news and bad news is good news because

854
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,720
we kind of understand it.

855
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:18,900
It's bad news because well I feel like I'm in stage four with gay shit bashing or fat

856
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,360
shaming or race shaming.

857
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:27,280
But I can't be in charge of everyone like how do we get the rest of you know how do

858
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,120
we pull people in this direction?

859
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,800
This is why you're moving toward something.

860
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,800
Yeah.

861
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,120
What are you moving toward?

862
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,120
An understanding.

863
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,920
Understanding of what?

864
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,760
Well see the examples I just gave are all in the first category.

865
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,440
You were talking about stages.

866
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,440
Yeah.

867
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,560
Tell me about stages because I don't know what that means.

868
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:57,320
Stages reflect a sequence where either accommodation, biology, culture or culture or biology.

869
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:04,080
So are you talking about a level of notion?

870
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,800
I don't think so.

871
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,800
But maybe you are.

872
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,960
What progress amount to and what is the difference?

873
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,480
I have all chapter in the shame book on this problem of progress.

874
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,160
What is progress?

875
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,000
What is progress?

876
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,480
So what is the ideal?

877
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,080
Let me put it this way.

878
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:30,920
Tell me from your perspective what the ideal society would be.

879
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,160
Wouldn't there be shame in it?

880
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,920
There would not be punching down shame.

881
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:39,880
So I was going to say that the examples I gave sexual abuse shaming people for being

882
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:45,440
poor, shaming children for being not having school lunch money, gay bashing.

883
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:51,400
Those examples are examples of punching down shame which I claim exist quite a lot.

884
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,000
There's a lot of power being maintained around punching down shame.

885
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,080
There's a lot of profit being made from punching down shame and I would call it invalid shame.

886
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,440
And the idea of progress would be to get past it.

887
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,240
And that would require that people who are shame by it say no.

888
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,240
No, it's not acceptable.

889
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,080
When you do those things.

890
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:16,120
If you get those things that people are doing, just punch down.

891
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:21,600
I characterize punching down shame as when you are shaming someone who has no choice,

892
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,400
who has either no choice or no voice.

893
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,480
So they either have no choice to conform to the norm or they have no power to explain

894
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,480
themselves.

895
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,040
So how's the lunch money work?

896
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,240
I don't quite have a picture of that as a shame.

897
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,240
Yeah.

898
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,720
You've never heard of that?

899
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,720
No.

900
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,520
It happens in more than half the school districts in this country.

901
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,520
Really?

902
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,080
I mean, why is it shaming?

903
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,560
What form does it take?

904
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,560
What's said?

905
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,560
What?

906
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,560
You are refused.

907
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,040
You did not give in food?

908
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,720
Okay, that's the number one.

909
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,720
You're not given food.

910
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,720
You're deprived of food.

911
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,440
You're considered, you're basically labeled as unworthy of food.

912
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,040
It is the most basic form of shaming.

913
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,320
And they are branded and you are, it's public.

914
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,000
It is like, hey, your parents didn't pay for food.

915
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,400
You're not going to get food.

916
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,040
Everybody knows it in the school lunch.

917
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,920
Even if they can't afford to give the money.

918
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,280
Of course, it's their children.

919
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,440
I mean, just to be clear, this is children.

920
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,120
It's their parents that are supposed to pay.

921
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,560
Do they have no power?

922
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,560
Yes, right.

923
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:18,560
Yes, exactly.

924
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:24,760
I would love to know a source for half the school system.

925
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,600
Okay, I'll give it to you.

926
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,600
Well, that's hard to believe.

927
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,080
It is hard to believe.

928
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,880
It's outrageous, actually.

929
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:46,160
The optimist, the terrible man that people are capable of perpetuating is not surprising.

930
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:54,200
So whether we want to call it up or down, punching, which is fine, it's a way of attacks

931
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,960
out of me.

932
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,360
He applied, there's a good shame or a bad shame.

933
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:10,400
If my child comes back with a paper or something they've done and they've not done well, what

934
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:17,080
are you going to tell parents or the tiger moms as they're called?

935
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,520
You shouldn't be doing that.

936
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:28,080
I mean, how can we disagree with people doing these things to children?

937
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,960
I mean, this can't be a New York.

938
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,560
There are laws against the child abuse.

939
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,120
So I think we can disagree about certain things.

940
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,160
But specifically about shame.

941
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:40,000
You mentioned that you were fat-chained.

942
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Yeah.

943
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:50,320
Does that mean that you are more prone to shame as a result of that?

944
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:55,320
Or does that mean that you are no more prone to shame than anybody else?

945
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:02,120
In other words, is the implication that that kind of shaming leaves rather serious marks

946
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,600
on the person that is indelible?

947
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:11,800
Or is it that some people react one way, some people, kids react one way, some kids react

948
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:17,640
the other way and some grow up without much shaming by anybody and they have more prone

949
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,840
to shame and some don't?

950
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,840
That's a good question.

951
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,600
I mean, my parents shame me, I think, because they were fat.

952
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,600
So they were sort of propagating a certain type of shame onto me.

953
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,720
I have not done that to my children.

954
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,560
But that's because I've thought a lot about it.

955
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,440
You know, like I went through these stages I'm trying to describe.

956
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:42,400
That's one of the reasons I came up with this taxonomy of shame is to understand when is

957
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,480
it unfair, when is it possible to ask for it?

958
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,760
Are you yourself more prone to shame than, let's say, your husband or your kids?

959
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,640
I think I'm more aware of my shame.

960
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,640
More aware.

961
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,640
But not more prone.

962
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,200
In other words, you don't more easily than somebody else.

963
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,680
I would like to hear what instead of a, I'm going to put it back to you.

964
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:00,680
I don't know.

965
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:09,360
I'm only asking because it seems to me from my perspective and my experience, the kind

966
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:18,480
of outside shaming is not what often or necessarily leads to a promise to shame later.

967
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:25,120
But rather certain developments in the strength of the person's self, in their self-esteem,

968
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,760
in their view of themselves is what contributes to how they feel later.

969
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,760
Interesting.

970
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,760
Let me support that.

971
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:38,640
It's another life work in pediatrics.

972
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,360
And we've been doing a study, the Fellows.

973
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,960
We have a fellowship program and I'm in charge of the research.

974
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:54,400
And there is a fellow who is studying the siblings of children who have ASD, who are

975
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,120
autistic on the spectrum.

976
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:09,080
And the idea being what does a sibling feel about having a sibling who is demonstrably

977
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,280
different?

978
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:21,400
And the interesting fondness so far is that there are a good number of the people who

979
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:29,760
end up taking care of handicapped kids or kids with disabilities are, in fact, from

980
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:38,440
families from which they had a close number, as well as just the opposite.

981
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:47,240
So that indeed supporting what you're saying, that in fact an experience can have very different

982
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,240
consequence.

983
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,440
One is a social good.

984
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:56,560
There are people committed to working with these children who, until now, we don't have

985
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:05,560
much resource to improve, but they are working with them versus those who probably develop

986
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:11,040
a, I get it and if you don't do what you are, you know.

987
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,040
This is temperamental difference.

988
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,600
People are born with different, comfortable or more resilient.

989
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,480
I think they're born out of it, right?

990
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,360
Other people are more fragile.

991
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:30,920
But you know, after spending 40 years at a medical school, my thoughts about the biology

992
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,920
of our bodies.

993
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:38,200
You know, we're not all the same temperament, however we may conceive of it.

994
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,040
There are different things.

995
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:48,160
My son and daughter are 50 years old when they were babies and I would, you know, toss

996
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,400
them up and prove them in the air.

997
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:57,480
But you know, just the girl baby, the younger, she loved it.

998
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:05,320
And she loves the rough and tumble, she goes in short cages and in cages protecting you

999
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:11,840
from my son who was in terror of it.

1000
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:21,000
In fact, I want to try to get my mind around you are questioned about groups and how do

1001
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
they react.

1002
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,320
And I guess I need some clarification because when you say how does a group deal with its

1003
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,320
own shame?

1004
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,320
Yes.

1005
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:33,200
Do you mean they have in fact done something which everyone would agree is shameful or

1006
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,840
do you mean they have been shamed by some powerful group telling them to do what they're

1007
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,840
doing is shameful.

1008
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:44,680
So for example, we have many examples in colonial domination situations.

1009
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:49,040
Let's say you believe the West is best and its view of gender relations, its view of

1010
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:55,520
XYZ is closer to the truth than those primitives or backward peoples of the world.

1011
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,920
And you start going and dominating those groups and telling them that what they're doing with

1012
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:04,640
regard to gender relations, how they raise their children, all this is shameful.

1013
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,640
Now is that the kind of question we're dealing with?

1014
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,040
How do those groups then react?

1015
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:14,480
As we know that some groups identify with the colonials and quickly become colonialized.

1016
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:19,280
We know other groups have rebellions against it and have all sorts of resistance.

1017
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,800
We have revival movements that go on.

1018
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,240
But these are power dynamics that are very different from the way you framed it.

1019
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:30,200
We framed it with examples in which you're inviting us all to agree that's shameful what

1020
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,200
they did.

1021
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:36,000
Not that some group is shaming another group from its power position and those are very

1022
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,920
different situations.

1023
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,960
And I'm just wondering what you would have.

1024
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,760
After you answer, we will go to questions.

1025
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,760
Okay, great.

1026
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,960
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a great question.

1027
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:52,200
And I'm not sure I was scrupulously careful about the examples, but what I really want

1028
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,800
to focus on is changing norms, probably is the best way of saying it.

1029
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,920
And maybe a good example in that context is the Me Too movement.

1030
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,160
So the Me Too movement is a movement because we are changing our norms.

1031
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,160
We never actually thought it was okay to assault women.

1032
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,440
We never thought that.

1033
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:14,000
But the norm was that the women kept quiet.

1034
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,880
The norm has changed.

1035
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:23,000
And now there's a lot of group shame among the men who now feel like, oh, what I used

1036
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
to be doing was inappropriate.

1037
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,360
That's an example of group shame.

1038
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,960
And I'm not saying they're all actually feeling like I should feel ashamed.

1039
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,360
Some of them are outraged that these norms have changed under their feet.

1040
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,520
And how dare that norm changed?

1041
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,840
I was perfectly comfortable and now I'm a bad guy.

1042
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:45,840
So that is, but it's a group, nor a group shaming.

1043
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,120
And my theory is that it goes through the stages of shame similar to the way I laid

1044
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,120
them out.

1045
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,760
And I might be wrong about that.

1046
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,400
I don't mind being wrong.

1047
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:57,960
Just because I'm a mathematician, I'm trained to just be happy to be wrong.

1048
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:58,960
I love shame.

1049
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:03,640
If you can explain, yeah, it's actually one of those one of those freeing things as a

1050
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,680
mathematician is that you say something and someone says you're wrong.

1051
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,280
You're like, thanks for not like I won't waste my time on it.

1052
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:15,440
But it's useful even if it's wrong, I believe, to understand group shame as an evolution

1053
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,800
through stages similar to the individual.

1054
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,320
Okay, we'll go for questions.

1055
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,720
So there is the mic and go to it.

1056
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,880
The mic works now?

1057
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:29,960
I hope it works now.

1058
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:45,360
It was very, very interesting here today listening to everybody.

1059
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:52,280
Some of the things that we did not talk about today, what about people like we, everybody

1060
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:58,040
knows Martha Stewart, who was incarcerated for a period of time.

1061
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:05,880
She was shamed and then she was released from jail and Martha Stewart just picked up right

1062
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:10,800
from where she left off and she's on TV and she's selling her merchandise.

1063
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:19,000
And just recently we have Anthony Wiener, who was in some sort of a halfway house for

1064
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,480
pornography and all that.

1065
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:27,920
Now he was just, Anthony Wiener was released and he's thinking about going into politics

1066
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:33,840
again so I'm just using a couple of extreme examples that we did not talk about today.

1067
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,840
Thank you.

1068
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:35,840
Who wants to respond?

1069
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,440
Sounds like you're proposing banishment.

1070
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:57,080
I mean part of the problem is that shame is I think it fits with the change in empathy.

1071
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:05,040
By the way, a rules manner is, we haven't gotten to which would be a very important part of

1072
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,920
the discussion.

1073
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:16,720
The idea of letting it all hang out as opposed to a rules governing our behavior.

1074
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:22,360
So you write a thank you note for dinner whether you liked it or not.

1075
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:31,080
And now that it would be called lying and so the whole issue and the change in social

1076
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:39,400
protecting the feelings of others have given way to be authentic and indeed the election

1077
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:45,280
really hinged on the fact that even though he was a terrible man, he was at least authentic

1078
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:50,320
where she was inauthentic and so is.

1079
01:20:50,320 --> 01:21:01,120
So the fact is that we're allowed, we have no shame about being shame is in fact what's

1080
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,120
occurring.

1081
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,120
Okay.

1082
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:10,680
Yeah, I just wanted to comment on individual versus institutional shame.

1083
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:16,240
You brought up the example of the Catholic church and why hasn't the pope felt more

1084
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,440
shame.

1085
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:22,120
Questions make political and financial decisions.

1086
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,960
They can't be shamed the way individuals are.

1087
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:30,320
But my question is to the professor, I see some agreement here.

1088
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:37,240
My question is to the professional psychologists among you.

1089
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:44,360
And this concerns the most prominent shamer, the shamer in chief.

1090
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:52,480
You feel that this is more strategic and purposeful than he's given credit for or on the other

1091
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,560
end of the spectrum.

1092
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,560
Does he suffer from a pathology?

1093
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:10,000
Well, 40, 45, 40% of the people believe that he has done nothing wrong.

1094
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:16,880
That is to say we're back to facts, even though you can demonstrate that he says he

1095
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:23,840
hasn't said something and you have a tape of him saying that he would just call it fake

1096
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,000
news.

1097
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:32,960
So one of the things that narcissists can do is that they change the rules, the normative

1098
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,080
behavior.

1099
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:42,280
So while on you're having now a man who did things that they shouldn't have done and

1100
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:49,680
now feel a movement to get them to feel there is also this movement and there's nothing

1101
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,240
to be ashamed about.

1102
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,640
You can make norms.

1103
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,880
You can go any way you want.

1104
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:07,080
You know, under or behind masked by his behaviors, which are defensive mechanisms, is toxic

1105
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,080
shame.

1106
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,080
Right?

1107
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:16,040
If you read anything about his upbringing, his background, he has massive shame, humiliation.

1108
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:20,120
These are all as narcissism almost always is.

1109
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,080
I have a paper that says defense of mechanism.

1110
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,080
He is wanting a band.

1111
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,560
He avoids, he attacks.

1112
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,560
Those are his two.

1113
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,760
Well, the device in my studio.

1114
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,400
Shame is so intolerable to him.

1115
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,400
Absolutely.

1116
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,120
That changes the laws.

1117
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,120
No changes, facts.

1118
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,120
He changes the laws.

1119
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,040
But you mentioned earlier, it claims others.

1120
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:44,560
You know, both of you had talked about the idea, the idea of, I don't think he's aware

1121
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:50,560
that he has, I don't think he'd ever admit or is aware that that's why he's doing it.

1122
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,560
So then it's a pathology.

1123
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,560
It's a pathology.

1124
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,560
Yeah.

1125
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,560
Exactly.

1126
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:55,560
It's a pathology.

1127
01:23:55,560 --> 01:24:01,080
You both talked about anger as being a reaction to be accused, to be shamed by others to respond

1128
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,080
with anger.

1129
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:09,320
And I think you very wisely, Kathy, especially mentioned that in this purposeless shaming,

1130
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:13,400
I think one of the reactions of the parties that are shamed is they get angry.

1131
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,760
And unfortunately they get mobilized.

1132
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:21,240
This is what this shame, shame, or in chief relies on that if you try to shame me and

1133
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:25,080
I don't want to accept it, I'm going to get angry with you out there, you try to shame

1134
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,080
me.

1135
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,120
And that mobilizes a lot of the populace.

1136
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,320
I think I'm going to go back to that.

1137
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,320
Okay.

1138
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,320
Next question.

1139
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,240
So I just want to get back to, it's not my fault, first of all my question, but to you

1140
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:47,960
would be to please elaborate on why you stated that men usually say it's not my fault more

1141
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,200
than women.

1142
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:54,520
But before you answer that, in terms of it's not my fault, I've always been under the

1143
01:24:54,520 --> 01:25:03,520
impression that a person that cannot take criticism or it's not my fault, they say that

1144
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:11,240
because they've been criticized quite a lot either by their parents or so I don't know

1145
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:17,800
if that has anything to do with it's not my fault, that defensive mechanism, but that

1146
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,680
goes into not being able to even take criticism.

1147
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:28,160
I didn't do it, it's not my fault and it's very pathological if you, so the question

1148
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:31,560
though really is why men were than women.

1149
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,560
Okay.

1150
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,720
I understand why that's important.

1151
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:41,720
If you win the lottery, you don't feel proud, you feel very happy because it's a chance

1152
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,200
you didn't cause it.

1153
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:49,120
Although some people will say I went to a particular store and I knew that that was,

1154
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:55,200
so they give themselves causality and they can feel pride because it's negotiable here.

1155
01:25:55,200 --> 01:26:06,360
So winning the lottery and event, you don't, most people do not feel proud of winning

1156
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:12,240
the lottery because it's a chance it has nothing to do with you causing it.

1157
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:20,000
So believing that you cause it or not cause it is a very good mechanism to move you around

1158
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,200
the self-conscious emotion.

1159
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:30,440
If it's not my fault, then I can feel anything I want that's appropriate and so you can manipulate

1160
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,960
it's not my fault so I'll do some manipulation.

1161
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,840
Now the sex difference.

1162
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:44,280
There are many explanations, there are data in which you can look at when parents are teaching

1163
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:51,600
children in the laboratory tasks to do and the child doesn't succeed.

1164
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,520
What does the parent say?

1165
01:26:54,520 --> 01:27:02,680
And it turns out that parents make these performance or global attributions more to girls than they

1166
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,600
do to boys.

1167
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:11,280
That is to say when the child is supposed to be able to do a puzzle and the child can't

1168
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:18,320
do it and you listen to what the child says.

1169
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:22,440
A parent could say on the extremes, oh you're so stupid.

1170
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,440
Why don't you get that?

1171
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,200
Parents say these things.

1172
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:29,880
Or they could say it's a very hard problem.

1173
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:34,400
Why don't you try and get and give them a strategy.

1174
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:41,280
It turns out that giving strategies rather than making global attributions are more likely

1175
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:48,560
for mothers now to give this to the boy child than to give it to the girl child.

1176
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,560
Why?

1177
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:56,040
I don't know why it is but I can only tell you what we think may be going on.

1178
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,200
But let me give you another one.

1179
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,080
I really think it's another reason.

1180
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:08,120
I think girls are much more, that is the woman kind, are much more concerned about their

1181
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,480
bodies than men.

1182
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,600
I don't know how broad it is.

1183
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:19,920
I can say that in most cultures that I've been to, if it's a more formal occasion, the

1184
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,440
women are better dressed than the men.

1185
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:25,760
The only place that might not be true is Italy.

1186
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,760
In India it's certainly my...

1187
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,760
I don't get them aside.

1188
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:32,400
It's not always true.

1189
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:33,880
It is not always true.

1190
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:45,200
But indeed the attending to the body is a necessity given that menstruation, which an

1191
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:49,760
adolescent starts with, you have to be concerned with your body.

1192
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,920
Men don't go, don't have that concern.

1193
01:28:52,920 --> 01:29:01,560
In the research of pre-attolescent, you ask boys, what do you feel about the fleshiness

1194
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:06,120
under your arm or the thickness of your thighs?

1195
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:09,720
And a nine-year-old boy, they don't have anything to say about it.

1196
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,240
They never thought about it.

1197
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:18,680
And nine-year-old girls are already telling you, oh, I think this is too much and so there

1198
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:20,720
is a concern for the body.

1199
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,160
So the question is why is that?

1200
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:28,480
One solution women have said that the object, sexual objects, for men, and so they become

1201
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,480
objectified.

1202
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:32,680
That's a reasonable hypothesis.

1203
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,680
But an alternative one...

1204
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:36,040
Where does that stop my fault, Link?

1205
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,240
How's that link to that?

1206
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:38,240
Okay.

1207
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,240
It's...

1208
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:45,480
If you attend more to yourself and that's where temperament would come in, if there's

1209
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:52,480
more information that you are deriving out of your body sense, that information is more

1210
01:29:52,480 --> 01:30:01,800
likely to make you think about yourself and therefore more likely to move toward the attributions.

1211
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:06,000
If something went wrong, I'd like to comment just on your question.

1212
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,600
I would like to add to this a little bit.

1213
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,000
Martha Stewart, was that your example?

1214
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
No.

1215
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Whose example is that?

1216
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,560
Martha Stewart, she never would have been prosecuted if she were a man doing exactly

1217
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,760
what she did.

1218
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:22,680
It's the expectations of society that villainized her in the first place.

1219
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,320
Good for her for going back to work.

1220
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,760
That's what I say.

1221
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:32,920
I would also like to keep an eye on the Trump officials that get blamed for their terrible

1222
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:39,040
behavior as Trump officials like Kirsten Nielsen and Sarah Sanders.

1223
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,120
What about all the guys?

1224
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:50,400
When we accuse women and we shame women, it much more often and much more than we ashamed

1225
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,400
men.

1226
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:58,440
I say that as a person who's written journalistic essays for Bloomberg, I get unbelievable

1227
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:02,160
hate from the commenters as a woman.

1228
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,000
Just unbelievable.

1229
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It is completely documented.

1230
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,880
I'm just saying it is socialized to a large extent.

1231
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,000
And of course, one last thing, dieting.

1232
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Guess who diets?

1233
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Girls.

1234
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Guess why?

1235
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
They're told to diet.

1236
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,240
It's by their parents.

1237
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:22,840
So it's very, very good data that this is socialized.

1238
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:27,400
The Justice Department doesn't like it when people lie to public officials.

1239
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:32,800
And Martha Stewart was not sent to jail because of the inside of trading accusation.

1240
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:38,240
Inside of trading itself is a very complicated area and it's gone through lots of changes.

1241
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:44,080
But when you lie, when you're being interrogated by the FBI, they don't look at your gender.

1242
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,080
That's like a fundamental principle for them, whether you like it or not.

1243
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,280
I don't like it.

1244
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:49,280
I don't like it.

1245
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:53,720
I agree with you about Martha Stewart good for you.

1246
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:58,560
And I think it was unfair to just nail her on the procedural thing.

1247
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,200
But they do that all the time and they do it to men and women.

1248
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,720
I have a somewhat different view than Mike.

1249
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:07,400
I would be really skeptical of a generalization of that gender in this area because I think

1250
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:14,520
a really fundamental principle of action is the premise that all human beings have is

1251
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:19,080
that there's a relationship between action and outcome.

1252
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,680
I might.

1253
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,280
I swing an axe.

1254
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,960
Something happens.

1255
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:28,720
Everyday life is built on the fundamental premise of a relationship between action and

1256
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:29,720
outcome.

1257
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,280
And that's the default.

1258
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,280
That's where you start.

1259
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:36,880
If you're going to move away from it, there are special cases in which you might have a

1260
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,120
conception of something, the world being simply a lottery.

1261
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,120
It's a horrible notion.

1262
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:44,640
If you really think about it that way because you're losing control of your life.

1263
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,000
It's if it's that way.

1264
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,160
And the relationship of action and outcome has all sorts of manifestations for men and

1265
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,160
women.

1266
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:55,280
And I would bet you can find areas where men might be one way and women and other and

1267
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,760
just the opposite in some other domain.

1268
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:02,280
But I'd really be surprised if the most fundamental premise was what you're at.

1269
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:06,240
What you do has consequences and you're responsible for it.

1270
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:13,120
In my limited experience, because it's only from within my office, it's not based on

1271
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,600
extensive research.

1272
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:20,320
But in my experience, I do not see a distinction.

1273
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:27,840
But what I do see is that the harder the person is on themselves, the more they're tempted

1274
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:32,000
to say it's not my fault when they're confronted with something.

1275
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,880
The more the person is willing to accept that they've done something wrong, the less they

1276
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:43,560
are willing, they need to say, oh no, it's not my fault.

1277
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:52,360
That's a complicated question because it involves all sorts of developmental issues.

1278
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:53,360
Yeah.

1279
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,360
Yeah.

1280
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,320
Thank you.

1281
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:59,760
I'm overcoming my public speaking shame by doing this.

1282
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,240
That's what I hear of something.

1283
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:02,240
Thank you.

1284
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,240
Good job.

1285
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,400
Thank you.

1286
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:10,600
My question is I always thought of guilt as being almost like the introjected parental

1287
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:17,520
figure telling us what to do and shame more as being part of the death drive as aggression

1288
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,240
towards ourselves.

1289
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:24,600
So I think that in my own opinion, to get over shame, we can sublimate that aggression

1290
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:33,560
outwards into more socially acceptable and positive ways, what are your views on that?

1291
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:39,040
I would recommend that everyone go back and see the movie Four Feathers Done by Corda.

1292
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:46,000
And the movie Four Feathers Done in the 1930s in which you were in a military family in England

1293
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,760
and they're going off to the Sudan to fight.

1294
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:51,800
And one of the buddies decides he's not going to go.

1295
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:57,320
And the Four Feathers are the feathers that you receive being accused of being a coward.

1296
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:04,560
In this case by his fiance and his buddies and the rest of the movie is about his attempt

1297
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:13,040
to do incredible things of courage to be accepted back into this, having been shamed so powerfully.

1298
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:19,960
And that seems to me as a kind of typification of how shame works in a society that has statuses,

1299
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:23,600
has clear goals, has notions of the good.

1300
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:30,080
And when you fall out of it and you are called on it, it's an incredibly powerful set of

1301
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,280
motivations that go on.

1302
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:38,920
And the movie is well worth seeing if you want to see, let's call it the pre-modern view

1303
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,960
of how this whole thing operates.

1304
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,880
And it doesn't fit that definition.

1305
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:54,000
A friend of mine last night told me, which has some truth in it, that guilt is an afterthought.

1306
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,040
Guilt is an afterthought.

1307
01:35:56,040 --> 01:36:00,400
Is that you commit the act and then you say, oh, I feel terrible about it.

1308
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:03,520
It rarely starts you from committing the act.

1309
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,880
It seems to me shame is a basic, is one of the emotions we have.

1310
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:11,160
We have love, we have shame, we have all those things.

1311
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:14,200
So I don't think that's anything to do with that drive or anything.

1312
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,560
It's just an emotion that humans have.

1313
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:19,120
And I guess some animals are.

1314
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:27,320
Which I tend to think of guilt and regret as having some spatial connection because the

1315
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:43,840
focus is on how to correct the wrong, whereas in shame, the self is attacked, thus very powerful.

1316
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:54,720
So I think that definition, that distinction is probably one from a behavioral point of

1317
01:36:54,720 --> 01:37:00,160
view and also from a general theoretical point of view, that kind of distinction is worth

1318
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,160
having.

1319
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:08,200
But isn't guilt simply moral shame, immorality shame, plus fear because guilt involves fear

1320
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,000
of punishment too.

1321
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Well, I guess so.

1322
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,360
I mean, there's a lot of words.

1323
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,840
I'm not quite sure what they mean.

1324
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,640
I think in fact that-

1325
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:22,800
It means that you've made moral transgressions.

1326
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:32,080
There is a vast literature of which I'm not much of a part of, which in fact looks at whether

1327
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:44,360
when it's around achievement, but it's very relevant, is you can look at your performance

1328
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:57,080
or you can look at the task, for example, Carol Dweck has made a very big, a whole career

1329
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,160
based on this distinction.

1330
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:04,800
I can focus and say, gee, I'll give you a perfect example.

1331
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,480
You write a paper and you send the paper into a journal.

1332
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:11,240
These are the kind of activities I do.

1333
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:21,000
And back comes the paper and it's rejected and there's a whole set of criticisms.

1334
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:29,240
I can do one of two things depending on what it elicits in me, this failure.

1335
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:36,400
I can look at what they criticized and focus upon that.

1336
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:43,280
This will cause me a set of actions to try to repair or save the paper.

1337
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:53,080
If in fact the result is a damaged self, I put it in a drawer and I forget about it.

1338
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:59,840
And when you work with graduate students and fellows in medicine, one of the things to

1339
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:06,320
try to teach them and is teachable, that's interesting, from a therapeutic point of view

1340
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:12,880
is in fact, I don't want to hear about you, what allows you, scientist, you are, I want

1341
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:20,920
you to go home and I want you to list each criticism separately and write some response.

1342
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:23,320
Do I have to do another analysis?

1343
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:26,680
Do I need to read more?

1344
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:34,920
Focusing them on the task gets them to stay in the game and try to correct the failure.

1345
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:41,640
If in turn you think you're a lousy scientist, you won't want to forget it.

1346
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:51,200
One way of coping with that shape is to forget it and so you put it in a drawer and exactly

1347
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:52,200
what you say then.

1348
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:59,160
And in fact, you want a mechanism that stops you in your tracks.

1349
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:08,000
It is sufficient that you can't do this except a great cost to yourself, a steam if you like.

1350
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:17,400
Whereas in guilt, you fundamentally want to repair it and you can actually see it in

1351
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,400
behavior.

1352
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:21,160
You can see that these children.

1353
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:23,080
But you want to repair it in shame too.

1354
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:27,120
The example I gave of doing something in a program.

1355
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:31,120
If you do something in a social context, it's inappropriate.

1356
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:32,120
No, you don't.

1357
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,680
You shame yourself.

1358
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:34,680
In fact, one of the problems.

1359
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:35,920
And you want to repair it.

1360
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:41,640
You want to go and say, I'm so sorry, I behaved so, I don't know.

1361
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:42,640
Anytime.

1362
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:44,640
That's also representative.

1363
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:47,480
Okay, let's go to the next question.

1364
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:51,400
I'm also facing my public shame here.

1365
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:54,920
But my question is something that hasn't been discussed here.

1366
01:40:54,920 --> 01:41:00,920
So I read in this book that shame is one of the main pillars of loneliness.

1367
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:03,040
So what do you guys think about that?

1368
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,840
I just want to understand from your loneliness.

1369
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:11,760
You know, I'm going to jump in and tell you how I understand shame and this is through

1370
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,920
a lot of reading.

1371
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:14,920
It's not my definition.

1372
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:17,440
And I'm trying to remember the person's name whose book is from.

1373
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:23,200
But it's this idea of a disintegration of self that you basically have this connection with

1374
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,920
your caretaker, when you're a child.

1375
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,560
And it's a good feeling.

1376
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,080
And then at some point they are disappointed in you.

1377
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,280
They shame you.

1378
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:35,600
And it feels like you do not have a self.

1379
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:42,440
And you're so desperate to get back into that connection that you literally do anything.

1380
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:46,440
And if you can't get back into that connection, you feel completely floating.

1381
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:47,440
You feel disintegrated.

1382
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:51,600
Like you do not have a connection to your mother or whatever.

1383
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,880
And that, I mean, of course, that elicits loneliness.

1384
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:57,720
So I think there's a very strong connection with that definition of shame, which might

1385
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:02,520
not maybe isn't the only one, but that definition of shame is is loneliness.

1386
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:07,160
It is in fact the definition of being alone when you're disconnected from everything else.

1387
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:14,160
Some feelings are shameful.

1388
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:21,240
And so you can be ashamed of being guilty, but you can't be guilty about being ashamed.

1389
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:24,680
And you can be ashamed about being lonely.

1390
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:30,080
Now the question is, if you feel lonely, can you be ashamed?

1391
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:30,680
Thank you.

1392
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:41,920
So clearly, if you are believed that you should be part of a social group, there are people

1393
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:49,240
who are interestingly, who don't have a lot of social interaction, much prefer to be on

1394
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:52,360
their computer than to go to a party.

1395
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:59,360
So on that loneliness may not be shameful because they don't have a value that they

1396
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,360
should be socially integrated.

1397
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:10,960
And Asperger is a perfect indication because part of the Asperger personality is in fact

1398
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:15,040
they're interested in things more than people.

1399
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:19,640
Okay, last question.

1400
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:26,520
I am wondering about the relationship between shame and the stability of a society.

1401
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:32,320
Because it seems to me that in very, very stable societies, whether it's a family or

1402
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:42,080
a larger society like our nation, shame is sometimes weaponized when the society changes.

1403
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:47,200
And perhaps it's a function of fear, of the change.

1404
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:56,520
And shame is used whether to put down a racial group or women or to impose certain standards.

1405
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:03,280
These things really ramp up when the society is changing, really to maintain the stability

1406
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,720
of the society.

1407
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:07,600
So it's almost a political weapon.

1408
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:13,280
Yeah, I'm going to echo you that I think we can look at our society and see that norms

1409
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:16,040
are changing very, very quickly.

1410
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:20,320
And I would even argue that people think they're changing faster than they actually are changing

1411
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:26,680
because we have this artificial sense of accomplishment on social media when it looks like in our

1412
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:31,400
tiny little corner of Facebook that we all agree that such and such is true.

1413
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,640
And in fact, it's a very small corner of Facebook.

1414
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:39,760
I think we actually are being misled by our intuitions around social norms.

1415
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,120
And we think things are changing faster.

1416
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:49,120
But that goes to your point, which is that if some people think the norm is now, you

1417
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:53,960
have to ask three times before having sex with someone and other people think, no, you

1418
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:56,040
don't even have to ask.

1419
01:44:56,040 --> 01:45:00,040
It's not surprising that conflict emerges.

1420
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:06,280
And when conflict about what we thought we already knew about norms, that is right for

1421
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:07,280
shame.

1422
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,560
That is what shame is for.

1423
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:12,440
Shame is for coercing people into the norm.

1424
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:17,440
So if they got it wrong, actually 95% of people are getting it wrong.

1425
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:19,400
What the fuck is wrong with these people?

1426
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:23,720
It's because we actually think we've accomplished more norm changing than we have.

1427
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:24,840
And that's what's happening right now.

1428
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:29,800
And we have, I think you made the point, one of the norms that we're seeing change is the

1429
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:33,240
idea of being authentic rather than factual, right?

1430
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,640
Or honest.

1431
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:40,560
That is itself a norm that is ripe for shaming, because it's exactly the point.

1432
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:45,840
The point of that norm is that people who follow that norm, who are in that norm group,

1433
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:49,760
are exactly the people that are going to be shamed by people who are like, no, we haven't

1434
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,840
agreed to that change in the norms, right?

1435
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:56,040
You are actually supposed to be an honest person, not a shameless person.

1436
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:58,920
So there's so much going on right now.

1437
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:02,680
It's chaos, honestly, with respect to changing norms.

1438
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:08,840
When there's chaos with changing norms, there is an uptick, if not an explosion of shame.

1439
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:09,840
Yeah.

1440
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:15,360
Yeah, well, this is off the top of my head, but I think it makes sense to think about the

1441
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:19,320
balance between the private and the public in societies.

1442
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:23,520
And when you're thinking about social change, there needs to be some kind of balance between

1443
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,680
those two.

1444
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:29,840
The domain of the private is a way in which you can't be shamed, because what you're

1445
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:35,480
doing with people who you're close to or intimate with, or you know trust you, is not

1446
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:38,520
something you would necessarily do with anybody.

1447
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:44,200
And now what's happened is the anybodies of the world are in that private domain, exposing

1448
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:45,200
it.

1449
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:49,640
And now your reputation, your career is affected because of something you happen to say in

1450
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:54,280
private that someone was able to eavesdrop on or leak.

1451
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:58,840
So basically our leaks, and this is with the irony of our free press, because our free

1452
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:00,720
press are a bunch of snoops.

1453
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:03,440
They're trying to dig into the private realm all the time.

1454
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:08,200
They're encouraging people to leak information, which would normally be in an insula area

1455
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:11,840
where you couldn't be shamed and they're shaming all sorts of people.

1456
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:19,360
And I think the MeToo movement, in fact, has brought us back to the 17th century.

1457
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,080
For stocks, that's why I use that notion.

1458
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:23,040
We have the stocks going all the time now.

1459
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,800
I don't think it's healthy for our society.

1460
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:31,040
And to the extent we continue to erode the private domain, it's an area where creativity

1461
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:35,960
can go on, transgressive experimentation can take place in miniature.

1462
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:38,800
Some of that stuff is truly loathsome.

1463
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:43,520
Others ends up being creative stuff that then filters out more broadly into the society.

1464
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:46,320
I think that's a correct.

1465
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:51,280
I think that's a commonality and that idea.

1466
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,960
But I think there's another thing.

1467
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,000
There is the idea of happiness.

1468
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,960
We haven't gotten to happiness.

1469
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:01,640
It was interesting that you brought it up as one of the best.

1470
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:03,280
I have to tell you the story.

1471
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:07,800
So I think I mentioned my father was born in the 19th century.

1472
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:13,360
So I mean in the 20th century, at the beginning of the 20th century.

1473
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:20,040
And he believed that if you did something well, you would be happy.

1474
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:27,480
And we now believe if you are happy, you will do something well.

1475
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:34,080
Focus has moved, which is part of the self-focus on our happiness.

1476
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:44,080
So in another round table, the discussion of happiness, and there's some wonderful books

1477
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:52,240
of how searching for happiness is made as miserable is really the theme.

1478
01:48:52,240 --> 01:49:04,000
So not only are some of the changes in technology, which supports some of this, namely, I want

1479
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,600
to walk down, I live in the village.

1480
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:08,960
I walk down the streets and I'm a little old man.

1481
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:17,360
And a big towering person is walking toward me, reading their phone.

1482
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:22,080
And I have to say, excuse me, or he's going to run me down.

1483
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:28,840
And if we said, oh, well, we used to have people walk down the street reading books.

1484
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:30,280
That was not the case.

1485
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:32,880
People didn't walk down the street reading books.

1486
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:33,880
What?

1487
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:36,720
Making a joke.

1488
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:49,840
So I think there is a shift to this happiness, to this idea that the self deserves certain

1489
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:50,840
things.

1490
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:59,080
And I think it's in part why there's a decline in empathy and indeed a rise in narcissism.

1491
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,720
We have done, by the way, a round table on happiness.

1492
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,160
But thank you very much.

1493
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:12,560
We'd be happy to do it again.

1494
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:38,640
Alludeah33.
