1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Welcome to the Hillick Center, I'm Edner Sessien, the Director, just a couple of...

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:21,000
No? Can you hear me now? Okay, so just a couple things before we I introduced the

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,040
participants of tonight today's roundtable in two weeks from now I think it's

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:35,800
November 22nd we have a roundtable on translation matters and it was organized

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,400
by Anne-Marie Levine and the participants are David Ballus, Bella Brodsky, Suzanne

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,720
Gill-Lavigne, Mark Politzotti and Michelle Woods. Then the first weekend of

7
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:55,200
December I believe it's the fifth and the sixth we have a meeting with the French

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:03,600
group Adapas and that's a think tank which has a section that is devoted to

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,020
Freud's work and there will be two days of meetings about four or five round

10
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,840
tables with participants from Europe and the US and some of the people who will

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,960
be here participating for that are Philip Dus Blazie who is the who's a

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,520
past foreign affairs minister of France Charles Melman who is the founder of the

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,040
Lacanian Association International Association Mark Smoller who's the

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,640
president of the American Psychoanalytic Association Ian Buckingham who's the

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,840
president of this association Paul Fry is a professor of English literature

16
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,840
from Yale Vincent Capenzano is a professor of anthropology and

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,720
comparative literature from the City University Jean Michel Rabat who's a

18
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:04,960
professor of English from UPenn and Emil Malet who is the editor of a

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:16,000
journal called Passage also will be a diplomat George Agash and Pierre de

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,360
Sennath Cleans who is professor of international affairs in Geneva so it's a

21
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:28,600
diverse group and the title of the whole conference is in which way Freud's work

22
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:37,600
can help us understand the what ills society today so today's round table is

23
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:45,400
on speak memory aside from being composed of water proteins fats and

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:53,120
sugar we are composed of memories and hopefully we will learn more about it

25
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,680
today I will not go into the details of everybody CV because I think you have it

26
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,760
already why will introduce them Christina Alberini sitting there is

27
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:11,720
professor in the Center for Neural Science at NYU Sven Bernakar sitting

28
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,880
here is professor of philosophy University of California Irvine Tom

29
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,240
Karoo is professor of neuroscience NYU Center for Neuroscience Martin Conway is

30
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,560
professor of cognitive psychology city University London and Penelope Lewis a

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,640
senior lecturer of neuroscience at University of Manchester about to move

32
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:41,480
to University of Cardiff so the format is there's no preparation you will

33
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,920
speak spontaneously and try to enlighten us thank you

34
00:03:47,920 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm the count of 3b found spontaneous is that

35
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:16,960
well I'm not sure if I'm ready to start but I can try since no one else is I think

36
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:25,520
my attempt to start would be by saying can you reiterate the question which you

37
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,080
want us to try and answer in this discussion and then then we can start

38
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,920
to discuss it why don't you start by you saying what's memory

39
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,200
that's that's quite a difficult

40
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:47,440
well all right I'll give my perspective on what memory is and then and then

41
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:57,400
these guys can tell me why I'm wrong for me a memory is stored representations

42
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,440
stored representations and I'm not going any further than that other people can

43
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,080
elaborate and he's going out on the limb with that since I happen to be in the

44
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,400
loop I'll pick up where she left off it's a it's actually a very deep question

45
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,440
there's not a one-stop answer to that on the one hand everyone in this room is

46
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,320
convinced that their memories are real but they also convinced their their

47
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,960
memories are true the former is definitely the case the latter is only 50 50 the

48
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,880
case there are many cases in this room and around the world and everybody's

49
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,800
study of memory that are you have an intense feeling of a memory that's real

50
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,840
but in fact it's not true it's not accurate not always but sometimes and I'm

51
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,720
sure Christina will pick up on that theme for the idea coming back to you

52
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,920
consolidate a memory so I think that to open the conversation it's I see

53
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,840
memories is essentially threads in a tapestry and each memory is a piece of

54
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,720
that and after a while we've assembled a tapestry that no longer has individual

55
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,280
elements any longer but has color and shape and texture pattern and that

56
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,520
becomes this kind of it captures our collective aggregate experience and in a

57
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,720
very real way we are our memories I mean that's what you got when you ask who you

58
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,800
are you think of your kids you think of your experiences you're relying on your

59
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,280
memories to extensively to calibrate and express the person that you would point

60
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,920
to when you pointed yourself so in a very real way with the sum total of our

61
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,080
memories then we'll get into what happens between our ears that'll be later I'll

62
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:39,160
toss it to my friend okay I want to make the point starting from the biology

63
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,240
which is where I come from I got interested in memory exactly because of

64
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:55,600
what Tom just said is a complex function is who we are we are who we are

65
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:05,720
because of our memories and when I got interested in this coming from a

66
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,240
background of biology that was very little known and we shared the same

67
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,440
mystery here we did the same type of progression in trying to understand

68
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,160
or address some questions about the biology of memory and I think in the

69
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,200
last I would say 25 30 years there has been a tremendous tremendous progress

70
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:35,440
in understanding of how the brain process information and store information so

71
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:43,280
memory is retention of information and then we use that stored information when

72
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,240
necessary and we do that by retrieving the memories more and more it becomes

73
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,440
clear in the last as I said 25 years that the storage of memory is very dynamic

74
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:03,760
and although before it was believed that storing information means to keep them

75
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:10,280
in a fixed fixated way in the brain now we know that that's not true we keep

76
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,400
updating our memories and so this has also a lot to do with what Tom was saying

77
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:23,360
our memories are not reflecting the reality of the experiences that happen

78
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,080
but they are constantly elaborated so we store information and then we retrieve

79
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,600
that information in a new context in a new moment in a different time and we

80
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,560
restore them in a different way and we keep doing that and and therefore that's

81
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,920
why we have memories that are not reflecting the reality but they are

82
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,440
reflecting a re-elaboration of history continues re-elaboration of our history

83
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:02,360
so those phenomenon or processes are called technically consolidation or

84
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:12,360
re-consolidation a new memory exists for some time in a labile state and during

85
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,440
that time which is temporarily limited it's strengthened and it become resilient

86
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,400
to disruption so initially as I said it's fragile so we can disrupt it easily if

87
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:34,040
some interference comes around it could be another learning event some pharmacology

88
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,800
some other type of interferences that can be used are disrupting the memories

89
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,320
very easily during this initial phase and in the biology field this was an

90
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,680
important discovery because one of the interfering events that can't disrupt

91
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,520
memories as soon as they're formed or prevent long-term memory formation are

92
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:07,560
compounds that block new synthesis of proteins and this is where biology

93
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,240
became biologists became very fascinated about the question of what are these

94
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,680
new proteins that are made to strengthen to make this memory strong and

95
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,200
resilient to disruption and in the last 20 years there's been you know great

96
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,640
progress in understanding those proteins and the regulation of how those

97
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,880
proteins are made are you talking about memory in general or particular kinds of

98
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,640
memory we're talking about long-term memories and thank you for the question

99
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:48,000
that reminds me to say that this is an evolutionally concerned feature of

100
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,360
long-term memory formation and it has been found to to be required in many

101
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,640
different types of memories so it's a general feature of long-term memory

102
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:07,520
formation so once they are stable these memories they if they are retrieved they

103
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,800
become fragile again and again there is another temporal window during which the

104
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:21,920
memory re-stabilized so by analogy the process that with retrieval the memory

105
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:29,560
becomes labeled and then re-stabilizes again is called re-consolidation and

106
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,200
there has been many studies in the field trying to understand what re-consolidation

107
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,840
is about because if we think there is it is not really advantageous to have a

108
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:48,440
memory made long-term and stable and then with retrieval make it lay by it

109
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:56,200
again why should it be that way doesn't make much sense right why did why was

110
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,440
it stabilized in the first place become lay by again with retrieval and and

111
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,720
again in the last several years several labs have tried to address this question

112
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,040
which is not fully understood but certainly we know that during this time

113
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:19,080
is it gives the opportunity to memory to the memories that are retrieved to

114
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,680
change and therefore to change the strength they can be modulated they can

115
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:33,600
become stronger or they can weaken or new association can be linked to the

116
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,080
retrieved information and this is why the updating occurs continuously

117
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,600
otherwise our memories will be compartmentalized and we will not be

118
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:49,040
able to make new association with the old experiences so all these mechanisms

119
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,480
are clearly very exciting in treating important for understanding how memory

120
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,520
work they have a lot of repercussion in the clinical questions and to mention

121
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:08,600
one definitely in psychoanalysis and in psychotherapy where the subject recalls

122
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,640
memories and then in the new setting with the therapist to re-elaborate the

123
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,440
memories think I'm gonna stop because otherwise I keep talking I thought I

124
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,120
thought it was very succinct well to do this I mean it's a real issue about

125
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,160
what memory is because it's lots of different things you know mine my

126
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,440
knowledge that Paris is the capital of France is memory but that's very

127
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,360
different from my knowledge all very nice restaurants I went to last night

128
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,600
which in turn is very different from my abilities and ride a bicycle for example

129
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,240
which is also memory I think the type of memory we've been most interested in

130
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:59,040
in recent times in the more behavioral cognitive area of the field is what's

131
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,480
called autobiographical memory so memory for the knowledge and the events of our

132
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:11,320
lives and it turns out that this this knowledge the representations of

133
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,060
episodes of experience and conceptual knowledge about our own lives is highly

134
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,560
dynamic as you said and if you put someone in a scan over look what's going

135
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,840
on in their brain when they recall not to biographical memory you get

136
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,760
activation from the front part of the brain it's almost as though the brain

137
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,120
sort of breathes a memory if you want and it's in this area where when people

138
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,920
suffer brain damage and also in in an older age when the brain changes that we

139
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,080
start to see impairments emerging and it's those impairments which have been I

140
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,600
think quite a big focus of a lot of recent research in this area so memory is a

141
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,080
lot of different things I think the autobiographical memory episodic memory

142
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,520
kind of area is the one where at the cognitive behavioral end would be most

143
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,800
interested in recent years

144
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:09,720
even the autobiographical memory it might be interesting for the group before I

145
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,680
return to you but just because to leverage up of your statement how many

146
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,600
you in the room have heard of a patient called HM yeah not so many so you know

147
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,480
in clinical it is a clinical tradition to always just use the initials of a

148
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,200
patient to for confidentiality but HM passed in with the last ten years they

149
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,440
was Henry Mullisness but the reason it's so interesting relevant to what

150
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,200
Sven said is the following because he was a sea change in how we understood

151
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,960
memory systems in the human this is a young man who fell off his bicycle as a

152
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,440
teenager had a horrible accident with his head and then was given to seizures

153
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,080
thereafter forever I mean it's to the degree that he would be probably die

154
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,720
from these seizures they were recurrent and just horrible and at the time there

155
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,640
was a surgeon and Hartford Connecticut named Scoville who did a kind of

156
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:11,840
surgery to remit seizures and what he did was to take out part of the brain

157
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,840
bilaterally but the brain is a bit like a walnut you open it up and it's more

158
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,160
less palindromic structurally so he took out some part of the brain called the

159
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,960
hippocampus and some other structures in the temporal lobe and the seizure stopped

160
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:31,000
and so from that point of view Henry HM was not cured but was better but a

161
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,560
devastating consequence of this surgery was the fact that he never

162
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,840
remembered a proactive fact again exactly the kinds of fact he remembered how to

163
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,760
ride a bike he could learn how to trace a mirror backwards and he's starring a

164
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,600
mirror backwards so there's things he could learn but the person that studied

165
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,880
him forever was Brenda Milner a gifted woman in Canada and then her

166
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,800
students isn't working and every day we come in hello Henry do you know me says

167
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,400
no I don't my name is Brenda nice to see you great they would work together all

168
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,920
day she come the next day in Hartford hello Henry do you know me no I don't

169
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:09,440
for 25 years for 25 years why that was important in all kinds of ways was that

170
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,400
here is a fellow who could learn certain kinds of things just find and

171
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,000
remember them new tasks like riding a bike or and the like but had this

172
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,920
devastating amnesia going forward he was also outraged at the price of

173
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,480
refrigerators on TV because he remembered with them back 25 years ago and he was

174
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,160
outraged that there were now hundreds of dollars it showed across 35 because

175
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,400
that was the last that was where he was frozen in time and it taught us

176
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,600
dramatically that there are different literally different neural substrates

177
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,920
different real estate in the brain that take care of different kinds of memories

178
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,040
because one was destroyed and one was completely intact we knew that a little

179
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,520
bit before but that was a startling case and so the connection that we've all

180
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:56,360
been deeply affected by is the basic science that Christine and I do but also

181
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,200
the connection to the human condition which is not just an end in itself but

182
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,280
terribly informative and how we think about memory in modern terms

183
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,880
it's all yours so the question was what memory is and we have the initial

184
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,000
definition according to which memory are memories are stored representations and

185
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:29,200
I think that is a that is a very apt account but in some respects it doesn't

186
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,520
seem to cover enough and in other respects I think it needs to be things

187
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:41,920
need to be to be added so Mark already mentioned the the many different kinds

188
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,960
of memories habit memories or procedural memories and declarative memories

189
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,880
semantic and episodic and so on and so the question I think would be whether

190
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,240
really all of these various phenomena can be subsumed under this heading of

191
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,160
stored representations whether learning how to write a bicycle or certain

192
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,120
procedures learning how to how to walk upstairs whether that is the learning

193
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:18,400
of a representation in other respects the definition of memory as stored

194
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,320
representations maybe doesn't isn't detailed enough because of course

195
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,240
representations can be stored in many different ways in books archives store

196
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,800
representations or at least can be portrayed as the storage of representation

197
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:40,720
so what's so special about storing representations in the head as opposed to

198
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:51,560
outside of the head or the body as opposed to outside of the body and it

199
00:19:51,560 --> 00:20:00,160
seems at least to me that not it's a particular kind of storage that warrants

200
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,400
the name memory you mentioned really truth and you said many of the things

201
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,080
that we seem to remember aren't in fact the case the way they are we talk readily

202
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,960
about false memories from my perspective false memories aren't memories they are

203
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,240
they give the impression of a memory but they are in memories they don't give us

204
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,760
a window into the past they don't allow us to know about the past things like

205
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,760
problem with that though is that if the person who's remembering a false memory

206
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,200
experiences as a memory they don't question it it's just a memory for them

207
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,200
then I think maintaining it's not a memory becomes problematic I agree well in

208
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,440
that respect it's like any fact of attitude to take knowledge many of the

209
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,360
things that I claim to know I actually don't know because they aren't the case

210
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:57,640
they're false so I think it's a treacherous slope to say false I mean I

211
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,960
just I'm interrupting it but go ahead but I think that there's nothing

212
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,680
wrong with a false memory say it again we want the discussion so it's okay to

213
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,240
interrupt well then okay but but do you know

214
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,880
Dick Nizer is so Dick Nizer did a beautiful series of studies this was a guy

215
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,800
he was one of the fathers of this field he's at Emory University before in

216
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:27,600
Europe and he took advantage of the Challenger disaster yeah and 1986 so

217
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,440
if I first folks in the room it can see me if I do this does that mean anything

218
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,000
to anybody what's that what did what just happened in your head when I do

219
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:46,080
that exactly so you saw two white trails on an azure blue sky so folks who can

220
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,680
visually bring that that's a memory and I just evoked it without a word right

221
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,400
well he took advantage at Emory University of going around the day of

222
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,960
that disaster there's many of the kinds of studies but his is canonical and

223
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,960
said where were you Penny when were you when that where were you at when that

224
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,120
happened and the kind of what he at the time what he would hear from students

225
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,680
would be what I'm gonna now recount is if my wife my marriage on I've been

226
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,400
married 51 years she's over in the corner so we've been together most of

227
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,480
our lives that's important because if I would answer him I'm gonna make this up

228
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,240
I would say well I was a more way back from chemistry class I met my wife

229
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,160
who's a painter met my wife on way back from art class walking across campus

230
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,320
and we stopped as we usually do to get our pita for lunch we're gonna sit

231
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,040
outside and we looked in the Commons and we saw these activity and people are

232
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,240
crying and they're looking at the TV I'm intentionally being very granular because

233
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,800
they're very detailed memories I just gave you now what he would do is then

234
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,320
talk to you a year later two years later and I would give that account

235
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,440
Mary Jo and I met we were the only problem was I didn't meet Mary Jo until

236
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,040
the next year right now was I lying no I was trying to make sense in the

237
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,480
present and integrate as much as Christina said about updating is memories are

238
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,720
trying to try to make sense of the world and so that was an absolutely real

239
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,920
memory that was felt and perceived and had a neural basis everything is that it

240
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,000
just wasn't true and so I don't think I would disagree if that if it doesn't

241
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,880
allow it to be in the category of memory what it does is mean that it's it's a

242
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,920
try to an updating of an experience that we're trying to make sense of and and

243
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,520
and I think memories allow us to make sense of that just as we create a

244
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,120
statistical model of the world if we hear this outside we would not think it's a

245
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,640
giraffe we would probably think it's a horse right but if we were also we would

246
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,440
have a very different perception of the same sound so often we're just trying to

247
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,440
make sense of our world with the best information we have and since I've been

248
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,760
with Mary Jo 51 years it's a pretty darn good narrative it just turns out to be

249
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,400
wrong where that really matters is when you get into the realm that you are in

250
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,720
in therapy and trying to deal with memories that are painful or are hurtful

251
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,040
for folks and want to try to deal with them and access them to get at them what

252
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:02,800
do you think Penny you believe any of this stuff I think that I don't think

253
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,280
there's a problem in this discussion between I mean I think your point that

254
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,280
some memories are false and your point that those are still memories can coexist

255
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:18,040
I think you absolutely right it can go in this but it's difficult to make room

256
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:26,400
for the dynamic nature of memory the sense making the meaning creating yeah

257
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,680
feature memory to make room of the of that aspect of memory and still allow

258
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,800
memories to actually give us knowledge about the past where knowledge is

259
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:47,880
required so it's compatible I believe but it's not easy to say how maybe maybe

260
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,320
one way kind of out of this is that a lot of people have been thinking recently

261
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,040
because of the work that's been done on people imagining the future or

262
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,200
imagining alternative past if you put them in the sky and see what's going on

263
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,360
in their brains it's really no different from when they're remembering the past

264
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,120
right so people have been talking about rather than a memory system I remember

265
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,400
a remembering imagining system if you want if you think about it you can't

266
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,880
really imagine things unless you can remember amnieces patients can't

267
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,200
imagine the future if you say to an amnieces patient what are you doing next

268
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,640
Friday they just become very distressed so it seems as though you need a memory

269
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,080
to be able to imagine and that the two are kind of interlinked together and

270
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,560
it's within that context that bits of the past emerge some of which are

271
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,360
somehow a reflection of the past and some of which are perhaps something that's

272
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,120
more imagined I think the point is we get to that we all get worried about is

273
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,760
that it means an implication is that well maybe all our memories are false in a

274
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,080
sense they are because if you think about how an event gets encoded first of all

275
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,920
it's massively time compressed so when I remember this event in a month's time

276
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,560
I'll be remembering in two minutes even though it took two hours so in that

277
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,920
sense all memories are in a sense not accurate representations and just as in

278
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,440
the side now stops off because it's your turn really but I think we've got a

279
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,680
problem here that the heart of our beliefs about memory we think that

280
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,120
memories like a video or it's like photographs and it absolutely is not

281
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,840
right it's a psychological representation so if you can do it with that would

282
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,120
believe then you can begin to accept that memories are some sort of

283
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,120
representation of the past to come back to your point Penny but the question is

284
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,440
what sort of representation I think that's the maybe that's what you could

285
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,920
arrive at but I think that's the interesting bit at the heart of this

286
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:48,600
bit of a discussion so yeah to what extent may memory alter change or edit

287
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:54,120
the stored content without being confabulation and still be memory

288
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,720
exactly it's an interesting question now I think just to come back and

289
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,320
reiterate again the question really goes to the heart of what is it that's being

290
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,400
represented because we do not know about how memories get encoded we don't know

291
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,200
how our memory all of us in this room how our memory of this event gets encoded

292
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,640
into long-term memory if we went around nasty everybody next week everyone I'll

293
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,120
have a different version of what went on and you might want to say well that's

294
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,560
because we will have different interests and we attended to different things but

295
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,040
we don't know how we got in there and we don't know what form it's in either

296
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,640
although we do know that memories often do come to mind with some visual imagery

297
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,920
but otherwise we don't know much about them so I think it's worth jumping in

298
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,320
here and and talking about how memories evolve as well because you're making

299
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,400
the point that memories and labile and plastic and they can change and it's

300
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,920
because they're labile and plastic that we sometimes wind up with false memories

301
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,920
otherwise if they were just fixed we wouldn't have these so that to me

302
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,160
raises the question of why are they plastic why do they change and for me

303
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,240
that's one of the things that's the most interesting about memories they there's

304
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,080
a reason why they're plastic and why they change in fact there are probably

305
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:11,280
lots of reasons the one I want to touch on is how do you so you mentioned it when

306
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,880
you talked about memories of fabric with lots of individual threads and you

307
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,920
know initially you might see individual threads and then eventually you see the

308
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,280
pattern of the fabric itself for me this is an important aspect of the

309
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,160
evolution of memories Martin I think mentioned the fact Paris is a capital of

310
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,720
France as a form of memory that's what we call semantic memory it's very different

311
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,240
than remembering what I had for breakfast this morning which is what we would

312
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,880
call episodic memory and a major question in my mind is where did these semantic

313
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,200
memories which is our general abstracted out knowledge of the world divorced from

314
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,600
the individual events which we experienced to build it up where do those come from

315
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,920
and this is incredibly important because that semantic knowledge is the basis of

316
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,120
who we are you know everything that we know every prediction we make about

317
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,680
things that are going to happen the consequences of our actions how people

318
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:12,840
respond to us it comes from the semantic memory and so one I'll just finish this

319
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,600
though and then you can jump in so so one idea about where that semantic memory

320
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,120
comes from is that those episodic memories build up and then those

321
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,520
representations of episodes actually change their plastic they evolve across

322
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:36,160
time and across sleep which is my particular interest and they become

323
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,480
abstracted out and generalized and they build up schemas of how things in the

324
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,240
world relate to each other that's the basis of our semantic memory and I could

325
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,720
say more about it but I think Martin wants to come in that I completely

326
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,360
agree with what you said actually I mean just to add to it one of the it's very

327
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:00,440
interesting amnesic patient many years ago reported by just some like lead

328
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,200
some like a physicist right highly intelligent man theoretical physicist

329
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,040
who had a stroke basically meant he could no longer encode new information

330
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:17,000
into memory and they could give him very complicated articles in the physics of

331
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,160
light he was a laser expert and he could read those articles and pretty much

332
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:28,440
understand them couldn't return anything from them at all so without these

333
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,400
mysterious episodic memory things whatever they are we can't learn either

334
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,560
so it seems we can't learn either right and it might be what's happening with

335
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,920
children for example is maybe the hippocampus is functioning when you're

336
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,480
born or around about then and they can form episodic memories I mean there is

337
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,400
a whole developmental theory that says how a child learns the meaning of the

338
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,520
word ball is that mum rolls the ball along the floor and says ball and then

339
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,280
they're outside and she rolls it along the grass and says ball and the child

340
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,680
builds up lots of different episodic memories with this verbal label ball and

341
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,280
eventually the key bit of all of these episodes this labeled ball gets separated

342
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,880
out and becomes the semantic representation it's one story not

343
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,040
everybody buys that one but it seems that people who were born with a

344
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,160
sorry I'll stop talking people are born with a disorder called developmental

345
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,960
amnesia who usually because of an anoxic accident at birth don't have a

346
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,000
fully functioning hippocampus nonetheless some of them seem to be able to acquire

347
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,520
semantic knowledge without having episodic memories and that's another

348
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:43,320
mystery we don't know how they do it it's a really this is so much fun because in

349
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,920
our world in neuroscience Kristina I have been friends for 40 years and work

350
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,520
together and so I'm not surprised we have a vocabulary that overlaps a lot but

351
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,080
listening to you is so much fun because it makes me have to read cat actually to

352
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,560
literally I need a libretto to to now know what we're talking about and it

353
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,280
makes so much sense the way you just formed it even though it's a little

354
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,960
different we think about it one thing that is fun that I've been thinking about

355
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,320
the last couple years in our world in neuroscience maybe in the psychoanalytic

356
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,160
world as well we often ask how does it work whatever the it is how does it

357
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:21,120
work when I move how did my arm get told by my brain to move when I think of my

358
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,200
daughter Amy how do I remember her face and we often center on the how how does

359
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,480
it work what's the mechanisms with the schema what's the underlying texture and

360
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,640
so on but the it needs some attention as well the it really matters because

361
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,000
sometimes the very same it's that you're looking at has a different underlying

362
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,400
mechanism it's not like there's different you know episodic versus

363
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,760
somatic memories but the very same memory looks exactly the same I want to

364
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,440
what one guy studied it's so interesting it may open up another domain of the

365
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,560
discussion so Larry Fee years ago in in Boston looked at an animal model of

366
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,360
memory looked at a mouse we can make designer mice we can put genes in and

367
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,280
out of them it will now and he has a mouse that had a genetic problem I

368
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,200
won't tell you what it is it was a G protein and the mouse had it had a

369
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,120
problem with hippocampal memory a task learning new objects and it had a

370
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,000
problem with with a brain mechanism called LTP synaptic facilitation that

371
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,160
sought to be a mechanism of that memory so the the mouse had a problem and they

372
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:26,080
gave these mice a lot of external stimulation it's called an enriched

373
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,720
environment they got on running wheels and they played with each other and they

374
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,240
pushed each other around and they got better the memory got better and the

375
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,560
brain mechanism got better if you looked in the brain oh my gosh it's back so

376
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:44,160
you might say wonderful we just made it better it's a different it turns out

377
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,560
that the brain mechanism that got better had to do it was not the same mechanism

378
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,720
it was something else it still got you to the same phenotype the same endpoint

379
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,960
very different underlying mechanism why is that important well obviously

380
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,920
theoretically it's interesting but if you're gonna now talk about therapies and

381
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,920
targeted therapies for giving kind of cognitive disorders we better know the

382
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,400
it we better know how it's what its texture is that's what Krinstina does for

383
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,880
living is to figure out how it works so the fun thing is that even within a

384
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,440
category that we'd accept as a common category what looks like it maybe have

385
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,000
four or five six different ways that it got to that final end state that opens

386
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,440
up for philosophy real question of well when is it still the same thing or not

387
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,720
that's what you do for living and out of it but does that really matter sure

388
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,160
does it you're gonna give me a pill and make me better well I was actually

389
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,680
thinking exact opposite I was thinking if you can boost someone's memory and

390
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,240
intervention does it really matter how it works as long as it doesn't have a

391
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,960
negative side well there you go first of all the notion of side effect I've

392
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,440
always loved there's no such thing as a side effect there's effects the ones we

393
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:52,840
like and the ones we don't like so the real problem is not in this task only

394
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,200
at its top where you can have exercise making it better but if we're gonna for

395
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:02,280
example have some targeted drug for Alzheimer's right well we better know

396
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,000
what what we're trying to fix because every drug every put in the brain has

397
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,280
pluripotent effects there's no such thing as a singular effect well let me

398
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,880
play devil's advocate for a minute gonna be a fight since I'm here because of my

399
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,960
interest in the impact of sleep on memory right and my field has a way to

400
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,520
improve memories non-invasively without drugs right without understanding what

401
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,160
memories actually are absolutely I'll briefly describe it so we know that

402
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,120
memories are newly spontaneously replayed during sleep that means that

403
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,040
the brain activity associated with something that you learned in the day

404
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,600
spontaneous the reoccurs while you're asleep and this is associated with

405
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,040
strengthening so the memories which replay are remembered better the next

406
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:54,600
day that's great but it doesn't allow us control recently and research has given

407
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,000
us a tool to control it so instead of waiting for this to happen spontaneously

408
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,200
we can pair a memory with a sound or a smell and then represent that sound or

409
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,600
smell when people are sleeping it will trigger that reactivation and that

410
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,680
memory will be selectively strengthened and we this is this has been

411
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,360
replicated many times in many labs around the world it works we know it works

412
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,440
we would like to apply this in Alzheimer's disease hasn't been done yet

413
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,760
would be interesting to see how well that works but we still don't know what a

414
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,680
memory is and we certainly you know know not much further with the the kind of

415
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,760
chemical cellular basis of it we know we can strengthen it so that's fine right

416
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,760
why can't we use that intervention you can't they're not mutual school from

417
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,600
anyway you can absolutely do it that way in fact what you're doing is

418
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,560
strengthening it without knowing the mechanism exactly but that's just fine

419
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,720
as long as you we appreciate that there are other ways that that could be

420
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,560
in inventive and useful and there are other things that are not as useful for

421
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,160
and people are in suffering and you got to worry about them too so we can't it's

422
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,560
not one stop shopping that the last thing about the fig study that's gonna

423
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,240
blow your mind is remember I told you that you made the rats run around and they

424
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,080
got better their kids got better their kids got better the rap pups got better

425
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:20,280
how they're Lamar clicks right the kids got better for about to how that well

426
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,240
what happened was that it's transmitted to the mother and the mother's womb in

427
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,680
the mother's hormonal environment transfers the gain of function it

428
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,000
remember they might still have the darn mutation the pups are still rap pups

429
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,720
with the mutation mice with the mutation but they had memory the memory was

430
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,400
improved and their brain was improved because moms uterine environment and

431
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,080
the hormonal environment allowed that to be transferred for two months so and

432
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,280
it's not Lamarck it is the fact that there was an experience that's epigenetic

433
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,800
that gets transferred and where there's no I don't think there's any tension

434
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,520
between doing things we don't know why I go to the gym to try to feel better I

435
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,560
don't have any idea what the hell is going on except that I hurt like hell at

436
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,480
the end but it I the illusion that it's good for me and I don't care what the

437
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,080
muscles are doing I just want to feel better so I don't think we need mechanism

438
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,800
all the way along but but I think that the reverse is hard to defend and you're

439
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,520
not saying it's not fair to you that to not understand it wouldn't be a goal I

440
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,040
mean to understand it will always at least help us get further along sure yeah

441
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,720
of course what do you think Christina well I think in biology this is what we

442
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,480
are trying to do right and and that's why I mentioned consolidation or

443
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:38,880
reconciliation so consolidation last for episodic memories in a rat that we're

444
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:48,440
studying in the hippocampus requires more than 24 hours to complete why 24 hours

445
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,440
so you are saying oh during sleep they are replaced and clearly we want to know

446
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,600
what goes on in these 24 hours what goes on in the phases of sleep for example

447
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,240
another labs are studying that so it is important to understand the underlying

448
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,960
mechanisms because if we have a handle of those then we can actually target

449
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,720
exactly what we want to see happening the reactivation of memory the recall

450
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:24,800
to give the smell during this lead reactivates again the cascade of changes

451
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,680
that lead to memory strengthening this process of consolidation so there is a

452
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,200
lot actually known not enough is the beginning but there is quite a bit of

453
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,280
dawn in terms of mechanism of how to strengthen the memory with a retrieval

454
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,880
so you present a cue the trace is reactivated doesn't have to be in the

455
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:54,720
awake state it could be while they're sleeping but the reactivation we know in

456
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,880
certain experiments that lead to memory strengthening but can I say it's probably

457
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:06,280
not the memory your strengthening its access of the memory what we know is

458
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,880
that consolidation last for quite a while and through consolidation memory

459
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:18,560
strengthen and stabilizes so I don't have a problem with consolidation that's

460
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:25,000
fine if if then we're saying well you know retrieval is gonna be better

461
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,840
access with time perhaps I mean it's something that has to be really carefully

462
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,000
dissected but in terms of mechanism they seem that they built over time and

463
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,160
this building leads to memory strengthening well I suppose the part I'm

464
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,960
trying to get at really is what is being consolidated what is being

465
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,680
consolidated now people often talk about as it's the memory whether the memory is

466
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:59,520
being kind of you know linked into other things or is it instead not the memory

467
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,960
which has been consolidated but your ability to access it for access bits of

468
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,560
it and that might be a really very different thing and I'm saying that

469
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,840
Christian you won't like this because I don't believe in reconciliation we can

470
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:21,720
talk about it extensively I mean this is what we are studying so I know I know

471
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,640
what we do I know the work of other labs in reconciliation so we can talk

472
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,320
about that so the reason why I'm saying no I don't think that that's the case

473
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:38,120
because you know shorter memories are very detailed I in the form in the moment

474
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:45,440
we are in the experience but long term memory built with time so if there was

475
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:52,280
you know a problem in like getting better in accesses them then why do we

476
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,160
have shorter memory with all the details that actually disappear so there are

477
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,440
different memory processes that occur depending on the experience and the

478
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,360
duration well a number of points though if I think most people would say that if

479
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,120
you've got a memory this has a duration of more than two minutes and it's long

480
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,760
term memory duration of short term real it's got to be about two minutes well

481
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:19,200
no we're not saying that I'm just going to get you know I suppose the

482
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,000
cognitive end of memory research but okay if we said to everyone in this room

483
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,240
now tell me everything that's happened to you today they could give us an

484
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,640
exquisitely minutely detailed account we ask everyone again in a year's time

485
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,520
maybe nothing maybe a few details that doesn't mean to say that information

486
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,680
has been lost from the system what it might mean to say is your ability to

487
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,040
access it has been lost well this is actually and this is where we can turn

488
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,720
to you who do philosophy for living I think that we first of all let's not

489
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,760
confuse metaphor and mechanism right so we use a lot of language to capture

490
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,880
stuff which is fine storage retrieval the brain doesn't know what that means

491
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,200
ranges adapts and engages the world and succeeds or not and so on so animals

492
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,680
from mice right up to our kids are pretty good at it we capture those

493
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,880
events with short hands like storage and retrieval those are semantic constructs

494
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,400
that allow us to talk to each other about it brain to know what that means and I

495
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,000
think my own view on it is that if there's an impossible disentangle that you can

496
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,280
never show a storage deficit you can only show a retrieval deficit because

497
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,760
let's say I try to get a memory out of Ed and he can't give it to me and then I

498
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,000
give him a glass of water and it comes back that means if you couldn't access it

499
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,480
but I didn't put a new one in there so if we had trouble accessing it we'd call

500
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,120
that a retrieval problem so so the only way you can know there's a storage

501
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,560
deficit is by virtue of retrieval in some way so they're conflated inexorably

502
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,280
by our language and the way we try to capture what we how we talk about it

503
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,600
and and I and for me it doesn't really matter is I like to because I believe

504
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,160
you've brought up evolution I think not just us but critters on the planet

505
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,040
forever have been really good at updating memories to be adaptive and changing

506
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,640
the risk analysis based on current things like hunger and I don't like so

507
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,320
that's a very complicated business I I don't have a problem with calling it so

508
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,400
I think it's perfectly reasonable to say you could probably just have can't get

509
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,160
at that memory but I don't think that we'll ever be able to untangle that at

510
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,600
least certainly mechanistically we can't because the only way you know a memory

511
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,880
is there is to retrieve it that's that's the that's the route but it does have

512
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,160
really really interesting implications if you think that it's all in there but

513
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,240
you just can't you bet oh it's phenomenally because it's probably still

514
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,040
influencing a great deal of your behavior in the world your conscious

515
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,160
behavior even though you don't realize it yeah so the people you're attracted to

516
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,200
the people you don't like the things you want to go and see the things you don't

517
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,400
maybe be driven by information you cannot get into consciousness but it's

518
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,720
nonetheless in there and it's still influencing processing well I have a

519
00:44:52,720 --> 00:45:00,440
question about that or sometime are those would you consider those memories in

520
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,160
other words would you consider the person you are attracted to the result of

521
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:12,880
memory so what we which touches on the issue like you are a two and a half year

522
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,760
old and your father dies or your mother dies and so now you have a different

523
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,160
person taking care of you or your mother is depressed because your father has

524
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:30,120
died so your mother is different now and this is inevitably going to have some

525
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:37,480
impact on you are those effects which can manifest themselves 30 years later

526
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:44,080
in the type of person you chose to marry do they are those memories those

527
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:49,800
experiences that are formative in a certain way no David someone sitting

528
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,000
next to you wants to speak to that one I'll speak to you as well well go ahead

529
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I wanted to open a new topic well very brief then I mean you say all these

530
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,120
memories they're the stuff from which memories are generated is why it's a

531
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:11,080
way or could it principle be if you could just access them I mean most people

532
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,040
can't access memories that occurred events that below the age of three

533
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,840
anywhere from the pre-verbal period of the sort what kind of a memory would you

534
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:25,360
say it is if you are interacting with the mother who wasn't depressed last

535
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,200
week and who is very depressed this week what kind of memory does a two-year-old

536
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:35,320
or two and a half year old have about that well exactly and I think it goes

537
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:39,680
back to a point that came up early on and that is we don't know how these

538
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:45,120
things get encoded we just don't know what the selection process is I mean

539
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,160
Freud had a great the great term for this didn't he called it after

540
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,120
afterwards than us I can't say it in Gerbt I can barely say in English but

541
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:59,520
the whole idea was that the memory you end up with after some eventually

542
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:06,520
experienced has this reprocessing that's gone on some selections and details

543
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,760
have been made available some of not been made available you know so you've

544
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:16,800
been hibitry process as well as an ex-itatory activation processes what sort

545
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,800
of memory a two-year-old has I just I really don't know but I would assume it

546
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:29,480
would be primarily nonverbal and effective and it might have some you know

547
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,240
modality specific information in it imagery or something like that

548
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,680
nothing should he or new topic

549
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,040
next to what you were saying that the episodic memory is in a way after a

550
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:47,400
while turning to semantic yeah I don't know how tightly that links to the

551
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,240
retrieval issue which is really what you're talking about I mean what I was

552
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:57,040
gonna ask you at the risk of seeming very ignorant is I mean I think everyone's

553
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,520
probably aware about this idea that all the memories are still there but we

554
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,600
can't retrieve them but what's really the strongest supporting evidence for

555
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,440
those memories being there what evidence is there other than the Roger Penrose

556
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:16,560
stimulation stuff from the 60s I can give you an example if you'd like sorry I

557
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,600
do that every time I lean forward yeah I don't remember it from moment I just

558
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:27,600
going with to well that's all cool well there's been a lot of work recently with

559
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:33,640
people using body-worn cameras what cameras body worn cameras these

560
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,240
cameras you were around your neck for example one we've used was originally

561
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,160
called sense camera it takes photographs and response to sensory

562
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,880
changes it detects okay let's say you go for lunch with some money where the

563
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,920
camera will take maybe about 300 photographs all right and then you go

564
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,200
later we come back in so we'll do you remember that lunch you had with your

565
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:59,680
friend Ruth and you I have no idea I can't remember when we last went out

566
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,680
together so I get to sit down and look at these photographs one by one very

567
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,000
quickly you're at a one per second so to a couple of minutes to review an event

568
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,680
that took two hours you will experience what we call pristine moments you'll

569
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,880
remember things that you didn't know for a million years you had in your memory

570
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,880
and actually those things won't necessarily be things depicted in the

571
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,000
photographs so I give you one example just by way of illustration and then the

572
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,960
larger point of course is that all this information is in there we just can't

573
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,280
access it that's what this is all about so a very skeptical colleague of mine

574
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,400
all this camera conference in Australia about three months later we go into

575
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,960
look at some of his movies we call them but they're not movies really there's a

576
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,880
series of still photographs and he's walking down the street in Sydney up to

577
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,320
the University of New South Wales where the conference was taking place and he's

578
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,920
walking past a line of cars and he was looking in these photographs and he said

579
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,600
well I'm not remembering anything I just can't remember anything about it and

580
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,960
then suddenly he said a swear word very loudly as he remembered the song that

581
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,560
was playing on his iPod as he was walking down the street three months

582
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:10,840
earlier and there's been quite a bit of work using these very very

583
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:16,920
powerful rich bodies of cues which do seem to show that you do return far more

584
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,080
than we realize it may not be everything but we do seem to could could that mean

585
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:28,760
that even when memories have become very very weak so that you know there's a

586
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,560
trace there there's information there but it's very weak and so when you try and

587
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,400
remember what you were doing in that location on that day three months ago

588
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,920
you don't retrieve it if you've given the appropriate cues yes even if it's

589
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,440
very weak you can kind of get it would you be happy with that interpretation

590
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:49,560
well the bit I'm sorry I don't have to accession to is I don't buy this idea

591
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,080
of memories becoming weak

592
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,120
it's all I think with access and cue effectiveness

593
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,080
particularly particularly as we get older you know the cues we encounter in

594
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,160
the world we've encountered them billions of times before that's probably one of

595
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,880
the reasons they're not very effective at eliciting specific

596
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,880
listen to the nature of our language right now we're talking about I don't

597
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,360
make this attribution if it's not right then push back that that memories by

598
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,160
retrieval are pulling a card out of a rolodex and it may be faded ink or not

599
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,680
but it's a card in a rolodex and that's certainly not the case what is the case

600
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,640
is memories are active reconstructions of them so it and it's the same in bird

601
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,480
song it's not just our special flood and privilege on the planet this way a lot

602
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,240
of animals and birds are beautiful for this kind of study I'll tell you if you

603
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,520
like but what you do is you make the best sense of what that means that's why

604
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,720
you occasionally have these nominally false memories because it made sense

605
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,240
I remember Mary Jo we've been together 50 years but it isn't and push back if I

606
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,280
don't have your thought right but I really love the work and I believe it I

607
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,440
think what it allows you to is have more cues to actively reconstruct that and

608
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,400
we're pretty good at it we're trying to make sense of it and I'm gonna remember

609
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,600
you were sitting on my right and casinos on my left probably with for a long time

610
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,520
so we're pretty good at reconstructing things especially if they fit into a

611
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:13,080
normal environmental expectable tableau sure scheme of perfect so I don't think

612
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,120
it's so much like it's a weak memory and you have a better flashlight on it I

613
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,960
just think it's a better access to the reconstructive process that allows us

614
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:26,720
to make the best sense of this experiential tableau we've got inside he

615
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:33,320
wants to hang a right-hand turn go for it something we all agree upon is how

616
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:41,760
important memories are for who we are and what we know and having thought about

617
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,240
memories for now about 20 years I'm getting it actually more more interested

618
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:55,000
in forgetting and the virtues of forgetting because it seems to me that a

619
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,240
normal rate of forgetting not a pathological but a normal rate of

620
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:05,160
forgetting maybe as important for an explanation for how we cope cognitively

621
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:12,400
in the world as memory is of course there's the story about whether or not our

622
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,400
storage is finite or not depending on what answer one gives to that story it

623
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,520
becomes important to free up storage space by forgetting now maybe our

624
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:32,120
storage is infinite I don't know I'm not I don't have a horse in that race but

625
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:38,000
in any case the retrieval speed and probably also the retrieval reliability

626
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:46,120
will improve the smaller the database that has to be sifted through they also

627
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:54,320
seem to be epistemological advantages to partial forgetting it's it's easier to

628
00:53:54,320 --> 00:54:00,520
have a justified belief when the content is watered down is diluted then when

629
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:07,040
the content is very rich it's much harder to to know rich contents then then

630
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:18,000
impoverished contents it may be that partial forgetting is what allows us to

631
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:28,720
see patterns it may be that it's important for attention that you know if

632
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:37,000
you if everything reminds you of something it's quite hard to attend on

633
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,080
the here and now but also for new learning for new learning correct it and I'm

634
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:53,040
I'm just speculating it could it be that partial forgetting is one of the

635
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:59,680
features that strengthens the social bonds because if I don't remember X but

636
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:06,280
I remember that Martin remembers X then I become dependent on him on his memory

637
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:15,800
perished thought they wouldn't help you well I was gonna say just a point it all

638
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,760
depends what you mean by forgetting really but from an evolutionary

639
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:25,320
perspective one might want to say that an animal can never know at the time

640
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:32,440
whether it's important to return a memory of an event or not right so maybe the

641
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,480
system set up in such a way that it's just gets into long-term memory it's

642
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,720
there the representations of that you can combine together and I completely

643
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,800
buy into the constructive idea we're arguing about it for 30 years but I don't

644
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,400
use the word reconstruction just construction so you can't know what is

645
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,840
you need to retain so the system set up to retain it but very cleverly what it's

646
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:58,560
done is it's made it difficult for you to access it right but it can still

647
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:03,320
influence processing and this is all based upon a story a friend of mine

648
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,760
told me called Jillian Cohen who was a famous old cultist psychologist and a

649
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,240
very keen horse rider and she told me she was riding a horse along a canal in

650
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:18,680
Oxford one day and there was a blacksmith forge there and some sparks came

651
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:22,000
flying out of the window the horse took right shied and ran off and it was a

652
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,040
quite dangerous moment for her the next year she was running along the same

653
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,360
track on the same horse but the last most of the clothes down they're not down

654
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,120
the building and as it got to the very point where it was the horse shied away

655
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:38,080
again sure right now I'm not supposing that horse could say well you know bad

656
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,960
thing happened here a year ago and I'm just repeating it but it's a point I want

657
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:46,240
to get out that the information may well be there but somehow our brains are set

658
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,920
up so we don't have to have it delivered consciously all the time so I don't

659
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,280
need to consciously remember oh it was last week I parked my car over there when

660
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,120
I got to the supermarket therefore this week it must be parked over there you

661
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:04,280
brain somehow has evolved to cleverly do it for you but the information is still

662
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:09,720
one way it's routinely measured is by a phenomenon you know well called savings

663
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,760
so very often you say do you remember this I absolutely don't remember we

664
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,280
studied this all the time we've got papers on it last year where animals

665
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,920
show no memory of an event and yet they can relearn that event more rapidly so

666
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,680
it's a very done the theme of it sort of in there in some way another dimension

667
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,560
to it that's really important or patterns I would suggest the horse

668
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:35,680
absolutely didn't remember the time of day but he sure is how we remember that

669
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,840
that the ones the canals on the left and the blacksmiths on the right and those

670
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,920
contexts and animals have to code context all the time to survive either

671
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,600
honeybee or bird or horse or human so so a lot of what we the way I think about

672
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:54,680
it loosely about what's retained is not essentially a lookup table but more like

673
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,800
patterns that are are adaptive to now be and actually this is what Christina's

674
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:04,920
work is about to be flexible because for example risk aversion in animals goes

675
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:11,400
up when they're sated when they're not hungry and risk aversion goes down when

676
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,640
they're they take more risks when they're hungry well that makes perfect sense if

677
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,840
you're out foraging right well turns out the guys at NYU two years ago found

678
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:23,280
nodes in the brain explain that and the way they studied it is an amazing young

679
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,800
guy that came up with this idea there was a shared node for for hunger and a

680
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,320
share a node is just a region in the brain where stuff works there was a

681
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,960
shared node for hunger and for risk aversion and he studied people that did

682
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:41,280
the stock market in countries that celebrated Ramadan pretty smart so

683
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,760
they're fasting and they still traded but the risk aversion changed as they

684
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,120
got hungry or they were well they take more risk in the market so it's you know

685
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,680
these are when you're I'm not just talking about squirrels in the park I'm

686
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,320
talking about your next portfolio a lot of things that govern our behavior from

687
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,840
the memory point of view are also very integrated or adaptive behaviors that's

688
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:05,920
sort of the point I was making yeah but I agree with the idea that actually the

689
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:12,880
details are lost that is forgetting this is the way I see it this is the way you

690
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:18,160
know the data we have make sense because if we would remember all the details

691
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:27,200
that we process and then they are not accessible a lot of space is gonna be

692
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:33,240
taken up by something that is not even used it's easiest Thomas suggested to

693
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:39,840
have you know something that is there and recall and then we make us remake

694
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:47,440
associations of it and and this is how the memories are not always faithful so

695
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:53,640
I mean there are so many data this for me suggesting that that's the most likely

696
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:58,400
explanation I mean the memory researchers that would agree with you is just I don't

697
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:05,200
and the point is this you say how can we remember all these details if they're

698
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,200
all in their whole lifetime is worth of remembering events I mean how is it

699
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,880
possible for the brain to store all of that but maybe the brain doesn't store

700
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,360
that much of any given event I mean me reason work with trauma patients

701
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,800
suggests that they return three to five what they call hotspots details from

702
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,840
their traumatic experience and actually not much else so when you remember this

703
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:29,320
event we're in today in a year's time maybe remember three or four or five

704
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:35,480
details maybe that's in the end all have got through all the got in there so

705
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:42,160
maybe we're kind of overestimating the information overload kind of story and

706
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,040
given how many connections are there are in the brain and that knowledge is

707
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,640
represented in those connections rather than in the new rooms then there's more

708
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:53,960
than enough processing capacity I think to represent an entire life and maybe

709
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,640
one or two more I don't know well certainly in the hippocampus most folks

710
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,920
know the hippocampus it's just shaped kind of like a big banana curl by itself a

711
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,640
bit in our brain there's a region of it that is involved in pattern completion

712
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,400
that's what it does for a living you give a little elements and then it puts

713
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,080
together stuff and I think it's commiserate with what you're saying is that that a

714
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:18,680
lot of what we do is a I going back to I get to write that same worth and that is

715
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,960
you don't need all the elements for an effective adaptive response to the current

716
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,840
you need enough to reconstruct it to then behave appropriately and so I don't

717
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,440
think we should think of memories I don't even like the fact that we've got

718
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,920
10 to the 13 cells and 10 to the third connections so there's plenty of room I

719
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:39,640
mean yeah if you like a computer analogy that's fine but I don't I think we're

720
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,800
much more interesting than that I think this is a good point to go back to that

721
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,360
idea of cementization yeah and the evolution of memories because at least

722
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:55,280
one take on that is part of what's happening is is in that evolution of the

723
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,360
episodic into the semantic you're abstracting out the statistical

724
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,720
properties and you talked about a pattern completion you need to know what the

725
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:08,000
pattern is in order to complete it you need to have a representation of the

726
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,480
you know the gist of a corpus of experiences that overall structure the

727
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,840
rules these are all words that have come up and in order to get in order to

728
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:23,560
extract that one ideas that you need forgetting right so you need to forget

729
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:29,520
the details in order to pull out the statistics the rules the gist and then

730
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,520
you have that structure and then maybe when you have a cue that taps into that

731
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,720
structure you can complete sure and you can maybe you can pull back memories in

732
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,080
that way through pattern completion that might have in some sense been forgotten

733
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:47,040
and by the way I would just make it a bit more complicated and qualify that by

734
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,280
saying you know I believe in this process but I also believe that you can

735
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,600
have both so I think that you can have the forgetting and the gist abstraction

736
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:01,760
process but you can also still hold on to those those memories that in some

737
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,720
sense in one system they've been forgotten but in another system they're

738
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:09,160
still there and so maybe that's what's happening maybe you get that gist

739
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,240
information and then the pattern completion can allow you to pull it out

740
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:18,200
from another system and that could be closer to your perspective I think I

741
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:25,560
don't know I mean what what got me started was at Irvine we have a group

742
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:30,360
a group of patients with super episodic memories there's a Jim McGire's group

743
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:38,080
correct and one of the striking features is the IQ is not any higher than that

744
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:42,560
of ordinary subjects and most of them are unhappy some of them they're actually

745
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:48,800
there are some happy ones as well but some I mean the famous ones are unhappy

746
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:54,080
anyway I don't mean interrupt you but you're right but that I found an interesting

747
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:59,120
feature you know if what you say is correct that the episodic memories are

748
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:07,000
sort of the material out of which semantic knowledge is built why are

749
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:15,520
people with a much larger episodic database not able to get smarter or better

750
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,440
maybe they have sleep problems

751
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,400
that's a good question actually it's very interesting many of them are OCD

752
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,560
many of them have kept diaries since they were four or five and they're OCD

753
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,320
there's a big OCD component to it and not all around happy you're right the

754
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:37,280
one I've met to the famous one is quite unhappy but but you make a point that's

755
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,120
really interesting for the group to think about and I'd love to hear what the

756
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:45,640
our guests outside of us I think about this I don't think that memory and

757
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:49,840
intelligence or smart or whatever the word is mapped onto each other whatsoever

758
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:55,320
adaptive getting around being clever that's fine but if there's lots of

759
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:01,240
studies in different domains that run that parameter out like cognitive

760
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:05,080
ability or problem solving and it may or may not map onto how well you remember

761
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:10,000
facts it much it's better often it's it's much better predictive how you use

762
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,400
facts it's not how many can you get at but how can you now be clever that's the

763
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,640
whole diversity thing if every read one book this year read something called the

764
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:22,320
difference it's a guy there's this whole frame about diversity and we're doing a

765
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,920
favor by getting diverse folks in there the trade-off is excellence nonsense

766
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,280
what it is is you get more diverse folks the variance compression because you

767
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:34,760
don't have consensus bias anymore you got a plumber and you got an Eskimo and

768
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:39,000
you got a psychiatrist and when they solve a problem you get a female

769
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,040
Puerto Rican and you get a male from from the Bronx you're gonna have a lack

770
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,120
consensus bias and you get a much better problem solved and you wouldn't say

771
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,800
any of them had better memories they just bring more tools to the toolkit I

772
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,560
think I just gave a speech I'm sorry

773
01:05:54,560 --> 01:06:00,440
so I think the I think so you've just said you don't think there's any link

774
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:05,400
between memory and intelligence IQ essentially I don't think they map onto

775
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:10,720
what I think there is an interesting relationship and I'll tell you what I

776
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:15,960
think it is and I think it all comes down to sleep as most things I think I should

777
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,200
take a nap let me say it first and then you can take the nap

778
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:27,400
so I can remember it yeah but so so we were talking about this abstraction of

779
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:34,480
just process we actually know that a stage of your sleep called slow wave

780
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,440
sleep is is important for this so we know that memories are replayed in slow

781
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,960
wave sleep they tend to be memories that are related to each other from the

782
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:48,160
same corpus of information the same types of experiences there's a hypothesis

783
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,840
that there's you know the overlapping components of those memories the shared

784
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:56,840
elements will be strengthened more and then when everything is downscaled

785
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,720
which also happens in this slow wave sleep you're left with a representation

786
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:05,880
of the commonalities the gist the schema the structure the statistics what we've

787
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,240
been talking about so that process there's quite a bit of evidence that

788
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:13,240
that happens and people are better at solving those kind of problems when

789
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,600
they've been allowed to sleep it's predicted by the amount of sleep they

790
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:20,720
had and you know on and on so here's the thing to IQ to and tell this is this

791
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:28,520
is complete speculation I like it yeah it's kind of fun so I would speculate

792
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:35,120
that if you if you can't build up schemas efficiently if you don't build up a

793
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:40,600
strong schema of the world if you don't build your semantic knowledge well you

794
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,880
can't make good predictions you can't integrate new information as well you

795
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,160
that means that you can't process information you can't you know you you

796
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:53,240
kind of get deficits across the board if you have a problem with that which

797
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:58,640
means you probably have lower IQ I mean if you're not taking in information as

798
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,000
well you're not using it as efficiently to make predictions you're not it's

799
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,360
gonna impact on these abilities right so could it be that if people if they are

800
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:13,680
not if there's some disruption in the sleep processing of information to

801
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:18,920
abstract out just generalities to build these schemas and if that happens across

802
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:22,880
your whole life from infancy onward where you're building up all your

803
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:28,680
semantic knowledge then eventually you know you start to have a deficit and you

804
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:33,120
start to show and sure enough there's at least a handful of studies showing

805
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:39,320
links between sleep spindles which are markers of memory replay and non-rep and

806
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:43,960
slow-wave sleep and IQ it's not a hundred percent it the literature is a bit

807
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:49,000
messy but it is there so there's a hint towards this but no one has really

808
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,240
tested it properly so I think they are disagree I I'm sorry I wouldn't

809
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:57,200
disagree for a moment I think that where I would intersect sort of orthogonal the

810
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:01,400
conversation is what we mean by IQ and if you mean dealing with facts that are

811
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:05,440
required for problem-solving then you're golden can I give you a take on that

812
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:09,280
yeah because I think a distinction we'd want to make here that's made in the area

813
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:14,680
is between crystallized and fluid IQ now when we're talking about memory we're

814
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:19,280
talking talking about crystallized IQ so if I can remember the decision we

815
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:23,000
made at the meeting last week then my view is probably going to carry the day

816
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,560
at the meeting this week you know people will have good long-term memories

817
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:33,480
probably influence things like social decision-making and emotional IQ and

818
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:39,360
important ways whereas fluid intelligence which is your ability to kind of solve

819
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,360
problems and things like that mathematical problems are you know

820
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:47,560
logical problems etc probably doesn't depend upon having a good long-term

821
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:52,680
memory of your life so that captures much and much more elegant phrase but I was

822
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:56,880
trying to say is that there's a lot of ways that we would call IQ or problem

823
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,960
solving intelligence and a certain class of those would absolutely depend on the

824
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,280
semantic episodic weaving of this tapestry and others would would not so I

825
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,720
only in pushing back on the canonical representation is more facts better

826
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:14,960
smarter and that that's a small part of it can I can answer it again just briefly

827
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,920
just because I want to mention this we've got one of these guys with a super

828
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,400
memory I do you studied him yeah he's brilliant guy he's a he's a kind of

829
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,880
senior manager at the civil service and England completely normal guy to kids

830
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,880
University his life considered completely normal except he has a slightly

831
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:39,280
unusual interested numbers it's a calendar calculator and what that means

832
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:45,520
is if you give him a date let's say I don't know June the 23rd 1971 what day of

833
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,040
the week was that he will tell you straight away it was the Wednesday and

834
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,680
I'll tell you what happened and who won the rugby game and what we did this test

835
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:57,240
with me put together a load of facts that we got various yearbooks and we said to

836
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:02,760
him okay he's he's a day tell us what day is he was 100% right on over 150

837
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:07,920
of these items and he could tell us what big items are in the news on that day

838
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,400
and Fatty was so good right we took our items from a thing called the Collins

839
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:18,880
yearbook and there was a famous comedian in in England who died on stage called

840
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:24,460
Tommy Cooper and we had this date in and the famous event he had to tell us was

841
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:29,000
Tommy Cooper died on stage and we scallove it in Martin we're talking to

842
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,960
him I said actually you did get one wrong there which I've quite surprised

843
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:37,400
at and he said what was it sort of Tommy Cooper dying on stage and he said well

844
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:41,480
that's the wrong date you've got the wrong date down there and so we went to

845
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,840
the web and looked at the Collins book of the Colours book printed the wrong

846
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:49,080
date isn't it it's amazing but he can remember autobiographical events and it

847
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:53,840
looks like the way he does it his memory is completely coded up in terms of

848
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:59,480
calendar time so I mean yeah we all research tells us that people don't

849
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:03,400
retain calendar dates in their memories very rarely but his memory is

850
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,520
completely somehow leaked to calendar time interesting it's amazing

851
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:16,440
character otherwise complete your view but retrieval does this kind of thing

852
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:21,860
reinforce it good question I hadn't looked at it from that direction but say

853
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:29,440
yes it's your view to absolutely isn't that what you were saying that the

854
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,760
information is there and he has better access to it that well yeah that we do

855
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,960
think that because he can use these very specific cues which you know date and

856
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:42,240
day of the week do you know it's really interesting about recalling and there's

857
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:48,040
an anecdotal story that Susan Corkin who is the woman who studied HM

858
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:52,600
extensively Brendan Miller is student and she tells the story that's actually I

859
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:57,240
believe never saw HM but I really believe it remember he doesn't remember

860
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,480
from the data the next so if Ed walked in and said hi and Ed he said nice to

861
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,760
meet you your chat he'd be able to work with Ed the next day he's never seen

862
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:08,100
him before all right if you tell the Susan said this was more than once she

863
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:13,560
would tell HM a joke and he'd love it and she'd tell up to him the next day and

864
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:18,040
he didn't think it was funny and he didn't remember it he didn't remember

865
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:22,520
the joke didn't remember the content it just didn't think it was funny so we

866
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:27,120
I'm that's chasing to me we got to be careful about putting bolts and buckets

867
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:31,320
right there's a lot more than brain smarter than we are so there's a nuanced

868
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:35,760
kind of encoding that clearly is going on that's well passed the categories we

869
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,240
have to impose on it to study it the sleep work is beautiful and you gotta

870
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:43,000
put boundaries on it so you can actually study it and did you push it

871
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,200
further and I don't know they found it funny and I don't know whether she did

872
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,880
it was completely anecdotal but but there were these very interesting quirky

873
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,600
things where it wasn't quite as canonical as it seemed I mean he was

874
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,760
devastated he got lost he couldn't find his way home but nonetheless there it's

875
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,920
not there are really interesting partial amnesia's where folks will have phenotypes

876
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,360
that are extremely interesting they don't forget everything but they just

877
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:10,120
forget some things you go maybe that reflects how you've categorized them in

878
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:13,880
the front end one doesn't know but what I'm really saying is the brain smarter

879
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:17,760
than we are so we have to impose structure on it to talk about it and to

880
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,200
study it and that's wonderful just like an analysis I'm sure you got

881
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:25,440
to impose the strength the brain is more than we are it is our brain that's

882
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,040
exactly the point yeah because we don't know I want to do something because I

883
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,880
didn't get a chance to ask you earlier when you were describing it when you

884
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:39,840
say the events of the day are then repeated during sleep slow sleep and

885
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:47,080
that helps with memory how are those events selected is this the whole day

886
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:56,720
played back it's a really important question I think what we know we know

887
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:00,960
from work in rats where they actually measure the replay of these memories

888
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:05,880
with embedded electrodes they're looking at populations of cells we know

889
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:11,280
that things that are more salient tend to be replayed more so rats replay

890
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:16,480
trajectories then they're running along you can see with cells that

891
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:21,200
represent spatial locations fire in order as they're moving towards a target and

892
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:26,720
those trajectories the ones that are moving towards food or a reward will be

893
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:32,680
replayed a lot more than trajectories that are not so we know that we in humans

894
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:39,560
we know that if you train people on to to say lists of words and then you tell

895
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:44,600
them we're only gonna test you on list a what tomorrow we're gonna test you on

896
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:49,320
list a and is how well you do is gonna determine how much money you get paid

897
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,000
for instance so forget about list B and then of course we test them on both

898
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,680
lists they improve much more on the list overnight on the list where they've

899
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:05,400
been told you'll be tested so it's more salient it's more and yeah so it does

900
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:10,000
seem that salient things also emotional things seems to improve from the coding

901
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,920
importance in some way yeah and that makes sense in an evolutionary context

902
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,360
it makes sense that if we have a mechanism for selectively strengthening

903
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:23,720
some memories but not all of them and you know at the same time things are

904
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:30,000
being forgotten across sleep as well so then we should strengthen the ones that

905
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,640
are important and the salient ones are the important ones so emotions would be

906
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:41,040
much more important in fact things that have an emotional facts that have an

907
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:46,400
emotional impact importance more than facts yeah so it's important to remember

908
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:52,160
that last time I ate this I got sick or last time I you know last time I did

909
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:57,280
this my my partner was happy you know these are important things but other

910
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:02,400
things that have no emotional link why should I remember them well because we

911
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:10,200
need to have facts we need to have facts but the emotion is modulating the

912
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:15,040
formation of that memory and this story the consolidation there are many

913
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:24,040
studies showing that emotions and hormones released by stress or arousal

914
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:29,760
can modulate memory strength right this is they have done many studies in

915
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,520
humans as well as in animal models I mean we're talking about Jim a girl

916
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:42,120
the K-hill but then many others in animal models but biologically speaking that's

917
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:47,840
obvious I mean if you think about the biology we need to remember more or for

918
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:53,320
longer what's important so if we encounter a danger we don't want to

919
01:17:53,320 --> 01:18:00,760
forget after the single encounter if that's very important we better

920
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:07,660
remember that if we get too close to a lion we are in danger I mean it's

921
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:12,240
obviously biologically anxiety type situations are the ones that are most

922
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:17,320
liable to be repeated in during sleep because that would be one of the major

923
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:21,320
emotions sure I don't know I'm saying sure you're in tuition

924
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:33,960
it makes sense I don't think that anxiety specifically has been studied I

925
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:38,680
mean it would have to be in humans because that sounds like a human kind of

926
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:45,120
emotion and I think that yes people would agree with that but I don't know if

927
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:49,480
there's empirical data to definitely support it and say that's one thing

928
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,560
that Christina said that's really important you mentioned Jim McGaugh who's a

929
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:58,080
beloved guy in the field we all know him well and he in the day he found

930
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:02,200
something that's very important it's almost the reverse of how Christina and

931
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,360
I study memory and if we block transmit we block protein synthesis we block

932
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:11,440
now Jim found that after trials over he can improve the memory is over now the

933
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,160
episode itself is over the animals already been there it's learned it and

934
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:19,120
after that if you do maybe think of it is our drugs drugs or hormones that

935
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:23,080
are involved in arousal you can after so you would think you're only encoding

936
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:26,840
when you're in the episode right I left the library the books closed but turns

937
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,280
out that for some length of time you can add close post trial enhancement you

938
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:34,160
can make the memory stronger by virtue of giving animals hormones that are

939
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:40,080
involved in in emotion so there that modulation is a really fundamental

940
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,120
thing in our world is that there is there's if you can think of it and it's

941
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:46,800
only a metaphor there's streams of like information but the volume goes up and

942
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,000
down you can tune the volume up and down depending on it and it's really

943
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,840
important to have the volume alone a lot of things because then you're not

944
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:56,560
riveted by your world but sometimes you need that volume up and it may well be

945
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:00,680
that during the day when that volumes up that will trigger the kinds of things

946
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:04,480
that you want to revisit in doing sleep but I'm just guessing with you but it

947
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:13,240
makes some sense I think it is it in everybody experience we do remember

948
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:19,600
better the memories that are linked to some emotion absolutely at least

949
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:25,960
access to it's a more complicated sure but if emotions are too strong stuff

950
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:30,280
around needs you right but this is also being studied by the same groups right so

951
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:37,200
they show that if the emotional regulation is too strong there is the

952
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:42,520
opposite effect so a little bit of stress is good right too much is bad there is

953
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:49,080
this inverted U function that describes memory retention but complex

954
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:55,880
function retention with the stress level if we you know if we look at the

955
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:03,240
relationship between stress level and performance that's how it is expressed

956
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:09,000
so a little bit is good to remember to perform better too much is bad yeah when

957
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:15,440
somebody says you know I keep remembering a lot of irrelevant facts in point of

958
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:19,280
fact they may only be irrelevant because he thinks they're irrelevant but from

959
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:23,680
your study it would show that they were relevant

960
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:29,440
I think there's even a condition that's to do with remembering too many irrelevant

961
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:34,120
facts particularly number type facts does anyone know well there are there

962
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:37,600
patients that can't admit right so right in this room right now most of us

963
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,880
don't feel the clothes in our body most of us don't hear that you will now when

964
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,560
I said you don't hear that background right so we are it's important for a

965
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,400
normal animals get around the planet to learn what to ignore and you don't even

966
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,800
learn it it just it's built into the system some folks can't do that

967
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:57,480
there are powerful I don't know the names of them but and I think you're right so

968
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:01,600
some just can't stop thinking about stuff and it actually is paralytic because

969
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,400
you know if I'm going to turn and talk to Penny well if I'm still fixated and I'm

970
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,120
what we're doing that I can't select my attention like a flashlight it's more

971
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,800
like I'm constantly based and that exists also in memories so kind of

972
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:18,320
streams of irrelevant information invading you know triggered by any queue

973
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,720
you know everything you might have ever known about this kind of carpet or you

974
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:25,400
know that kind of ceiling or pain it's a bit like the superlores they have these

975
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:29,680
kind of memories at least some of them are terribly distracted by it not the

976
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,600
least of which it's important to forget things are painful and they were

977
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,600
remember you know they're when they're puppy-died when they were five and it

978
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,760
still hurts and so for in some ways it's not a bad thing to forget or at least

979
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,600
have it blunted enough we can move on so that brings us to something else which

980
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:48,360
might be interesting to talk about which is PTSD and this kind of inability to

981
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:53,560
remove the emotional content from traumatic memories I mean that's

982
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:57,480
something that is interesting from a sleep perspective as well because there's

983
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,160
one idea that one of the things that happens in sleep to memories is that the

984
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:06,280
emotions can be decoupled from the memory so you might you might have been

985
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:12,520
mugged you know and it might be that sleeping you know of a probably not one

986
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:17,160
night but a year of sleeps might be strengthening the memory for that you

987
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:21,920
can still remember all the details of what happened but helping you to dissociate

988
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,280
the emotions so that when you remember it you don't have the physiological

989
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,640
reaction you're not as upset and of course people with post-traumatic

990
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,880
stress disorder have trouble doing this or they can't do it they can't decouple

991
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:39,000
and these emotions invade and they have they can have nightmares and they can

992
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:44,240
have kind of flashbacks and it can be I'm really disruptive to people's lives

993
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:49,080
people can commit suicide because of this Christina has the most articulate

994
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:52,320
kind of view on that with I know you don't like reconciliation or whatever

995
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:56,400
the the construct we used to talk about it I think that you thought deeply about

996
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:06,840
that yes so what reconciliation told the field we can talk about this

997
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:14,880
agreement is that when memories retrieval becomes fragile again and so

998
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:21,640
this was an interesting point for clinical translation for application one

999
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:27,240
is PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder the other is addiction addicts also have

1000
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:33,440
very strong and persistent and repetitive memories and they can relapse if they

1001
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:38,120
are brought back in the context where they used even after the talks this is

1002
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:44,880
how they more likely relax is when they go back and they remember of the effect

1003
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:51,600
of the drug so PTSD was one of the fields in which reconciliation was like

1004
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:58,600
oh wow this is gonna be a new way to treat this type of disorders and has

1005
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:07,840
not been so you know resulted or positive as we would we would have thought

1006
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,800
because most of the studies in reconciliation have been done with normal

1007
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,440
I call them normal let's say adaptive

1008
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:22,560
aversive memories fear conditioning and those are not model of PTSD so this is

1009
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,280
to say that that's exactly what you're saying the quality of the memories of

1010
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:38,840
PTSD are different than adaptive aversive fear memories and so we definitely need

1011
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:46,840
to understand more of what is going on in the subject that lead to PTSD in a

1012
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:56,080
population trauma leads to PTSD to PTSD in about 20% of the popular the cases

1013
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:05,480
the number of subjects that become PTSD for example from war zones or from you

1014
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:13,600
know very profound trauma that they experience there are a number of other

1015
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:21,720
feature attached to it previous history seems to be very important and that you

1016
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:26,920
know we don't know enough of what really leads to PTSD what is the

1017
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:32,760
theology of PTSD that's important and the understanding of what's different in

1018
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:37,840
those memories well there's I mean one comment I could make it so there is this

1019
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:44,120
idea that replaying those memories this is it's a hypothesis that comes from

1020
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:50,600
Matt Walker at Berkeley his idea is that replaying those emotional trauma

1021
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:56,640
memories in REM sleep specifically allows this decoupling of emotion and

1022
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:00,480
that's because in REM sleep you have very low levels of a neurotransmitter

1023
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:06,480
called norepinephrine which is if you have very low levels of that you shouldn't

1024
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,600
be able to have physiological responses to things so you shouldn't have that

1025
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,400
increase in heart rate the sweating pupil dilation these things that are

1026
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:17,200
associated with a stress response an emotional response and so that means

1027
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:22,600
you're essentially replaying the content of the memory without that response and

1028
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:27,720
so decoupling so that's his hypothesis and there is some support for it there's

1029
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:31,920
also some counter evidence but there is interesting yeah there's quite a bit of

1030
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:38,440
counter evidence but the interesting thing about it is that irrespective

1031
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:43,760
whether that hypothesis is right certainly people who are predisposed to

1032
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:49,920
suffer from PTSD have abnormal REM sleep so the properties of that sleep are

1033
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:56,800
different and in rats if if the force to go into REM sleep at a time when the

1034
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:02,000
norepinephrine is high so it hasn't been able to come down as it should because

1035
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,160
they've been too stressed then they will show PTSD like symptoms that actually

1036
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:13,440
persist over months chronically so there is you know it's I think it's a

1037
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:17,640
tricky area I think it's complicated and I'm not completely a proponent of this

1038
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:23,400
hypothesis but I think something is going on yeah well is not yet understood

1039
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:29,960
as we will say but what do you what you're saying it will make sense with perhaps

1040
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:36,120
that previous history plays are all into it right okay

1041
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,520
question fine

1042
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:48,840
anything what is known about the retrieval process in particular outcome

1043
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:53,040
when I can't remember something then the narrow rate I'm in the shower it comes

1044
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,600
to me when I'm not even trying to think of it you've had tip of the time from

1045
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:02,080
home it's your it's so normal everybody experiences it the last thing I do is

1046
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:07,360
try to keep pushing when on the site and then you turn or Mary Jo and I went

1047
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:11,160
to try to remember the French lieutenants woman and I remember I like the actress

1048
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:16,040
and she I could see her cape and her name rind with peep and it was Merle

1049
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:19,120
Street but it was a while back that I could pull it out so you probably have

1050
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:23,680
a cognitive framework for that but it is absolutely common to does anybody

1051
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:26,960
know what's going on there why that happens there's a metaphor I the answer

1052
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:32,480
is I don't but the metaphor is that if you start pursuing if you see bifurcations

1053
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:36,040
of a retrieve you just trying to find something the further down a road away

1054
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,680
from the domain the further you get locked into the wrong strategy and if you

1055
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:43,680
just stop and the system can kind of reset you can get back to it but that's

1056
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:47,520
pure metaphor I maybe my colleagues know I don't it's absolutely real everybody

1057
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:53,360
in the world experiences it pisses you off but we are really so the is normal

1058
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:58,000
I mean one thing it illustrates is that the retrieval process carries on

1059
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:05,760
non-consciously absolutely which in itself is quite an interesting thing and

1060
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,480
it's associated why did I know it rind with something because we break up

1061
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:14,120
memories I think you made this point earlier we break up memories not

1062
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:17,200
consciously into lots of different things it can be sounded it could be

1063
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:21,640
color so why would I know it rind with something that's not uncommon and it's

1064
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:26,040
because although we codified it's like the movie that's not how my brain did it

1065
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,560
my brain already has distributed that memory in lots of different places where

1066
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:33,120
there might be a sound associated with it or a smell like you were talking in

1067
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:38,160
sleep so another issue actually related to is how do you know it's the right

1068
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:50,320
answer because it feels right I never thought here a philosopher saying that's

1069
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:55,360
my answer but you may have answered this question in my hearing didn't pick up

1070
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:59,120
yeah I you may have answered this and I apologize if you did I couldn't hear

1071
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:07,160
everything what are you saying that one's nature if there is such a thing in part

1072
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:13,720
determines whether memories are positive or negative is is it did you talk to

1073
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:22,160
that at all whether an underlying personality determines the nature of a

1074
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:27,960
memory we can have we can both go to Coney Island and go on Ferris wheel and I'll

1075
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,720
remember it as a very upsetting experience I had if you were next to me

1076
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:37,680
and you'll remember it is a very positive experience is there any knowledge about

1077
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:41,400
yeah I mean what we haven't really discussed really is the relationship

1078
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:47,400
between memories and goals memories and goals your goals while you do things in

1079
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:52,280
the world right your memories reflect those goals but we don't always cannot

1080
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:59,200
always identify them it's probably how goal attainment is hindered or promoted

1081
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:05,400
by the experience that leads in part to a positive or negative memory so maybe

1082
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,800
one factor there'll be others as well

1083
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:21,360
I'm primarily interested in biology so I have a question assuming we are in this

1084
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:29,080
world to survive and possibly in utero perhaps soon thereafter we are

1085
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:36,360
accumulate experience that could be both emotionally physically painful and we

1086
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:43,520
want to avoid to what degree does intentionality to survive come into play

1087
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:49,080
impossibly I'll use the word select but there ain't not be an actual choosing

1088
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:56,280
event but the process the individual wants to survive and what's going on

1089
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:02,240
chemically biologically with that individual

1090
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:18,400
no it's a very important question right where does it start I feel inspired the

1091
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:26,560
answer from the angels where does it start the process that really select

1092
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:31,160
what's going on so that there is survival intentionality I don't know you

1093
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:36,720
know I don't I really don't I don't know how to comment that biologically

1094
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:43,200
speaking is I think evolution has set as selected the number of mechanisms that

1095
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:49,480
that's what they do so if there is an experience they respond in a way that

1096
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:57,280
will promote survival does that answer okay I have my own experience but I'm

1097
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:03,800
also curious about the role of learning with memory that for example the monarch

1098
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:10,200
butterfly it takes three generations to complete a cycle do you are familiar

1099
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:16,000
with the monarch studies they they live in the summer months in Ontario and

1100
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,760
Midwest they winter in Mexico but in between they go through another whole

1101
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:25,920
life stage it's not even the same parents grandparents you know it's going

1102
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:31,600
skipping a generation so there's incredible information being encoded

1103
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:37,080
into these butterflies to get them through a complete cycle to reproduce

1104
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:48,160
oh I mean I don't think we are so like separate and better evolved

1105
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:53,840
throughout the scale I think there is a continuum in the evolution and we are

1106
01:34:53,840 --> 01:35:02,920
surprised to see how much we can actually then see in lower animals so to

1107
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:08,880
speak you know in less evolved animals I think these mechanisms are very intrinsic

1108
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:18,040
in the evolution I mean I don't know how to answer your question I mean I'm not

1109
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:25,400
surprised that we see this complex survival mechanisms in butterflies in

1110
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:34,920
sea elegance in a plesia and toward the evolution I scale thank you

1111
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:41,840
early in the history of physical science as we started to understand

1112
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,640
emergent phenomenon like pressure in terms of models having to do with things

1113
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:50,400
like statistical dynamics and so we started to learn the notion that unlike

1114
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:54,680
the early reductionist interpretations of nature good a phenomenon that came

1115
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:59,760
out of these sort of very nonlinear phenomena so today we are applying

1116
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:05,160
simplified models of the brain to problems in recognition and can do

1117
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:10,400
things in machines that were not doable nearly ten years ago now there are some

1118
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,840
interesting problems with these approaches they're intractable in a sense

1119
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:17,360
that is to say we can build systems that are mathematicians and physicists can

1120
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:23,120
actually describe how they work if you investigate this but nevertheless it

1121
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:27,240
does smack a bit of reductionism in a new sense however my sense in talking to

1122
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:32,640
brain science frequently is that reductionism is sort of unwelcome is it

1123
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:37,080
the belief of the panel that ultimately we will have a sort of for certain

1124
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:40,920
segments of the brain because the brain is like the body made up of many systems

1125
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:45,240
but for certain computational components of the brain or information

1126
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:49,520
representation models of the brain we will we have a fundamental calculus of

1127
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:55,360
information and perception what is the panel's position on this

1128
01:36:55,360 --> 01:37:04,520
I'll weigh in on it because it's a very deep question one of the ways that this

1129
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:09,320
is impacting the field right now is our cartoon the position in order to comment

1130
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:13,040
on it is that if we understood every connection in the brain there's 10 to

1131
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:16,520
the 16th connections to the math if we end up and they're dynamic they change

1132
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:20,000
with time so they're not just solder joints if we understand every connection

1133
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,280
then we'll understand the brain and there is pushback from that point of view so

1134
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:29,960
it's a it's a scientist don't have facts we have opinions and we struggle with

1135
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:35,200
making our facts turn into something that's coherent that said I would frame it

1136
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:39,320
the following it's absolutely necessary but not sufficient so to have that

1137
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:42,560
corpus of information for a complete understanding now we would turn to you

1138
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,840
to say what that is me I don't know what a complete understanding means to have

1139
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:49,200
those the understanding the connectivity is absolutely necessary in the long run

1140
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:56,200
but insufficient to then explain the way it works and so what we do is as scientists

1141
01:37:56,200 --> 01:38:01,360
and I would follow the reductuous camp in a heartbeat is provide modules that is

1142
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:06,120
I'll give you a molecular module for how genes are turned on to store a memory

1143
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:09,760
anywhere and now you can import that to the cortex and have that one kind of

1144
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,760
memory you can port that to the hippocampus and use another and I would

1145
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:17,200
never for a moment say that my simple animal is just a is a human but fewer

1146
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:21,160
neurons it's the rules change absolutely change the computational rules change

1147
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:24,880
but what we can do is say well what are the comp because we really believe in

1148
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,800
evolution what is evolution hung on to she's pretty smart so she's hung on this

1149
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,120
transcription and translation and phosphorylation and protein folding and

1150
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:38,600
pre-transcriptional modeling and etc up and down to humans right on down to

1151
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:44,040
simple animals so no one would I would never equate what we study to anything

1152
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:47,920
close to a human experience but what we can do is get building blocks that can

1153
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:52,240
inform the computational rules of a given domain in the brain that does balance

1154
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:56,320
or does encoding and memory in the limit case though is in a sense of provable

1155
01:38:56,320 --> 01:39:00,880
assertion the way for instance statistical mechanics are relatively it is in but

1156
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:05,880
the keyword is the limit of course but in reality if you think of a machine that

1157
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:09,080
is 10 to the 16th connections that change with time and it's a pretty

1158
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:16,480
complex challenge so sure yeah I was at a conference is all philosophers and the

1159
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:20,040
idea was around if we understood all the connections with you and I was asked to

1160
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,800
make some comments at the front when your dean asked to do this you talk about

1161
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:27,760
stuff you know nothing about I do it every day and but what was funny was it

1162
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:31,760
was right when do you remember when when is it called big blue what was the IBM

1163
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,880
robot big blue what's it and he was on jeopardy like anyone you know why what

1164
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:40,080
someone because he had shorter reaction time it wasn't that he was smarter he

1165
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:44,400
gets be faster and there was one question I see if the room can get it that what's

1166
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:48,400
and I'll drill back and why this is important what's in blue something that

1167
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:52,280
Jennings got and Watson blue and it's a following you know in jeopardy how you

1168
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:58,320
get a statement and then you recast the question and it was I'm a city with two

1169
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,640
airports one named for a famous World War II general and one named for a

1170
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:05,560
famous World War II battle what city am I I didn't know the answer anybody know

1171
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:13,160
way to go it's right so you've got Chicago's O'Hare and and and anyway yeah

1172
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:17,800
but big blue didn't get that and they asked the woman who built him she knew

1173
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:21,960
every connection right she put in there I mean there's a whole team but she why

1174
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:25,440
did you do that she I forgot a clue I don't know why didn't know that so

1175
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:29,360
you referred to as attractability she well I mean but she knows all the connections

1176
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:34,480
right she knew she she knew every dial she knew every and yet nonetheless she

1177
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:38,880
could only approximate why big blue blew it no pun intended so I guess what I'm

1178
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:42,560
getting it is just knowing the connectivity would be extraordinarily

1179
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,360
helpful but ain't gonna get us all the way so it won't bring us through with

1180
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:50,000
statistical mechanics I would think not but what it might do is it might be something

1181
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,560
something like quantum mechanics is gonna help us and already people taking a

1182
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:57,920
quantum approach to various forms of cognition quantum decision-making is a

1183
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:03,260
big area of the moment yeah well the thing about quantum is it has these

1184
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:07,360
emergent properties and obviously the brain is gonna have those as well without

1185
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,120
knowing what those are you're not going to be able to make sense as you'll see

1186
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:14,640
a lot that's going on so it just we need to get smarter about our physics

1187
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:20,920
will be my answer how well I think would be great if reductionism worked I

1188
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:25,460
would I would rejoice but it's I don't think we even have a way of seeing how it

1189
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:34,760
could work at this present moment I mean take take some of the the metaphors

1190
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:38,840
that have been used in this panel discussion to describe the memory

1191
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:45,600
process you know the notion of a trace was passed around we have not not the

1192
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:50,480
faintest idea of how to think about a memory trace if that is meant to be a

1193
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:56,440
representational item what should that be what should that be I mean if if

1194
01:41:56,440 --> 01:42:01,280
connectionism is true which I suppose it is then there are no

1195
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:06,240
representational items stored you mentioned again and again that we

1196
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:11,240
shouldn't think of the memory as a as an index card absolutely true but how are

1197
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:17,760
representations we don't have at least as a talk about or as weights yeah a

1198
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,160
single synapse has it but in a computational sense there's a number of

1199
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:25,680
shifting of weights that allow a network to recreate yeah but what's our metaphor

1200
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:30,040
what that means is that whatever input you put into the system sure it's the

1201
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:33,760
content of that input and that of course is different when you recall them when

1202
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:39,560
you what you originally had absolutely so there wouldn't be anything stored the

1203
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:45,360
notion of this idea of storage goes out of the window when you take connection

1204
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:51,440
to the system seriously at least as far as I can tell so yeah I think we don't

1205
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:55,160
even know how to answer this question but it's a great question thank you

1206
01:42:55,160 --> 01:43:02,040
thank you I'm a bit of a passionate hobbyist about cognitive neuroscience and I'm

1207
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:05,960
that have a small software companies who actually agree with all of his points

1208
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:11,160
which are that these talks are so great because there are so many dimensions to

1209
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:16,480
knowing something that having people from various disciplines you really get to

1210
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:21,760
see the shape of something with everyone that speaks but computer science is

1211
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:28,400
playing such a hard and fast game with this stuff that it it seems it seems like

1212
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:33,040
a great opportunity to have someone who's a very accomplished computer scientist

1213
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:38,560
on the panel you know like when you were speaking about there was a a gentleman

1214
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:45,920
at your college that has a very locked to a calendar personal memory of things

1215
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:50,560
that's very much like a directory and if you had every file that you ever did

1216
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:54,600
connected on to which a day they were of course you could access it right I mean

1217
01:43:54,600 --> 01:44:00,320
everyone has computers with so many things where the gentlemen with hyper

1218
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:04,760
accusers of you know in computer systems we hide things that we don't think are

1219
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:08,720
important for the user to know and that thing being broken would be them being

1220
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:17,160
overwhelmed or just everything down the line like or converting memories and

1221
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:22,680
long term memories when you go to sleep right that's been happening in digital

1222
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:29,800
audio for decades now called bouncing to disk you know so there there seems like

1223
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:33,800
there's so many parallels and there's so many interesting ways that to kind of

1224
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:39,360
look at it I was just wondering if any of you intentionally seek out computer

1225
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:46,160
scientists as well to kind of bounce ideas off of you bet yeah no it's a deep

1226
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:52,160
it's a very deep part of our field the site of neuroscience is about 42,000

1227
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:56,760
members all over the world and our typical meeting we just in Chicago had

1228
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:01,360
29,000 people show up so there's a lot of folks and a significant check of those

1229
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:04,520
folks who have fallen to class about your common computer science their

1230
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:08,400
computational scientists their connection to science but they absolutely bring

1231
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:13,200
that to the table and and it's not just building the metaphor it really informs

1232
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:16,840
how we think about things I mean they're there they're one of the most

1233
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:21,120
interesting fellows that I've run into down NYU is only Paul Glimture who

1234
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:25,240
studied what he called neuroeconomics it's now called decision-making and that

1235
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:28,120
maps on everything from risk aversion to addiction things we've talked about

1236
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:32,440
today that came from a computational analysis so he's got economists

1237
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:36,800
philosophers psychologists neuroscientists and hardcore folks in

1238
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:40,840
carot that do nothing but number crunch and and the aggregate is extraordinarily

1239
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:44,640
exciting that's that's what we're blessed to do this no one of us have a

1240
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:47,360
handle on the truth but when you get a bunch of people together it's a

1241
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:52,120
amazing payment pass to do it but it goes the other way as well I think it's

1242
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:56,360
worth mentioning I mean of course it's incredibly useful for us to look look

1243
01:45:56,360 --> 01:46:00,640
to computer scientists but it's also incredibly useful for them to look to

1244
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:04,280
the structure of the brain right so that's something that you're probably

1245
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:08,840
aware of that's happening for instance in Manchester where I am at the moment

1246
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:15,920
that they've constructed a computer that does parallel processing with it's

1247
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:21,400
called spinnaker and it's built out of thousands of mobile phone chips each of

1248
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:25,000
them representing a few neurons and these so it's it's mimicking the

1249
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:30,640
structure of the brain somewhat you know to some extent more closely and it has

1250
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:34,240
phenomenal processing abilities because it's this parallel processor which is

1251
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:41,400
not how most computers are right so the what I would add to that be we always

1252
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:45,120
kind of look to nature first to get the idea and then we engineer out the

1253
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:49,320
inefficiencies right so you like you see a flying bird and you make a plane and

1254
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:53,200
you make a faster plane by taking away some of the bird parts right and that

1255
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:59,440
happened a lot with computers like in the 90s the the cra supercomputer breakthrough

1256
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:04,360
was structuring it like the brain is because that shortened travel time

1257
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:09,800
actually for all the signals to coordinate into like a central hub unit

1258
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:17,320
try to you know make sense of things but I think I think what's really exciting

1259
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:22,600
about it now like so for parallel processing right how did computers

1260
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:26,000
eventually get to the ability where they could drive a car which used to be this

1261
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,560
artificial intelligence holy grail and then it just accidentally happened in

1262
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:34,120
the background right we got that way because people got really good at

1263
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:41,320
GP GPU general purpose graphics card massively parallel processing because

1264
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:46,080
humans are just pattern recognition kind of monsters right we're super fast at

1265
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:52,960
it so when we finally had enough parallel cores analyzing video images

1266
01:47:52,960 --> 01:48:02,520
like on the fly we could have it track better so like it seems the the cell

1267
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:08,400
phone thing I'm not not the cell phone thing the the spin occur the cluster of

1268
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:13,960
low wattage nodes that you're speaking of is that doing a specific kind of

1269
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:18,680
research project or is that it exists in itself using these low wattage chips

1270
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:25,200
the project it's it was a project to build it as I understand but now it's

1271
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:30,200
being used for projects so it has been constructed as something that looks a

1272
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:35,680
bit more like the brain right it's a computer and now people are trying its

1273
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:41,440
ability to perform different kinds of tasks so it goes both ways you brought

1274
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:45,880
up that maps directly and what Penne just said is the field at large is

1275
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:51,160
driven two ways one conception when it's technically and and in I wouldn't have

1276
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:54,720
the vocabulary to tell you it was like 10 years ago if I sat down with

1277
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:57,520
Christina 10 years ago and talked about what we're doing in our labs right now

1278
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,360
in our labs right now we wouldn't have the vocabulary for that so that the

1279
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:06,360
techniques can't explain but they can sure be drivers and open up windows

1280
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:10,120
which so all of you are seeing me and seeing each other right now through your

1281
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:13,640
eyes and your eyes have a retina at the back that's processing that and there's

1282
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:18,840
a molecule in your retinas called opsin that is allowing that signal like that

1283
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:23,760
brown jacket to turn into a neuro signal you can take that molecule you can put

1284
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:28,440
it in a neuron attach it to whatever you want shine a light on it turn it on so

1285
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:32,000
now we have a technique called optogenetics we can turn things on and off

1286
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,400
and complicated network well we just turn on everybody in this room whose name

1287
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:41,000
begins with them right before it was impossible to do so you can put these

1288
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,160
techniques around now they're parlor tricks if you just stop there but now

1289
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:49,000
really smart folks team up together with those technically driven folks of how

1290
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:54,960
can I interrogate memory and for example how can I record a cluster of cells in

1291
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:58,840
this thing called the amygdala that's important for emotion and they change

1292
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:02,720
with an emotional memory like Christina studies and then later I can activate

1293
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:07,280
those with this light and bring the memory back and have the animal literally as

1294
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,240
if I've just turned the memory on and bring it I just shine light on its brain

1295
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:14,280
couldn't have not even couldn't have done it 10 years ago we didn't have the

1296
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:17,720
vocabulary for that so the kinds of computational things you're mentioning

1297
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:23,040
can dramatically non linearly boost the field when they give us the ability to

1298
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:28,760
ask a question at more granularity right thank you thank you so much guys

1299
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:35,760
hi I have sort of a two-part question my first question is with regard to the

1300
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:43,400
idea of focus sort of what happens when one orchestrates a situation for the

1301
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:49,160
recall of memory and from your discussion it seems like you know it's it's quite

1302
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:54,760
likely that what that means is is orchestrating a certain level of sort

1303
01:50:54,760 --> 01:51:02,680
of chemical stress but then I wonder and I guess a bit of ignorance with with

1304
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:07,160
regard to the effects of meditation but I there's sort of the popular trope of

1305
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:13,760
that of research in in into meditation now I think is this idea that it

1306
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:18,920
increases your ability to focus it increases your memory but also it sort

1307
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:25,560
of decreases your stress level and so I wonder you know are they are they and

1308
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:32,400
you know are focused and the effects of meditation are they sort of

1309
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:37,040
affecting one's ability to recall memories from different angles or are

1310
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:42,360
they sort of I don't know what you might have to say what do you exactly do you

1311
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:48,120
mean by meditation the reason I ask is because California it's different

1312
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:54,520
out here we were close it

1313
01:51:56,320 --> 01:52:02,840
go ahead I you know it's sort of a traditional practice of focusing one's

1314
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:07,880
thoughts of being you know conscious of of the experience of one's body and

1315
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:13,280
and sort of practicing a focus of of directing one's thoughts to a you know

1316
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:17,080
specific thing rather than letting you know one's thinking be scattered that

1317
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:26,320
that kind of thing I'm gonna try to give some some thoughts so focused meaning

1318
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:32,080
attention yeah in that sense so attention is regulated by hormones and

1319
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:38,480
those are important for strengthening memory through the processes we talked

1320
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:46,440
about so perhaps that could be a link to think about right and meditation lowers

1321
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:56,280
stress level and too much stress impacts memory expression memory performance as

1322
01:52:56,280 --> 01:53:02,800
we said so that could be another link to think about that meditation it doesn't

1323
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:07,160
you know completely eradicate stress but it's immediately it actually is right

1324
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:11,880
or even you know increases one's ability to sort of control the amount of stress

1325
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:17,400
that when if you have control it means that you can lower right the level of

1326
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:22,880
stress hormones and when they are too high there is an impact as we said in

1327
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:27,440
memory performance and some studies actually have shown that what the impact

1328
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:35,160
is retrieval so retrieval is impaired in high stress conditions so that perhaps

1329
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:40,520
could be some link to think about it one thing this Christina said earlier that

1330
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:44,840
was really important in your mind's eye right now picture next more access that

1331
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:49,640
inverted you that describes everything from chemical reactions in a test tube

1332
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:55,200
to the way stars go through the planet it's a phenomenally important function to

1333
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:59,920
a little's not if this is performance too little is no good there's an optimal

1334
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:02,960
and then too much is no good and that it really does describe a lot of things

1335
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:08,400
beyond psychology and in that maybe what I know nothing about meditation but

1336
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,240
maybe you're shifting it back to the optimal if you look further over the

1337
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:14,960
right you know maybe you're just shifting that balance back to the optimal and we

1338
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:20,240
have language to capture that calling it meditation or relaxation which captures

1339
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:23,480
it but maybe which really does this resetting it back not really I mean

1340
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:26,840
another way to say we're getting back to that optimal which is moving further

1341
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:31,680
away from the stress level and you know it is important to stay stressed a bit I

1342
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:34,400
mean if you're gonna take a test and you're not up for it you're not gonna do

1343
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:38,640
well so a little bit good but most of us are on the right hand side of that curve

1344
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:44,640
I just wonder you know what it is about meditation that doesn't you know that

1345
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:49,720
all these studies are sort of reporting these very positive results and not a

1346
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:53,080
result that goes completely to the opposite end of that bell curve where

1347
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:57,080
people are too chilled out to you know remember anything or you know focus at

1348
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:00,600
all I mean it's just some suggestion I don't think there are proof that that

1349
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:05,960
that's what explains but it is a reasonable suggestion to think about

1350
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:33,800
thank you and thank you everybody thank you
