1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Hey everyone, this is our last roundtable of the day, but it is by no means the least exciting,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,320
because STEAM education encapsulates so much of what we're talking about.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,200
And we started talking about STEAM this morning. I know that feels like a long time ago, it does to me.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,720
This morning we talked about polymathi, we talked about transdisciplinary groups as the kind of

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,280
new version of Leonardo. What are we trying to do when we teach people STEAM? What are the ways

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:36,720
that STEAM gets realized either in the nonprofit sector or in education in K through 12 versus

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,920
college? What are these people going to grow up to be like? So these are the questions that we

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,520
start talking about this morning. We have a very good group of people here who have very vastly

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,600
different experience from teaching for a couple of years to teaching for 45 years. So there's a

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,360
lot of wisdom to be found here. I will let Zach as usual introduce the panel and then we'll get started.

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:14,240
Harvey Seifter. Harvey is founder and director of the art of science learning AOSL. He has taught

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,320
innovation at GE's Croughtonville Global Leadership Development Center. He is also a classically

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,480
trained musician and has provided his leadership in works with numerous award-winning musical

14
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:35,040
productions. Jill Barganetti. Jill is a professor at Hunter College and CUNY Graduate Center.

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,200
She has received an NSF Career Award and Presidential Early Career Award for scientists.

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:49,680
She is also a standing member on the NIH Tumor Cell Biology Study section. She also is a choreographer

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,640
who has developed a class choreographing genomics which focuses on teaching genome information flow

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:05,440
through postmodern dance. Paul Fry. Paul is the William Lampson Professor of English and is taught

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:13,840
at Yale since 1971. His primary areas of specialization are British Romanticism, the history of literary

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:21,440
criticism, contemporary literary theory and literature in relation to the visual arts. He is also an

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:31,920
award-winning author. Cynthia Panucci. Cynthia is the founder of ASCI, or ASCII, and is responsible

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,560
for creating much of the pioneering art science programming. She has a background in fine arts

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,360
and as a professional artist worked with printmaking, textiles, mixed media, and photography.

24
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,680
Daniel Groschkin is co-founder and executive director of GenSpace. He is also the founder

25
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,160
of the Bio Design Challenge. Daniel is a fellow at Data and Society. Additionally,

26
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,240
he has done journalistic work reporting on the intersection of biotechnology, culture,

27
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,800
and business for Bloomberg, Business Week, Scientific American, and other publications.

28
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,720
Ellen Levy. Ellen is a New York based artist and writer and a past president of the College

29
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:31,600
Art Association. With Patricia Olnick, she co-directs the New York based laser, which is Leonardo art

30
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:39,600
and science evening rendezvous, as I mentioned earlier. She was a special IDSVA advisor on the

31
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Arts and Sciences at the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the visual arts and has been a numerous

32
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:55,200
group and solo exhibitions have featured her art here and abroad, including at the National

33
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,560
Academy of Sciences, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the like. With that, let's begin the round table.

34
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,840
All right, thank you, Zach. So, the question on my mind right now is for Paul, and you can get us

35
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,400
started by maybe framing us a little bit, having been in education for 45 years. I'd love to hear

36
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,720
about how you think things have changed, your experience good or bad through changes and either

37
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,400
ideas about what the institutions want or ideas about what the students want.

38
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,840
Yes, thanks, Julia. That's a good sequence of questioning because it puts me in the role of

39
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:46,000
reporter, which I think is probably the safest role to have me in. Today, the effort to create

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,200
interactions between literary and science study is quite lively. In the academy, it certainly was

41
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:00,400
not when I began teaching. Today, I suppose the most visible, it's been mentioned already,

42
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,800
form of collaboration is ecological studies, which is a lively field in the literary world.

43
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,080
Ursula Heiser was mentioned earlier as one important figure in that field. There are also

44
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:25,760
quite serious efforts at the neurological understanding of aesthetics. Some years back,

45
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:33,360
there was a book of essays called Beauty and the Brain, which was interestingly experimental.

46
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,840
It showed, for example, that dogs and monkeys were as excited about the golden section as we are,

47
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:50,480
and that perhaps four reasons having to do with shelter theory, some of you may know Jay Appleton's

48
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:58,400
book, shelter theory. In any case, there have been efforts to understand the aesthetic, which

49
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,280
always seems somehow or another to be completely in agreement with Kant's aesthetics and how and

50
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,000
why the scientific approach to aesthetics gives you that result. I don't think I'm qualified to say,

51
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,560
but it's interesting. There are now also interesting neurological efforts to understand what was

52
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,920
earlier referred to as the importance of telling stories. Not so much the anthropological question,

53
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,960
why do we tell stories, but the neurological question, why do the stories take the shape that

54
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,440
they do? A person called Lisa Zunshin is well known in this field, and there are a number of other

55
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:46,800
people working in that field as well. There have been lots of efforts to correlate the relationship

56
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,280
between literary hermeneutics, the art and science of interpretation, something that interests me,

57
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,880
especially because I really simply think of myself as a teacher of interpretation. If I'm

58
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,720
either or transdisciplinary, it's plainly that one needs to interpret and about any undertaking one

59
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,200
can think of. But there are, there are, there have been efforts by Edie Hirsch and others

60
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,360
to make a correlation between hermeneutics and the scientific method in the argument,

61
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,000
under the umbrella of arguing that there's a kind of unified field theory of interpretation.

62
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,720
This is met with widespread skepticism, and I'd be interested to hear the views of many of you

63
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,880
on a subject of that sort. I certainly share the skepticism myself, and I think that it's partly

64
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:45,040
the skepticism we heard earlier about the scientific method itself that drives that, in large degree,

65
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,120
and but in any case, this is another field in which there's quite lively interest within

66
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,960
literary study. I think I should stop there for the moment and come back to other aspects of the

67
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,120
issue. I would only add that when somebody said recently that, well, you know, we're all the same

68
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:16,960
here. There's not much diversity in this group. I feel quite diverse. I, as our children say,

69
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:26,560
I suck at science, and I can't pretend otherwise, but I nevertheless do, at the abstract level,

70
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,040
take a lively interest in these things. It's really just the hands-on part of it I can't do. I

71
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,480
could never see anything in a microscope. I just, you know, I would look and I would see nothing,

72
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,520
and I would call the lab assistant over, and the lab assistant would say, look there, don't you see

73
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:48,560
those things crawling around? No, I don't see them. So this was a kind of visual inhibition on my

74
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,640
part, which I've never overcome. I suppose another remote qualification I have to be here is that I

75
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,760
do paint. I was an art major in college, and I seriously considered a career in painting,

76
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,240
but it's only been intermittent. I've done some exhibiting, but not much. So in effect, I think

77
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:13,120
I'm in the category of that person who dissected those frogs. And I also have a very different

78
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,360
attitude toward the kind of creativity that goes into my own painting, and the kind of creativity

79
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,360
that I admire in my literary studies. It would be very hard for me to talk about a bridge

80
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,440
really between those two activities. Yeah, it's interesting when we're talking about

81
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,280
integrating disciplines, but then we have to recognize and we have been doing this, you know,

82
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,760
that they're different. They feel different, and that's not a bad thing either. So,

83
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,960
Jill, I'd love to hear a bit from you about your experience in your class choreographing

84
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,040
genomics, because I think that'll also really set the stage for this theme.

85
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,840
Yeah, I'd love to share it. I just want to say thank you to you, Julia, and thank you to the

86
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Helix Center, and thank you to SciArt, because it's really been an amazing day, and yesterday

87
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:10,720
helping me to think about how I integrate art and science and all the discussions that have

88
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,120
been going on here. So in my class, choreographing genomics is what I'd like to focus on, and this

89
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,800
idea of this collaboration, but collaboration within each human being themselves. I've come to

90
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,680
feel today that really I need to describe myself as a scientist and an artist, and that that is

91
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,720
what I'm working to do with my students in the classroom, is to make sure that every student

92
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:46,960
is describing themselves as a scientist and an artist, and that they are not at odds with each

93
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,840
other, and I think that that's why we're all here because we recognize that they're not at odds

94
00:10:51,840 --> 00:11:00,080
with each other, and that the process of discovery in science is similar to the process of discovery

95
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:07,680
in the arts, and that allowing young adults, you know, 19-year-olds who are at that process of

96
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,800
discovery to discover in that way in the classroom and get joy out of discovery through art for

97
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:22,160
science, and science understanding is an important thing. So what I do in the class is to have the

98
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:30,960
students have two texts, one which is about art and postmodern dance called Terpsichore and Sneakers,

99
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:38,800
which describes to them a lot of what happened at Black Mountain College, and the process where

100
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:47,120
many postmodern dance choreographers were learning or thinking about moving out of the realm of

101
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,000
classical dance training in order to give the process of what is art, that process of art,

102
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,440
what is experiencing art, and allowing each student to recognize that their experience will help them

103
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:09,280
to experience the visual learning of science, because all true scientists are very visual thinkers,

104
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,400
kinesthetic thinkers, didactic thinkers, they're having all these different thinking processes

105
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,400
brought to the table. So to teach students in this forum, or we're talking about education,

106
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,520
I think that it's really important to allow students to learn through what's called VARC,

107
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,240
which is visual learning, auditory learning, reading and writing, and then kinesthetic process,

108
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,520
and so that the students are bringing all of those processes to the learning table. So they're

109
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,440
learning about these different postmodern choreographers, so they can learn about Ivan Reiner and

110
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,920
Merse Cunningham, and they know they can run, and they can jump, and they're all dancers, and all

111
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,560
these different choreographers, so they're learning all these things through the lens and voice of

112
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,400
Sally Baines, who wrote this amazing book, and then they're learning about DNA through somebody

113
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:06,720
who I don't particularly care for, but James Watson's book, where they get to learn even that lens of

114
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:14,480
somebody who speaks in such terrible words about people, and you see his lens, and you see his

115
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:23,200
racism and his sexism through his lens, but you do also get the brilliance of the DNA molecule and

116
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,600
information flow, and so that's the text they have for that, so they can see how you can have both

117
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,920
together, and we're talking about all of these things, and then they're bringing them to the

118
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:42,720
table to choreograph genome information flow, DNA to RNA to protein, and earlier today it was like,

119
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,600
what is the new icon, our iconic symbol, and it is DNA, and we talk about DNA as the heart of things,

120
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,480
people use it now in language, and the language of science and biology is often couched in language

121
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,600
of choreography and movement and motion and synergism, and all these words we use in science that are

122
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,080
also used in choreography, so the students are using all of this, bringing it to the table,

123
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:12,000
choreographing, and then picking genes on different chromosomes that associate with cancer and

124
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,760
exploring those in movement, and they all have to be the choreographer, they all use all the students

125
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:25,120
in the class as their dancers, and they all are being audience, so they're learning the active art,

126
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,520
art formation, art audience, science, conceptual, and I think that's a great way to teach, and I

127
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,520
think it's a great way to learn, and I was lucky enough to have it, and I try to give that to others.

128
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:46,240
Can I ask a question? You're saying that you're teaching, for example, DNA yields for RNA yields

129
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,200
protein, which was the mantra for many years, certainly when I was growing up, but no longer is.

130
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:01,440
Correct. So do you also update these series? So this class, in the class that I teach,

131
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,400
so this is Biology 175, the one that I'm telling you about, I teach many different levels, I also

132
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,480
teach PhD students, but in this class right now, I have people who, it's their first semester

133
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:20,320
in college, and so, you know, I may talk a little bit about microRNAs and all these other complex

134
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,320
things, but these students actually, just having them understand five prime to three prime, and

135
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:34,000
using their bodies to understand directionality and anti-parallel, and this old to central dogma,

136
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,560
it's enough kind of, you have to decide what you can add on when, when they walked into the class,

137
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,720
so you also have to deal with assessment in education, so when they walked into the class,

138
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,760
the first piece is to do assessment, and to assess, do they know the name of any gene?

139
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Do they know how many chromosomes would you have? Do they know how many nucleotides there are?

140
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,480
Do they know how many miles this would stretch for? And none of them knew any of this, okay?

141
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,080
So you begin with the assessment, and then have to take it from there, okay, now they know how

142
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,760
many chromosomes, they know many genes, they know what those products do, they know enzymatically

143
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:16,800
where activities are happening in the nucleus, and so, yes, a little, but this is a class to try to

144
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,280
help them determine what your major gonna be, and some of them are going to, they want to become,

145
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,720
they're going to theater, and they want to do puppetry, and others want to become chemistry

146
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,720
majors, and some want to become doctors, and so it's, it's to begin that vocabulary, so the person

147
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,080
who goes into puppetry, who's the one who actually made our flyer, who's so excited to share the

148
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,320
performance, it's taught in a black box theater, there are no deaths, there are no chairs, you know,

149
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,960
they're moving, but he's the most excited to share what they've learned in their final exam,

150
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,960
which is performance-based, so we can't do everything beyond where we were with Central Dogma at the

151
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,640
beginning, but I think it's a beginning of how do you set the stage as opposed to when students

152
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,200
come in and they take general biology, they think they're going to med school, and maybe they get

153
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:13,600
a C, and all of their dreams are squashed, and they're just like, what do I do? And this, and they've

154
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,360
sat in this classroom with 500 students in the back, really, on their phone half the time,

155
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,080
as opposed to in this classroom where their phone can't come out because they're moving,

156
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,320
and if they don't get five-prime to three-prime, they haven't joined hands with the right person,

157
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,280
and I'm asking them, where are you? Why'd you go there? So we can't do everything.

158
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,920
So what it sounds like for your class is that you're describing a dance class in the service of

159
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,880
teaching science, basic DNA science. Am I in misunderstanding? You are misunderstanding.

160
00:17:50,880 --> 00:18:00,000
This is not a dance class. This is a science class. The class is Biology 175, and it's utilizing

161
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,760
all different kinds of learning possibilities to teach people in many different ways. So they

162
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,840
have to come to class, having read two different chapters. They have to already understand, I'm not

163
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,240
going to stand there and tell them all the things that should have read in the text, so it's almost

164
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,880
of what we call a flipped classroom. So they have to have come in prepared to be ready to go where

165
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,600
they're supposed to go, and it's very evident if they don't understand the concepts where I can

166
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:38,320
help them, I can help them to feel it in their body, I can help them to articulate it with their

167
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,080
voice, because postmodern dance and performance art, you're articulating, so they're speaking,

168
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,400
they're moving, there are times I'll do a PowerPoint to show them the, like when we're dealing with

169
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,520
five prime and three prime and really getting them to understand the molecule and where the sugar is.

170
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,560
So they're also doing chemistry. Everything is there. They see the chemistry of the molecule,

171
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,200
they have to understand where the sugar is, the nucleotide is. So this is a beginning,

172
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,200
but I think it's a great beginning because much of our vocabulary and science now is based on the

173
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,040
genome. So it sets them up, the next semester they might be going to general biology or they're in

174
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:23,360
chemistry, it sets them up, but it is not dance. They don't have to point their toe, but they do

175
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:30,880
have to run, or maybe if they can't run, they have to sit and speak. Whatever's going to work,

176
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm just working for what will work. I would agree that this is an essential part of STEAM

177
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:46,080
education to bring these different things together, but it also reminds me in 2015,

178
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:54,880
I opened up The New York Times, and I read a fascinating article on trying to decipher the

179
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:04,320
Herculaneum scrolls. It couldn't be done. This was 2015, or some of it could be done, but not all of

180
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:13,440
it. A little bit later in the paper, there was another article about the connectome and some from

181
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:26,800
Columbia, his effort to decipher the neuronal connections in the brain. When you read the article

182
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:34,320
a little bit further, which realized is that they shared a common solution, but didn't really

183
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:46,240
realize it, which had to do with tomographic imaging, that they could unfurl the scrolls using

184
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:55,680
tomography without having to actually invasively destroy them. That was true also for the neurons.

185
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:02,320
So it would have been interesting if there had been somebody there representing STEAMs that,

186
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,680
what do you guys collaborate and see what happens? I love that idea. That's so funny.

187
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,360
I want to switch a little bit to STEAM outside of the classroom, because there is plenty of

188
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,040
that to go around. Harvey, do you want to start us off? Because you have a lot to say in this.

189
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:25,840
Sure. So just a little bit of background. I started off as a musician. I learned to read music before

190
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,640
English. I did a lot of sciences again, working in renal immunology. In college, I hung out with

191
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,920
a rougher crowd, so I did theater. And theater was my kind of core professional activity for the first

192
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:50,960
half of my career. I also kept a toehold in music, and when I became director of the Orpheus Chamber

193
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Orchestra, I had this opportunity to work with this amazing conductorless orchestra. And I became

194
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,040
really fascinated with how the orchestra did that, how they were able to perform that way. And that

195
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,440
actually led me into some broader questions. Not only about what could you learn about

196
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,920
collaboration from a conductorless orchestra, but more broadly, what can we learn from artistic

197
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,520
skills, processes, experiences, in what realms and what domains and how we could apply them.

198
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,640
And it was really growing out of that, and the things that I learned in doing all of that work

199
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,320
led me to believe that there were these, as we looked at the application of these things in

200
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,320
business and research and academia, that the world was filled with these really intractable and

201
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,280
wicked problems that were effectively failures of the imagination and failures of collaboration,

202
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,120
that the fault lines of those failures tended to be where the disciplines were a worn meeting,

203
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:56,800
and that there might be ways to work with the arts and with arts-based learning to help bridge

204
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:03,280
those gaps and begin to build new things in the space in between to use the phrase that's been

205
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,040
used a lot here today. So that led me to start the art of science learning. And with the art

206
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,160
of science learning, we've really done three kind of big things over the last decade. The first is

207
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,520
we've developed and we, because there are 40 artists involved with this, and there are artists

208
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:27,040
that are visual artists and sculptors and painters, poets, filmmakers, choreographers,

209
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,960
improv theater artists, other types of theater artists, musicians. So we work with lots and lots

210
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:40,640
of different ways that you can experience and explore the arts. We turn that all into a curriculum,

211
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:48,000
a curriculum that was really designed pretty much for anybody. So not for really little kids,

212
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,200
we have other things that we do with really little kids, but really from for adolescents

213
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,280
and adults from all kinds of different backgrounds and interests and approaches. And it focuses

214
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:06,320
on how you can use the arts to help you learn and help you become an innovator and innovating

215
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,600
in many, many different domains. So we kind of built that body of work and those best practices

216
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,880
that this is as we were able to find them and put them together in a curriculum. The second thing is

217
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,480
we realize of course that we've designed a curriculum for which no institutions existed that can ever

218
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:33,200
be taught. So we essentially spent several years creating a large work around as a model. And that

219
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,800
took the form of incubators for innovation, which we set up in a number of cities around the country

220
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,040
in partnership with museums and other kinds of informal learning centers. We brought together

221
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,400
hundreds of people, artists and scientists and business leaders and researchers and high school

222
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,840
students, college students and so forth. And working around specific STEM challenges, exploring them

223
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:04,080
through the arts and through arts based learning and then innovating and actually developing new

224
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:12,080
ideas into products, processes, services, curriculum to address civic challenges like water resources

225
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:21,520
and urban nutrition and transportation alternatives. And then the third thing that we did is we kind

226
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:30,880
of focused a lot on impact and data because we had a strong sense that for all the power that we've

227
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,640
all experienced at this intersection of art science and learning, we have relatively little

228
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,520
proof that we impact it and so that it was important to try to address that. So we've kind of spent

229
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:52,080
this these years working outside the formal education system, but I think increasingly coming up with

230
00:25:52,080 --> 00:26:01,120
things that are impacting and creating opportunities. I feel like you have some good input here about

231
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,240
outside of the classroom or growing from the classroom out into the real world. So let me tell

232
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:14,880
you about my background before I jump into it. I'm sorry, your mic's not on. Can you hear me now

233
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,960
better? Yeah, sure. All right, I'll just keep my finger here and it'll make me look very intelligent.

234
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:32,240
So my background is as a journalist. I neither have a degree in the sciences nor particularly in

235
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:41,520
the arts. I fell into it because as a journalist I found that access to the sciences specifically

236
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,280
biotech was incredibly hard once you left the university setting. Meaning I was reporting on

237
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,520
all these wonderful scientists and all the wonderful work they were doing and the second that I wanted

238
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,160
to actually try any of the work that they did themselves, it became immediately clear that it

239
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,960
would take me another decade to get back into the lab and actually try anything of my own. And that

240
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:08,000
was not acceptable to me personally. And so lo and behold we created something called GenSpace

241
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,880
which is the first community biology lab where anyone regardless of background, regardless of

242
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,240
you know what stage of life they're in and what you know what they're doing with their time can

243
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:27,040
come into our space and do at least their first genetic transformation and then move on from there

244
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:34,960
to more sophisticated things like CRISPR or we're about to offer a grow your own lamp using my

245
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:45,120
celium. So you know historically for me and I've been doing this for the last 10 years I haven't been

246
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,360
sort of addressing these issues within the institution. It was only later that we created the bio

247
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:58,480
design challenge and that's largely because artists and designers were finding their way to us. Being

248
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,760
New York based that shouldn't be a surprise but it was and what they were looking to do with use

249
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:11,360
our space as a platform for them to explore the technology. And as someone as a science journalist

250
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,520
who wasn't you know didn't know much about the practice it became very clear that they were

251
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,080
contributing something very very important to the dialogue that was going in on our lab

252
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,520
and I actually think contributing something very important to a larger dialogue about

253
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,800
what this technology what this science actually means for us as a society. So they were asking

254
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,960
well what can I do with this stuff and how will it affect the future of us as a civic society,

255
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,320
us as individuals, us as a collective. And these questions were really really important to me.

256
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,880
So one of the things that I haven't heard today was anything about social justice environmental

257
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:00,880
justice and it has surprised me and I think largely this collaboration these are the things

258
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:07,600
that will unfurl uncover sorry going back to being intelligent. Will unfurl and uncover

259
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:16,240
some of the challenges in social and environmental justice. To make a long story short we created

260
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,600
a program called the bio design challenge where we took classrooms of artists and designers we

261
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,520
partnered them with biologists who would act as kind of guides and mentors offering up office

262
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,600
hours and we asked them to imagine the future and what is the future of biotechnology look like

263
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,080
out in the world. How would you use some of the papers that you've read some of the

264
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,040
new advances in research how would that actually turn out in our society how would that turn out

265
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:52,960
in the products that we use. And the students then were able to either innovate and show us some

266
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,600
amazing visions but also critique and that became very important and so for the last three years

267
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,480
we've had these students on stage at MoMA presenting their ideas and as much as they are a celebration

268
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,760
of the learning of the science through this novel means it's also a critique of the of what happened

269
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:20,800
when you take science and technology and you cross it with capitalism and I think that's actually where

270
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:30,960
where the the power of this begins for me personally. I want to go back to the classroom but first.

271
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,320
Well my background is as a fine artist you know we often have to have a day job to support our

272
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:48,960
art habits so for 10 years as an artist in New York before I started ASCII I worked with kids

273
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:56,160
in community settings so I did a quilt project with pregnant teenage girls with a theme of

274
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:03,440
your hopes and fears of being a pregnant teenager. I did environmental murals with kids at a

275
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:12,720
religious after school project where you know it was about they got down on the floor and they put

276
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:20,400
their bodies and traced around their bodies and then those paper patterns went into the big 13 foot

277
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:28,320
by 8 foot mural but through working with kids in children's museum settings and designing art

278
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:40,080
workshops and and also interactive sculpture where kids could could accessorize with pattern texture

279
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,400
and form so interactivity became important to me and going into science museums and seeing how

280
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,520
kids were like pretty much programmed to be pressing pressing buttons and I didn't see that they were

281
00:31:51,520 --> 00:32:02,720
getting very much out of that in terms of learning. So I just personally became involved in ocean

282
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:10,880
conservation from my first snorkeling experience in 98 and when I learned you know that they before

283
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,640
we could go down in the water they said you can't touch the reef because there's a protective film

284
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:23,280
and it will kill the reef gradually. Anyway I started to get I just read all I could on the internet.

285
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,320
I started to realize that when you when I saw this fantastic agoracal setting with all these

286
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,040
fishes and then I and then we got out of the boat and he said well you know two-thirds of the ocean

287
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:43,680
reefs are dead or endangered and I thought I was like outraged like I didn't know that and I couldn't

288
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:50,480
figure out well why in our society I watch National Geographic and like all of you do and I couldn't

289
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,720
figure out you know why why didn't really know but so I started studying about well so what is the

290
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:04,080
significance of artificial reefs why should we care? Well now my passion is ecology because I've

291
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,760
learned that the phytoplankton floating around in the global ocean is responsible for 80 percent of

292
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,320
the oxygen that we breathe and all the fresh water that grows our plants and that we drink and so my

293
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:27,520
my pursuit has has kind of gone along this path so I took my interest to NOAA in Washington DC and

294
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,960
I had this project that would was about the ocean health of the ocean and there was a photography

295
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,640
project and a fashion project and all these different components and they said well where's your

296
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:46,320
where's your youth education project and I hadn't done that so I went back to the drawing boards and

297
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:58,720
I a year later I came up with this project about collapsing ocean fisheries and there so I reached

298
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:10,960
out to the oceanography community and got people from the Southeast Asian countries and the Philippines

299
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:21,360
and other countries to put their children together on a blog and to be talking about for instance in

300
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:29,520
the Philippines children often can't go to school anymore because they have to take all day fishing

301
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:40,160
to catch minnow size fish because the industry size fishing industry from the Baltic countries

302
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:46,800
that is totally subsidized by their governments comes in to the Philippines and you know raids all

303
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,560
of the endemic fish that they can give their hands on so anyway well so friends were telling me

304
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,800
Cynthia don't do a project about collapsing fisheries with kids that are eight nine and ten

305
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,280
what do they care about fish so you know I don't really normally listen to people so I kind of

306
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:13,040
went on with this project but something amazing happened the project was with fourth graders at

307
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:20,640
a school in Chinatown because the principal was a very advanced adventuresome principal and she

308
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:32,720
took it on so we so we had these children blogging to these other countries and they were they were

309
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:41,120
either acting or speaking for the fish like don't throw dynamite on my reef because you know they're

310
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:46,240
going to kill me and you're going to destroy the whole reef as well which is what they do in Malaysia

311
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:56,160
so and then so the kids were to speak to give voice to the fish and also to give voice to the

312
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,880
children in the other countries that were the people their parents were having to move away

313
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,560
from the shoreline because there were no more fish so they had to go and do agricultural things

314
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:14,560
well anyway it's it started me on this whole journey and when it was over we had this blog

315
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:23,440
conversation that was supported by this Philippine ocean management fishery management

316
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,720
organization and it was online and it wasn't live but the questions were posed

317
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:38,000
so in the end I hired a choreographer and I made these fish cutouts as just

318
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,960
Objes dart that the students would the choreographer just designed this movement

319
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,600
some were ocean and chobis some were sea bass so there was a movement and then the music stopped

320
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:57,920
and the kids would go to the microphone one at a time and they would do this monologue that came

321
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,680
out of the blog that happened so there was a performance that was sponsored by the United

322
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:11,840
Nations environment program for the world environment day in 2007 and at the end of this wonderful

323
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:19,520
little performance that the kids did they ran up to me and they said well we have to write a

324
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,920
letter to the president doesn't he know what's going on this was George Bush's administration

325
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:35,120
but it's I had never talked to them anything politically I showed them a picture of this

326
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:42,480
the young children in the Philippines on stilts fishing and I told them that they you know these

327
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,800
kids could not go to school anymore well I didn't realize of kids that I was working with in Chinatown

328
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:55,280
you know that that culture is very interested in education so much so that that's the most

329
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:04,480
important thing to them and these kids were coming up with these concerns like the children in the

330
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:11,280
Philippines need to be able to go to school you know anyway it was a totally in terms of outcomes

331
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:19,600
of projects I had kind of created framework but I had no idea that these children would have been

332
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:27,680
had a reaction but it was of empathy I think for their fellow fellows in a different part of the country

333
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,320
kind of we've touched upon this before but when you give people the opportunity to have a kind of

334
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,560
cross-disciplinary experience whether they know they're having it or not there's this kind of thrill

335
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,160
which which is it you know relayed at the end and because students are wide-eyed that's that's

336
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,120
why they're wonderful they're open to learning so I just wanted to point out we have kind of

337
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:55,200
independent artist nonprofit academia nonprofit academia nonprofit academia slash nonprofit

338
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,960
how do we enact steam across these platforms what's easy for you and what's hard for you

339
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,320
first of all I think that there are many more opportunities for art science

340
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:21,120
insights and maybe in terms of teaching what's important is to not only draw connections

341
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:33,280
but think how you could impart it I spoke with a woman who is an educator Susan I believe it's

342
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:43,040
where she said Hogarth and what is word that that's her name and she told me something very

343
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:54,000
interesting many of you probably realize that both Golgi and Kahal received a Nobel Prize together

344
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:01,440
but what I had not realized until I spoke with her was that they both used the same staining method

345
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:12,720
and Kahal came up with Noron theory whereas Golgi came up with a theory that was I think it was

346
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:20,720
called a particular theory it was discarded and considered incorrect and what she looked at

347
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:29,840
with her class were the differences even using the same methodology which allowed one to see

348
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:35,760
something differently from the other this had to do with looking through the microscope

349
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:46,720
adjusting it using extra resources after applying stains evidently Kahal went and used various

350
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:55,040
kinds of pigments and coloring on it to bring out certain characteristics then this is just one

351
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:02,720
this is the tip of the iceberg another really prevalent thing is it wasn't just Galileo who

352
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:12,320
looked through telescope I mean this happened in at the same year with a man from England named

353
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:21,520
Hinton but what allowed Galileo to see this was his fine arts education and his relationship

354
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:32,320
with an man named Chiggling so I think then in terms of teaching having symposium these extra

355
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:41,280
things need to be brought out where you have creativity on the part of two people and yet

356
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:49,840
one is able to make even further observations this is something all of you here can use

357
00:41:49,840 --> 00:42:00,720
in your teaching and your communication with others well the future of education is part of our

358
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:07,760
topic and I suppose I should say that another thing I do is co-chair something called the

359
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,640
started as the Yale New Haven Teachers Institute and now it's a national program called Yale

360
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:22,960
National Initiative for public school teachers K through 12 in underrepresented schools in collaboration

361
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:32,400
with university faculty who teach content based seminars for those public school teachers and

362
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:41,040
what's of interest perhaps in our context is the question how to approach the trans and

363
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,080
interdisciplinary in this setting because of course as other people have said speaking of

364
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:56,240
school teaching one is beset by codes and standards and above all by test scores and which is still

365
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,960
for us as for others who have spoken the only available form of evaluation that convinces funders

366
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:12,640
so there's a lot that one's up against here but a lot of us have nevertheless I've talked 15 of

367
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:22,480
these seminars and a lot of us have experimented with with tiptoeing around the interdisciplinary

368
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:29,040
they write long curriculum units as opposed to lesson plans so that it's partly an exercise in

369
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:41,120
brushing off their prose and so I for example teach seminars sometimes concerning poems on pictures

370
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:49,360
and introduce the idea that actually visual arts and verbal arts have rival agendas and in some

371
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:56,800
ways envy each other and that there's a kind of a dramatic force field that run encounters in an

372
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:05,520
eight-phrastic poem as they're called and I try to interest teachers who are English teachers or in

373
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:12,400
some cases art teachers in the possibility of thinking within the humanities of a variety of

374
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:20,800
disciplines and it's in that way that we feel we can approach the problem even for the K through 12

375
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:31,520
teachers whose lives are so scripted and regimented as as we all know it's a it's a small step as we

376
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:39,680
say on the moon but it is something at least we can do to enliven the prospect of teaching for

377
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,040
public school teachers in the future if I could just hold the floor for another minute to talk about

378
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,680
um something I do myself as a undergraduate graduate teacher teaches seminar quite often called

379
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:00,560
defenses of poetry which once again has to do with the rival read among disciplines you know Plato

380
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:09,200
in the tenth book of the republic unceremoniously banished the poets from his ideal republic and

381
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:17,760
based his whole argument in favor of a just life under the philosopher king on the idea that poets

382
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,120
really have no idea what they're talking about they live in a state of delusion three times removed

383
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:30,160
from reality and much as we like them we simply can't afford to have them in our ideal republic and

384
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:37,280
so we begin with a text like this and then we go on attempting to find ways to rehabilitate

385
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:46,560
uh poetry uh and and bring it back into even a republic that has um ambitions something like those

386
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:54,160
of Plato uh to me the high watermark um in this effort uh is a wonderful text by Shelley the

387
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:01,600
ronatic poet Shelley called a defense of poetry and Shelley argues in the defense of poetry that

388
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:09,440
science in its imaginative moment just is poetry in other words he commandeers the entire field of

389
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:18,400
thought for poetry understood as the capacity to metaphorize uh he then argues that metaphor

390
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:25,360
degenerates into equation or law or whatever it might be in the field and always needs the

391
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:32,080
resuscitation of rethinking so that um he believed for example that the americans revised their

392
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:37,600
constitution every five years i mean who you know he liked the americans uh naturally they

393
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:43,280
must revise their constitution every five years otherwise to live under law would be intolerable

394
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:51,520
because law in other words perpetually needs to be rethought as metaphor uh so this is a good

395
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:58,160
instance of a unified field approach uh to the disciplines which is which which i celebrate in

396
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:04,480
this in this setting quasi facetiously because we all know the problems with an argument of this kind

397
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,120
but it's nevertheless it seems to me in some ways an exhilarating one

398
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:17,120
Matthew Arnold then gives the whole show away he says science is true but it's also hateful

399
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:24,800
Darwin has told us that we are no longer the signisher of the universe we're descended from some

400
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:32,400
horrible arboreal creature with prehensile paws uh you know and and and and how can we possibly live

401
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,480
with this well says Arnold what we need is poetry which tells us pleasing lies right i mean i'm

402
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:45,040
boiling the argument down but as you can see everything Shelley won Arnold gave away in other

403
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:52,000
words this is in a nutshell uh the drama that i try to communicate in a course of this kind

404
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,520
and of course it tells you nothing about science and in fact in that setting precious little about

405
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:05,280
poetry uh but it does it does uh oblige you to rethink the questions of the relation among the

406
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,560
disciplines and i and we do spend a lot of time in this setting thinking about that sorry to

407
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:22,320
have kept you so long so if if we're actually gonna translate steam uh i actually have always hated

408
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:28,000
that but i and i fought it for i think we can all agree on that if we fought it for a long time but

409
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,640
i've actually decided you know it's out there let's just go with it so okay so um the word yeah yeah

410
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:42,000
so if if um if we're actually going to translate it from the not-for-profit from the informal learning

411
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,120
into the formal system um we're going to have to tackle this question of of how we measure impact

412
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:56,240
and i think that if we stick to the traditional measures we're kind of missing the point and

413
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:02,160
playing out of losing playing field you also not just how to measure the impact but define what

414
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,480
well yes i was just going there so in order in order to measure at first we have to define what

415
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:13,680
we mean by it and what it is that we're trying to impact so we have all of these wonderful 21st

416
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:21,200
century learning standards and we all think that collaboration is really important um we don't

417
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:29,120
really measure that very much um we don't integrate that very much into how we think about these things

418
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:35,280
and yet we now have actual data that proves that relatively small amounts of art space learning

419
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:46,080
leads directly to better collaboration among both adolescents and adult scientists um we think

420
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:52,720
that creative thinking is really important we don't always know how we want to define that but um

421
00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:01,120
um we have good data that we've developed that shows that art space learning actually impacts

422
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:06,800
specific creative thinking skills ranging from the ability to generate ideas to the ability to

423
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:14,240
form heuristics we think that innovation is very important but we don't actually focus on that

424
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,120
and yet there are two we have powerful compelling data now and more being developed all the time

425
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:29,760
uh that shows the direct impact of art space learning on the innovation outcomes of teams so

426
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:42,680
I think that there's a real opportunity there to work across the the not-for-profit world the K12

427
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:49,480
world and also to work across art and science because after all if we're actually going to

428
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:55,080
to change things and move the needle on how we think about this we need compelling narratives

429
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:01,800
and compelling data we actually have what it takes to do both of those but without the application

430
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,680
of that to to these questions we're going to be spinning on the margins of a system which is

431
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:12,040
designed to drive other outcomes altogether which are actually as we all know not the outcomes

432
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:19,800
that we want to be driving as a society can can i can we step a little bit back because I think

433
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:26,920
we all have different perspectives here what is the positive benefit of steam from your perspective

434
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:32,040
meaning you're you're talking about all the ways in which it makes us better collaborators more

435
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,360
creative more innovative that would be goals for you but I think all of us have different

436
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:41,880
understandings of what that might what those goals might be yeah absolutely and and I only spoke

437
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:48,440
about a few of them for me and ones that I happen to have some data on but I think that they're a

438
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:55,880
pretty broad and rich set of things that can be accomplished through steam I like to give an

439
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:09,880
example more exact you mentioned things before but they weren't really examples that one could or I could put my yeah so

440
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:16,680
and I'm grappling for what will be a helpful type of example when you say an example an example of

441
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:26,760
an example of what the collaboration led to yeah okay sure could not have happened without it yeah so in

442
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:33,720
in our project we brought together 28 teams of people these people were artists there were

443
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:39,240
scientists they were students they were researchers people from very very different kinds of backgrounds

444
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:46,840
they worked together for a year and in these on these projects which they selected themselves in broad

445
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:56,680
challenge areas they developed things that I cannot imagine have coming out of any other

446
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:05,080
process things that were really strikingly original social innovations we had a we had a team that

447
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:13,240
that started out trying to reinvent the technology behind how people pay for transportation but ended up

448
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:22,600
with a novel social innovation and sharing economy innovation that has led today to a thriving

449
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:29,400
nonprofit which has people going to work for nonprofits banking their hours converting them into bus passes

450
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:38,760
being sponsored and sending about 500 rather 5,000 immigrants to their first job interviews so I mean

451
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:44,040
these things are coming out in in in lots of different domains they would not have happened if they hadn't

452
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,560
been artists and scientists and students and business leaders people from coming from very different

453
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:56,120
perspectives and using the arts as a common language and a set of tools to help them collaborate and

454
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:04,840
generate ideas and develop them. I'd like to talk about what what it means to me and what I think

455
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:12,760
how it can impact learning and so this morning there was this this term steamy and how steamy

456
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:22,280
you know steamy has a much more kind of rich thought for for young people like the kids saying wow

457
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:29,960
that's so steamy so when you think about how it can affect yeah it's hot you know that's like it's

458
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:41,800
lit it is so when you think about how arts transpires and it hits everybody and and just you can use

459
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:51,320
it as a way to empower all the learners just for an example from from my perspective when I was in

460
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:57,480
college even when I started to know I was a scientist I would not tell people I would always say I was a

461
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,640
dancer and even when I was going for my PhD I would go to parties and I would say I was a dancer

462
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:09,800
so and so now I now then I got to a place where I don't always say I was a scientist but now in

463
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:15,720
both the scientists in a dancer and the point is that I think steam this idea of putting it all

464
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:22,920
together allows you to reach audiences you ask this question about social justice and and dealing

465
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:31,400
with steam as a mechanism to affect social justice to be able to diversify the people that you can

466
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:39,880
speak to about science to allow science to be accessible to the broader public because the broader

467
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:46,440
public often when you begin to speak about science becomes glassy I we talked about elitism so in

468
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:52,520
an elite audience of this type here yes science seems so big and wonderful but in your normal

469
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:58,360
walk a day world you want to do a party and you talk about being a scientist this is my world

470
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:05,880
you know my family I don't speak about my work with my family I can speak about dance I can see

471
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:12,760
so you need to be able to have these conversations and to have young people it's not just students

472
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:18,840
these students are the the future scientists and to have them think something is steamy

473
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:24,520
and them to be able to make the new discoveries because it is young minds that make the new

474
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:30,760
discoveries it is young minds that shift paradigms it is young minds who are able to think differently

475
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,000
just as you're talking about staining something differently seeing something differently being

476
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,960
able to open their minds and not be lost in the paradigms we have now but be able to have paradigm

477
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:47,720
shifts because they see things differently and I think that steamy will allow us to affect those

478
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:53,320
kind of paradigm shifts and it's important to be able for people to not see things in this

479
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:58,440
didactic way that we approach science and that is the beauty of this putting together a part in

480
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:05,960
science that takes us past this didactic approach I'd like to also take it from there to point out

481
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:14,440
that we've had some new programs developing and there's some examples here one that particularly

482
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:24,280
impressed me was and was mentioned earlier was David Edwards program in in Boston I think he

483
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:34,600
injected it now 100k for high school students and I was part of the group of people who were

484
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:45,880
brainstorming about neuroscience and art there was the use they these high school students

485
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:56,200
after hearing 30 different ideas selected what excited them and what motivated them to develop

486
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:03,960
a project they were given a technologist to work with they were given an artist to work with and

487
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:12,360
these are people who when I first met them were for the most part fairly in articulate at the end

488
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:19,800
of six months they were so articulate they were excited they could develop a budget that could

489
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:29,080
support what they wanted to do I thought it was really quite a transformation and it's not anywhere

490
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:37,480
on that scale but these lasers that have developed they're all over now they're in other countries

491
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:48,360
Patricia Olinik who you heard before and I set this up late in 2008 when it wasn't officially

492
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:56,040
called a laser and we've had people every five or six weeks except for during the summer months

493
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:04,600
since then three and four people present their ideas and the beauty of it is not just that it's

494
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:12,600
largely unscripted which is true here also which is really quite wonderful but that at the end of

495
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:20,600
it we put these people together to talk and see what themes emerge from sometimes quite disparate

496
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:30,280
approaches and that's really where the excitement for me is is seeing how a theme and understanding

497
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:38,200
can emerge that had not been there before and I would say this is true of everyone here talking

498
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:46,520
about their programs both in this group and also in the earlier groups so I think that's what we're

499
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:54,840
trying to get at I think it's kind of ironic that in our culture here in this country you have to

500
00:59:54,840 --> 01:00:02,120
sneak up on citizens when you talk about science I mean you can't just be blatant about it I can't

501
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:08,920
with my family either and then you know science is heavily funded of course scientists wouldn't say

502
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:17,480
so but art is totally almost not funded so here we have two groups you know the underappreciated

503
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:27,160
and the underfunded but you know somehow we got from our whatever I love for art and science so

504
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:37,080
how do we put these together in ways that really relate to the the student the young person so

505
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:43,960
so that they're turned on and they ask questions to me that's the most important thing is how do

506
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:50,120
you turn on the brain how do you provoke the questioning mind because the answers are all out

507
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:56,040
there you just look on your phone pretty much so that's what's so exciting in in the impacts that

508
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:02,040
we've seen the data that we've developed and that we've studied it has this tremendous capacity to

509
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:09,240
spark engagement curiosity enthusiasm a sense of optimism about learning a sense of agency and that

510
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:15,240
you can apply things that you learn in your own life and and and change the world around you

511
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:27,320
impact it we we're dealing with educational systems that by and large are not set up or designed

512
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:35,640
to do those things so something that you said that you do the seminars with teachers so maybe

513
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:45,160
we should reach out and do short term or summer session for teachers teaching the teachers so

514
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:50,840
because then they can if they fall in love with the teachers need the space to do it in so some

515
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:56,840
some schools are doing that already I'm blanking on the school it might be fisc but we published

516
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:03,160
about them in August and yeah they host sessions about how to teach in a more steam-like manner

517
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:08,120
for teachers and where they hosted they hosted it in the school's gallery because I don't know if

518
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:15,480
there's room there and it's nice to be in a gallery um so uh we're gonna open it up for questions now

519
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:23,800
right after Ed asks a question if I understand it if I understand it correctly

520
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:35,400
uh if you have somebody who is going to go into a lab and study the microtubules inside the neuron

521
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:46,280
the advantage of that person having gone through steam education during his

522
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:57,480
whole education period is that that person would hopefully look at the problem in a different way

523
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:06,040
more enriched way than if somebody hadn't gone through that education is that the claim that is

524
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:12,760
one of them yes and they'll think out of the box creatively because they don't have these

525
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:21,640
preconceived ideas of what the outcome should be I think well partly what we're describing is the

526
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:28,120
societal need for people who are both fluent in both and I'm going to add design to this as well

527
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:39,240
because it's an important one yes so design as well as the technology what or the science

528
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:48,680
whatever it is uh for for several reasons one reason is simply that when scientists do their work

529
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:54,760
they are particularly focused on what is going on in the mechanisms under the microscope or whatever

530
01:03:54,760 --> 01:04:01,960
it is um when the designer takes that finding or works with that finding they're thinking about

531
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:07,400
the people who are going to use that in their daily lives and so they're acting almost as a

532
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:14,200
translator of the science that's being discovered into the product that will eventually be the

533
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:21,400
whatever it is we use and I think that person needs to be able to understand both what the

534
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,120
scientist is talking about understand the technology itself and then be able to understand people's

535
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:35,240
desires and so there needs to be that translational role in society I don't know about the internals

536
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:40,520
of apple but I will say that you know what we're trying to do is we're trying to create a generation

537
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:48,280
of bio designers which are people who are fluent in the language of design and also at the same time

538
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:53,880
can speak to a scientist and understand what they're saying and the hope just like now we have in

539
01:04:53,880 --> 01:05:01,640
computing groups of designers who are working on things that uh basically designing with with

540
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:07,000
computation there will be a time in the near future probably already happening now we just

541
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,560
don't identify it as such people who are designing with biotechnology with biology you know when we

542
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:19,640
think about GMOs you know you know Monsanto crops and things like that these are bio designs these

543
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:27,240
are designs to be used in the context of human civilization human uh the human endeavor human

544
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:32,600
experiments well I hope they're not doing human experiment well they are well that's what Monsanto

545
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:39,240
is all about well fair enough anyway my point is that if you have a generation of designers who are

546
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:44,120
fluent in that language but also into in the social understand the social context hopefully

547
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:50,200
we'll avoid some of the environmental maybe humanitarian catastrophes that we've had in the past

548
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:57,080
hello I'm Len Steinbeck I teach in the museum graduate program at Johns Hopkins

549
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,600
I will do terminology has come up if popped up a few times yesterday and today and I was wondering

550
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:09,720
if you could share what you know about neurological plasticity and the thinking and ways of thinking

551
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:18,120
that benefit scientists and artists and whether these have these projects have any

552
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:30,280
lasting effect to your knowledge I can talk oh please um I was going to say that plasticity

553
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:38,200
appears to be a proven fact that this there is development that it's ongoing but that's not what

554
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:44,920
you really are asking is it I want to apply it and I want to apply it in both directions because

555
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:52,360
for a moment before it seemed like you were talking about um there's science artists impacting science

556
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:57,880
or science impacting artists one way or the other and not as mutually as I hope the conversation

557
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:05,160
would go especially when you talk about certain outcomes but so but I am interested in knowing

558
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:13,720
what we might know about how an intensive artistic orientation new to a scientist and you

559
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:21,480
scientific orientation to an artist changes in a lasting manner the way they see the world

560
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:28,600
there's a wonderful there's several wonderful books but one I particularly liked is by Warren

561
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:37,960
Nieden who is both an artist and an ophthalmologist it was written in 2003 and was devoted to how

562
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:47,320
an art for namely the cinema was sculpting people's brains and I think it's a very compelling

563
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:55,160
um explanation of work by people like Gerald Ailman yes and I know there there is a lot of work done

564
01:07:55,160 --> 01:08:03,480
about art in the brain more ternering or kind of many have but I'm interested in what science does

565
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:09,800
with the art oriented brain and what art does with a science oriented brain or my being too specific

566
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:14,680
and please will read the tell me because I'm not well I can only comment a little bit on one side

567
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:23,560
of that and that is that um I don't know if you know the late James Catarols work at all um but

568
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:31,960
but he he did a did a meta study that looked at I think it was 40 neuro imaging studies over a

569
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:40,280
long period of time and he found a lot of shared neural substrates between artistic process experience

570
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:49,320
and empathy actually to come back to there's that work is incomplete but um there's certainly

571
01:08:49,320 --> 01:09:00,520
some strong suggestions of things there um can I just say um one influence of um art on science is

572
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:08,920
Ned Seaman who's at NYU um he is known as the grandfather of DNA nanotechnology he came up with

573
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:18,600
the idea because he loves art and collects art and it was MC Escher's work and tiling that gave him

574
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:29,880
the idea for his whole field of DNA nanotechnology so I mean there I'm I think Leonardo is starting

575
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:37,400
to collect these exemplars and I think we could really benefit our field by having a compilat

576
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:44,600
compilation such an example I've been hugely impressed by the number of stunning examples of

577
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,640
collaborative success I've been hearing about in the last day and a half

578
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:57,080
uh and still perhaps a little skeptical about how they translate into the classroom it's the the

579
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:05,960
uh uh what we're what we're talking about is the um uh mutual insemination of great scientists and

580
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:13,480
great artists or at least very good scientists and very good artists and uh the uh and in the

581
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:19,960
future of education this has to give us uh an optimistic sense that more of this kind of thing

582
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:28,440
if possible perhaps uh not quite at such an advanced level uh but but but still I mean the way the

583
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:35,400
the instances of these sorts of success that you all have given is extremely impressive to an

584
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:40,680
outsider I just want to say that well it's uh I'm glad you brought that up because I just want to

585
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:47,640
note before we move on to the next question steam officially starred in 2008 all of us in this

586
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:54,920
room found it before then on our own whatever we called it um it's it's only been nine years you

587
01:10:54,920 --> 01:11:01,320
know for a movement that's that's pretty short right so we are now educating the people that in

588
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:06,920
ten years will be getting those jobs that will start dictating different things that will happen

589
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:14,200
in institutions so so it's a bit of a a long uh study in terms of what's working right but but I

590
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:23,160
think uh there are already a lot of good stories hi my name is Jessica Beals I'm an artist from

591
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:32,840
Washington DC um I work primarily with themes related to science and math um but I'm particularly

592
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:38,200
interested in one aspect of this particular discussion today I'm related to education because

593
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:45,160
um I was I was once and I for the last four years have been invited to bring an interactive art

594
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:51,000
project I have to an annual summer institute for teachers at the Washington International School

595
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,480
where they're focusing on teaching for global learning so not so much about science or art

596
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:01,080
specifically but um they brought my project in which is a language-based interactive project with

597
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:08,520
rocks um about identity and community building just as a diversion mostly for the teachers to have

598
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:15,960
something to um do in between sessions and explore whatever was sparked by my project and of course I

599
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:22,440
had an underhanded idea about what I was going to do when they turned into my my space um and I

600
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:26,040
would have conversations with these teachers about what my work wasn't what they thought it was and

601
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:30,600
if they were told it was an art project in the gallery and they were welcome to look at it they

602
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:35,800
go oh this is interesting um can I touch it can I do anything with it and say of course it's interactive

603
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:40,680
do whatever you want with it and then tell me what you think about what you're doing um and they

604
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,680
would go oh wow this is really interesting it's bringing out memories and I'm interacting and

605
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:48,360
what's this thing there's sort of a seesaw over here what am I supposed to do with that and I'd say

606
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:53,080
way out way out the rocks way out the words on both sides tell me what you think see see what

607
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:58,440
happens I was encouraging teachers to explore using a scientific method on a very basic level

608
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:04,520
um language and another level interact with each other and they're just doesn't really feel like an

609
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:09,000
art project anymore and I'd say well it isn't they just decided to call it an art project because

610
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,360
it's a diversion um it's actually there's a lot of science here when I use this with kids I'm

611
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:20,040
teaching them about levers um it's a way to to edge into to physics without telling them that

612
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:24,840
that's what it is because they might be afraid of it so one of the things that is sparked in me

613
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:29,000
with all these conversations is that we keep on talking about artists and scientists and how we

614
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,720
have to bring them together as though they're intrinsically separate things and steam itself

615
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:38,200
is just an expression of the fact that we're all doing all these things all the time and

616
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:43,000
and our institutions perhaps have separated us um unnecessarily and we're just trying to figure

617
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,320
out how to get back to where we all are which is we're all doing all these things all the time we

618
01:13:47,320 --> 01:14:00,680
just have to stop being afraid to do them at the same time amen to that um that was actually

619
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:07,320
going to be exactly what I wanted to say was that thank you it was it was good to comment on that

620
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:14,360
because I mean to please invite you to comment on that because we we are saying art and science and

621
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:22,920
when you say that you bring a lot with you like you bring a lot of um generalities scientists do

622
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:30,120
this and artists do this and we think like this and they think like that and um you know in science

623
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:34,360
communication we it's you know we're trying to we there are a lot of great conversations about this

624
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:41,080
like we're trying to give you something and and tell and like you you know you must take this in and

625
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:51,640
um what this whole thing is about is really opening your mind to um allowing whatever insights are

626
01:14:51,640 --> 01:15:00,040
are being sparked by either seeing science and art and things like that um and the fact that you

627
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:07,160
know there's like all this um fractal consequence that you never really know what the impact of what

628
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:19,240
you show someone or tell someone or um give someone uh will be and so I um I was just hoping you could

629
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:24,520
comment on exactly what she was saying you know in this as we're trying to build a future of

630
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:31,080
education calling it science and calling it art um to start with as opposed to just saying we're

631
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:41,240
learning about inquiry um and what all can you you know you as an individual now that you have

632
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:48,040
made insights and connections what can you bring to this um something that has been in my did anyone

633
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:53,480
else ought to see of the mind is ought to see of the mind something that was so that is exactly

634
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:57,640
what I've been thinking about all day you know because that's a kind of an area where

635
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:04,440
in terms of what you want out of a collaboration maybe it's not an end goal or product maybe it's

636
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:11,720
just to to let people figure out what they're good at and and people are going to be good at

637
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:16,040
different things so you don't have to take an artist and make them a scientist you know what

638
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:20,840
I'm just gonna take a scientist to make them an artist you just have to allow them to um really

639
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:28,120
figure out what they now see the world differently so that was more a comment but I was hoping that

640
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:33,960
the question of it would be if there was any feedback on that I'd give one and that is that

641
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:39,080
so we've talked about the institutions and the challenge of the institutions pose there's also

642
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:45,240
us and the challenge that we pose and by that I mean all of us um because all of us are

643
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:52,040
expert at something we have our domain expertise and I don't think we want to get rid of domain

644
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:58,920
expertise I think domain expertise is really valuable um and if you think about really high

645
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:03,720
performing teams in lots of aspects of life one of the things that's really characteristic of of

646
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:09,160
of really effective collaboration is that you can leverage domain expertise people can go back

647
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:18,200
and forth between being an expert at in their particular specialty their domain and have this

648
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:23,400
generalist knowledge of what we're trying to accomplish together and and to sort of fluidly

649
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:29,080
integrate those things so our institutions are are definitely not set up to do that and maybe

650
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:34,040
we're not as set up to do that as we'd like to be and maybe that's a very important thing for us

651
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:39,960
to think about and develop how do we actually nurture that without sacrificing that expertise

652
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:45,960
but also recognizing that we all have a tendency sometimes to use that expertise as a kind of

653
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:53,000
leverage that makes it harder to collaborate I think we should think more about um you know

654
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,920
infants and and really really young children how do they explore the world I mean they put it in

655
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:06,280
their mouth they smell it they feel it they taste it they hear it all of these senses that Howard

656
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:13,400
Gardner talks about Harvard education so this this sort of tactile world is even what artificial

657
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:20,440
intelligence is grappling with now how do we put that into computers and into the computer mind

658
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:29,240
so artists have a lot to offer because these are the tools that we learn in art school and so um

659
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:36,200
perhaps we have to go back and unlearn things when I was a student I wanted to draw like Matisse

660
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:43,960
and my professor said first you have to draw like Leonardo before you can draw like Matisse

661
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:52,920
so we can't reduce until we know what the reality is we have to train our vision and observation in

662
01:18:52,920 --> 01:19:00,440
the eastern society really knows about observing we don't observe enough we don't slow down enough

663
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:06,360
especially in our digital world but anyway I think playfulness going back to childhood would be a

664
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:13,160
really really good starting point for education for art and science and attention is relevant to

665
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:18,440
it was brought up earlier there I mean there are two forms there's depth of attention and there's

666
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:26,920
the attention span that gets so much attention and we need to think about the best ways to capture

667
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:35,080
both forms I just want to make a comment about the the not separating the artist and the scientist

668
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:42,440
and when people are going to go for the PhD or they're they're applying for things there's always

669
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:50,680
this piece where they ask you to rate the person's creativity you always have to rate the person's

670
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:57,080
creativity but in our education system we're not always you know we're separating these things and

671
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:03,160
I think we need to not separate we need to be teaching in a way where maybe we're not always

672
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:10,760
on this art or calling it science because the the person who goes on to become a formal scientist

673
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:18,280
needs to have those moments of creative exploration to set up their hypothesis and that hypothesis

674
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:25,880
comes from this intrinsic hypothesis place that's this creative place that's the artistic space

675
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:34,760
so yeah so so there really isn't the dichotomy the way it's been set up because

676
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:41,800
this actively working scientists are very artistic as was brought up earlier in one of the questions

677
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:47,640
and talking about Einstein and his violin scientists even if they don't think they're artistic or

678
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:53,320
somewhere if they're practicing being artistic when they're sitting there they get that free time

679
01:20:53,320 --> 01:21:00,440
that freedom that room of their own should I say for for females but yeah we shouldn't separate

680
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:17,080
I'm nearly an artist I would say a hacker of technology a citizen hacker so to speak I've worked on a lot of

681
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:26,840
collaborations on art science art technology teams and one thing in the discussion that I'm hearing

682
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:32,520
you know it's interesting to be talking about this and to learning about other people's perspectives

683
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:40,680
about how does one teach people to collaborate how do you best open them up like take this

684
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:48,840
you know flower and just completely open it well from my experience the most interesting teams

685
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:57,720
and most interesting productions that we've created have come from listening to them listening to

686
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:08,520
other there I there's no one way to teach this isn't a linear discourse it's taking for example

687
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:18,600
a hyperactive kid taking putting building a community of collaboration from all different kinds of

688
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:25,800
challenges different cultures different interests a kid who's totally interested in music or another

689
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:30,760
who's interested in the sounds of silence then another another another kid who's like moving so

690
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:38,360
fast they can feel that they can they can feel the algorithms between their arms you know like moving

691
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:46,360
them there there's so many things that you can learn from the people that you're putting together

692
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:54,920
and how and and new and seeing how they create together one thing that I found really interesting

693
01:22:54,920 --> 01:23:02,360
for myself and on some teams were different concepts like reading different articles depending upon

694
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:09,720
the age groups of course that we're talking about reading different articles about scientific

695
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:21,320
discovery and thinking really in terms of synchronicity not in terms of disparate movement you know like

696
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:29,800
there's the past and there's the future and there's this line outliers are are incredibly

697
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:35,800
interesting and ed edify so much of what's going on in the world and I have found that

698
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:42,360
when there are groups that are that are put together and people are reading different material

699
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:49,480
and they're not embarrassed or made to feel uncomfortable to come up with their interpretations

700
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:55,320
which may be very much out of the box but they may be very brilliant after his i'm in

701
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:01,000
Einstein would not have been one of your your people how you could have collected that data

702
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,680
he didn't do that hit Malayva his wife did much better university than he did and he collaborated

703
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:13,000
with her on projects so it's you know on the theory of relativity they work together on it so you

704
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:19,800
you know i i just think it's important to listen to the groups that you put together

705
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:28,840
and from that their discussions of things you know i believe some really interesting

706
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:35,400
collaborations will come about for the teachers to then be able to learn from two because it's

707
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:42,840
all about learning from each other i'd like to add to that uh one of the things that we found

708
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:50,200
is that if you create the incentive structure for these collaborations you get a lot of you get a

709
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:55,880
better result so in the early days of Genspace when artists and designers started to show up and we

710
01:24:55,880 --> 01:25:01,480
had other folks who were with science backgrounds there was a real tension between these two these

711
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:11,240
groups uh the scientist would feel that the artist is you would be using them for their own artistic

712
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:16,840
purposes and they'd be feeling taken advantage of on the reverse side when the artist was when the

713
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:25,800
when the scientist was um more quote unquote in charge the artist would feel as though uh they

714
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:33,160
are being used to do PR for for the scientist and what i found uh over the last couple of years was

715
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:39,400
that scientists have found that the the publicity that comes from that collaboration uh ends up

716
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:44,280
being quite useful for their careers and what i've seen is that they there's been a proliferation

717
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:51,160
similar literally for the artist it has helped them as well after the scientist all of everyone

718
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:56,760
seems to benefit at least in some cases and so the more of that we see that the more we'll see

719
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:02,040
these collaborations i think the single most important thing we can do actually is to create

720
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:11,400
spaces and environments that foster collaboration maybe offers some some resources some models some

721
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:18,840
freedom to experience residencies and i think the culture has been changing in a way to promote this

722
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:27,560
um just some extent to some extent i think i i haven't seen great evidence that the culture

723
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:33,800
within formal education is deeply changing to support that although i do see examples of it

724
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:40,360
happening all over the place i would say the new Minerva institute relatively new in california

725
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:47,960
part of the clearmont system barred the changes they've made to introduce science into what was

726
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:58,040
previously an arts curriculum um and again i don't think we can give too much praise to the role

727
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:06,120
that leonardo has played in fostering a lot of this and and but k12 is a tough yeah

728
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:20,200
great um i'm going to try to keep this brief um first off okay thank you for doing this um i'm

729
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:26,200
as many of you probably are i don't think i ever had a choice in where i was going to fall in a

730
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:32,360
career path my undergrad experiences medical illustration my grad experiences museum exhibition

731
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:37,080
design in between i've done a little bit of everything else and when you are an interdisciplinary and

732
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:44,920
and when you don't feel like you fit anywhere life can get a little scary can't it so to hear

733
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:51,000
that you've been uh working on these projects these collaborations these foundations you're doing

734
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,920
this outreach it's really heartwarming but you need to keep doing it

735
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:08,520
because uh a lot of people want to do this i've been teaching high schoolers for quite a few years now

736
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:14,600
in fine arts and trying to rope in as much chemistry into my dye lessons as i can

737
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:24,840
so you keep keep just doing it but um remember that doing this being able to go out on a limb

738
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:31,160
and chase your dream and exist in an interstitial space where you may not have a safety net is a

739
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:38,360
privilege and if we want to bring more people into this not just a marriage of arts and sciences

740
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:43,880
but every single identity that we can possibly rope in because every identity brings its own

741
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:53,880
perspective to any given question and who knows which one's going to be useful which one's going

742
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,160
to crack the code and which one's going to blow everything out of the water

743
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:08,760
so how do you think you want to grow and maintain a support network not just for kids to bring them

744
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:13,800
up and not just for students to feed them while they're in school but for the adults they'll become

745
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:22,600
thank you for your comment i think um i wanted to let you know a nice sentiment uh which is good

746
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:28,920
for everyone to know so in the in august of uh last or this year rather uh sire magazine published

747
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:33,000
a steam issue and this was the first collection of a bunch of steam articles many people in this

748
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,360
room contributed to it um and there were a lot of different viewpoints a lot of different approaches

749
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:43,240
etc but it was just kind of a general roundup and uh the one thing that everyone agreed on is that

750
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:50,120
we did steam because we thought it was the right thing to do and we we didn't have to explain why

751
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,800
i was just like yeah of course it's the right thing to do so don't worry people keep doing it

752
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:07,480
hello again everyone um i am really interested in the the future of steam education as it applies

753
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:13,560
and you know k-12 but also bringing it into the university and something i've been thinking about

754
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:21,080
is how we're disseminating what we've learned from these projects that that we're working on so

755
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:28,760
how are you guys putting out um some of the results that you talked about you know we have

756
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:35,720
data or your course sounds absolutely amazing you know how would how would someone else you know is

757
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:43,960
there is there a model um that someone can would be able to take or access um because when i i hear

758
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:50,120
about the things i'm usually in a room with the person and um on the big wide world of the of

759
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:57,160
the internet it's it's harder to find and it's not so much um covered in a lot of the scholarly

760
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:03,640
articles yet so how are you guys um working to to get that information out in the arabore journal

761
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:11,400
yeah there's um roger what is the name of the woman who is putting together the collection of steam

762
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:20,040
approaches you know i'm talking about can you give him that microphone

763
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:28,920
because this is good information to her and her name is kathryn evans um we're working on the

764
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:34,840
idea of a cloud curriculum project so anybody who's been developing a syllabus shares it with other

765
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:42,120
people um i call it kind of like a gated commons you can only get in by contributing your attempts

766
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:50,920
um and it's it's got an acronym c dash curriculum development in art science and humanities

767
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:56,840
so if you google it you'll find the website we're about to announce it and invite people to do

768
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:04,440
curriculum sharing online because one of the problems is as you were just saying it's so

769
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:10,600
difficult to find the other people who've maybe taught for a couple years and have some best

770
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:17,880
practices or new practices there's a couple of other major places to look one one is informal

771
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:26,120
science.org um and that's a tremendous resource uh we certainly publish all of our major data on

772
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:32,440
there and so do many other people and you can find a vast amount on there um the innovation

773
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:38,760
collaborative and if you can google them and they've developed a lot of best practices and have

774
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:44,760
materials around that and with a lot more coming certainly our website also has even more detailed

775
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:49,560
data and information on our work and also a fair amount of other things that we're able to find

776
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:54,760
out and post that we think are of interest to to that work and to people who are interested in

777
01:32:54,760 --> 01:33:02,440
in in this domain uh and so artofsciencelearning.org lots you can find there uh just to add to that

778
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:08,600
biodesignchallenge.org uh so we've been working with i think we've we've hit the hundred mark hundred

779
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:17,240
plus uh university educators who have been working at the intersection of biology and art and design

780
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:25,480
uh i have their sample i have samples of their curricula online as well as a library of resources

781
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:33,080
uh of reading materials from all from Foucault all the way to um you know complicated articles on

782
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:39,320
uh science articles on CRISPR uh which are which is a fantastic resource for anyone who's developing

783
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:45,960
their own curriculum. Speaking of Foucault uh anyone interested in data mining from my point of view

784
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:53,880
uh might be interested in following the work of the Stanford literary lab which has uh convincingly

785
01:33:53,880 --> 01:34:03,320
found new ways to think about uh making sense of vast quantities of literary data so. I think we

786
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:11,800
need we need something that's more centralized so I so i'm an academic and you know i do my work

787
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:17,720
my own little cloud earth so I think what we're hearing here it's bringing all these people together

788
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:21,160
and each person saying oh I have this I have this and then you'll sit and you'll google and you'll

789
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:27,000
search for it but in bringing us all together here the beauty of today is that we're all in this

790
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:32,920
room and it sounds to me like we need some place where we can all be together in a virtual room

791
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:39,240
that's where all of these pieces that people are you know saying now are available and

792
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:47,000
I'm it's easy to to find these things I would love to share but as we've talked about earlier

793
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:52,440
in the day when we write our grants and we're talking about our broader impacts you know I've

794
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:58,520
applied to try to get money to be able to share my approach to be able to teach teachers what I've

795
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:04,920
done I've taught it four times I'll share my my syllabus but it's hard to get money for being

796
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:11,400
able to to share these things and teach people what you think you've learned and I don't know how

797
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:17,800
we're going to begin to do that and this is where we say we have academia we have you know not-for-profit

798
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:24,120
academia not-for-profit I think the not-for-profits have to try to bring in us who are in academia

799
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:28,680
because we're always going to not-for-profits to try to get money to be able to do our things

800
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:34,840
and disseminate but unless we get that money and we have that free time to disseminate we can't do it

801
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:41,640
the way we might want to. Okay we yeah we have time for one last quick question.

802
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:48,200
We will make the two quick questions and let's order night.

803
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:57,320
Do we have no profit and academic media in the round table do you think we are seeing the

804
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:04,600
birth of a new field a new interdisciplinary field called art science or called science art

805
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:11,960
that is not much separated art and science just like biochemistry doesn't appear it doesn't split

806
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:20,040
biology and chemistry and is biochemists and astrophysics astrophysics is not more astronomy

807
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:27,240
nor physics do you think we are seeing the birds of this new field in an environment like this

808
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:30,920
the second question is do you think the academy will

809
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:42,600
grill will help to grow up this field because for instance in our academy in Brazil we have a

810
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:51,480
master in PhD course since 2004 called education for bioscience and health in which we have

811
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:56,920
a line of research of science and art and we have 10 teases PhD teases on science and art

812
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:04,360
but I don't know other academies on the world that that give this liberty this freedom to

813
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:11,640
think out of the box like this like we are doing here so this question before the night.

814
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:17,400
I just want to make a plug first off for Pearl Premis who was one of the first people to dance

815
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:26,760
her PhD and yeah I think we need a new a new academy that will begin to look at this today I

816
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:32,120
began to wonder what happened to Black Mountain College what happened to this kind of place where

817
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:39,960
people want to work this way where people come together like this in scholarship to to have these

818
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:46,360
conversations and and it's not silos but I don't know how that would happen and where the money is

819
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:53,240
for that kind of scholarship to occur. Okay well I think your questions are good ones to also

820
01:37:54,520 --> 01:38:02,360
revisit tomorrow so thank you guys so much for this wonderful panel this concludes our day together

821
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:10,840
two quick announcements tomorrow morning we're starting at 10 a.m. we'll open the doors at 9.30

822
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:17,000
number two you are all invited to an art exhibit opening tonight that Syart Center is hosting

823
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,920
10 blocks from here the address is 208 73rd street there's a flyer on the table out there

824
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:33,960
art reception wine amazing science based art please join us from seven to nine 30
