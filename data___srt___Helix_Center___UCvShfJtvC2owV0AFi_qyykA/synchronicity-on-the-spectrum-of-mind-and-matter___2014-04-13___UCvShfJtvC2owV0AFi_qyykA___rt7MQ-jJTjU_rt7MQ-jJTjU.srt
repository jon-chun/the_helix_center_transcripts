60
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:55,840
Thank you so much Rob and I especially want to thank Ed Nasserian and Rob Penzer and

61
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,200
Henry Levine who were open to this proposal and to me it proves that Helix is really one

62
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,320
of the major centers for intellectual and all other kinds of discourse in New York and

63
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:16,960
I'm just thrilled to be here. I think we are here because we all believe that conversation

64
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,240
among the sciences and among all the disciplines is real in that interaction is where the most

65
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:30,040
fruit is going to be born and you've been just wonderful in keeping this alive and making

66
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,720
this alive.

67
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:46,200
Because this is not a space where there has been too much talk of Jung, I've spent a lot

68
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,960
of time in this space, many different programs. I'm going to take just a few minutes to fill

69
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,840
in what you might not know in terms of the background through which we even are having

70
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:06,120
this conversation about synchronicity. Jung counted among his primary influences William

71
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,800
James first, then Freud and at the same time as he and Freud were separating Einstein was

72
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,640
a major force in his life. They were on the faculty together at the Pauli Technic in

73
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:25,840
Zurich and in the summer before Jung came to New York to give the Fordham lectures where

74
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,280
he differentiated his idea of what psychic energy was from the traditional one. He wrote

75
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:41,200
Freud a series of letters in which he described having dinners at his home with Bloiler and

76
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,720
others and a young physicist who talked about the theory of light and then he repeated to

77
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,200
Freud what this young Einstein was saying about energy. Then when he came to New York

78
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:01,640
and he gave his definition of energy clearly see Einstein's effect on Jung. Jung was 20

79
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:10,160
years younger than Freud and so he was exposed to a different generation of science. Many

80
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:19,680
years later in 1930 he met Wolfgang Pauli who was a quantum physicist in the Niels Bohr

81
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:28,640
School and who had been the man who established the exclusion principle. Excuse me I'm very

82
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:42,920
dry here. Which was the basis for the periodic table in chemistry and he and Pauli then

83
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:52,400
worked together over 20, 30 years and they corresponded and although my science education

84
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,480
stopped with dissecting frogs in my freshman year in college and I'm surrounded by these

85
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:06,080
eminent scientists here I was asked to write the preface to this correspondence of Jung

86
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,720
and Pauli which took me two and a half years to read enough about physics so that I could

87
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:20,600
do that. I've had friends vet it since though. And I found their correspondence just thrilling

88
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:27,400
because they were each attempting to come from their own disciplines and really lovingly

89
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:35,600
heartfully communicate with each other. Pauli took such effort he was 30 years younger than

90
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:45,720
even more. Younger than Jung took so much time writing back to him about his dreams and a

91
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:55,840
true exchange of information and it was Pauli who convinced Jung to write about synchronicity

92
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:07,360
and then Pauli also wrote about it. So then when I met Harold and as you will hear he

93
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,160
knows everything there is to know about the subject I met Harold a few years ago at a

94
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,800
conference he gave just of physicists and a philosopher and a few analysts and Joe Cambra

95
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,280
and I have worked for years on the topic of synchronicity and then I met at a dinner

96
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,920
party I met Edgar and the first thing he mentioned in our conversation which doesn't happen so

97
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:41,920
often is he mentioned Pauli as one of his heroes and then farzade I met at a conference

98
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:51,680
we had at Fordham on Jung's 100 year long ago lectures and I just finished editing a

99
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,200
chapter that first is done about going into the laboratory he did it with his wife T.

100
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:04,800
Marie and the effect of the observer on the experiment who is being observed and therefore

101
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,240
on the experiment. So it's been a great pleasure for me to know these men I'm so glad to share

102
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,760
their company with you they most of them just met each other last night and I can tell

103
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,600
from what happened around the dinner table this is going to be an exciting day and I

104
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:30,080
want to turn first the platform over to Harold who's come here from Zurich. Thank you Beverly

105
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:36,720
thank you all for coming here and for making this a success I guess let me let me start

106
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,160
with some because you were Beverly you were talking about the road which which it took

107
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:48,520
Jung to get to this for Pauli it was a little bit different of course and you know Pauli

108
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:58,680
was had a chair for theoretical physics at the ETH the polytechnic at Zurich since 1928

109
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:06,560
and that was the time also among other other things in which the new theory of quantum

110
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,560
mechanics was proposed and worked out and this was so to speak the pioneering phase

111
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:19,360
of the new quantum physics physics of atoms and you know all this this small particles

112
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,000
and so on and in this time actually it's interesting to know that many of these physicists who

113
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,240
were contributing Bohr, Heisenberg, Diorak and others they were all very much interested

114
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,640
also in the philosophical foundations but almost none of them was interested in making

115
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,720
contact with psychology there's only one except I mean Pauli is one exception second

116
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:52,040
exception is Pascal Jordan Jordan Jordan and Jordan went the Freudian way in a sense and

117
00:12:52,040 --> 00:13:00,960
Pauli went the Jungian way so now now we have this Wolfgang Pauli writing up his dreams

118
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:07,920
he was for a short time he was even in analysis with Jung and there's this rich dream material

119
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,160
by Pauli which is some of the dreams have been used by Jung in psychology and alchemy

120
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,360
but there is a huge body of dreams which have not even been seen by anybody except

121
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,920
very few people and so this collection of dreams about 2000 pages and two volumes is

122
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,400
just sitting on the table of the main editor at Springer-Fahlach in Heidelberg waiting

123
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:38,640
to be published so the manuscript is completely ready and it should be out this year maybe

124
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:45,240
next year we don't know we don't know for sure but this will be out so Pauli then had

125
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:52,120
to go into exile because he was of Austrian origin then Austria was enacted by the by

126
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,880
a Nazi Germany Pauli was living in Zurich but he didn't have a Swiss passport so whenever

127
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,580
he would leave Switzerland then he would be there was the risk that he would would be

128
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,760
captured by the by the Germans so he went into exile to Princeton actually and had an invitation

129
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:16,680
from Einstein there and that was in 1939 he went to Princeton 45 he got the Nobel Prize

130
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,640
couldn't pick it up because he didn't have a passport then then then the US government

131
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,160
reacted very quickly they gave him a passport in in a few months so he could at least go

132
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:35,280
one year later and get his Nobel Prize from Stockholm and in the same year 1946 he returned

133
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:44,240
to Switzerland and now this is the period now from 1946 until Pauli's death in 1958 in

134
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,800
which the scientific and philosophical correspondence and collaboration with with CG Jung really

135
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,760
reached its climax and that's also the time when the synchronicity principle was actually

136
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,800
formulated by the two together Jung published it but if you look into the correspondence

137
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,120
you will see that there was a huge amount of discussion and refinement of the paper and

138
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,560
going forth and back and then Pauli said no you can't do it you can you can say this

139
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,880
simply you know and then Jung would would refine and would revise it was a period of

140
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:24,680
almost one and a half years over which this this paper was developed so you you probably

141
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,560
all know what synchronicity is about it's a synchronicity experience very briefly and

142
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:39,080
maybe superficially is a kind of is an experience of a meaningful coincidence between the mental

143
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:47,840
state of an experiencing subject can be a patient can be any human being between the

144
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:55,760
mental state of an experiencing human subject and physical state of matter kind of apparatus

145
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,920
it can be a kind of can be a piece of rock can be everything out there in the material

146
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:10,520
world so what we're talking about here is an instantiation of the mind body problem

147
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:17,040
ultimately and that's why this why this issue of synchronicity moves so many people because

148
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:26,160
it touches on an issue which is as old as human human cultures are already the Greeks talked

149
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,320
about this and of course in in other parts of the world the mind body problem has been

150
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,960
treated as well though in different terms but that's that's why this this issue of synchronicity

151
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,080
I think is so important because it's a it's a very interesting nucleus for talking about

152
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,640
the mind matter of the mind body problem in general and I think there are three at least

153
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:55,760
three and that's my then I then I come to an end here at least three roots which are

154
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,760
I think important to study and develop to do research and development on the mind body

155
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:08,520
problem exemplified by by the principle of synchronicity the first one is we need to

156
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,280
understand better in terms of in terms of scientific research really what's what's going

157
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,760
on in synchronicity events you know we're talking about in relationship between actually

158
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:27,440
some two two very different realms of reality the the the mental and the material and Harold

159
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,480
my understanding is a causal is a major factor that's that's an important point which we

160
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,520
might come into when we come to when we go into details just give me these these are

161
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,640
the two broad things which I think are important you know interdisciplinarity of course is

162
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,240
a key issue and you see when you see that already when I said a party as a physicist

163
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,200
and and Jung as a psychologist tried to go into that together this is this is the highest

164
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:03,080
tension of interdisciplinarity that you can actually have in research almost nothing is

165
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:09,000
done in this in this area then we have the second point is synchronicity is also a kind

166
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,760
of I think it comes down to a world view issue we want to if we want to understand synchronicity

167
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:23,600
then this this touches on the world view that people really have and for instance when you

168
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,560
go to a standard neuroscientist who in the standard lab neuroscientists what would say

169
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,080
I mean what the mind body problem and actually everything is in the body and every in the

170
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,400
brain and the and we understand the mental the mind when we understand the brain and

171
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,640
for me this is too cheap for many other people too but this is something of course with this

172
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,760
has world view quality at the third point which is also important maybe even more important

173
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,920
than the other two is what are the practical implications of understanding synchronicity

174
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:05,920
and this might be another issue which we can discuss as as this session develops.

175
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,120
Okay thank you.

176
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:18,200
One just one point that I'm sure Joe will pick up is that you in his essay on synchronicity

177
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,120
Jung makes it quite clear that he's looking at the kind of phenomena that come together

178
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:32,480
for which there's no perceivable cause and one of the reasons he's doing this is to try

179
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:42,120
to get us away from magical thinking that very often if one cannot see a cause or source

180
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,160
that's the reason for something to happen we leap into magical thinking.

181
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:54,000
So he's asking us to open our minds and not look for strict efficient cause of one thing

182
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,280
therefore making another happen so that if I fall off my horse for instance it isn't

183
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:07,200
necessarily because God looked down down and saw me there may be some other reason I was

184
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,320
meant to fall off the horse.

185
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,800
There might be some beautiful plant on the ground.

186
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Just gravitation.

187
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,920
No but if something else happens that is enacted but not cause so I just want to stick that

188
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,520
and do you want to say anything more about that piece or another?

189
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,640
What I would just add to the historical discourse I think it's important to see how the idea

190
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,640
emerged in Jung's thought and when I first wrote a book on this it was prior to when the

191
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,160
red book had come out and since then I would rewrite the book considerably because after

192
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,360
studying the red book you can see the emergence of this notion in its early forms.

193
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:54,920
Basically what happens as many of you probably know in 1913 as Freud and Jung have a real

194
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,160
falling out Jung has a terrible set of personal experiences it's really catastrophic multiple

195
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,400
things are going on in his life but he has a set of visions waking visions on a trip to

196
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,560
see his mother-in-law.

197
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,920
I don't think she was the immediate cause.

198
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,560
One never knows.

199
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,840
In any way more seriously he sees Europe filling up with blood and he's horrified because as

200
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,120
a psychiatrist he understands what these kinds of mental states are apt to indicate.

201
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,200
However instead of trying to seal it over and move away from it he decides to go on an

202
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,960
interior exploration of this state of mind and this leads him to the raw material that

203
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,040
becomes the red book.

204
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:45,920
He emerges out of that in April of 1914 just about a hundred years ago today.

205
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:53,520
We're almost smack on when he stops that work and he resigns his presidency from the IPA

206
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,600
he resigns his position in the psychiatry department at the University of Zurich and

207
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,560
he really is sort of in a free fall but he has a series of dreams that he finds rather

208
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,320
helpful and potentially transformative although if you look at them they're healing juices

209
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,040
and grapes but it's frozen and so forth.

210
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,400
The real change for him comes of course in August of 1914 when the guns go off and he

211
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,320
has a sense of oh maybe this wasn't just personal madness maybe there was a prophetic dimension

212
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,840
but the truth of the matter is that the horns of that dilemma are not very appealing to

213
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,400
him either.

214
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:36,040
In fact he stays with this for about 15 years struggling with how to find a resolution for

215
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
that.

216
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,200
For him he said the resolution came in 1928 when he received from Richard Wilhelm the

217
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,560
synologist and close friend of his a Chinese alchemical text called the secret of the

218
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:54,760
golden flower and why that was the ending point was he was in the middle of doing a

219
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,640
set of mandalas for the red book he was working on these kind of elaborate paintings of his

220
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,680
own personal expression and he was doing one that he felt had a very Chinese feel to

221
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,600
it and it had a particularly yellow color to it and so he was stunned just as he had

222
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:16,480
completed that he received this manuscript and it linked directly to the missing piece

223
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,560
and within a couple of months of that he's giving a dream seminar private dream seminar

224
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,760
and there turns out there's a whole cluster of phenomena that begin to be activated around

225
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,840
a patient's dream and the students in the class ask him how does he understand that

226
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,800
and he said well you know in the west our prejudice is for causality in the east it's

227
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,880
for pattern formation basically it's for this kind of coming together or synchronicity it's

228
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,200
the very first time he uses the term.

229
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,800
In 1930 he uses it once publicly at Wilhelm's memorial service and then he's fairly silent

230
00:23:52,800 --> 00:24:00,600
on it until the poly letters go on but I think that that transitional moment there where he

231
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,920
gets the secret of the golden flower one way to conceive of that is that he has a realization

232
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:15,960
in the post-year point Beverly that he's that the prophecy madman dilemma is a false dilemma

233
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,280
that there may be something about the quality of the universe we live in it's he's a proto

234
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:26,040
anthropic universe kind of guy he's suggesting that mind and meaning are somehow inherent

235
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:32,080
in the very fundamental quality of our universe and so he's starting to make a move into cosmology

236
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,040
or cosmogany quite frankly and when you look at the writing of the synchronous city essay

237
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,720
in the late 40s I'm sure Polly is feeding him some of this he starts to talk about places

238
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,720
where space and time collapsed in year zero about his new idea of a psychoid archetype

239
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:57,160
that links matter and mind as being a world constituting factor so what we have in that

240
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:06,560
is basically a cosmogonic hypothesis that's mixing the best of contemporary cosmology

241
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,440
with a kind of new psychological approach and once you put the idea against that background

242
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,680
it inserts to look quite different one final comment taking it forward for myself as a clinician

243
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,240
I got interested in this topic because in the late 80s and early 90s I had a lot of trauma

244
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,400
patients referred and there were a number of them that some rather strange elliptical

245
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,320
communications to say the least anomalous phenomena started to occur and so I went back

246
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,960
and reread Jung's essays to see if it would give me any insight on those cases and I found

247
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,000
there were problems with his argument for example he makes an energy argument but it

248
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,680
uses classical 19th century thermodynamics for closed systems near equilibrium well what

249
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,200
we're talking about with this phenomenon are open systems very far from equilibrium so

250
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,280
in fact my good fortune at the time when I started thinking about this is the people

251
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:02,720
of the Santa Fe Institute were studying complex adaptive systems and they began to speak about

252
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,760
exactly those kind of systems that might be occurring at the origins of life at the origins

253
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,120
of mind and so forth and so when you cast a recast this hypothesis within that kind of

254
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,720
metaphor you get a different understanding that I think actually has a lot of clinical

255
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,720
utility as well as some applications for physics but I'll stop there.

256
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:30,400
And Farzad you came into this from a completely different angle and how did you why were you

257
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,320
drawn to this?

258
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,480
Well my first response please said that was it's pretty much how I do everything some

259
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,800
other angle coming in and I think if I think the first time I heard about this I was studying

260
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:54,960
chemistry and I started to get interested in the history of chemistry because I noticed

261
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,680
that there were different phenomena could be explained by two different mathematical

262
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,640
formalisms explaining the same phenomena and then on the other hand sometimes you had

263
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,920
one mathematical formalism explaining two really widely different phenomena and so this got

264
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:17,040
me to think about alternatives to what I was being taught I was taking physical chemistry

265
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,040
which as anyone knows who's taking chemistry when you start to look for alternatives because

266
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:30,080
it's hard to do but I realized at that point there's many ways to go do this after I looked

267
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,600
at the history of chemistry I thought how many ideas have kind of not made it for one reason

268
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,480
or another like all the different technologies that for internal combustion engines there's

269
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,840
several but we were kind of stuck with one for a long time.

270
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,600
In any case I started looking in the history and I came across young in the history of

271
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:57,040
chemistry with alchemy and then from there I basically got lost for a while wandering

272
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:06,800
around trying to figure out why he's writing so much about alchemy and as a psychologist

273
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:13,000
and it was in there when I started looking at his other works and found synchronicity

274
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,760
that I saw the cross between the two fields as you were saying the physics the study of

275
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,120
matter and the study of mind at the same time and that got me very interested.

276
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,480
So it was from science that really drove me to it I didn't really know much psychology

277
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:34,040
or I didn't even started doing philosophy yet which is what I ended up doing.

278
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:40,720
One of the themes that came out when we were talking last night is the degree to which

279
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:48,520
serendipity in scientific discovery or in laboratory work is sometimes experienced as

280
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:54,600
what we would call the synchronicity something we didn't really set out it seems to come

281
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:04,360
to us in a nonlinear way and so I'd like to turn to Edgar about this.

282
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:10,920
Edgar really stepped into this I mean he's able to figure out how to send a rocket into

283
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:17,640
space and the interval of 12 minutes that it takes to get into space and so that sort

284
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:25,800
of the spirit with which he agreed to participate today to just step into this room and into

285
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:31,720
this discussion which is extremely different from what he does in his aerospace lab.

286
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,200
So Edgar could you?

287
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,840
Yes I should start by saying that coming to your credentials in science limited to dissecting

288
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:47,160
frogs I should say my experience in psychology is limited to dissecting the mind of my girlfriend

289
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
in college.

290
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:56,600
It's a attempt that I miserably failed of course but so my as someone who works only

291
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,560
on the matter on the mindless matter part of the equation here since we have eminent

292
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,440
psychologists and people who work on the mind and in the case of Harold both mind and matter

293
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,440
I work only on matter.

294
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,600
Perhaps the role I could play is that of a pro-poke a little bit and maybe reflect a

295
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,760
little bit of the some of the skepticism that I hear in the more prosaic community of applied

296
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,160
physics when somebody mentions synchronicity.

297
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:32,480
Specifically at least of course there's no doubt that there's some very interesting aspects

298
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,720
of context in which synchronicity can be talked in the realm of physics.

299
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,840
I'm sure Harold will tell us more about it especially in quantum mechanics itself in

300
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,280
the theory and experiments having to do with quantum entanglement but when it comes to

301
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,760
prosaic research in everyday physics and applied physics we actually teach our graduate students

302
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:02,000
to avoid specifically some activities or some habits that synchronicity seems to imply

303
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,720
as central to our human existence.

304
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,840
Specifically the idea of asking causality.

305
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,800
One has to be fair Jung himself did not say that synchronicity is a replacement for causality

306
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,640
and coincidence.

307
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:24,560
He said it's another option so to speak.

308
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:31,400
One that of course he also implied extends more to a general framework.

309
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,920
Let me give you an example for it to become more concrete.

310
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,640
For example let's say you are going to see a friend.

311
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,120
You seek to see a certain friend who you know where he lives.

312
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,200
You know he lives on 82nd and next in the morning.

313
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,800
You walk to the block, you turn the corner and he's in front of you.

314
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,880
Now there's a causality involved.

315
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,400
You're not going to be terribly surprised because when you turn the corner and see your

316
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,280
friend you know it's the time to work.

317
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,160
You actually sought him.

318
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,560
His being there is not terribly surprising.

319
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,000
There's a coincidence of seeing him.

320
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You're not expecting to see him but the coincidence has a causal you know relation.

321
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,200
Now imagine going walking around the city, turning a block and as you turn the block you

322
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,640
think of a friend you haven't thought of in 20 years.

323
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,800
John.

324
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,560
And suddenly John is right in front of your face.

325
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,320
Now of course depending on how spiritual you are or how skeptical you are you might make

326
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,360
a big deal of the situation.

327
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,960
Most of that situation seems to me and again please correct me later on if I'm wrong.

328
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,120
To satisfy more what John had in mind when he talked about a single city.

329
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,400
Specifically John talked about a situation where he was constantly talking to a patient

330
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,160
and when she mentioned in the middle of her talking about her dreams a golden scarab being

331
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:03,120
given a present in her dream of a golden scarab and at that exact moment, John said there was

332
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,480
a little tap on the window behind him and I'm sure he's very correct in fact as they were.

333
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,520
Turn around, there was a bug on the window, opened the window, grabbed the bug in the middle

334
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,120
air and it wasn't as close as his scarab as you can find in Zurich at that time.

335
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,000
So and he made a big deal of it and that was an example that he cited in I think in his

336
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,280
book in 1952.

337
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,920
So that to my mind resembles very much what happens when you turn the corner and suddenly

338
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,680
you see your friend you thought of.

339
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:37,360
Now the question is we teach our students in the lab, graduate students to think about

340
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,560
it this way.

341
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:45,720
Now how often do you go around the city thinking of people, which you do quite often, and you

342
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,640
turn around and they're not there.

343
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,800
And so we teach them what we call normalization.

344
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,960
You have to divide the number of certain events by the large number of other events.

345
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,560
So there's a huge number of times you go around the city thinking of people and there's

346
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,560
a huge number of times you turn corners and not there.

347
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,200
When you normalize them you get a small number that will be caused statistical noise and

348
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,240
we tell them to look at it this way.

349
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,440
So of course we get a little bit edgy, I'm not talking about myself, but when somebody

350
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,760
comes and say wait a minute there is a grander more and your students should be aware of

351
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
this.

352
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Now I'm not saying this is what Jung didn't say, but this is how sometimes it's perceived

353
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,600
in the prosaic community of applied physics, simplicity might be manifested.

354
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:36,400
So I'm here to poke starting with this argument and hopefully get some conversation.

355
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:43,760
Also I would like to be educated more on how the concept simplicity can interface with

356
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,080
physical science and ask how come in 62 years hasn't yet settled on something we can teach

357
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,080
in textbooks.

358
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:58,040
For example quantum mechanics is now an 80 year old science, we teach it in schools, but

359
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:05,160
seldom we get to talk about these issues that directly relate to Jung and even what

360
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:10,520
Pali were talking about is not very well accepted by the mainstream physics community.

361
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,320
So hopefully I can play that a bit of skeptical podium.

362
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,120
You're playing Pali's role.

363
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,840
That's why actually you look a little bit like Pali's too.

364
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,520
That's very flattering considering how much I have.

365
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,120
You know the history of early quantum mechanics, he was seen as something like a demon George

366
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,920
Gamov actually has a picture of him with horns on because every time he'd go to a lab to

367
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,800
see what was going on and this cutting edge lab everyone would tremble in fear because

368
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,680
things would break down.

369
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
And if you know-

370
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,680
It's the Pali effect.

371
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,240
Exactly, hasn't it?

372
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:51,200
And so the thing is that instruments that deal with observing atomic phenomena or basically

373
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:59,320
phenomena that are at a certain scale or in a certain level of metastability are sensitive.

374
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,960
Sensitive enough to have a really grumpy, very sort of skeptical, poke a hole kind of guy

375
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,160
in the lab who was also brilliant in a Nobel Prize winner.

376
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,960
And so that happened quite a lot.

377
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,640
But he in fact the same person was the one that stimulated Jung to actually consider

378
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,320
the possibilities of psyche and matter somehow not being two things but being two aspects

379
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:30,520
of one thing or essentially not treating synchronicity as a mental phenomenon only.

380
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:36,760
If we do just look at it as instance, instance, instance and then what I think about what

381
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,440
meaning I put on one instance or another, it gets tricky.

382
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,880
You can't do any statistics on it.

383
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,640
And so one of the things that is interesting in trying to take a scientific view on synchronicity

384
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,280
is you have to revise your idea of what a scientific view is because on the one hand

385
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,200
you can't do the statistics.

386
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,520
On the other hand you have phenomena.

387
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,840
And then you have people who habitually are making meaning seeing patterns.

388
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:15,560
And so for people to basically naturally think about a coincidence as more than a coincidence

389
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,120
is something that happens all the time.

390
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:24,360
So it's a common phenomenon therefore one that would fall in the domain of science that

391
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,680
needs to be studied.

392
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,840
But then the normal way of doing it won't do it so we have to rethink.

393
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:35,360
I'll just add one thing here, something I learned from going into lab and actually I

394
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,600
probably learned it before that but I really saw it crystallize in laboratory settings.

395
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,640
And it has to do with a poly effect very much.

396
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,840
What we saw in quantum theory early on and the lesson that was learned there I think

397
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,560
has not yet had an effect on how science is done.

398
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,480
I think it's changed science and it's created a lot of technologies.

399
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,480
But the idea of what quantum theory did to science has not yet made it.

400
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,080
And I think that's where synchronicity and physics hit.

401
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:15,720
And it's precisely just one point and that is that there is an effect when you observe

402
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,120
something at an atomic scale you become part of that.

403
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:25,800
So in other words the observation becomes constitutive of the thing you're observing.

404
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,960
And I'll put it in more general terms.

405
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,360
This was the beginning of seeing the world as relational.

406
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:39,960
So what a thing is is not something just in itself closed and totally self-defined.

407
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,760
What anything is in this relational world view is it's made up of its relations to

408
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,000
everything else.

409
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,400
Also the properties of this cup or this table are not properties just purely inherent.

410
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,360
They're properties that are dispositional.

411
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,600
They will emerge upon interaction.

412
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,000
In this kind of large scale world interaction with the world doesn't really change the

413
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
chair.

414
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,320
Am I sitting in the chair, change it a little bit but not significantly.

415
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,680
It's when you get to the atomic level that's simply the act of observation of that actually

416
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,760
changes what it is so you can access while you're looking at certain aspects of it, other

417
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:21,560
aspects of it are invisible, not accessible, unobservable.

418
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:30,080
This is what Bohr and Pauli effect agreed quite strongly with him is called complementarity.

419
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:37,760
And at the root of complementarity is this idea of which is the same as the relational

420
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,920
world view of a coupling.

421
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,080
So what Bohr said it all, complementarity boils down to, and I think this is what synchronicity

422
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:50,480
boils down to as well, is that when you observe something there's a coupling between the observing

423
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,880
device and the thing being observed.

424
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,840
And at that point there's a wholeness.

425
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,160
There's one thing.

426
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,320
And any dividing line you put between them is going to be arbitrary.

427
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,760
It's going to be theory dependent.

428
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,600
It's going to be instrument dependent.

429
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,760
It's going to be context dependent.

430
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,600
And that was not part of science up till this time.

431
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:14,120
It was after that that Bohr kind of formulated conceptually as complementarity.

432
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,960
Heisenberg then came up with a mathematics that showed precisely to what extent something

433
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:27,160
becomes imprecise, that we start to have this idea that the properties are relational in

434
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,360
the physical world.

435
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:35,680
And I'll just say this last thing and then pull back to the larger world and see where

436
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,320
this goes.

437
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,800
So, basically we're dealing with pairs, dyads.

438
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,920
Anytime we have two things overlapping, becoming one thing.

439
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,160
So there's a causal interaction between the observing device and the thing observed.

440
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,320
You have one thing, you have a wholeness there.

441
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,520
At that point you have a co-constitution of one thing by the other thing.

442
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,320
Now, as I said, this is not observable in science, but any of you who are married or

443
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:06,760
in relationship right now know that what you are, how you feel, has a lot to do with is

444
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,160
dependent on the other person that's significant in your life.

445
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,440
You co-constitute one another, there's no defining you without the other.

446
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,160
And family relationships are like that, ecosystems are like that.

447
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,360
So we have a lot of macro-scale things that are, but we didn't really do science that

448
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,680
way until quantum theory sort of forced it on us.

449
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,520
And I'll pull back from that for now.

450
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,040
One issue that is relevant to synchronicity, that I would imagine would drive a scientist

451
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:45,520
mad, which I don't want to have happen to you, is that in fact there is no statistic,

452
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,600
and it's a highly subjective experience.

453
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:56,520
In so far as it's only one person in that instance, sometimes it's villages who has

454
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:02,360
the image, and at that time it's not that, oh, there's been many times I didn't see my

455
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,360
friend.

456
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:10,840
It's, you, if the person asks why, what in particular, why was I thinking of this person,

457
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:17,200
what do they mean to me, what do they represent to me, and why is that being reinforced, and

458
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:24,840
can I register it with surprise, which is one of the survival emotions, then it should

459
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:30,120
take me to some part of myself that is the reason from the inside I was thinking that

460
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:37,880
person, about that person, that would allow me to make it meaningful that I met that person.

461
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:44,120
So it's highly subjective, it's not reproducible, and you can't set it up in the lab.

462
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:53,360
It includes coming seemingly out of the blue in terms of that kind of coupling.

463
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,560
So maybe you can pick up the graph.

464
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,800
Yeah, I actually wanted to address some of the issues, Edgar, that you brought up, because

465
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,760
I think it's really important to take these objections seriously, because if you don't

466
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,560
do that, then you don't have any chance to talk about this scandalous frontier between

467
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,960
the mantle and the material, right?

468
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,680
And I think you described very well how the reaction of a typical, not only physicist,

469
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:27,040
typical scientist to this principle of synchronicity would look like, because whenever you see

470
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:34,680
a correlation in the sciences, and you don't have a causal model that describes it, then

471
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,200
the reflexes, this must be chance.

472
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:45,960
Not only, I would even say, not only if the number of incidences versus the noise is so

473
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:52,160
low, but even for the conceptual reason that once you don't have any causal model, then

474
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,360
it must be noise, right?

475
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:59,120
And if you have sometimes in high energy physics or in cosmology, if you have signals which

476
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:05,800
stand out of the noise by many standard deviations, some people would say, no, this is not enough,

477
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,800
because we don't have a model, we don't know how this comes up.

478
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:18,600
Now Jung, actually in his definition of synchronicity, wanted to, he implemented something with

479
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:24,760
which he wanted to react against the noise argument, the chance argument, and that was

480
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:33,480
the idea that not as a replacement, as you said, but as a complement to the causal explanation,

481
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:39,680
there is another possible explanation, and that he called meaning, meaning, that's why

482
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,320
synchronicities are called meaningful coincidences.

483
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:48,960
And not only the meaning just blah, blah, blah for a banal thing, but at least for a

484
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,560
long time, Jung was convinced that this meaning must have, he used to notion, luminous dimensions.

485
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,080
So something like, people must be touched existentially.

486
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:08,160
And the scarab example that you, of course, properly told us, of course, had a luminous

487
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,520
dimension for the client, and for Jung himself, because it's important to see that it's not

488
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:21,400
only for the client, it's a kind of, it goes on in both, because it's a diet, even in that

489
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,200
relationship, right?

490
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:31,440
So for the client, a whole new world of realizing emotional components and his, well, Bob Antone

491
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,000
came up, and for Jung, I mean, Jung, of course, he knew about this idea of synchronicity,

492
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,680
he was deeply touched by the way in which he saw that this just worked in that instant.

493
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,920
So this notion of meaning, now, of course, when you come to a scientist and tell him,

494
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:54,840
you know, now we causal explanations don't work for these correlations, so I'm not allowed

495
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,640
to do chance, then these guys tell me I should do meaning.

496
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,160
This is even a greater scandal, because meaning is not at all a topic in science.

497
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,600
It's not what it's about.

498
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,480
Of course, every scientist would insist that he does meaningful work, and so on and so.

499
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:17,400
What I'm saying is the issue of meaning itself is not an explicit object of the study, that's

500
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
what I'm saying.

501
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:25,800
And now, of course, we are sitting here and are confronting the question, how can we,

502
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:33,040
in a reasonable way, in a way which other people can understand, how can we talk about

503
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,400
meaning?

504
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,760
And that is, of course, this can be a research topic, of course.

505
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,720
This is also a topic for individual experiences.

506
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,720
Yeah.

507
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:54,680
And of course, meaning is most often something that one experiences the desire to grant if

508
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:03,040
it has an emotional charge to one, and if it takes one out of one's usual orientation.

509
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:10,320
For me, as an analyst, one of the most stunning aspects of synchronicity is the degree to

510
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:19,120
which it brings an aspect of surprise to me that often has to shake up a certain fixed

511
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:26,640
element of my counter-transference onto a patient that I haven't really noticed has

512
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:34,360
somehow slipped into some kind of embedded state and is not sufficiently fluid.

513
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,480
And then very often something will happen.

514
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,560
For instance, I'll open the door, I'll see a patient, and I'll suddenly think of a lobster

515
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:48,080
for absolutely no reason, and the person doesn't look remotely like a lobster.

516
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:53,960
And then she'll sit down in the chair and say that she was just on Canal Street and

517
00:47:53,960 --> 00:48:01,600
a little lobster ran between the cars because Canal Street still has things coming up from

518
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,160
the canal.

519
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:08,800
Or I will have a thought, and for some, you know, we're all trained to really pay attention

520
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,680
to what are the images that come up in us.

521
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:20,920
And very often it turns out to be an image that a patient's dream will contain.

522
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:26,840
And I don't see that, and I don't understand it, but I don't see it as just mirror neuron

523
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,240
phenomena.

524
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:34,760
I don't see it as just echmin-like expressions where I'm imitating the expression on my

525
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,280
patient's face, so I come up with the same images.

526
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:43,920
There's some way that element of surprise is asking me to wake up to something with

527
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,360
that patient that maybe I've become a little bit dulled out toward.

528
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:53,440
Now, I don't know how that works in terms of serendipity and laboratories.

529
00:48:53,440 --> 00:49:00,080
I'm not sure I can go right to serendipity, but I wanted to, for a moment, return to

530
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:06,520
the misattribution because I think that's an extremely important piece of the discussion.

531
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,920
And from another place I'll start with something that Winnicott said that one of the roles of

532
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,080
the mother is to protect the infant from too much coincidence.

533
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,760
It's a fascinating statement.

534
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,520
Tom Ogden picked it up and put it into one of his books.

535
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,840
And I thought, well, what is that telling us about our structures of the understanding

536
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,840
of the world?

537
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,880
You know, that I think there's something about the way we formulated science that we're in

538
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,840
the midst of a paradigm change.

539
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:34,200
And the whole question, of course, as you know, is how do you get from statistical

540
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,520
understandings up to the actual observed phenomena?

541
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,840
You have a gap there, as we all do.

542
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:44,360
And this is where things like emergence, we've needed a complex enough science.

543
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:50,040
So the question would be, for me then, if we reframe this again in terms of interactive

544
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:55,760
fields, we might have a more interesting discussion about what is coming up between myself and

545
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,320
the other.

546
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,640
We've all been talking about co-constructed fields in the analytic world for quite a while.

547
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:07,040
And I go back now to the 19th century when, starting with Hans Christian Orsted, when

548
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:13,640
he was running, showing his students how to do a voltaic pile, you know, and he accidentally

549
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:20,600
serendipitously, I'll put it in now, serendipitously, there was a compass on the table and the needle

550
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,920
fluctuated.

551
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,040
This was the very first experimental observation of a link between electricity and magnetism,

552
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,360
that those phenomena that had prior to that seemed completely unrelated.

553
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,360
Now had a link.

554
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,960
He didn't know much what to do with it, quite honestly.

555
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,920
That was in the 1820s.

556
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:41,720
And by the way, a friend of his predicted in the 1820s this would be discovered.

557
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,200
That's a whole other story.

558
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:52,240
However, we have to go to Michael Faraday in the 1850s before we get the experimental

559
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,360
evidence for what fields are like.

560
00:50:54,360 --> 00:51:00,120
And you know, when Faraday finally articulates his field theory to the British, the Royal

561
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:05,920
Society of Science, people are stunned because he's overthrowing Newton.

562
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,680
The space is no longer empty.

563
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,840
And that things are not, that there's no action at a distance.

564
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:18,160
That suddenly the things that seemed magical in science were now being retransformed.

565
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,720
Enough that James Clerk Maxwell, when he does his equations, he's a very young man at this

566
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:29,440
point, he writes to Faraday, a rather amazing letter saying about what this is done to his

567
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,800
understanding of the universe.

568
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,560
It's opened up an interconnected web that he sees the heavens in this kind of, what I

569
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,760
would call an archetypal image that grabs him with great power.

570
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,120
And of course that leads to Einstein.

571
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,400
But we know in the 1870s that William James is reading Maxwell.

572
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:53,960
And he's incorporating that when he gives his Gifford lectures in 1904, 1905, these are

573
00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:00,000
the variety of religious experiences, he talks about the margins of consciousness acting

574
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,560
like a magnetic field.

575
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:06,440
He uses that metaphor very, very explicitly in those lectures.

576
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:12,720
And so what we have then is the kind of introduction of a field theory, a theory of mine being

577
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,720
introduced, borrowed from physics, creating a new paradigm.

578
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,720
And I think this is the model that Jung himself was starting to develop.

579
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:26,240
Because by say 1934, he writes, James Kirsch wrote him a supervisory letter asking for

580
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,400
his advice about an explicit transference dream that a patient had.

581
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,880
And Jung gives him some support and advice on this.

582
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,760
And he says, but you know really, at the deepest level, we don't dream out of ourselves or

583
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,880
the other, but it's what lies between.

584
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,520
In an analytic process, he saw the dreams as being out of a co-created matrix that was

585
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,520
coming out of that.

586
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:51,520
What kind of scientific discussions do we have for the besides going into field theory?

587
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,520
Well, maybe I can poke a little bit further.

588
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:01,600
And first of all, what I try to describe in my earlier comment is the unease that practicing

589
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:07,800
researchers at these physical science, I'm sure, is a lot like this in their life sciences,

590
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:15,200
have when you can encourage people to draw a conclusion as to a correlation, a space on

591
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,480
meaning as opposed to only base on causality.

592
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,680
But now let me turn the table.

593
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:29,200
So let me turn the argument around and ask, in the realm of Jungian analysis, there is

594
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:35,760
a tendency to use some simplicity, of course, and to interpret the example that Beverly just

595
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,560
did with a patient.

596
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:47,240
The question I have is there should be to some extent a questioning of how much personal

597
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,760
bias is at stake.

598
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:54,480
So when you go around the corner and you think of a friend and you see him after 20 years

599
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,360
for the first time, because you thought of him, you have a tendency to amplify because

600
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:05,920
of your own experiences, maybe because of your own belief, Christian beliefs, religious beliefs,

601
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,480
maybe Jesus was behind it and so on, things that we do all the time.

602
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:17,440
So there seems to be, for it to be a universal, tenet or universal concept for simplicity

603
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:23,960
to be such a concept, there ought to be some more scrupulous analysis of when it is based

604
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,600
on meaning or when it is caused by amplification of personal bias.

605
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,880
We call that, when we teach our students, to do statistical analysis and find a correlation

606
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:40,840
that could be based on their bias, it is caused an error, one type, one of the worst things

607
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,280
you could do, number one, make sure it is not because you want to believe in the theory

608
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,880
that you saw this coincidence.

609
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:52,560
So is there such a burden that you guys uphold and how do you do it?

610
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:57,560
And how do you make sure that you are not saying, this is really meaning, this is really what

611
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:02,240
Jung had in mind, and not simply because I wanted to see a lobster.

612
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,240
Yes, of course.

613
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,600
I'll make a brief comment.

614
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:13,680
Yeah, and just that it was precisely so that we didn't create all magical levels of thinking

615
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,600
and the gods and goddesses are coming down and giving us a message when something unexpected

616
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:24,960
happens is to leave our minds sufficiently open, that we are the person who is perceiving

617
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:32,320
things, we are making the connections that just because we don't see the efficient cause

618
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:37,960
and effect aspect of it doesn't mean it's magical, it is something that has happened

619
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,440
to us.

620
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,840
If it hits us, if it affects us, then we grant it meaning.

621
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,640
It's not that there is meaning in my friend coming.

622
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:58,160
It's the surprise aspect and as I said, of the recognized universal survival emotion,

623
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,000
surprise is one of them.

624
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:08,200
So I sort of have always taken it that it's like a call to just be more alert and alive

625
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:14,240
and connected to certain levels of connection that I've not been so observant of.

626
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,440
But it's quite subjective in there.

627
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:22,320
But I also think that part of the answer is to not immediately jump to the fact, aha,

628
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,720
this is meaningful because I think you're absolutely right there, a ways in which our

629
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:31,880
bias will unconsciously, I mean the unconscious bias is obviously the most difficult to eliminate

630
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,880
from that.

631
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:39,840
And one of the things that one tries to do, I think, with this we might call Jungian neutrality

632
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:44,960
would be to hold the phenomena and watch what else happens, watch what else comes from the

633
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,680
field itself.

634
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:52,320
That I think rather than taking one event and taking that as a kind of definitive answer

635
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,360
to this kind of question, one sees what begins to follow.

636
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:01,680
So for example, I can give you some cases where I have had a synchronicity or something

637
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:07,280
that might be defined in that way with a patient and I've not particularly commented on it.

638
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,840
I've just held it in watched because I felt that it was an elliptical communication.

639
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:16,760
For example, with trauma patients, we can go to the brain neuroscience for just a second.

640
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,840
We know that when the amygdala is really active and there's a lot of fear and anxiety, there

641
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,320
are parts of the frontal lobe system that are going to shut down.

642
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,280
So they're putting things into language and probably even images are not going to happen

643
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,960
very readily with that sort of patient.

644
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,440
And under those conditions, the normal avenues of communication are blocked off.

645
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:41,880
The question is, are there more archaic forms of communication that might be possible, that

646
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:47,200
one has interactions that amplify that field that I was talking about, the interactive field,

647
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,160
gets charged effectively even though there isn't a verbal component.

648
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,880
And so then the question is to do a trajectory, to follow this over time.

649
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:01,440
So with a patient where I had a really striking, new manous kind of synchronicity where she

650
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,080
had a effectively a precognitive dream that it was only two days later that something happened

651
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:12,160
to me that precipitated the identical event at the level of image.

652
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,760
She had a dream that I was lost in the black forest.

653
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,920
I started to dive and it was in a site called the Black Forest.

654
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,920
Choral site.

655
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,200
Choral site, yeah, it's a black coral.

656
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,200
It was called the black forest.

657
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,120
That was the dive site name.

658
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,160
And I was just learning to dive.

659
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,160
So there was that kind of confluence.

660
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,080
I never disclosed this to the patient.

661
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:38,200
But what happened, and she had no idea where I was.

662
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,760
And there was no dive equipment.

663
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,880
I was rather scrupulous about making sure that piece of the communication wasn't involved.

664
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:51,000
She then had a series of dreams for example in which she was in great difficulty underwater

665
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,240
and I would show up and help her with what's called buddy breathing.

666
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,360
That is, you take the regulator and share it.

667
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,520
And this had to do with the kind of psychological rescue.

668
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:07,960
That felt to me like it was a reinforcement that the unconscious of the patient was interacting

669
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:13,600
in the field communicating back that what was synchronistically occurring between us

670
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:21,800
was in fact finding verification in her communicative system that was outside conscious ability.

671
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,640
And so it's following that over a period of a year or two that seems to me starts to

672
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,640
create a more evidential base that this is something other than just my personal bias

673
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,800
that's doing that.

674
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:37,240
Even though I must admit my personal bias got me very interested to start paying attention

675
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,040
to these details.

676
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:46,000
If I may draw out the microscopic examination, if I may draw out the microscopic examination

677
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,840
of synchronicity and talk about it from a macro scale.

678
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:57,640
What I mean by that is we've been talking as if so we have this phenomenon that people

679
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,320
seem to observe in psychology.

680
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,520
If they're young, young analysts, they see this and other people say.

681
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:10,240
So let's scrutinize that and see how we can examine this thing and what criteria count.

682
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:14,880
That's kind of a normal procedure of kind of going down to smaller and smaller levels

683
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,600
to try to find some verification that we can then replicate and so forth.

684
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,280
I want to draw back from that for a moment and then take some of the characteristics

685
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,480
that we've heard about about how do you tell if it's a synchronicity.

686
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,640
You follow the meaning.

687
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,680
You basically look for some larger context.

688
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:37,680
You're not just verifying one fact about the person but you're alerted to pay attention

689
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:42,320
now to see what else might be coming along that's meaningful in a broader sense than

690
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,960
that one instance.

691
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,960
Okay.

692
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,280
So essentially it comes down for example as we were just saying in a transference, counter

693
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,640
transference kind of situation where you're trying to figure out who's mind we're talking

694
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,080
about right now.

695
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:01,440
Is this something I'm projecting on the therapist or vice versa and sorting that out is very

696
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,280
important in therapy.

697
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,280
It's analogous to sorting out whether you're creating an effect by your instrument or whether

698
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:15,880
the phenomenon is actually responding naturally as it does.

699
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,320
Okay.

700
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:25,200
So what's missing I think from science as a whole has been is a degree of self-consciousness.

701
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,000
It's conscious but it's not self-conscious as it should be.

702
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,960
And what I mean by that for one example we had early on was just in this discussion.

703
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,440
Science doesn't talk about meaning.

704
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:41,440
It's a scientist who meaningful work but they don't study meaning.

705
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,200
What does that tell you?

706
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,560
That's a bizarre statement to make.

707
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:51,960
Back up from that we have scientists being so objective that they will essentially deem

708
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,000
themselves neutral on an ethical field.

709
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,320
My work is ethically neutral.

710
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,680
This is purely objective.

711
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,920
It has no subjective dimension whatsoever.

712
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,640
It doesn't matter whether I like it.

713
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,640
Don't like it.

714
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,920
I'm not surprised, find it meaningful, not meaningful.

715
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,880
I just took a measurement and I took a whole bunch of them.

716
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,400
And we know that there's no error.

717
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,680
One coming in here which is the data.

718
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,920
These are all good characteristics of science.

719
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:23,920
But when you pan back to a larger scale you see that science does have tremendous ethical

720
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,160
impact.

721
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,600
Scientists are not trained to see it as a matter of their discipline nor is society

722
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:38,760
prepared to do anything internally with the development of science until recently.

723
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,000
Sort of you let the thing roll along.

724
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Something horrible happens.

725
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,840
There's a government committee that tries to figure out what are the ethical implications.

726
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,840
What should we do?

727
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:51,840
But recently now we see that in fact there's a good recognition at least from the 60s on

728
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:59,280
that science does have tremendous aesthetic and ethical impact sort of inherent in it.

729
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:06,400
And I'll take you to a little bit of research now from observing scientists that work in

730
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,400
the lab.

731
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:12,520
And then maybe you've seen something like this yourselves.

732
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,280
So this goes to study in Arizona State University.

733
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:22,640
They're putting non-scientists in with scientists to observe them and to learn what science

734
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,120
in practice actually is.

735
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,800
They spend 12 weeks with them.

736
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:35,800
And so one of the first pilot studies of that the observer who was a social scientist

737
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:45,440
was asking the scientist how do you decide whether to do A or B. And for a good while

738
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,960
the scientist in question is the bench scientist chemistry nanotechnology.

739
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,320
I'm not making decisions.

740
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:56,200
I'm just carrying out the experiment.

741
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:01,560
And it took a while for the scientists to admit, well, I guess I did decide to do this

742
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,560
instead of that.

743
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,400
So there was a little bit, well, why did you do this instead of that?

744
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:11,680
So there was a gradual penetration of self-consciousness stimulated by the other, but

745
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:17,120
actually all going on internally in the mind of the scientist.

746
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,520
That particular story just to wind it up they had some problems with a particular material

747
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,360
they were using, some iron compound.

748
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,080
They couldn't get it in time.

749
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:31,160
It was the first time that this particular researcher had to sort of think about alternatives.

750
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:37,880
And he was prepared to do that rapidly because he had been questioning everything that normally

751
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,480
does not get questioned.

752
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:43,600
And so going to an alternative, iron compound turned out to be a great idea.

753
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:49,800
And suddenly you had a much more efficient, cleaner product coming out of this particular

754
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,400
line of nanochemistry.

755
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:59,640
Now not to say that that caused it, but the point is that the normal operating procedure

756
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:06,520
is not to ask questions that are self-reflexive, that would create a self-reflexive process

757
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:10,960
within science, kind of interferes because you have a procedure you carried out.

758
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:16,520
And doing too much of that seems to be sort of enhancing the subjective dimension which

759
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:21,920
we spent hundreds of years getting rid of in order to have a good scientific revolution.

760
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,240
So how is it that is coming back and what form can it come back that it now does not

761
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,600
interfere but enhances it?

762
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:34,840
That's related to this question of synchronicity but from a way out here and not near earth

763
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,480
orbit at this point.

764
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,840
So that's your orbit.

765
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,480
I think that's...

766
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:46,800
This is precisely one of the explosive aspects of talking about synchronicity and these meaning

767
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,760
related issues within the sciences.

768
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:56,480
I think this is explosive because the sociology of science tells us this scientist themselves

769
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,360
is exactly as you say.

770
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,280
They avoid this topic.

771
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,440
But at some point this needs to be brought in I think.

772
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:08,200
Another interesting issue which you may have read in the papers, some of you may read Nature,

773
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:16,040
some of you may read the Wall Street Journal, the issue of reproducibility, which is in

774
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,320
the basic sciences.

775
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:23,520
It's clear if something cannot be reproduced independently in another lab at another time

776
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:28,240
by other people and so on, this is not considered a scientific result.

777
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:34,200
Now we know when we go from physics to chemistry to other sciences to psychology for instance,

778
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:40,560
also to sociology and in between biomedical science is very important, right?

779
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:46,280
Where we have many problems with reproducing for instance results of preclinical studies

780
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:49,920
and not simply because the research is bad.

781
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,360
There are systematic reasons.

782
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,200
There are reasons in principle.

783
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,960
This tells us something too.

784
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,000
This tells us that there is a whole spectrum I would say when you start from the basic

785
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:07,160
sciences going, let's say upward or downward, I don't know, to the social sciences, then

786
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:13,720
the criteria which are the cornerstones for science, the methodology changes somehow.

787
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:19,840
I mean, for instance, in social sciences often what you never want to reproduce a single

788
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:26,000
number in an experiment, you want to reproduce pattern identification, something like that,

789
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
which is completely different, very qualitative and yet it's science, right?

790
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:38,560
So now where is the border where we go from the reproducibility of numbers, for instance

791
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,840
to the reproducibility of patterns?

792
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:47,840
Where is it precisely?

793
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:55,840
We don't know.

794
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:09,220
The guy just named Reed

795
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:14,220
the instantiation of the mind, the body mind.

796
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:15,660
Yeah.

797
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:18,580
I would like you to say if you could go further into that.

798
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:19,660
That was maybe a little bit bigger.

799
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,260
Yeah, that'd be great.

800
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,700
Yeah, I think so.

801
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:26,580
That has to do with, so why is the question,

802
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,220
if I may repeat it very quickly,

803
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:30,860
the question is why is synchronicity,

804
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:34,820
or why do I think that synchronicity is a kind of paradigm

805
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:37,540
example for the mind-body problem,

806
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:39,220
and how can we approach it?

807
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:44,980
I think two important topics have already been mentioned,

808
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:47,380
which are related to this question.

809
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:51,180
One of the topics is quantum holism.

810
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,180
You talked about this a lot.

811
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:56,500
The holism, the completely different holism

812
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,860
that we know in quantum mechanics

813
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:00,580
as compared to holistic features like

814
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:01,860
in system theory and so on.

815
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:06,060
I will lose some more words about this in a minute.

816
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,340
And the other one is that,

817
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:11,260
I think that's also why Pauli became so interested in it.

818
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:14,940
Meaning is not an issue that you can't ascribe to a state.

819
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,780
Meaning is an intrinsically relational issue.

820
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:22,700
The meaning is always something, consider a sign.

821
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,900
A sign is not the thing that has the meaning.

822
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:29,860
The sign indicates something, it refers to something

823
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:33,060
out there, and this reference relation,

824
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,060
that's why I'm saying it's a relational.

825
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,340
The reference relation of the sign,

826
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,820
that's where the meaning is.

827
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:41,300
So you cannot locate it here or there.

828
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,820
And Pauli immediately saw this,

829
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:46,220
that meaning might be an interesting concept

830
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:50,780
to relate the mental, as the state

831
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:53,820
that, for instance, the mental representation.

832
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:56,260
If it means something, then it refers to something

833
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,780
out there in the material world.

834
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:02,860
So the meaning, you think of an apple, or whatever it is.

835
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:05,420
Now then, what you refer to with this representation

836
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:08,100
is what you represent, namely the apple.

837
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:12,420
So that relation is, as I said,

838
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,420
it's an intrinsically relational notion.

839
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:18,780
It's also, in some sense, it has this appeal to holism,

840
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:22,100
because it connects two different things.

841
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,700
And so that's, I think, that is important with respect

842
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,820
to the notion of meaning, that we cannot localize it,

843
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:32,380
neither in the mental state of the subject,

844
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:35,500
nor in the stone, or in the apple,

845
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,460
or in the rock, which is outside there.

846
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:41,540
Now, how does that bend back to this quantum holism?

847
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:45,020
Now this is Pauli's other idea, because Pauli was,

848
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,220
I mean, if anybody at that time,

849
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:49,940
Pauli knew what quantum holism was about, namely.

850
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,020
To put it really radically, I mean,

851
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,940
we can discuss this, of course.

852
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:59,300
Systems in out there in nature, quantum systems,

853
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:03,380
do not present themselves as collections of parts.

854
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:06,820
They present themselves as holes to begin with,

855
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:10,620
and parts have to be created by interactions

856
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,500
with the system, for instance, by measurement,

857
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,540
for instance, something like that.

858
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,620
So the part, and then what happens is,

859
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:20,060
when you sort of destroy the wholeness,

860
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,300
by making an interaction with the system,

861
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:25,620
you generate the parts, but not only you generate the parts,

862
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:29,340
you also generate correlations between the parts.

863
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,540
And these are the remnants of the lost holness,

864
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:32,380
so to speak.

865
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:38,900
Now, in this idea together with this

866
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,980
intrinsically relational aspect of meaning,

867
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,340
was for Pauli something that he saw,

868
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,100
and the idea is the following.

869
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:49,940
He said, we have a, and this is the aspect of cosmology,

870
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:53,260
which Joe brought up half an hour ago.

871
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:57,460
Cosmology that is behind this picture is we have a kind of

872
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:00,380
psychophysically neutral domain of reality,

873
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:03,420
a basic reality, like in Spinoza.

874
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,900
A basic reality that doesn't know the matter

875
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:08,980
distinction at all.

876
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:13,780
And now, if this is considered in the analog

877
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:17,380
to quantum holism, if this is the hole,

878
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:20,580
you can separate it, you can make a distinction,

879
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:22,620
for instance, for the purpose of gaining knowledge

880
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,700
to be able to talk about things,

881
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,380
for the purpose of analysis,

882
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:29,300
and then you distinguish the psychic and the physical.

883
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,980
Once you do that, I mean,

884
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:35,500
staying in the analogy to quantum mechanics,

885
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,220
once you do that, you're not only making the distinction

886
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,540
between the two things, you also generate correlations.

887
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:46,060
So this analogy was what drove Pauli to believe

888
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,260
in this picture.

889
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,980
Of course, it's a conjecture, I mean this book, you know?

890
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:53,460
We called it the Pauli Jung conjecture,

891
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,860
because a conjecture is a hypothesis

892
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:59,260
which is unproven, but maybe plausible.

893
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,780
Okay?

894
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,460
That's why we called it that way.

895
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:07,300
So we have this idea of a psychophysically neutral

896
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,100
background reality which needs to be explored.

897
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,660
We don't know much about it.

898
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,220
I mean, for Jung, the archetypes and this kind of material

899
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:18,140
would be there somehow.

900
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,980
And then we make the distinction,

901
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,140
we generate, so to speak, the parts,

902
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:24,740
the mental and the material sub-domains.

903
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,580
And by making the distinction,

904
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,620
we also generate correlations.

905
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:32,020
In physics, we know how these correlations are,

906
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:35,180
can be studied, these are the EPR correlations,

907
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,860
you don't want to know this.

908
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:41,860
But the analog, the analog of these correlations,

909
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,260
now in a much broader picture, of course,

910
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:46,180
because now we are transcending physics,

911
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:50,100
are meaningful coincidences.

912
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,980
So that meaning is in some sense already implicit

913
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:57,580
in the undistinguished domain, but of course not explicated.

914
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:02,380
And it unfolds by making the distinction,

915
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:04,620
and then you see it in the correlation,

916
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,460
as a relational notion.

917
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:09,300
I think that's basically the picture.

918
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,380
And of course, I need to add,

919
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:14,740
this is just a sketch.

920
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:17,260
And it's an hypothesis.

921
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,940
But I think it's really worthwhile to study this

922
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:23,420
in more detail, and there are many aspects I can tell you.

923
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:25,340
I mentioned how, you know,

924
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,100
it's interesting how can research be done on this?

925
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:31,820
And what would be the practical implications?

926
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:35,140
So this is something we may still talk about,

927
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:38,300
but I just wanted, I think this picture is already

928
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,820
the core of the whole thing.

929
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:44,820
May I ask if people would prefer to have the air conditioning on again?

930
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:47,820
All right, so...

931
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:48,820
Quite.

932
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:55,820
I kept hearing the word physical and psychophysical.

933
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:59,820
It reminded me I'm hot.

934
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:02,820
So, break.

935
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,820
Yes, absolutely.

936
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:10,820
So, Joe?

937
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:15,820
I just wanted to come back to your question about more clinical information,

938
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:18,820
because I didn't try here to unpack that.

939
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:20,820
But let me say a little bit more.

940
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:24,820
I have to start with the value of the conjecture

941
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,820
that Harold's just put across.

942
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:32,820
It opened my eyes to something I couldn't see before I had this articulation.

943
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,820
That is the clinical observations we're making are epistemic,

944
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:38,820
and this is an ontological question.

945
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,820
And that's part of where we get...

946
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:44,820
I find myself confused at times with Jung's hypothesis,

947
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,820
because he doesn't make that distinction.

948
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,820
And so, if you don't know that ahead of time,

949
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:51,820
then you think the clinical observations are the explanation,

950
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,820
and that falls short.

951
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,820
That's part of the problem.

952
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:00,820
But one of the questions I had in starting this is also to add,

953
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:03,820
or about the way contemporary science would think about

954
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:05,820
different qualities of time.

955
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:09,820
Because I think when you look into this systemic approach,

956
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,820
one of the things you start to talk about,

957
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:12,820
Dan Stern, for example,

958
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:15,820
and the Boston Process of Change Study Group started to talk about

959
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:20,820
chyros, particular moments, that had a kind of analytic density to them.

960
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,820
And in those dense moments,

961
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,820
that's when these kinds of transformative,

962
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:28,820
phase transitions sort of experiences come about.

963
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:31,820
So, to go back to the Black Forest case,

964
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,820
and try to make it a little bit more understandable

965
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:36,820
in terms of clinical relevance,

966
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:40,820
in this situation, this was somebody who was highly traumatized,

967
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:44,820
who every time I went on any kind of travel,

968
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:46,820
I needed to hospitalize.

969
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:50,820
And in fact, we came to a complex agreement

970
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,820
that I would make a call when I was away,

971
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:57,820
and took a lot of supervision before I'd break that boundary to do that.

972
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:01,820
But nevertheless, this is where the Black Forest business came out.

973
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:07,820
And what happened is, in the phone interaction with her,

974
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:09,820
it was quite stabilizing.

975
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:13,820
I used a lot of reality testing and settled her down.

976
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:18,820
It was only the next day when I had the rather uncanny experience of this,

977
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:21,820
you know, dive into the Black Forest,

978
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:26,820
and how I processed that experience that I emerged from that

979
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:28,820
with a kind of new understanding.

980
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:31,820
If you look, for example, at the people who study

981
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:35,820
self-organizing systems that create emergent, you know, phenomena

982
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:39,820
that are more than the sum of the parts of these global things,

983
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:46,820
one of the observations is that those things are best looked for

984
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:49,820
at the edge of order and chaos.

985
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:51,820
Now, that's a very interesting notion.

986
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:55,820
If you say that emergent forms are most likely to occur,

987
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:59,820
if it's too organized, if it's too dense, too concentrated,

988
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:03,820
then things, in terms of forming life, everything polymerizes.

989
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:08,820
If it's too dilute and too chaotic, then nothing forms for long enough.

990
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:12,820
And so it's only at that particular emergent edge that you get these kind of phenomena.

991
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:16,820
Well, what happened in that case is that I provided a kind of reality testing

992
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:21,820
for my patient that was rather, you know, sort of order inducing for her.

993
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:25,820
What I hadn't seen was the chaos induction in myself.

994
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:30,820
And so that I had to adapt my analytic stance with regard to this patient

995
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:35,820
in terms of the way the field itself was embracing the two of us.

996
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:39,820
And that allowed me, once I could do that, is to truly see the black forest

997
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:45,820
as the image we were both in, rather than her dream image or my dive experience.

998
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:50,820
It was a larger holistic emergent form that was operative

999
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:51,820
in the clinical practice.

1000
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:55,820
And so then I could begin to keep my counter-transference eye

1001
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:58,820
on those kinds of forms as they were emerging.

1002
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:01,820
In the shorthand of what Beverly was saying about some of these things,

1003
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:05,820
one might note in one's counter-transference reveries, let's say.

1004
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:10,820
But one accumulates those in such a way that they begin to provide a reading of the field.

1005
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:14,820
And I think they do then give supervision to the clinician back.

1006
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:17,820
That would be my argument.

1007
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:20,820
You wanted to ask Edgar something?

1008
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:25,820
Well, I was asking about the whole question of the different qualities of time

1009
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:28,820
and how that might be thought about in contemporary science.

1010
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:36,820
Well, first I should say that by nature, I admit the way academic science is practiced

1011
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:38,820
is inherently conservative.

1012
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:42,820
And I think this is what Frasad was criticizing in some ways.

1013
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:52,820
So associating anthropological attributes or epithets to quality,

1014
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:57,820
to a quantity is one of the, there's a knee-jerk reaction against them.

1015
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:00,820
However, that doesn't mean that in the practice of science,

1016
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:04,820
people can be extremely creative and can break boundaries.

1017
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:09,820
But at the end of the day, a theory or an experiment is just very conservatively.

1018
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:12,820
Now, I thought, well, I'm learning to just summarize to the honest,

1019
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:14,820
at least what I'm learning from this.

1020
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:21,820
First, I started with a knee-jerk classical science critique of simplicity.

1021
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:28,820
And you responded, Frasad, for example, gave a very nice eloquent critique of science practice

1022
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:36,820
that lacks an element that he claimed very nicely that could enrich and enhance the practice of science.

1023
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:46,820
And Harald also added, first he explained that there's a spectrum of how science is practiced.

1024
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:53,820
And meaning, and the use of meaning in correlation, can be different from going from left to right.

1025
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,820
It's a spectrum, it's not either or.

1026
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:59,820
And I really think that's a wonderful thing I just learned tonight.

1027
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:03,820
But I have a question, actually mostly to Harald,

1028
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:11,820
given the fact that, originally, the concept of simplicity and quantum mechanics

1029
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:20,820
were to use a term entangled at birth because Paoli and Jung worked it out together,

1030
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,820
actually Jung did not contribute to quantum mechanics, of course,

1031
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:28,820
but Paoli, I think, did contribute to Jung's ideas, and he felt that there was an entanglement.

1032
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:37,820
After 62 years, there is a feeling, at least, that people who do not work on minor problems,

1033
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:51,820
that still know concrete scientific or explanation of physical phenomena

1034
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:54,820
that can be unambiguously attributed to simplicity.

1035
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:58,820
Is that the case, still the case, if so, why, and if that is the case,

1036
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:05,820
can you give us an example of how you think a direct contribution to understanding physical phenomena

1037
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:08,820
from that principle has come through?

1038
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:11,820
We need to respond to this right now.

1039
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:12,820
Yes.

1040
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:13,820
Yeah, I know.

1041
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:14,820
We'll start with questions.

1042
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:18,820
Yeah, I think we should open it also to the public, I guess.

1043
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:24,820
So there are several levels of answer to this question.

1044
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:25,820
I mean, for Paoli?

1045
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:26,820
Yes, we're going to do it.

1046
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:27,820
Himself.

1047
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:33,820
I think a large part of his own interest in this question was due to his own experiences,

1048
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:38,820
which you mentioned, the Paoli effect, because what does this tell us?

1049
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:43,820
I mean, you become sensitive to these ideas, not just because someone else tells you this might be interesting

1050
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:50,820
or study it, go into the lab, and so on, but I think the easiest way to really get involved with these issues

1051
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,820
is own experiences.

1052
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:58,820
That's level one, which is maybe almost trivial, but not quite.

1053
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:06,820
Then, of course, there have been quite a number of research labs which tried, really, in the lab,

1054
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:14,820
to set up paradigms or scenarios in which human subjects, with their mental intentions,

1055
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:18,820
can change what's going on out there in nature.

1056
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:23,820
I mean, for instance, of course, a radical example would be levitation.

1057
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:30,820
If I want you to lift off, right, and want it strong enough, at some point it should work, right?

1058
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:37,820
Unfortunately, in the lab, it didn't work so far.

1059
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:43,820
I mean, 700 years ago, there were these anecdotal evidences about Joseph of Copartino,

1060
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:53,820
I don't know how trustworthy these sources are, but I mean, there are so many, it's almost just Joseph of Copartino.

1061
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:59,820
He was shooting up, you know, not only like this, and then he was staying there,

1062
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,820
and at some point he can't.

1063
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:07,820
Anyway, so this is about violating a law of nature which we call the law of gravity, right?

1064
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:12,820
So this is a deterministic law, and then people realize in the lab we can't do it.

1065
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:20,820
So, maybe a good alternative is not really violating deterministic law, but violating statistical laws.

1066
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:25,820
And since you're, for Princeton, we know that in Princeton there was such a group, a group of Bob John,

1067
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:26,820
and they, what they tried is...

1068
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:31,820
By the way, my own advisor, even though he advised me in physics, but he was pericycology.

1069
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:33,820
What did you mention? I didn't want to mention it.

1070
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:35,820
He was my own advisor, right? And I'm very proud of that.

1071
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:36,820
No.

1072
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:37,820
It's an wonderful physicist.

1073
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:39,820
Yes, that's true. Yeah, that's true.

1074
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:46,820
And so what did they do? They did, they also had these human subjects with mental intentions,

1075
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:52,820
but it was not, the purpose was not violating deterministic laws of nature, like gravitational.

1076
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:58,820
The purpose was violating statistical laws, like when you have radioactive decay,

1077
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:05,820
you have no idea whatsoever what the individual particle does, but you know the statistical distribution of the lifetimes, right?

1078
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,820
That's what physics tells you.

1079
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:18,820
Now, of course, when you do the experiment often enough and long enough, then the hope was that you could change the average lifetime of, for instance,

1080
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:25,820
radioactivity decaying particles. They didn't do it with radioactive decay, but other groups did it with radioactive decay.

1081
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:34,820
And this is interesting now because there were many reports, which were, first of all, in the first instantiation,

1082
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:38,820
when the paper was published, they published an effect.

1083
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:48,820
Sometimes, sometimes immensely small, but statistically, if you do enough bits, then at some point you get statistical significance.

1084
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:53,820
Now, that was the first publication. The second publication, people tried to replicate this.

1085
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:58,820
Zero effect. Third publication, small effect, and so on and so on.

1086
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:04,820
So then some people came up with the idea, we do a meta-analysis of all these analyses,

1087
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:11,820
published in a prestigious journal, Foundation of Physics in 1989 or something like that.

1088
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:18,820
This meta-analysis showed that there was an effect averaged over all the studies that were published,

1089
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:25,820
but then additional points of criticism come up like publication bias, because all the studies that have no effect have not been published,

1090
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:30,820
so they could not go into the meta-analysis and on and on and on.

1091
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:39,820
So, you see, because if you have a decent journal and have no effect, I mean, what should they do?

1092
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:48,820
They don't publish it simply. But nevertheless, in a reasonable meta-analysis, all the materials should be included.

1093
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:57,820
So, this, I think, this is only one example. There are many more examples like remote viewing and others.

1094
01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:10,820
I think so far up to now, in the lab, this kind of mental influence on physical processes has not been convincingly demonstrated.

1095
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:16,820
And with that, we're going to open for the audience. Thank you, Carol.

1096
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:21,820
So, anyone who would like to ask a question, please do so here at the mic.

1097
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:27,820
Please, follow us who you are and limit it to one question.

1098
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:30,820
Through my bed.

1099
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:36,820
This is something that you help with this. Thank you. Thank you.

1100
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:43,820
Okay. So, I'm trying to put forth a proposition I'd like you to respond to, specifically this gentleman,

1101
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:57,820
Anne Harald, that attempts to correlate two things you spoke of. In terms of field theory, it has to do with the weak electromagnetic field generated by neocortical activity.

1102
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:11,820
And the other has to do with holism. And is it valid to say that within that sketch, that entanglement can be viewed as a hypercorrelative state?

1103
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:24,820
Okay. So, my question is, would it be an explanation for the individual person A, thinking of person B, going around the corner there as person B?

1104
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:37,820
So, if they had known each other before, and the weak link here is that entanglement is subject to subtle entanglement death from noise.

1105
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:50,820
But if they knew each other from before, then the interaction of the two electromagnetic neocortical electromagnetic fields could reactivate the neural activation pattern,

1106
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:54,820
which is how memories are stored of person B and person A's mind.

1107
01:28:54,820 --> 01:29:00,820
And so, it would not be, in fact, surprising that that person was around the corner when he turned that corner, but actually expected.

1108
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:10,820
And the experience of surprise would be because all of that kind of activity, as FRMR studies show, in well-constructed experiments,

1109
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:23,820
that the scientists conducting the experiment can determine what decision and decision experiment will be made by the activity in the limbic system prior to conscious choice,

1110
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:27,820
as if conscious choice is an after story.

1111
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:37,820
So, I'm suggesting that this kind of meaning and surprise is an after story caused by the interaction of these neocortical fields,

1112
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:41,820
where there is a hyper-correlative state between the two individuals in this particular example.

1113
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:46,820
And I'd like to respond to both of you for that, if you don't mind.

1114
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:52,820
Okay. So, experiments, am I, yes.

1115
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:57,820
Again, there are some experiments which have been made along similar lines, not precisely the same.

1116
01:29:57,820 --> 01:29:59,820
Yeah, the flashing light in one hand.

1117
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,820
Yes, exactly.

1118
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:09,820
And then, exactly. So, and what happened is, you had the subjects were selected like one subset of the subject,

1119
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:18,820
whereas people who were in some sense bonding to each other, exactly, to make sure that they know enough about themselves and so on and so on.

1120
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:23,820
And then there was a control group, right, with randomly selected subjects here and there.

1121
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:31,820
And the same happened as before, sometimes there are results, then people try to replicate, nothing and so on.

1122
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:36,820
Again, I mean, I'm not saying that this is completely hopeless.

1123
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:43,820
Maybe we have to think about this issue of reproducibility in novel ways, right? This may be possible.

1124
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:50,820
Now, the other aspect, I think, is much, is even more interesting than you mentioned, because what you say is,

1125
01:30:50,820 --> 01:31:01,820
we are not necessarily talking about conscious state, which generates these kinds of correlations, but unconscious states.

1126
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:03,820
And this is...

1127
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:04,820
Pre-conscious.

1128
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:08,820
Pre-conscious, oh, yeah, I mean, but not conscious yet, right?

1129
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:16,820
So, and I think this is the basic idea in this kind of proposal is very much in line with Jungian thought, I think,

1130
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:22,820
because for Jung, as I tried to indicate before, you know, the common...

1131
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:30,820
Let me call it the common cause, the holistic picture behind the correlations is, of course, in the unconscious.

1132
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:38,820
I mean, from Jung's point of view, you come to the psychophysically neutral reality through the unconscious, from Pauli's point of view,

1133
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:43,820
you come to the psychophysically neutral reality through quantum holism.

1134
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:52,820
But at the end, if the picture has something to it, at the end, the distinction between the mental and the material that solves.

1135
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:58,820
But it has to do with going deeper into the pre or unconscious, whatever.

1136
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:00,820
Well, this is, I think...

1137
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:01,820
Thank you.

1138
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:02,820
This is very interesting.

1139
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:07,820
As JJ Gibson said, he showed his psychology as not what is inside the head, but what the head is inside of.

1140
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:08,820
Inside, yeah.

1141
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:10,820
Collogical psychology, right, yeah.

1142
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:18,820
I'm hoping everyone can hear the speakers, and you're all still able to hear the speakers, so speak into the... into your mics.

1143
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:22,820
Just very briefly about the electrical...

1144
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:29,820
...electro-magnetic fields and so forth. I don't think we've got a whole understanding or description of the field yet.

1145
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:31,820
I think that's a contribution.

1146
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:40,820
Just think about what's come out in the last couple of years on the human microbiome, that you've got 90% of the cells in you on you are non-human.

1147
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:44,820
That you've got 23,000 genes, human genes.

1148
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:47,820
If you take the whole of you, you've got 8 million genes on you.

1149
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:49,820
So what are the communicative systems?

1150
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:55,820
There's all kinds of new experiments showing that there's changes in behavior as those microbiomes change.

1151
01:32:55,820 --> 01:33:05,820
Yeah, and so what... I would think these are also other very low-level aspects of this field, this psychological field that's generated.

1152
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:06,820
That's...

1153
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:07,820
Sure.

1154
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:08,820
Good question.

1155
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:17,820
Our audience, just to keep the questions brief, because we have many people waiting, and we can always take up things after the program is open.

1156
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:22,820
I'm Fritz Kessel, psychoanalysts, psychiatrist.

1157
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:30,820
The issue, I'm very glad the unconscious was finally mentioned. It was not mentioned in the entire, I think, in the entire presentation.

1158
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:37,820
The unconscious, that the unconscious was... that this phenomenon is probably very, very much related to the unconscious.

1159
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:56,820
And that the issue is, do you think that there's an archaic kind of phenomenological unconscious that is not psychodynamically meaningful that we would not very much use clinically because it doesn't have any psychodynamic meaning?

1160
01:33:56,820 --> 01:34:16,820
Versus slips of the tongue specific things that happen in dreams and so on that we do think are psychodynamic meaningful. And if we're very much over into that more archaic camp or just unconscious things kind of popping up that have no particular psychodynamic meaning,

1161
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:34,820
is that pathological? Are we starting to get involved in a hyperattachment to the patient? Are we so attached as when psychoanalysts presented it that her periods coincided with the patient's periods?

1162
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:48,820
Are we so unconsciously overattached that we are making these, concocting these kind of synchronicities that may be more symptomatic of...

1163
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:52,820
We're just too attached to the patients.

1164
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:55,820
Sure. I think this is again a question about...

1165
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:56,820
Could you speak louder?

1166
01:34:56,820 --> 01:35:02,820
This is again a question about the attribution of meaning, I think, and the role of counter-transference that Edgar was raising in there.

1167
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:13,820
Yeah, I think that's always a bias. I think though, if you'd let me expand it just slightly, is there a repressed unconscious that's wholly divorced from more primitive layers?

1168
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:21,820
I suspect that these bleed into one or another, that we're looking at spectrum phenomena and it's very difficult to have a complete cut off.

1169
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:32,820
I mean, I know Freud's arguments about... Because his interest in telepathy and his insect examples where he felt that there are chaotic modes of communication.

1170
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:44,820
The problem is that what happens when some of these archaic modes get operating in the therapy that may be because of traumatic situations that are extra therapy.

1171
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:52,820
They're not about necessarily therapeutic attachment, but actually the preconditions that the person's bringing in.

1172
01:35:52,820 --> 01:36:01,820
Then I would say that those become therapeutically relevant. It's an associative model rather than just a repressed model, and that's the kind of patience I was talking about.

1173
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:16,820
I'm joining Erin Berg. Several thoughts, but I think the issue of unconscious communication has not really been brought up in a way that it seems to me is very important.

1174
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:32,820
I think starting with forensic paper, 1933, confusion of tongues, I think the issue of whose experience are you experiencing and to what extent we carry the feelings of the other without even knowing it at the moment.

1175
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:51,820
It seems to me that in my own work with patients, there are times in some of my writing, what I've focused on is the counter-transferances often are most important tool for understanding what's going on with the patient and vice versa.

1176
01:36:51,820 --> 01:37:07,820
I think the whole idea of negative therapeutic reaction, I think at this point we understand that often it's more the impact of the analyst that's provoking that rather than it has to do with the patient.

1177
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:26,820
I'm also thinking about the case you mentioned, and it seems to me my experience, and I think in that kind of case where you have to hospitalize the patient when you're away, there is something about the connection that is absolutely vital.

1178
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:39,820
There are certain patients who my experience is if I leave them a number when I'm away and there's an emergency they will call me and they will survive. If I gave them someone else's name, they would fall apart.

1179
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:49,820
Now this is the same stuff that goes on between mothers and children, that if the mother is present in one minute you can calm the baby.

1180
01:37:49,820 --> 01:38:03,820
A babysitter, it might go, maybe it might be hysterical for hours. So it seems to me the personal connection is somehow very important and I just feel maybe it should be more included in this.

1181
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:21,820
I would appreciate if you ask questions or if they make comments, you can always make your comments later, but feel like you can focus on asking your question.

1182
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:35,820
I'm not really sure if you're interested in any training. And here is two sentences to lead to my question.

1183
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:57,820
The question is, what does the question mean to the children in this state a moment in a connection between the two? It seems a little kind of information that is connecting or circulating in ways that none of the explanation that we have in science can explain, right?

1184
01:38:57,820 --> 01:39:07,820
Then there was this interesting point about how science manages things. A very important thing in science is to be able to predict, right?

1185
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:18,820
Your hypothesis is solid if you can predict the system. And of course with synchronicity you have a problem, which is that it's unpredictable.

1186
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:35,820
So I was wondering, would you guys be considering that maybe what we call synchronicity is just the unpredictable part of a phenomenon that might be much more general, but we can't see?

1187
01:39:35,820 --> 01:40:00,820
And I have two examples that I think you could tell me if it's relevant or not. Two things. I was always kind of interested in all those experiments that show that cognition can go occur sometimes much faster than any neuronal connection can go.

1188
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:09,820
You just flash people with the minimum information and they catch it way before the whole thing, you know, the whole physiology should be able to say it. That's one thing.

1189
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:28,820
The other thing is, and another thing that really fascinates me is the way group of organisms can work together in ways that I think are difficult to explain with usual neural patterns.

1190
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:39,820
I think of birds and fish and I'm done. Which is that? So do you guys see something interesting there or not?

1191
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:42,820
Well, Harold had it, I think.

1192
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:46,820
I think the first reaction is like a tennis player, right?

1193
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:50,820
Oh, it's just not on you.

1194
01:40:50,820 --> 01:41:09,820
The typical example that is often discussed is a tennis player who receives the ball from the other one within, I don't know, as you say, it's a timescale which is far too fast, far too short, I should say, to plan a controlled reaction and then put the racket in this way.

1195
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:20,820
So that's typically explained by anticipation.

1196
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:36,820
Anticipation, the experience tennis player anticipates by the movement of his opponent what he will do where the ball will go and before even the opponent plays the ball, he already arranges his action planning and so on to hit the ball to where it might come.

1197
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:45,820
I would like to say this is a perfect example of using causality to illustrate something that could have been interpreted by somebody else as coincidence of meanings.

1198
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:48,820
There's a perfectly causal physical reality.

1199
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:53,820
But this is, I think, this is the conventional wisdom about the story.

1200
01:41:53,820 --> 01:42:00,820
Now, I think the other question is, I mean, for the work that I'm doing is even more interesting.

1201
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:16,820
Namely, the question whether we might have a spectrum from very, very unusual and very, very in quotation marks, meaningful synchronicities down to something which we observe like an everyday basis.

1202
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:32,820
And I think one of the predictions that the Paul Jung conjecture makes is that this should be the case.

1203
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:46,820
And those experiences that Jung originally highlighted as numinous synchronicities experiences, they are in a sense the tip of the iceberg. So what are the normal correlations?

1204
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:54,820
One, my favorite candidate for those are correlations between brain states and mind states within a person.

1205
01:42:54,820 --> 01:43:02,820
These correlations are completely ununderstood, not understood at all. Everybody knows they are there. But we feel that we are in a conscious state.

1206
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:06,820
Of course, everybody assumes, yeah, the brain must do something.

1207
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:16,820
But what, I mean, neural correlates of consciousness don't tell us anything. It's just the measurement of a correlation, but it's nothing about the origin of the correlation.

1208
01:43:16,820 --> 01:43:26,820
You see? So these are totally, you can look at the whole area of psychosomatic, which is a similar example.

1209
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:37,820
And I think these whole, the framework of thinking that Paul Jung posed, right, gives us an idea to understand this whole spectrum.

1210
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:48,820
I cannot move my right arm. This whole spectrum between a total over emphasis of meaning, right? Yes, thank you. Thank you.

1211
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:56,820
These would be the coincidence phenomena. And then you go to the baseline, you go to the ordinary experiences.

1212
01:43:56,820 --> 01:44:04,820
And then the prediction would be that on the other side, where you don't have coincidences, you have dissociations.

1213
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:13,820
And this is another kind of exceptional experience, which we know that happened, a paradigmatic example out of body experiences, right?

1214
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:21,820
Out of body experiences, the mindness of my body is no longer, does no, it's somehow interrupted.

1215
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:28,820
So I see my body as if from an outside perspective, and that's precisely the opposite of coincidence.

1216
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:36,820
So this is all part of the picture. And so now we're talking about pattern reproducibility.

1217
01:44:36,820 --> 01:44:40,820
And this kind of stuff has been reproduced already in the last years.

1218
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:44,820
So there's a lot, I'm only saying that very shortly because we don't have a lot of time.

1219
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:54,820
But there's a lot of interesting research going on, but not in terms of reproducing individual effects, but reproducing now patterns,

1220
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:59,820
patterns of behavior, patterns of experiences, something like this. Thank you for that question.

1221
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:00,820
It's a great opportunity.

1222
01:45:00,820 --> 01:45:08,820
But if we could get a power law relationship of those spectrum phenomena, then we could begin to point to an underlying unifying phenomena,

1223
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:15,820
even though we can't describe what it is. In other words, if there's a spectrum and we do an intensity, frequency, log log plot,

1224
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:21,820
and we get a straight line, then it indicates that we've got the same fundamental phenomena going on,

1225
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:25,820
that would be interesting to think of how to do that experiment.

1226
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:35,820
My question actually is exactly about patterns. I'm a young analyst, and I would like to just say that most of my experiences

1227
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:39,820
of synchronicity that I use clinically are not with particularly traumatized patients.

1228
01:45:39,820 --> 01:45:45,820
I wouldn't want us to think that that's a prerequisite for some kind of synchronicistic event.

1229
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:50,820
Mostly the things happen to my patients outside and they come in and they want to talk about how did that happen.

1230
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:53,820
What does that mean?

1231
01:45:53,820 --> 01:46:01,820
I'd like you to talk. I'd like all of you to throw this out to talk about the correlation between pattern,

1232
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:07,820
because usually it feels big because it's replicating something. It's amplifying something.

1233
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:17,820
Meaning, pattern meaning and hope, because there's always a upswing, a charge when something synchronicity happens,

1234
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:23,820
where the patients come in feeling like there's a moment of hope that this could mean something.

1235
01:46:23,820 --> 01:46:33,820
This could mean something. I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about the correlation between pattern making, meaning and hope.

1236
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:37,820
Thank you.

1237
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:43,820
I'll take a shot at that from way out again.

1238
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:53,820
The pattern making, I think the primordial synchronicity, this is what I think you were saying, Harold,

1239
01:46:53,820 --> 01:47:00,820
is that our minds and bodies go together, that brain state, and that's constant nonstop.

1240
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:02,820
I'm thinking about reproducibility.

1241
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:12,820
Then when you come to pattern making, because we're talking about coincidences, two things happening that ordinarily may mean nothing at all,

1242
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:18,820
could just be a correlation, which is useless from a scientific point of view, or it could have meaning.

1243
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:25,820
This depends on the person. A lot of that is essentially the work of metaphor.

1244
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:33,820
A metaphor that works is not always universal, but it'll work very tightly for some situation or other.

1245
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:46,820
What occurs to me regarding the hope thing is that in the writings of mystic, Sufi mystics, this is 11th, 12th century,

1246
01:47:46,820 --> 01:47:56,820
basically the technique, they talk about the imaginal world between the pure invisible stuff and the pure material stuff.

1247
01:47:56,820 --> 01:48:03,820
That's where the work goes on, not in the so-called archetypal realm, maybe or the material realm, but in between.

1248
01:48:03,820 --> 01:48:08,820
And in that in between, there's a lot of image formation going on.

1249
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:11,820
How does that correspond to what we're talking about? That's what metaphor is.

1250
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:14,820
You're throwing two things together and looking between them.

1251
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:20,820
And finally, the way they did this was very much like Jungian active imagination.

1252
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:26,820
A hypnagogic state, they would explicitly put themselves in there, and then they would just go forward,

1253
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:32,820
and they would take the prophecies of the boron in the case of the Sufis.

1254
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:38,820
And this is woodwork elsewhere too, of course, is to take those things and take them forward.

1255
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:45,820
So, as Ebeneh Araby said, this is the land of prophecy, where prophecies are true, is only in this realm of the imaginal.

1256
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:47,820
That's where it's true, and that's where the hope is.

1257
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:52,820
So, look forward, Michael Scott, we in a lab for, you know, in one case, you're looking in the wrong place,

1258
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:57,820
because you're trying to universalize something that's individual.

1259
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:03,820
Yeah, Kay, I'll read it.

1260
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:04,820
Hello.

1261
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:06,820
Oh, anxious.

1262
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:15,820
What I have to do to say has to do with somehow the words I have a co-creative, inter-subjective fields,

1263
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:23,820
more archaic, archaic but not meaning, and very much counter-transference.

1264
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:26,820
I'm a music psychotherapist.

1265
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:29,820
I have a lot of Jungian background training.

1266
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:38,820
So, our whole field in the creative arts is co-creative, everything we do, and it's not like you're over there,

1267
01:49:38,820 --> 01:49:41,820
and I'm sitting this close to the client.

1268
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:46,820
I was talking about this with my supervisor, who didn't really get it.

1269
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:48,820
You know, you're not way over there and protected.

1270
01:49:48,820 --> 01:49:54,820
You're right here with me, and we do, we write music together, we sing together,

1271
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:58,820
and there's something I do called pre-associative singing, right?

1272
01:49:58,820 --> 01:50:02,820
So, we're just free associating, but we're doing it through music.

1273
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:05,820
I'm playing, they sing, and I sing.

1274
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:11,820
Now, what happened recently, and just throwing this out to get your opinion,

1275
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:16,820
because it kind of freaked me out, was I'm singing with this woman.

1276
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:21,820
She is dissociative, and it's happened now about five times, and we've discussed it,

1277
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:24,820
is basically the technique.

1278
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:27,820
She'll sing a word, and I'll repeat it.

1279
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:29,820
She'll sing, and I'll add to it.

1280
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:32,820
She'll sing another word, but I'm right there with her.

1281
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:37,820
Somehow, in this process, her dissociation, which you all know happens,

1282
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:40,820
got to me, and I started to, like, go under.

1283
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:46,820
But what happened is when I went under, it's like I went into a trance,

1284
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:53,820
and I was having my own dream, and all of a sudden, I sang my brother's holding a sign

1285
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:57,820
that says, I'm a teddy bear, and she said, what?

1286
01:50:57,820 --> 01:50:59,820
And I, like, snapped out of it.

1287
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:04,820
And because this has happened before, she said, what happened?

1288
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:10,820
I said, I don't know, and I don't know if that was part of related to you,

1289
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:16,820
or that was related to me, or that was co-created and related to both of us,

1290
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:18,820
and I'm wondering what you think.

1291
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:22,820
It's happened, like, four times, and I have four or five, so.

1292
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:26,820
Well, I think that relates to a lot of what Darlene was saying,

1293
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:31,820
that this kind of, where the question of ownership and individual psyche

1294
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:38,820
is itself a model that's too limited to completely describe these kind of phenomena.

1295
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:43,820
You're looking at genuinely co-construct, and it has something I think to do

1296
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:45,820
with the porosity of the mind.

1297
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:50,820
In those kind of relationships, the deeper you enter into an affective,

1298
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:54,820
empathic relationship, there's a kind of porosity, and one has to be careful about that as well.

1299
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:59,820
It's both wonderful in terms of the connection, but if you think of complexity,

1300
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:03,820
one of the things in terms of creating complexity is you have to break symmetry,

1301
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:04,820
you have to lower symmetry.

1302
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:09,820
Therefore, when you're in a very tight empathic relationship, it's highly symmetric.

1303
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:13,820
And to create more psychic structure, there has to be a rupture.

1304
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:15,820
In fact, I think your patient did that.

1305
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:19,820
She disrupted you, and something more complex could come of that.

1306
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:24,820
My name is Valerie, I'm a writer.

1307
01:52:24,820 --> 01:52:28,820
Every experience of synchronicity that I've had has been helpful.

1308
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:32,820
It's felt like a great gift encouraging and supporting my growth.

1309
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:38,820
So assuming that at some point, synchronicity will be proved as scientifically happening,

1310
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:44,820
whatever that means, just taking the next step from this, what could it be for?

1311
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:50,820
I mean, is it possible that there is some substance, some force that could only be serving,

1312
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:57,820
healing, and growth, because synchronicity never seems to happen as...

1313
01:52:57,820 --> 01:53:02,820
Yeah, that's an extremely good question, and it's something I should have said right up front.

1314
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:08,820
That in the way Jung uses the word synchronicity, it is only a synchronicity

1315
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:14,820
and the person who is observing it and making the connections,

1316
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:21,820
internalizes it in such a way that it leads to some expansion and deepening of consciousness.

1317
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:27,820
Until it gets to that point, it's a synchronous event, but not synchronicity.

1318
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:33,820
And I should have said that, and thank you so much for forcing me to say it right now, reminding me.

1319
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:34,820
Thank you.

1320
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:38,820
I just have time for two more questions.

1321
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:39,820
Hi, my name is Dan.

1322
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:43,820
I'm a student in cognitive science.

1323
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:52,820
So I'm aware of at least one mathematical equation, the HKB equation for people that aren't familiar,

1324
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:57,820
Hans Kelsobun's equation that attempts to model coordination.

1325
01:53:57,820 --> 01:54:02,820
And so I was wondering whether the esteemed speakers were aware of this equation,

1326
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:10,820
whether they could say something and whether or not synchronicity is conceptually distinct from coordination.

1327
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:13,820
Did I say coordination and synchronicity or distinct?

1328
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:14,820
Yeah.

1329
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:19,820
Can you put that question on the blackboard, please?

1330
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:20,820
What is the equation?

1331
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:23,820
I didn't understand what the equation was.

1332
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:31,820
HKB equation, which attempts to...

1333
01:54:31,820 --> 01:54:32,820
I don't have to...

1334
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:38,820
I mean, I'm aware of the equation, but I'm not an expert, so I'll try to at least explain it.

1335
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:46,820
The HKB equation is a mathematical equation that attempts to account for finger coordination between subjects.

1336
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:54,820
And so the observation is that finger subjects begin out of synch with one another

1337
01:54:54,820 --> 01:55:04,820
in certain conditions they begin to go into sync.

1338
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:07,820
That HKB, that stands for three names.

1339
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:12,820
One of them is Herman Harken, the founder of the field of genetics,

1340
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:18,820
which is the theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and many other things.

1341
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:22,820
So Harken, then the second one is K, Scott Kelso in Florida,

1342
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:27,820
and the third one was a PhD student, Heinrich Bunz, B, U, and Z.

1343
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:31,820
And indeed, they were modeling with tools of non-linear dynamics,

1344
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:38,820
these processes in which motions, I mean, in that case, finger motions,

1345
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:44,820
from an asymmetric state spontaneously go into the symmetric state.

1346
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:48,820
It happens spontaneously, not only with finger movements, but with many other movements too.

1347
01:55:48,820 --> 01:55:55,820
In other words, you cannot maintain the asymmetric motion for an arbitrary long time.

1348
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:56,820
It's not possible.

1349
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:57,820
Why?

1350
01:55:57,820 --> 01:56:04,820
Because the potential that describes the whole situation has a deeper minimum for this symmetric motion.

1351
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:08,820
And then at some point, for some people it takes long, for some people not so long,

1352
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:11,820
they relax into the deeper minimum.

1353
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:13,820
That's the stable thing.

1354
01:56:13,820 --> 01:56:17,820
That's something like the principle of least action, you know, if you want.

1355
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:22,820
But before we go to the next question, I'm still stuck on the last two questions,

1356
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:24,820
digesting some of what I heard.

1357
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:29,820
And it occurred to me just right now that I just learned something very important

1358
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:34,820
for myself, education, which is the relationship between meaning and hope.

1359
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:40,820
What I heard is once you experience the synchronicity and see meaning,

1360
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:44,820
it opens up hope, that's what the lady who asked the question mentioned.

1361
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:50,820
And Beverly even went further saying that actually only when you do that feedback

1362
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:56,820
and see benefits, you register it and see that you're opening it up,

1363
01:56:56,820 --> 01:57:01,820
that you are experiencing what Jung was talking about.

1364
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:07,820
That makes me understand synchronicity as very successful, potentially successful

1365
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:11,820
therapeutic mechanism based on some feedback mechanism.

1366
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:19,820
And therefore even less, possibly less relevant to explain physical science.

1367
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:21,820
It's like explaining religion.

1368
01:57:21,820 --> 01:57:24,820
The piety mechanism that makes you feel better.

1369
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:28,820
When you go to church and you very pious, we actually feel better.

1370
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:29,820
It's like a rush.

1371
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:35,820
And that is a mechanism that you cannot necessarily, this has no relevance to science.

1372
01:57:35,820 --> 01:57:40,820
The more at the end of the session, I'm realizing more and more that this is a wonderful

1373
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:43,820
therapeutic mechanism that's been successful.

1374
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:49,820
But I'm becoming more and more skeptical as to one need to explain it scientifically.

1375
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:56,820
At the end of the day, what makes you feel good doesn't necessarily mean that there's a meaning there.

1376
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:59,820
But Edgar, what you're not.

1377
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:06,820
If I want somebody to levitate and really want to levitate, the person I can bet as a scientist would not levitate.

1378
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:11,820
But I can imagine somebody to feel good having the image of that person levitating.

1379
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:12,820
Okay.

1380
01:58:12,820 --> 01:58:20,820
Oh, but Edgar, what is quite different from what you're saying is, first of all, one doesn't make a synchronicity happen.

1381
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:30,820
We do not use it as a therapeutic tool because there's absolutely no way that you would know what would really be surprising to a patient

1382
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:34,820
except that it would be shocking in some way, which is not too...

1383
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:37,820
So it's not something one does to the other.

1384
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:38,820
It happens to me.

1385
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:49,820
The only way that... why it's a question at all is how do we understand the fact that so many people experience

1386
01:58:49,820 --> 01:59:00,820
untoward a causal, unexpected, multiple coincidences that come together, that somehow matches up.

1387
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:03,820
Something that happens on the outside to the inside.

1388
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:10,820
It's not to say we have to explain it for what it is, but why does it so often happen?

1389
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:15,820
What's the point of so many people having these kinds of experiences?

1390
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:21,820
I guess the answer that we're hearing is possibly because it does help you feel better.

1391
01:59:21,820 --> 01:59:24,820
No, sometimes it makes you feel terrible.

1392
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:25,820
That's not always the case.

1393
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:30,820
You dream about somebody you absolutely cannot stand and then you get a...

1394
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:35,820
I thought you said yourself that it's only satisfied the quite tree of simplicity

1395
01:59:35,820 --> 01:59:38,820
when it leads to some self.

1396
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:39,820
No, no, no.

1397
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:40,820
Oh, yes, no.

1398
01:59:40,820 --> 01:59:45,820
Countessness, but sometimes what you become conscious of is what you used to want to know about yourself.

1399
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:46,820
I see.

1400
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:47,820
It doesn't mean it's bad.

1401
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:48,820
No, okay.

1402
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:49,820
It doesn't...

1403
01:59:49,820 --> 01:59:50,820
Okay.

1404
01:59:50,820 --> 01:59:51,820
So the last question here.

1405
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:52,820
Thank you.

1406
01:59:52,820 --> 01:59:59,820
First, I just want to say it's been an amazing experience to listen to you all with your different perspectives

1407
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:01,820
very exciting.

1408
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:02,820
And...

1409
02:00:02,820 --> 02:00:09,820
I'm Janine DePyer and I'm very interested in the topic of telepathy.

1410
02:00:09,820 --> 02:00:18,820
So I think my question really is coming from a place of wondering why did everyone come today?

1411
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:20,820
What is it that's motivating us?

1412
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:21,820
Yes.

1413
02:00:21,820 --> 02:00:28,820
And what is the motivation of each of you to pursue your various lines of inquiry and interest?

1414
02:00:28,820 --> 02:00:36,820
Because mine as a psychoanalyst is, I suppose today, looking at it clinically, like some of you have mentioned

1415
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:39,820
about the value of this potentially clinically.

1416
02:00:39,820 --> 02:00:45,820
But just as some of you have said, there are times when I think, what the heck, you know, what is all this about

1417
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:47,820
and why is it even important?

1418
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:52,820
What draws me into it is, of course, a personal connection to it, having had experiences of it.

1419
02:00:52,820 --> 02:00:54,820
But I don't know if all of you have.

1420
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:59,820
So I'm just interested to know what brought each of you into your field.

1421
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:02,820
And of course, I'd love to know from everyone else why you're here.

1422
02:01:02,820 --> 02:01:04,820
But just with you, eminent speakers, I'd love to know that.

1423
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:05,820
Thank you.

1424
02:01:05,820 --> 02:01:07,820
You go with time.

1425
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:09,820
Let me just prepare the participants.

1426
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:11,820
There is going to be one more question.

1427
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:13,820
One more question, okay.

1428
02:01:13,820 --> 02:01:21,820
I think that the electromagnetic field illusion was a great addition to the discussion.

1429
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:22,820
Hold on.

1430
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:24,820
Let me do this.

1431
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:28,820
I think that the electromagnetic field illusion you made was a great addition to the discussion, as it can provide,

1432
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:34,820
the so-called light at the end of the tunnel, you know, for your search towards synchronicity.

1433
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:40,820
And perhaps one day we will find that our brains do in fact impact, you know, the neurocortical fields of others.

1434
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:43,820
However, as far as we're concerned, that's not the case right now.

1435
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:48,820
You know, in your discussion of the Paul Young conjecture, there were a number of references to wholeness,

1436
02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:53,820
the meaningful coincidences, you know, in a scientific world dominated by doubt and scrutiny in its history,

1437
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:58,820
things like Heisenberg, uncertainty principle, Grodel's and completeness theorem, you know,

1438
02:01:58,820 --> 02:02:05,820
with synchronicity, just a way to feel better about the unknown, or are you all confident that you will one day find the equivalent of the fair day discovery of the magnetic field?

1439
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:08,820
I don't know about feeling better.

1440
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:11,820
I don't know if the better came into this.

1441
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:14,820
You know, maybe I can't say something about this issue.

1442
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:15,820
Please.

1443
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:18,820
I think people better really just say it in a way.

1444
02:02:18,820 --> 02:02:21,820
You know, understanding if understanding something is feeling better about it.

1445
02:02:21,820 --> 02:02:22,820
Yeah.

1446
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:28,820
That's a different level than I would say. The experience itself is not necessarily feeling better.

1447
02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:32,820
You know, we have in the Freiburg Institute where I'm also a part-time working.

1448
02:02:32,820 --> 02:02:39,820
We have a counseling unit there, and in the last 15 years we have seen about 2,000 actually clients which come,

1449
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:45,820
and some of them ask for advice because the experience that they have,

1450
02:02:45,820 --> 02:02:50,820
synchronicity experiences, telepathy, extracellular perception, what do you want, you know?

1451
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:56,820
They are deeply troubling them. They experience them as negative and burdening.

1452
02:02:56,820 --> 02:03:01,820
I mean, not everybody. It's almost like half and half.

1453
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:08,820
There are some who really feel that this is enriching their life and they interpret it very positive.

1454
02:03:08,820 --> 02:03:12,820
That's the whole thing, right? But others are, and it's the half.

1455
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:14,820
It's the other half.

1456
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:18,820
They cannot get along with these experiences at all.

1457
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:28,820
And now, if you ask a psychiatrist, we have a psychiatrist in the lab actually in this group.

1458
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:35,820
And the psychiatrist, when he hears what these people report, he opens his manual, the DSM,

1459
02:03:35,820 --> 02:03:46,820
the IV, or V now, and then he looks it up, and then he sees, this is a very severe precursor for schizophrenia, for instance.

1460
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:52,820
You see what I mean? So what I'm saying is these experiences are completely ambivalent.

1461
02:03:52,820 --> 02:03:59,820
Some patients, or some clients, we don't have patients, clients report them positively, others report them negatively,

1462
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:10,820
and even the progressive psychiatrist, who, there is no discrete distinction between healthy and diseased,

1463
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:19,820
but things about the continuum, he would insist that these phenomena are on a spectrum from healthy to dysfunctional.

1464
02:04:19,820 --> 02:04:27,820
And the convinced psychiatrist, even of the modern continuum type, would completely dismiss the positive side.

1465
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:33,820
And I think it's the interesting thing is that not that everything is positive.

1466
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:41,820
The interesting thing is that given the normal assumption that they are all dysfunctional, we also have positive cases.

1467
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:43,820
That's the interesting thing.

1468
02:04:43,820 --> 02:04:46,820
And so with that, there's so much more to say.

1469
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:47,820
Yes.

1470
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:53,820
One thing that I would like to point out is to point me in thanking the panelists for a wonderful discussion,

1471
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:59,820
especially Beverly Tsubrissi for organizing a wonderful discussion. Thank you.
