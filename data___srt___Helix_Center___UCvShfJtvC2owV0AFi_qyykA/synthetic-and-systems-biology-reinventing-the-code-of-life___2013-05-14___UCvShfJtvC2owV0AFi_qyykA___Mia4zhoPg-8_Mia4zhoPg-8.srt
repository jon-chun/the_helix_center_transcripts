1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The Helix Centre.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,600
I'm Ed Narsesian, Director of the Helix Centre.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,000
Welcome to this program on synthetic and systemic biology.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Before Rob Panzer introduces the participants and tells you a word or two about our future programs,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'd like to say that the meeting will last around an hour, an hour or 15 minutes.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
After that you'll have time to ask questions.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But please ask questions rather than making commentaries.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I think it works better that way. Thank you.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So let me tell you first about some upcoming events.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
On Saturday, May 18th, from 6.30 to 8.30, we're going to have the second annual heavy mental variety show.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's a night of mind, brain and magic.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The amygdalaids led by neuroscientist Joseph Ladoux

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
will play several suites of original songs on mind brain topics,

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the mind body problem, memory, emotion, unconscious processes and mental disorders.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Each suite will be preceded by a short lecture on the scientific or philosophical foundations of the topic.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Also, internationally acclaimed magician Mark Mitten will dazzle you with mind bending

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and brain twisting tricks of his trade. Doors open at 6.15.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Admission is $10 without drink tickets and $17 for tickets with two beers or glasses of wine.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Saturday, June 8th, altruism and empathy is a program with Stephanie Brown, Alan Leslie,

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wind Schwartz and others.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Then there are some round tables that are in the works for September,

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but I want to make special emphasis on a symposium that will be holding on October 12th and 13th

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
in co-sponsorship with the Algama Foundation of Switzerland.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It will be a two-day symposium exploring the significance of the work of A.B. Warburg

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
for art, science and psychoanalysis.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We will re-examine his work through the compound lenses of current knowledge of dynamic memory,

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
the Freudian unconscious and historical scholarship.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It will be an international gathering of scholars drawn from the arts and sciences

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
featuring round tables, exploring Warburg's ideas and their adenbrations,

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and will focus on neurostatics, memory and unconscious psychosis and creativity,

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and Bizwanger and Warburg. Bizwanger was his psychiatrist at one point,

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and classical and renaissance art.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Also, the evening preceding it, Friday the 11th, will feature the

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Mignoloids returning for a pre-symposium performance, and joining us at the symposium

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
thus far, or historian Christopher Johnson, historian and psychoanalyst Peter Loenberg,

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let me go on now to today's program.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No. As soon as we have the definite times of the round tables

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and the confirmed other participants will put it up on the website,

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000

before joining the faculty at Columbia University in 2011.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Over the years, his laboratory has addressed fundamental challenges

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
in decoding the regulatory genome

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and revealing how networks of interacting genes implement complex phenotypes.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The long-term goal of his research is to achieve a predictive understanding

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
of biological behavior in terms of the structural and dynamical properties

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000

following his 25-year career as a writer, editor,

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and bureau chief at the Wall Street Journal.

95

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
including the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries,

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
health insurance, medical services, public health, and health policy.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mr. Waldholtz is the author of the book Curing Cancer

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and a co-author of Genome.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He was awarded the 1996 Pulitzer Prize

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
for national reporting for his stories on the breakthrough in AIDS medicine.

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's start the conversation.

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Who would like to initiate with a question or a remark

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
or maybe say a few words about what the subject is about?

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, I think one of the ways to discuss the topic.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm a systems biologist, but also a dabble in synthetic biology.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But these new fields, as they emerge, they have a definition problem

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
because the initial investigators who are forging the path forward,

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
they're all doing somewhat different things,

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and in the process of actually defining the field.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I think one way to define systems biology

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
is in contrast to the prevailing approaches of modern biology in the last century.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There have been extremely successful two axes of which are biochemistry and genetics.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So, I think if I were to describe this really powerful existing methodology

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that is responsible for basically everything that we know, almost everything that we know right now.

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There are two ways of studying biological systems.

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
One is to break it down into its composite components

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and intricately study the details of those individual components

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
in an attempt to figure out what they're doing, what the whole system is doing.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's sort of what biochemistry does.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The other approach has been very successful, even older than biochemistry,

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
which is genetics, which is to take those individual components,

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
break them down and see the fact that that has on the system,

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
see how that perturbation causes a malfunction in the system.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And so, it's akin to essentially studying, for example, how a car works

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
by slowly destroying little parts of it,

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
taking out the spark plug or the carburetor and seeing what the fact that has.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So, it's extremely gross and caveman approach to understanding the system,

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
but it has been extremely successful.

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But the real challenge nowadays for all of us in biology,

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and I think that's what kind of was the impetus behind systems biology,

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
is to attempt to understand what the whole system is all about.

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What is it doing? How are the parts coming together?

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I think the grand vision for us to shoot for is to have an understanding

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
of biological systems in ways that are more similar to what physicists think

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
about systems, which is to be able to predict the dynamical trajectory of a system in time,

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
not well enough to understand that.

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's the challenge. And I would argue that we're very far from that still.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But this is kind of the goal that we're shooting for.

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
To engineer the system.

141
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, I think engineering a system is important because I think one way,

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and that sort of was synthetic biology is about,

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
but I think in order to really, if you want to prove to someone that you really understand the system,

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
you should be able to re-engineer an instant of it and have it,

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and predict what that thing is going to do.

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I think that's the scientific value of synthetic biology.

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There are, of course, other aspects of synthetic biology that are really important.

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I agree. I think that's the true test of our understanding is the ability to forward engineer,

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and then I discreetly predict exactly what matters.

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It scares some people, though. That's the thing.

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
When you say synthetic biology, there's often people who are worried that you're going to be creating

152
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
super bugs or, you know, they think of evil scientists in their lab hackling late at night.

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But the, you know, most biohackers or more synthetic biologists are generally just tinkerers.

154
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They just want to try to discern what is sort of this test of their understanding of the genetic system.

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And there's even a laboratory in Brooklyn that's called GenSpace,

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
which is a community laboratory.

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The way you think of buying a gym membership today, you could go to Brooklyn on Atlantic Avenue

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and get membership to GenSpace and go and play with pipettes.

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And if you want to make some of your cells turn green with GFP, you can do that in a couple weekends

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and learn how to do it.

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So there's, you know, and that's just synthetic biology.

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But when they set up the lab in Brooklyn, they had the FBI come first to make sure that they were legitimate

163
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and they invited them to come home.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Really, we're just a group of people who want to tinkerer.

165
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
They're really tinkerers.

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And so you go from that impetus of tinkering, I think, in larger academic and industrial centers

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
to make it on a real high throughput scale.

168
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So it's...

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, I was just going to say it maybe as a...

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
as the lay person, the non-scientist on the panel,

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
it might be good for everyone here if someone could give.

172
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Because I think that was a really great general picture of how systems biology differs from what was being done.

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But I think for many of us, synthetic biology leads a very specific description with examples of what's going on.

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, I'll do that.

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So, again, I think what's said was defining with systems biology, synthetic biology.

176
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
In a sense, I'd like to define that by saying that biology, as we know,

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
albeit old biology that was taking things piece at a time, or systems biology, the modern type of biology,

178
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
those fields are looking at that which is.

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And I think synthetic biology goes a step beyond that and asks what might be possible.

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What might we have not yet seen, but it's still possible?

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Okay, so in a sense, well, just that, that synthetic biology is going beyond that, which is and explores that, which might be possible.

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Which really does have a bit of a science fictiony, brave new world tone to it, but it's real.

183
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So could you...

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let me elaborate on that.

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And I'll tell, I think much of what people normally think of as synthetic biology is where people are taking pre-agisting genes,

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,000
proteins, or regulatory elements from various different cells, organisms, and mixing and matching them to make new cells that have particular properties.

187
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The example you gave a moment was a moment ago where you can take a green fluorescent protein that exists in one particular system

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and move it into another system and people have made green fluorescent organisms that didn't fluoresce before.

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So that's one form of synthetic biology.

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And that's...

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That makes E. coli smell like bananas, for example.

192
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Right, so in that case, there are people who are taking pre...

193
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
In a sense, one can look at it as an analogy, as a toolkit of parts.

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And so the natural biology that we have is a toolkit of parts, genes and proteins and regulatory elements.

195
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And much of what people do in synthetic biology is to take these tools, these parts and rearrange them into different machines.

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's one form of synthetic biology, and that's what most people think of when they discuss synthetic biology.

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I have a different take on synthetic biology, which I'd want to...

198
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Well, I'll do it now.

199
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
A different take on synthetic biology, which is a bit perhaps more synthetic, and that is...

200
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, you started by saying, how do we define the basics, or maybe we'll define biology before we even get going?

201
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So what does it take to be a living system?

202
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What does it take to be a cell?

203
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What are the minimal requirements to be a cell?

204
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And I think in some respects, one can say that a living system, a cell, has to have molecular machinery, molecular machines that do stuff.

205
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So a living system has to have an enzyme that digests food, that's a molecular machine, or a molecular machine that enables vision.

206
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So those are molecular machines.

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And most of the molecular machines and biology are proteins.

208
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So one thing living systems need are... I'm defining living systems as a collection of molecular machines that do stuff.

209
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The second thing, I think, that living system that we need to define in terms of living systems are a blueprint, or an encoding...

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
A way of encoding those molecular machines such that can be passed down from generation to generation.

211
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So a factory is a collection of machines, not molecular machines, but it's not alive.

212
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It doesn't pass down a collection of machines to the next generation.

213
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Biological system cells have a collection of molecular machines, the proteins, that do stuff.

214
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And a genome that encodes those molecular machines, and the genome gets passed down along the way.

215
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So my view of synthetic biology is a bit different from what I mentioned earlier in the sense that instead of taking molecular machines and genes,

216
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
that preexisting nature and recombining them into different systems, taking the banana smell and putting into bacteria, taking the green fluorescent protein,

217
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and putting it into cats or whatever. Instead of mixing and matching preexisting parts, I think synthetic biology in its most extreme case is now at the point where,

218
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:17,000
rather than take those preexisting machines and mixing and matching them, one can ask, is it now possible to come up with new sequences, new proteins, new genes, that can sustain life?

219
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I want to challenge a little bit, because I think there's a much broader sense in which we can think of synthetic biology.

220
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:36,000
For instance, if you go back to what Zayla was saying in terms of creating something that essentially a new function will not be previously seen, utilizing biological components,

221
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:44,000
would say that for instance you're saying the cycle of each of these things, to synthesize alcohol in a vat was probably the oldest or most synthetic biology.

222
00:15:44,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And that's the next thing I have to do with Diggenome, which is there are many ways in which you can even use natural evolution to create environments in which bacteria can multiply and naturally achieve some type of selective functions,

223
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and that also means that it's a synthetic biology.

224
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So I would say there's an entire progression of application of synthetic biology that go all the way from synthesizing molecules using sort of biological forms,

225
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
all the way to actually synthesizing novel forms of biological life by messing around with the DNA, I think, kind of right, they're almost synthetic.

226
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
As a synthetic biology and a synthetic biology are almost at two phases of the same coin.

227
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So you exclude reproduction of the two strongest poll shows of the human mind. So one is trying to figure out how things work, and the second one is to mess around with them as soon as you understand how they work.

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And some extent it's exactly what the two fields are doing.

229
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:56,000
This is biology is trying to figure out things work, and it's trying to do so in a way that sort of takes a step back and goes into a much more unbiased, sort of completely neutral approach to understand biology,

230
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
where for instance people say, let's make an example of the English language and say the word doc, depending on how, where you say the word doc,

231
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and if somebody says doc and you're in street, you better just get out of the way, but if somebody says doc and it's in a French restaurant, then no means a completely different name.

232
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And so in biology it's exactly the same thing, the same gene may be doing, completely different things in different contexts, yet the old vision of microbiology was that this pressure, this function, this activates a photo, this is the same.

233
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:38,000
These are all true observation in particular context, and I think if system biologists thought of something, that context is extraordinarily important, and context is both molecular and physical.

234
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So on the other side, I think once we have this recipe, we think of ourselves living at the boundary of systems and synthetic biology, some of the things that we use from systems to actually implement the centennial biology

235
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:14,000
is we program cells, so if you take for instance two genes and you modulate them in this molecule or you're seeing genetic approaches, and you can now turn the lineage of a cell into another lineage, that's a form of a state biology, that's a necessary question for programming the DNA, but certainly we program the full cells into the complete number function.

236
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So these are, I would say, there's a type repertoire, and this is also a way to justify the field, because if you start thinking of synthetic biology as the way, you know, heroes die in the first place, then it becomes a little less frightening if you think about it as manipulating DNA and making crack and stack.

237
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And where you put exactly that threshold, what you say, it goes from being something that is controversial to being something that's not controversial, that's where you really have to move your ethical slider and try to figure out where the lead is, but it's not a real breakpoint is a type of thing.

238
00:18:49,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I think the breakpoint is that it's now just in the last few years become possible to not just move proteins and genes from one system to another, but to actually create new sequences that bear no resemblance to anything that ever existed before, and to have those

239
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:23,000
enabled biological functions, I think that's new.

240
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So in the high, sorry, the high-mutational context, for instance, you remove the DNA-repared genes from a bacterium, you can essentially engineer the same way as if you actually put in new pieces.

241
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I have a simpler definition, which is any interaction that humans have with biological systems that changes the behavior of those systems.

242
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And the implications that come from that run a gamut as a physician, I'll start with the medical possibilities are fantastic.

243
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You can make new medicines.

244
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:11,000
In fact, any medicine, in fact, is synthetic biology, both in its origin and its impact on the cell.

245
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And then the second is the scientific question, which I think is what's being addressed here too, which is a question of how do you actually influence a cellular system?

246
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And what's remarkable is how robust systems are.

247
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
They tend not to change.

248
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So you can push on them in many, many ways without them changing.

249
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And that's where, as a geneticist, the caveman approach, which is what I do, is so remarkable because that approach, the genetic approach, finds those few nodes in the whole system that are critical and causes the system to either collapse or to amplify.

250
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And those are in many ways where the synthetic biologist will go because most of the places you interfere, turning genes up or down or proteins on, do nothing.

251
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And so, in fact, of course, it's actually a miracle that any of us survive any drug we're given because these drugs have very powerful effects.

252
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Somehow, the body buffers them in most cells except for the cancer cell or the cell that needs to be attacked.

253
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So that's the scientific element.

254
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But for me, it's not a complex synthetic biologist, not complicates anything you do that changes the system, the behavior of that system.

255
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I think something that's really fundamental to that point is, you know, the origin of these systems, right?

256
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Biological systems come about through this random process of mutation and natural selection over hundreds of millions, millions of years, right?

257
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And, you know, there's an organizing principle, there are bunch of organizing principles that contribute to its evolution and its function.

258
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So, if you imagine these kind of buffered systems where you perturb lots of different components quite a bit, actually, and the cells doing perfectly fine,

259
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
you'd imagine that you would say that the biological systems in general are extremely robust to environmental perturbation, to noise, and so on and so forth.

260
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Whereas if you compare them to human engineered systems, like 747 or something, right, each of the components in these machines have been designed to have some tolerance.

261
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But the tolerances that they have are typically much worse than biological systems.

262
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And part of that has to do with the fact that these systems have to withstand a certain amount of mutation as they evolve with time.

263
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:49,000
They have to have components that are modular because of the mix in matching that goes on, and the sharing of genetic information that happens as a function of evolution,

264
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
mostly among the microbes in the horizontal gene transfer.

265
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But those kind of contingencies of natural selection are embedded in the way in which the system functions that are very different from the kind of things that people think about,

266
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
when they want to design a system from scratch.

267
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And I think what's really amazing and really fascinating to look forward to in the future is the adoption of a lot of these evolutionary methods,

268
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:29,000
some of which I think Michael has done in his work and others, is to utilize rapid evolutionary scenarios to design systems that are robust to a variety of different environmental perturbations and variations.

269
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And you know what's interesting about that just as a footnote is that cancer is not robust.

270
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That's why we can kill it because it didn't evolve to support the rest of the system.

271
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And to that end, I think the idea of starting to design systems, designing life again,

272
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
we would probably not like some of the things that evolution has designed.

273
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:59,000
For example, increasing gene expression noise as a measure of fitness in some cases or increasing mutation rate to give you a further adaptive advantage for some bacteria.

274
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
We would probably not design a system to start to do those things, but their actually evolution has created them.

275
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I think as again as a lay person looking in the thing that interests me about synthetic biology is that there's an extension of using all the tools of molecular biology and genetic engineering that have come about over the last 20 to 50 years.

276
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:43,000
To do what Michael says, which is to create new forms of life or new versions of existing forms of life by actually in the laboratory creating genetic sequences that don't exist, often using the same laws of that govern how we exist today.

277
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Laws of mutation. I think for most people, we don't understand that we've evolved to who we are today through some sort of natural selection, but that we aren't exactly who we might have engineered from the first place.

278
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And if we had to choose, but that a lot of this tinkering has exactly, you know, people get very concerned and I'll bet you we get questions from the public that you are playing God or tinkering with nature in a way that we can't.

279
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You know, how do you have the right and who's governing you?

280
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But that kind of tinkering, of course, mankind has been doing and nature has been doing from the get go.

281
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I often think of the piece of corn for some reason. I always look at corn when corn first evolved in this hemisphere, in the northern southern hemisphere.

282
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It didn't look anything like what corn looks like today and corn looks like what it does today because of human tinkering with it.

283
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Same with that ball.

284
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Same with that ball. Dogs are even better at that.

285
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So we've been tinkering all along.

286
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Or horses, yeah. I would even argue, I even push back against people who critique it.

287
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
One is the historical context you just mentioned, but I would even argue, I guess I put forward the thesis that it's actually our duty as a species to embrace the engineering in that our survival may very well depend on it.

288
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And if you think in the long, long term, I'll posit this sort of thought experiment. So you think 100 years from now or 1,000 years from now or 1,000,000 years from now.

289
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I actually have this question, whenever we interview grad students or faculty for the department.

290
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
My last question I always ask them is how long do you think the human species will survive?

291
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And it always throws people off because they're not expecting that at a job interview or a student interview.

292
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But I like it because it gives me a sense of their hope actually for the human species.

293
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And a lot of times people say 1,000 years or 1,000,000 years.

294
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I usually remind them we've been here at least for several million years in our current form.

295
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But one person even said 100 years, I think, well, humans will only be here for another 100 years and I said, well, good God, man.

296
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Why don't I just go to the beach and sell bananas and hang on?

297
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
He said, well, I want the last 100 years to really count. It was actually what he said. I couldn't imagine.

298
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But I would argue it's our duty because we probably won't be here on this planet forever and the human genomes not built to live on other planets.

299
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So we may have to think of a time when we re-engineer the species on which we depend or even the human genome in order to actually survive in a long, long, long term.

300
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I think we have the ability of the species to think that far so we should consider that as a thought experiment.

301
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
There's a precise moment in time. I think if you look at Albers, Natans and Smith, Nobel Prize, right, when they, restriction enzymes,

302
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,000
that demarcated a very important milestone because before, the only thing you could do to manipulate biology was essentially look very natural.

303
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You could graft a plant on top of another plant. People have been doing that for tens of thousands of years.

304
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Nobody ever thought that would be either an ethical or potentially controversial. People have been breeding dogs, etc.

305
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But the moment you could actually do it molecularly and actually infringe on the domain of the most sacred molecules, DNA,

306
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
then all of a sudden things escalate to tremendous proportion.

307
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I think, you know, obviously, one of the things that actually Mark said, I think, is extremely important is that we live to be a system of homeostasis

308
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and actually 90% of our machinery is to keep the cell doing exactly what it's doing regardless of perturbation.

309
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
But the biggest domestic system is the actual world. If you go outside, you know, one of the biggest problems you have right now,

310
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
people try to engineer algae to produce lipids at much higher rates.

311
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So you, for instance, get better biofuel production. And people have been very successful doing that.

312
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You know why we're not producing fuels? Because the moment you actually start breeding these things in normal environment,

313
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
they are immediately out-competed by normal algae that don't do that.

314
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And so that's the way of the plan of getting back and basically telling you, look, yeah, you produce more fuel, but for the planet, it's not very helpful.

315
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And so these species will actually be out-competed and will eventually die. It will become not a dominant species.

316
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So I think that we have to always come to terms with, I think, today, right in New York Times that our CO2 levels are the highest in

317
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
400 million years. That worries me. I think a lot more. Because that can trigger an absolute irreversible catastrophe and

318
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
finance and no way to react to that. Most of the living organisms, if you think of the number of species that we have

319
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and the number of genetic experiments that are happening every day, and each one of them, just because of, you know, normal rates of mutations,

320
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
almost everything that you could possibly do in the lab is actually being done out there.

321
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So when you say we're synthesizing new virus for influenza, is lethal and can transmit to man-to-man? That's being done every day out there.

322
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I have to disagree with that. I have to go back to what I said before and disagree with that.

323
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I think the current and the next stage of synthetic biology are profoundly different.

324
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's not just ionizing radiation and individual mutations, and it's not just sampling sequences that may have been already sampled.

325
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I think it's at the point now when one can design proteins entirely from scratch that are not mutationly related to anything that's been seen on Earth before.

326
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And one can sample new sequences, both protein and DNA sequences, that are unrelated to anything that's ever been around.

327
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And I think that's a fundamentally different thing. It's not just making mutations.

328
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Michael, has anything been created like that that can be a specific example?

329
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Well, that's what my lab does. But there's also, I mean, I think in terms of protein design, there's David Baker in Seattle who's doing computational work to design proteins entirely from scratch with predetermined folds and predetermined activities

330
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
that are unrelated to anything that any sequences that exist on Earth.

331
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
My own work, we're making libraries of novel sequences unrelated to anything that has ever existed on Earth.

332
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And if a sequence base is larger than can it ever been sampled with a history of the universe?

333
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And someone can now make sequences that have never existed before and then challenge those sequences to provide to see whether they can provide life-sustaining functions.

334
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So one can actually go into bacterial cells, knock out parts of the genome, and then see if those parts of the genome can be replaced by sequences that never existed before.

335
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So if you do that, if you take a bacterial cell that has 4,000 genes and you replace four of them, well then it's an E. coli that's a little weird and it has four new genes.

336
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Again, these are not mutant genes. These are genes unrelated to anything that ever existed.

337
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So if you do it four out of four thousand, it's a minor thing. But when you start, I'm not going to do this, but we can imagine just around the corner that people can now replace large sections of a genome of, let's say, a bacterial cell with sequences that never existed before in the history of the Earth.

338
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And then that, I think, one has to come to grips with the fact that those are new forms of life that are not evolutionary variants of existing forms of life.

339
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
They're fundamentally new, fundamentally new sequences, proteins designed from scratch, genomes designed from scratch.

340
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That, I think, is around the corner and I think that's, you know, in terms of philosophical or theological issues, that's sort of something that one wants to think about.

341
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Another thing would be chemotherapy. Often we use nucleoside anelones. We have variations of AC, G, and T that are just different enough that they killed the cells.

342
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And so you can use synthetic biology. I would even argue that chemotherapy could be viewed as a form of synthetic...

343
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And the genetic, the genetic code there. We're 20 amino acids for as long as the world's been around, but we can now engineer the genetic code to have more than 20 amino acids.

344
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What is the... I'm trying to understand the grasp of at least the fundamental semantic difference between having a protein that is completely different from another one and got to be completely different because of some very complex evolutionary path.

345
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
God there, one that you would engineer from scratch.

346
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Parentage. The difference is parentage. The difference is linear. The difference is whether it evolved from something that pre-existed out in Darwin's swamp or whether it's something that came to be in an innocent, pathetic lab.

347
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I understand, but what I'm saying is it's a form of mental evolution. Instead of deriving from a process where the one position at a time to get there, there are by a process where the complete sedimentation is computed by computer or by AMMB.

348
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But the point is you now have a new protein. We're not saying we're creating new proteins all the time. We're doing the mutation.

349
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:58,000
In some cases, we're doing big rearrangements and so other things that are... You do an inversion, for instance. That is a... I think in the public's mind, one is... evolutionary is natural.

350
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And this is synthetic. And I think that is the question that the product is the same. The protein is the same.

351
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So, for instance, again, as a journalist, we try to get down to examples. I think there are a couple of examples of synthetic biology that are out there already that are interesting.

352
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And it's interesting to see whether the public is bothered by it. One is changing the genes of algae to produce lipids or oils or fats and getting algae to produce biofuel of some type.

353
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Or in another instance, changing the genetics of yeast to not only create alcohol when they interact with sugar, but now to create fuel, which is already happening. Not in a commercial level, but it's happening.

354
00:33:47,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And those are examples of what at least has been described to me as synthetic biology. At that level, I think the public sort of feels, okay, you know, we're sort of tinkering with yeast in one instance, maybe bacteria or algae in another instance.

355
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:14,000
But what is it when we start tinkering with humans? So you're talking about the fact that there may be medicine in the future. What do you... from synthetic biology, what do you say?

356
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Let me take it over several different ranges. The first is we can now take individual genes in a bacteria and line them up in a way so they will make novel drugs.

357
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Because you can predict from the sequence of the enzymes you put in there all the reactions that the cell will do, and then they will excrete that in. So you could, in principle, make very complex... and do you can naturally make very complicated molecules naturally in a cell.

358
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:59,000
In fact, these are called natural products, even though these, of course, are unnatural in the sense that we were thinking about it. So from the point of view of new medicines, very powerful.

359
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Because these kinds of natural products are extremely good at being drugs. Let me take it to the extreme. I have taken care, let's say we're taking care of a child who has inherited disorder.

360
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Well, now we can go in with a particular set of enzymatic replacements, and this has not been done, but in principle. We certainly have done it in experimental systems.

361
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Take out the bad gene and put in the good gene. Replace it with the normal gene.

362
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Would you deny that to a child? You're changing their genome. Why would you not do that? We're not there. We're far from that. There's lots of issues about how many cells would have to take it up, etc.

363
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:10,000
If you had a child with, let's say, with hemophilia, rather than getting regular injections every day, or regularly to prevent bleeding, would you not take the opportunity to fix their hemophilia gene? Of course you would. At least I would as a physician.

364
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
What if it was an embryo? It's easier if it's an embryo.

365
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You can certainly do it as an embryo, and that's where it's been done in other animals' machines. But even in an adult or child in principle, if you could change enough of the liver and you get enough into the liver, you could do it.

366
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So there you have an extreme. One, you're tinkering with bacteria. Everyone says you can make a drug. The other, you're tinkering with humans. Both cases, you will revolutionize medicine for the better.

367
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,000
There's even a more extreme scenario that's actually being used in human trials. HIV infects tel lymphocytes.

368
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:56,000
There's a small fraction of a Western European population that has a variant of a core receptor on the surface of cells that is very ineffective for HIV infection.

369
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So what they're doing now in humans now is taking out some of those white cells in HIV patients and using zinc-finger nucleases to inactivate or modify that core receptor in a way that makes that patients T cell in vitro, impermeable to the HIV.

370
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Put it back into the human and have that grow and repopulate. And the idea is that eventually this could be a nice way to destroy the, to get out of HIV.

371
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So these kind of things, because of the example that Mark brought up, and there are many more examples coming up, because now, because of really amazing, fundamental basic research into understanding the way in which molecules work, we now have generated these tools

372
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:50,000
that allows to go on an engineer human cells, any kind of cells that we want. And people are going to be wanting these treatments, because they're critical.

373
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And Dr. Siano has engineered this gene directly into the stem cell compartment of the bone marrow, and essentially populate the niche, these are the metabolism, and basically, this one child that was treated was effectively almost completely cured of a pretty bad disease by essentially doing the direct transplantation in the bone marrow.

374
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But, I mean what I was trying to do before was simply to some extent demystifying, when I do this, I'm kind of doing it in a more, maybe a little bit provocatory way, because obviously, I'm not trying to say that, trying to, in fact, to pass judgment at all on this entire field.

375
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm just basically saying that there are oversensetization of the process, and there are undersensetization of the process that are happening.

376
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,400
cases, for instance, we think that certain things are immoral,

377
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,720
when we've actually been doing some other things that

378
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,060
are very, very close to them, and are not quite

379
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,680
substantially different in theory,

380
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,520
but that we're considered to be natural.

381
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,600
And all of a sudden, because you're

382
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,840
doing these at the molecular level, it's no longer natural.

383
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,000
And to some extent, it's always when chemistry gets involved

384
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,440
and things get complicated.

385
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,080
But we have to remember that we all

386
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,600
work with chemistry, whether it's natural chemistry or not.

387
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,840
So when you actually graph the plant on another plant,

388
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,920
and you're mixing their genomes,

389
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,760
since I understand you are doing chemistry.

390
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,240
But then chemistry in a way that doesn't involve pipettes,

391
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,360
but it's still chemistry.

392
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,680
I think I want to bring the conversation a little bit

393
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,560
back to systems biology, because the degree

394
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,680
to which synthetic biology is going to be successful,

395
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,360
and people are going to rely on.

396
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,160
And it's going to actually, over long-term produce results

397
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,720
that people aren't going to be afraid of,

398
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,840
relies on a foundation of understanding

399
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,880
of how cells work.

400
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,000
And that's where systems biology and modern biology

401
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,840
comes in.

402
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:46,280
And so one of the major challenges for us

403
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,640
is to understand these systems well enough

404
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,440
to be able to predict exactly what happens

405
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,040
if you re-engineer a particular molecule in the cell.

406
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,720
And what are the consequences of that when

407
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,640
you put it back in in a very complex multi-scale system,

408
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,880
which is a human body, all these organs interacting

409
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,760
with each other, where we have just only

410
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,160
begun to scratch the surface of that kind of potential

411
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,400
interactions that can happen.

412
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,560
So I think synthetic biology and systems biology

413
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,400
are going to be interacting with each other

414
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,000
as they co-evolve.

415
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,560
And synthetic is going to heavily depend on systems.

416
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,200
And I think this marks the divide between what

417
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
Michael and Ray were talking about,

418
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,040
which is using natural selection evolution

419
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,960
to develop variants of existing molecules,

420
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,520
is a essentially a brainless thing.

421
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,720
You just set up the selection, cause mutations,

422
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,000
and you'll end up finding bacteria that

423
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,760
can do a particular thing, or mammalian cells.

424
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,520
But having the knowledge of what are the compositional

425
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,600
components, the organizing principles by which amino acids

426
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,560
come together to form proteins, what do those folds do?

427
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,920
How do the folds interact?

428
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,440
And how do you make machines out of those folds?

429
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,000
Is it a foundational knowledge that we need to gain?

430
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,080
And people are gaining.

431
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,960
Michael's laboratory, for example.

432
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,480
In order to set up a foundation that

433
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,040
allows us to build new things based on rational engineering

434
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,080
principles.

435
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,360
And I think that's where the most exciting stuff is happening,

436
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,160
because that's where it will impact our understanding

437
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,840
of biological systems.

438
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,760
And so I think that's what I find really exciting.

439
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,240
The other way around, too, I think actually

440
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,600
what's been, to me, re-transformation is that we always

441
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,040
think that understanding biology informs

442
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
the ability of engineering.

443
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,640
But actually, the ability of engineering

444
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,320
also really helps dissect it.

445
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,000
So for instance, Diego di Bernardo came from Jim Collins

446
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,720
lab, engineered in yeast.

447
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,480
A fairly complicated circuit.

448
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,840
And that circuit was used in this conference

449
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,840
that we ran off of last seven years, called

450
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,320
Dream, where we essentially challenge

451
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,080
systems biologists to dissect the piece of biology

452
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,160
we actually know.

453
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,120
The problem is that there's really no piece of biology

454
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,880
we actually know.

455
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,960
Literally, there's not a single one that we actually know,

456
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,800
except for extraordinary, simple things.

457
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,840
So having an actual engineer system

458
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,720
and was engineered in a way that could not interact

459
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,120
with the rest of the environment in yeast

460
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,720
was incredibly important, because now you can get data

461
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,280
that basically says, if you can reconstruct

462
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,800
what the logic of the circuit was, now we

463
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,400
know that your method works well before there's really

464
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,000
no way to know whether it was able to be constructed.

465
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,960
You didn't have a gold standard.

466
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,200
You have a gold standard.

467
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,360
And so this was actually, I think,

468
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,520
that there's an entire new sort of discipline

469
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,320
in synthetic biology that will help systems biology

470
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,600
dissect regulatory models.

471
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,480
I think to elaborate on something

472
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,040
so you'd said a moment ago about making mutations

473
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,800
and selecting is brainless as easy, and I agree.

474
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,840
Versus engineering and knowing something about the system.

475
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,080
And I think it has to do with Darwin on the one hand

476
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,000
and engineer on the other hand and having them work together.

477
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,800
So if you make random collections of mutations,

478
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,120
you do selection, you said it's brainless in the mindless.

479
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,280
We can do that into where it works.

480
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,280
However, if you understand the system,

481
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,320
then you can make a smart library.

482
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,920
So suppose you can make 10 to the ninth a billion different

483
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,440
variations of something.

484
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,480
If you make that billion variations randomly

485
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,680
and you select among them for a desired property,

486
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,040
you may or may not get a hit of what you want,

487
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,320
even among a billion.

488
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,400
However, if you know something about the system,

489
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,440
the system being either the molecule or the entire cell,

490
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,400
then you can devise a collection, same number,

491
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,760
10 to the ninth a billion.

492
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,400
But now that billion is sampling that region of space

493
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,640
that's most likely to succeed.

494
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,280
And that's incredibly powerful.

495
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,120
So if you can now make a smart library,

496
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,360
I'm using the word library to indicate a collection, right?

497
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,400
You now make a smart library of 10 to the ninth variations.

498
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,480
And you select in a Darwinian sense among those,

499
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,600
then you've combined both the smarts of the engineering

500
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,520
and the dumb selection of Darwin,

501
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,480
and then you have a much better chance of getting it.

502
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,440
If I go again, I ask the question of specificity.

503
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,440
You are making libraries of proteins or sequences, right?

504
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,720
In a particular area?

505
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
For what purpose?

506
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,560
I'll give you an example.

507
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,960
So for what purpose?

508
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,920
Or give me an example.

509
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,160
Well, an example is, so I mean, for example, Jack Schostak

510
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,560
is a very well known scientist, Nobel Prize winner.

511
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,200
He did some spectacular work where

512
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,880
they made libraries of 10 to the 12th,

513
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,080
a huge number of sequences, and selected among them

514
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,560
for particular features.

515
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,720
And they found them, because 10 to the 12th is a big number.

516
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,040
And if you weed through that library,

517
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,800
you'll find what you're looking for.

518
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,160
In our case, we try to make designed libraries,

519
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,120
and we'll make a library of 10 to the 6, much, much, much,

520
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,320
much smaller.

521
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,160
And it'll be much richer in terms of getting folded proteins

522
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,400
or functional proteins, because you're

523
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,160
pre-biosing a library to that part of space

524
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,600
where you're more likely to get something that you want.

525
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,320
Again, are you developing proteins of a certain type

526
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,520
for a specific purpose?

527
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,480
Or are you just doing it to see if you can do it?

528
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,560
A 10-grained name.

529
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,280
In our aim, what we're doing is we're

530
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,840
trying to see what's possible.

531
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,400
Let me give an example from something

532
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,040
that happens in cancer all the time.

533
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,800
So it's a very precise thing.

534
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,240
So people do routinely, after Steve Ballage and other people

535
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,840
introduce the technique, very large screens

536
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,520
where they essentially knock out every single gene

537
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,040
in a particular cell to see what are,

538
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,560
because cancer, as Mark was saying,

539
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,080
is a little bit less stable than normal cells.

540
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,080
Actually, certain vulnerability emerge

541
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,880
that are not normally in normal cells.

542
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,000
And so they knock down every gene, and they say, OK,

543
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,360
so we would gene kill the cell.

544
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,480
If you do it out, it's an extraordinarily inefficient way

545
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,120
of doing it.

546
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,640
So one thing that we've shown, for instance,

547
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,960
is that you can now study the regulatory model of the cell.

548
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,520
So you reconstruct it from scratch,

549
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,080
from a large number of observation of the cell.

550
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,640
And when you interrogate these models

551
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,760
with the specific question of how you would want to sort of

552
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,320
abrogate the cell viability, they give you

553
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,560
a set of recipes.

554
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,800
And these recipes have typically a hit rate of about 60%,

555
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,600
meaning that the best one was 100%.

556
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,520
The worst one was 30% on average, we get 60% across,

557
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,000
maybe 15 different tumor types that we looked at.

558
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,520
So now, instead of having to shut down 24,000 genes,

559
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,880
and then maybe you have most of the genes that actually

560
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,560
will kill the cell that are shooting on the wheels of a car,

561
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,760
they'll kill every cell, the one that are specific,

562
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,320
maybe very, very small number, you now

563
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,320
end up having a hit ratio of maybe 1 in 1,000

564
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,040
to a hit ratio of now 60%, which is a huge change,

565
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,440
and is exactly what Zane completely derived by,

566
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,520
our ability to understand in a rational way

567
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,240
what the cell is doing, mechanistically.

568
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,880
So we still seem to have a PR problem, I guess.

569
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,680
I think all of us are very pro-synthetic biology,

570
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,920
pro-systems biology, but there's still,

571
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,480
I think a large segment of the public

572
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,640
that is frankly terrified, I guess.

573
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,120
But I mean, what do you think are the ways we could,

574
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,040
and we try to demystify it, so I'm

575
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,640
going to make it more palatable?

576
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,960
I thought that's how we're going to get

577
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,200
mambarded in the question period.

578
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,200
Yeah.

579
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,200
OK.

580
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,440
Well, yeah, I think one of the-

581
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,280
Medical groups.

582
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,760
I think one of the questions, you know,

583
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,040
you can dance around some specific examples, not just-

584
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,040
I'll give you one.

585
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,040
OK.

586
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,400
I mean, when you try to find a way to kill a cancer cell

587
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,520
with an antibody, you have an antibody that carries a toxin,

588
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,880
you will screen through artificial libraries

589
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,680
that look like antibodies.

590
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,080
They're made of antibody components,

591
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,040
but they may not be real until you find one that binds tightly,

592
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,320
will carry your toxic payload in to kill the cancer cell.

593
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,280
That's how you do the business.

594
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,920
So you're always- you know, these screens

595
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,200
can lead to very powerful new drugs,

596
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,960
and they're new proteins that may be unnatural in the sense

597
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,800
of being seen before.

598
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,960
So the analogy, there might be nuclear power.

599
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,800
That we could use nuclear energy for a good, in that sense.

600
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,560
But I'm not troubled by this, because I think it's

601
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,240
the same issue that you have with nuclear power.

602
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,680
If you call everything atomic, then you have the good and the bad.

603
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,880
If you call everything synthetic biology,

604
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,120
there will be some places we have to worry about it, right?

605
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:15,800
So call it.

606
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,560
If you throw everything into the same bucket,

607
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,440
instead of saying, let's look at each of the kinds

608
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,200
of specific applications and see, are there any that actually

609
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,440
have problems?

610
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,720
And the vast majority are either

611
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,840
add to fundamental knowledge, or we'll add to a therapeutic

612
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,840
armamentarium.

613
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,440
And I think, again, the public, or at least the people

614
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:41,120
I deal with when I'm answering questions as a journalist,

615
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,400
I think an example you gave, or similar to one,

616
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,240
would say, well, there is a drug out there called Enbrough.

617
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,320
That works very well against rheumatoid arthritis.

618
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,080
It is a synthetic antibody.

619
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,840
In other words, it's a man-made antibody.

620
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,280
It's the same thing, yeah.

621
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,720
It's a man-made antibody.

622
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,000
It was made in a laboratory.

623
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,040
It takes something that was natural, which is a antibody.

624
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:08,320
And scientists figured out a way of manipulating it,

625
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,640
or creating it, in a form that it works specifically

626
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,120
against a receptor in the immune system.

627
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,840
In arthritis, the immune system is overactive.

628
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,600
So this antibody turns the immune system down.

629
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,600
Most patients given Enbrough don't know that.

630
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,160
It's like me, when I get in my car,

631
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,280
I don't really care how it works.

632
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,800
I know that when I turn the key and put it in drive,

633
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,920
it goes.

634
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,920
All that other stuff I don't care about.

635
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,200
So when most patients don't care that Enbrough does exactly

636
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,720
what I just said.

637
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,640
So in that place, people don't care about that.

638
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,520
It's synthetic.

639
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,840
But when we talk about creating new kinds of bacteria,

640
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,440
new forms of yeast, or taking cells out of the body,

641
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,000
like you said, manipulating it, and then putting it back

642
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,920
in the body, people, I think, begin to have issues with it.

643
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,720
Well, yeah, I know.

644
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,040
I mean, for example, the experiments

645
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,480
at the University of Pennsylvania,

646
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,240
where they took lymphocytes out of patients

647
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,200
who had terrible cancer and engineered

648
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,440
a totally synthetic new receptor on their surface,

649
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,040
and then those lymphocytes went and killed that cancer,

650
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,800
cured those patients.

651
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,720
That's about it.

652
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,080
And stayed in that patient forever.

653
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,120
So they're carrying this abnormal sequence forever.

654
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,960
And my guess is quite happy to do so.

655
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,080
So I think it, again, is important what it's for.

656
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,640
The other point, which needs to be made

657
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,600
and was made back at the origin of the molecular biology

658
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,000
revolution when everyone was worried

659
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,800
and actually shut down molecular biology, as you recall,

660
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,280
for a few years, is that pretty much everything we make

661
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,040
is not going to survive in the world,

662
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,480
because it is not being selected for.

663
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,000
It is not robust.

664
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,760
Evolution has done a wonderful job

665
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,760
of selecting out anything with any weakness.

666
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,600
So pretty much anything we make, and this

667
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,400
has been proved time and again, whether it's

668
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,520
an unusual mouse, which was the original question,

669
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,320
or these bacteria or yeast, will die in competition.

670
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,520
So realistically, I think that the problem is small.

671
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,920
But it's not nonexistent.

672
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,560
And that's why I think we should say there will be times

673
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,240
you should worry about it and times you don't.

674
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,400
And I wouldn't just put it all under the one rubric, one

675
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,760
umbrella of synthetic biology.

676
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,920
I was saying that you just mentioned with those children

677
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,640
what happens when those children's children,

678
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,840
that they don't know long ago, doesn't affect the germline.

679
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,560
So I would take even a step back.

680
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,800
So the question is, you have to be very pragmatic about these

681
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,320
things.

682
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,560
So the question is, is there anything

683
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,720
that has ever been possible to do in terms of stopping

684
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,960
progression of knowledge?

685
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,280
And that has never worked out.

686
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,160
Could you have stopped understanding

687
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,240
that you can break the atoms and that creates energy?

688
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,640
To some extent, we could have prevented it,

689
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,440
but somebody at some point would have done.

690
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,120
And so I think that the more important

691
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,360
to try and understand whether knowledge is good or bad,

692
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,920
I think knowledge is neutral, is how we use knowledge

693
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,680
that can become good or bad.

694
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,080
So I think that this is a matter that is very important

695
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,320
for legislation to take a stance.

696
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,200
What are the things that are viable that we put safely into?

697
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,520
So they have to be obviously a number of safety constraints

698
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,800
that have to be satisfied, et cetera.

699
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,280
But this is much more of a legislative matter

700
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,520
than a matter of whether the knowledge producing

701
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,400
exercise that essentially the scientific enterprise is

702
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,520
undergoing should be arrested or continued.

703
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,040
Because that's going to fail no matter why you try.

704
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,680
There's never been one single situation

705
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,520
where we've been able to stop the progression of scientific

706
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,000
knowledge.

707
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,640
So I would step ahead of that and try

708
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,120
to figure out what we do with it.

709
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,720
I think it's important the case where

710
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,760
you have malicious intent, where you

711
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:00,720
try to create warfare agents in this crazy world of ours today.

712
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,440
That's possible.

713
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,680
The only way to stay ahead of that is to just know more.

714
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,200
That's the most important thing.

715
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,840
Know more than the guys who are attempting

716
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,000
to build malicious agents.

717
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,240
The other thing is that we have to do a better job

718
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,760
of educating the public, which is pretty dismally

719
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,600
scientifically literate about a lot of these issues.

720
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,000
I see it in the nuclear case, for example.

721
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,960
It is by attaching a label onto something,

722
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,920
you demonize it immediately, and you shut down the cortex.

723
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,000
And nobody looks deeper.

724
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,640
And we are in the realm where that

725
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,400
could happen with synthetic biology.

726
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,880
It's up to us, I think, as a scientific community

727
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,120
to do better outreach and to educate the public more

728
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,360
about the details of exactly what we're doing.

729
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,560
How is it that we're generating these things?

730
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,800
Where do they come from?

731
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,480
What were we doing during dog domestication era?

732
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,120
How is that different?

733
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,440
Why do we love dogs?

734
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,920
I mean, it was a really amazing experiment

735
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,480
of human selection, right?

736
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,640
And so I think those are the two things that,

737
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,280
and I agree with Andrea, you can't really

738
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,160
stop the pursuit of knowledge.

739
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,520
And sometimes it'll be used for malicious purposes.

740
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,080
The other aspect of it, I think, the bad,

741
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:17,240
is the inadvertent problems that we might have

742
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,520
with some of these things we engineer.

743
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,400
We don't know how well they'll function.

744
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,520
That's where, as a community, we have to set standards

745
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,120
that, for example, the FDA will have

746
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,160
to adopt about these therapeutics

747
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,440
to make sure that we don't do harm on average,

748
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,240
that we apply these methods to extreme cases

749
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,800
where there is, for example, no other alternative.

750
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,760
So these standards will evolve.

751
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,240
And these things happen naturally all the time.

752
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,480
I don't know if you looked at Aspen recently.

753
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,440
There are no trees anymore because of the beetle

754
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,320
infestation. The entire forest has been completely destroyed.

755
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,120
And there was no genetic engineering at play.

756
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,760
So these things happen in an organism

757
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,920
or a microorganism getting out.

758
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,400
The other one is like, I don't remember the name of this piece,

759
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,080
but this plant that grows over vegetation

760
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,520
if you go every US highway right now.

761
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,520
Cousy.

762
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,520
Cousy.

763
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,520
Cousy.

764
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,520
Cousy.

765
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,520
Cousy.

766
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,520
Cousy.

767
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,520
Cousy.

768
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,520
Cousy.

769
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,520
Cousy.

770
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,520
far Al715.

771
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,520
lime b87aes.

772
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,720
Non- grinded, huh.

773
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,720
It's not resistant.

774
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,620
How are you thinking about how we're looking at these Brand

775
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,620
documents?

776
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,620
And I also like that.

777
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,840
And that counts as directed by the healthcare

778
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,840
glycogen.

779
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:19,080
So not as designed, Jackson, pawns over the

780
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:40,080
plant council.

781
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,080
Yes.

782
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,100
And a partly, one term is linear.

783
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:38,240
The bestCLE

784
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,480
there was something implied in what you were saying.

785
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:49,840
I was just putting out there the idea that the novelty is at a new scale.

786
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:56,040
I was not going to put any value judgments on at all, but just to say that the possibility

787
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:02,240
for one of the things I've talked about with students, it's not a question of if new forms

788
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,240
of life are possible, it's when.

789
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:09,240
It's when.

790
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,160
That's something that one needs to think about.

791
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,400
I sort of agree with what you two were saying before.

792
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,280
I think transparency, right?

793
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,120
You can't stop the progress of science, but in an attempt to prevent evil from happening,

794
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,320
I think transparency is the most important thing.

795
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,720
It's really better to know than not to know, because otherwise I would absolutely do it

796
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,720
first.

797
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,360
But I think when people do things behind closed doors in secret, then you've got to worry.

798
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:39,720
We've seen that in societies forever, but when people do things out in the open, I have more

799
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,520
faith that people will do good things.

800
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,640
That's a standard of care in the bio-brick foundation.

801
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,640
The idea is you want to build a house with bricks.

802
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,160
You don't want to build a genome in an organ in the same way.

803
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,720
All the parts, you can order them online.

804
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,720
You can look up at what every piece is, every piece of DNA.

805
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,720
It's all open.

806
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:00,720
I wonder if you were also, though, up against a certain psychological orientation of the

807
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:07,080
public who is not steeped in the science, where there tends to be an idealization followed

808
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,800
by a de-idealization of new technology.

809
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:16,720
I think the same thing happened with nanotechnology that was the promise of all these wonderful

810
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:22,800
things that were going to take place in the world and transforming human life.

811
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,600
And then there's the big, bad, gray goo that's going to the nanobots that are going to take

812
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,600
over.

813
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,600
I wonder if there's a...

814
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,920
I think you make a really good point, because I think people are essentially scared of what

815
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,520
they don't really understand in detail.

816
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:41,360
When you do a graft and put a plant on top of another one, people understand that intuitively.

817
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:46,400
They're not scared of it simply because they feel they have achieved that level of reassurance

818
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,120
that is necessary to let that be in the back of their mind.

819
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:55,120
When you start talking about very complicated operations, the manipulations of fundamental

820
00:57:55,120 --> 00:58:02,440
molecules of life, then people only grasp certain aspects of it, and it scares them to

821
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,640
no end because simply they don't know exactly what's been done.

822
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,000
And so I think that one of the things that really should be important about this, about

823
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:15,200
demystifying this process is actually really have a major effort in education and in dissemination,

824
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,280
because sound of these things can be explained in relatively simple layman terms.

825
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,960
In a way that if you want to know about it, you can actually do it.

826
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,320
I think there's the educational aspect and the fear that you referred to, but I also

827
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:34,400
wonder whether you think that there's just a tendency that when the promises, especially

828
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:41,080
when these new technologies are kind of hyped and people don't really know what the hard

829
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,520
work is all about to develop the science, that there's a disappointment then when these

830
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,960
things aren't forthcoming and so then there's tends to-

831
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:53,040
But I think that disappointment currently constantly exists.

832
00:58:53,040 --> 00:59:00,440
The war on cancer, you know, 40 years ago, sequencing the human genome, where's all the

833
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,440
great discoveries?

834
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:07,280
Well, the truth is in the laboratories, the war on cancer has advanced and there have

835
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,640
been breakthroughs, but cancer isn't cured.

836
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:17,400
And the human genome sequencing has led to all the synthetic biology, but we're not

837
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,720
buying anything in the grocery store, at least that I know, or the drug store as a result

838
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,720
of it.

839
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:28,000
And I think that kind of- that's just the nature of being human.

840
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,640
I would like to make one pitch.

841
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,640
I think that-

842
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,480
One pitch as a retired working journalist, I mean I'm still working as a science writer,

843
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:41,880
but not for a publication, is that I believe it's in the best interest of the scientific

844
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:51,000
community, the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology industry, to help educate the public.

845
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,840
Listen, news people never think- we never think of ourselves as educating the public.

846
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,680
We think of ourselves as seeking the truth, but there are very few people who are as skilled

847
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,600
as I am in doing what I do.

848
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,320
And it took me about 30 years to figure out how to do it.

849
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:15,240
And I would argue that as the science gets more complicated, as these issues become more

850
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:22,680
difficult for the lay public to grasp that a group of writers who can translate science

851
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:27,280
into understandable, easily accessible, but an entertaining-

852
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:33,360
Not just writing, but video and film or whatever, and someone ought to get together because

853
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:41,760
the field of journalism in which those writers bubble up, I mean, there are schools that teach

854
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,000
science writing, but there aren't places for those people to have jobs.

855
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,640
In other words, the world, the media world has changed so dramatically that it is in

856
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,160
a self-populating area.

857
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:59,080
I would say in the 1950s and 60s that it was an explosion, and in other words, the creation

858
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,960
of the science writers, and it was around the space probe, but there was- I mean, think

859
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,960
about it.

860
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,840
In New York City alone, there were six newspapers in each one of them had one or two science

861
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,840
writers writing about the space.

862
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,840
That's gone.

863
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,920
Science writers are- Well, that's what I just told you.

864
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,920
That's really disturbing.

865
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:21,600
And without- and so what's happening, again, not to say, the new model is a nonprofit model.

866
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:27,640
There are a number of nonprofit news organizations, investigative news organizations like ProPublica

867
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:33,760
that are being funded by nonprofit organizations, sort of like the Gates Foundation, the Kaiser

868
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:42,320
Foundation, Kaiser Health Foundation, underwrites the science news at PBS, and the Gates Foundation

869
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,400
is underwriting science news at NPR.

870
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,400
And if those didn't exist, there wouldn't be science writing at those two places.

871
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,800
So that's my pitch.

872
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,000
What- What about science science-

873
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,680
Well, that's the New York Times.

874
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,680
Yes.

875
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,680
What about Seattle?

876
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:57,680
I don't know.

877
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,780
There's no science writers.

878
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:06,720
I think there's even a bigger issue, which is not the- I think the scientific literacy

879
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:13,760
issue and our ability to outreach is very critical to all these issues we're discussing.

880
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,820
But I think the fundamental challenge that I see now in modern progressive societies is

881
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:28,360
the lack of teaching of the history of science and technology to the population that is supporting

882
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,480
it with their taxpayer money.

883
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:36,880
If you ask an average person on the street, you know, what all this money is going for,

884
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,520
they will tell you, well, they're curing cancer.

885
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:45,280
They're using it to develop new nanotechnology, nanobots or whatever.

886
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,360
But actually, what they don't appreciate is that the reason why their cell phone works,

887
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:56,040
which is a miraculous technology, the reason their laptops work, has to do with a very

888
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:04,040
long viewed investment in basic understanding of nature that came decades and decades ago.

889
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:08,200
Microwaves, quantum mechanics, attempt to understand the fundamental working principles

890
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,760
of the universe that had no application whatsoever.

891
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:18,000
These were just crazy passionate individuals who worked on specific problems because of

892
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,480
their taste in those problems, because of their passion, because of their love of understanding

893
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,480
the universe.

894
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,360
That decades later, maybe even a century later, accumulated into a level of understanding

895
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:35,320
that allows us to now build whatever the hell we want based on fundamental rational principles.

896
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:40,400
This is the history lesson that we fail miserably at communicating to people.

897
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:47,440
And that's why the budget of the NIH, which supports all of biomedical research, is 130th

898
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,160
or 140th of the military budget in this country, which is an outrage for modern.

899
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,800
Let me push it even further because I think this is really important when you say that

900
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:01,600
there is this perception that you can actually find applied research and that applied research

901
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:07,600
will miraculously generate the microwave and the cell phone, etc.

902
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:12,360
And unfortunately, everything that applied research does is to move our fundamental understanding

903
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:19,040
of how matter and biological matter works or inert matter works into something that is

904
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,480
then a lack of value.

905
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,800
But if you don't have that knowledge, you don't push that knowledge forward, the well

906
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,760
will dry up and we won't be able to do any more applied research.

907
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,680
So the idea that we now, everything has to be translational, everything has to be applied

908
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:36,800
is really a major problem because in the long run, we'll figure out that all these things

909
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:42,400
now are being translated and there's no more basic advancements that can be translated into

910
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,400
the data.

911
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:48,560
And to follow up on that, what gets hit hardest in times of austerity are exactly the topics

912
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,000
we're discussing today.

913
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,480
Systems biology, synthetic biology, approaches that are out of the box that are new, that

914
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:02,040
don't have a great track record because what does well is very well defined, almost no

915
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:08,240
risk proposals that attempt to move science forward incrementally.

916
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:13,480
So you have a very well established field of traditional biology and if you send your

917
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:18,600
proposal to the NIH, your ability to get that funding for your proposal relates directly

918
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:24,960
to how close you are to existing inertia of knowledge that exists in your field.

919
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,320
If you're totally out of the box, you get penalized and in times of austerity that's

920
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,320
even worse.

921
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:35,720
So if our fields are actually suffering this innovation challenge, partly because of this

922
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:42,480
funding that I alluded to, but partly because what funding limitations do is to then, you

923
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,200
know, then it goes to the Congress and goes to the White House and these guys are saying,

924
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,480
we need you guys to have deliverables.

925
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,600
You need to give us deliverables within a year or two.

926
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,080
What have you done for us in the last 10, 20 years?

927
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,760
You promise all this stuff and you haven't delivered.

928
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:03,080
So we want to make your science more applied, get, solve these specific problems that don't

929
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,920
understand that in order to have any chance of solving these complex problems, you need

930
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:10,960
a foundation of investment in basic research and that takes a long time.

931
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:16,120
Part of the problem isn't the education of what you're calling the late public.

932
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,320
Most of the problem is educating the scientist.

933
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:23,920
There are very few scientists who know where their history came from.

934
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:31,320
And, you know, if you take the average graduate student now, they will go back 10 years, they're

935
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,040
considering it a history lesson.

936
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:39,080
And if you look, for example, if you want to go back to the cures for cancer, many of

937
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:46,640
those discoveries came out of the fundamental work by New Sline-Volehart on the fruit fly.

938
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:53,520
This was to understand how a fruit fly cuticle gets patterned.

939
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:58,280
Did all the work, worked out all the original pathways, all the stuff that you guys are working

940
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:04,280
on now, all those pathways were discovered by a set of genetic experiments that then later,

941
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:09,440
30, 40 years later, led to those cures.

942
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:15,280
If you want to look at atherosclerosis cures and the statins prevention, you have to go

943
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:20,520
back to 1948 for the first epidemiological scientific studies, which were really pretty

944
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:25,320
much curiosity driven about what relates to heart disease.

945
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,640
So you can draw a trajectory.

946
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,880
And that arrow in my experience is about 40 to 50 years if you're lucky if it's going

947
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,880
to work minimally.

948
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:40,240
So I think the problem, though, is with the scientist as much as it is with the late public.

949
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,480
And my holly kinase, the czechuan, old cell psycho, was old yeast.

950
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,480
I know.

951
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,040
It was like, all those old little things started.

952
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,960
How old the major target for doing that?

953
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,200
I went in the back to one thing that you said, because this issue, we were joking before

954
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,720
when you guys arrived, because I arrived a little earlier, that we always promised science

955
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,240
to solve a problem in 10 years.

956
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:04,520
To some extent, Nixon's in 10 years is going to solve cancer then, Andy.

957
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:10,160
For God's name, the director of the National Cancer Institute in 2000.

958
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,840
No, no, no, no, no.

959
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,840
It won't go there.

960
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,080
Andy, you promised the cure for cancer.

961
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,080
Probably the new cancer.

962
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,080
15 years, etc.

963
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,920
Every once in a while, we come up with another 10 years or 15 years.

964
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:24,960
But the reality is that actually, the only problem is that cancer is cancer.

965
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,560
Cancer is plural.

966
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,400
And because a lot of cancers have been solved in the 10 years.

967
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:35,240
For instance, I was in Basel when the day that actually they announced that Glevaik,

968
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:40,720
because in fact approved, FDA approved, and that actually solved one cancer completely.

969
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,800
It was essentially 30% of the patient will erupt.

970
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:51,880
But people that the next day were going to die in Glevaik, all of a sudden, they were

971
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,880
saved.

972
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:58,040
The same thing in the secular cancer, same thing for instance in her two breast cancer.

973
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:02,520
I used to be one of the absolute worst tumors that you could possibly get.

974
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,280
Now they react very well to trans-susima and on and on and on.

975
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:12,680
So I think that we have, if you count the number of 10 years blocks, we've solved more cancers

976
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:16,560
than those number of 10 year blocks, it's just that we have discovered that this is such

977
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,640
a heterogeneous disease, both within the patient and across patients.

978
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,560
You want to say something with it, because I was surprised that you said that every patient's

979
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,280
cancer is different from the next...

980
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:31,320
So the spectrum of genetic alterations that lead to more agencies and progression are

981
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,920
essentially different in every single patient.

982
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,240
There's no two patients that have the same set of mutation.

983
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,320
There are some recurrent mutation that occur in multiple patients.

984
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,920
But those only tell a part of the story.

985
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,040
In fact, we're now doing a span cancer study where we study, live about 7,000 patients

986
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,960
that we fully profiled.

987
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,960
And you can see that these patterns of genetic alteration, they don't co-segregate on any

988
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,680
two patients.

989
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:58,160
And so one, I mean a big initiative, I was actually part, I'm sharing the net, co-sharing

990
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:03,640
the next annual meeting of the ACR, the megastation for cancer research.

991
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:07,960
And one of the big topics in that meeting and also one that we had as a forum in the

992
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,960
zero meeting is going to be the end of one study.

993
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,320
It is studies, clinical studies that are going to have a single patient.

994
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:19,240
And we have three patients in our Columbia and other places that have done these on a

995
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:23,840
genetic basis, we do it on a more assisted biology basis, where we're trying to solve

996
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,320
cancer just for one patient at a time.

997
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:30,200
And not that we think that we're actually going to fight cancer one patient at a time,

998
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,880
but we need to understand cancer one patient at a time before we can understand what other

999
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,840
rules that can be generalized.

1000
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,840
And so this is really...

1001
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,560
Understanding the genetics under the machinery...

1002
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,600
Understanding how the genetics collapse into creating certain dependencies that are then

1003
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,760
much more universal than the genetics.

1004
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:52,840
So the genetics is distributed, so for instance, in an example, many very, very bad cancers

1005
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:57,800
have a mutation in the gene called KRAS or in other RAS genes.

1006
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:01,280
But if you have a mutation in another gene called NF1, you will have almost the same phenotype

1007
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:06,280
because NF1 actually is the protein that allows KRAS to...

1008
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,280
It's called GTPAs...

1009
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,800
I have this GPA's function.

1010
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,320
So whether you mutate one or the other, it really makes very little difference.

1011
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,960
And you can have very similar phenotype.

1012
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:17,920
And there's an entire set of protein downstream from that that will give you like B-RAP and

1013
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:18,920
the vice-RAP for it.

1014
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,800
That will give you exactly the same, or very similar phenotype.

1015
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,160
This sent to me mutated differently in different cancers.

1016
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:31,600
For instance, in melanoma, you may have more B-RAP mutation in pancreatic cancer, 60, 70%

1017
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,920
of the patient have KRAS mutation, but no B-RAP or very few B-RAP mutation.

1018
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,040
So the question is that if you actually go in and try to figure these things up one gene

1019
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,560
at a time, you will really never be able to get the full story.

1020
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,120
And we know, for instance, KRAS is called right now an undrugable target, although many

1021
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,600
companies, but assuming purely...

1022
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:53,200
Nobody is probably trying to find the drug that will shut down KRAS.

1023
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:58,240
And so what we're left with is trying to figure out if this is the actual mutation, what is

1024
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,920
the node in the cell that becomes the vulnerability because you have the mutation?

1025
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:02,920
Okay?

1026
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:03,920
Should maybe another gene.

1027
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:09,120
So for instance, right now we know that if you use in prostate cancer a combination of

1028
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,640
a gene that inactivates protein called A-K-T through a virus, different mechanism.

1029
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,800
And in one, in another protein called MEC, the tumors that have KRAS mutation tend to

1030
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,800
be respond well.

1031
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:25,560
But that may be just an observation, we work in patient, we don't know, etc.

1032
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:30,760
So I think this is exactly why I think we need to try and understand tumors on an individual

1033
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:35,760
basis before we can now generalize because generalized has not really helped us, certainly

1034
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,160
helped us in some cases, but we have picked up the lohanging fruits and now we're left

1035
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,760
with all the other things that we don't really understand.

1036
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,760
Yeah.

1037
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:47,200
For example, it's so individual.

1038
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:51,760
I can't speak for any other group than mine.

1039
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:57,160
Our approach is what we call a molecular pathways approach, which is basically a systems biology

1040
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,280
approach.

1041
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:05,280
Because I would agree entirely that it's very difficult to explain biology in general,

1042
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,360
whether it be cancer or regenerative biology on the basis of one protein.

1043
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:16,920
But what we know is that the language of biology, the grammar of biology, is the pathway.

1044
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:23,320
The signal, the receptor, the transaction, nuclear transcription.

1045
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:27,800
And those pathways are conserved from fruit fly to man.

1046
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,080
Probably only a few dozen of these pathways.

1047
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:38,440
So for us, what we've taken upon ourselves to do is to try to dissect these pathways,

1048
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:44,560
health and disease, and say not only what are the pathways that are perturbed, because

1049
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,440
they can be perturbed, as you say, in many different places.

1050
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:53,160
But what are the vulnerable nodes where we could hit them with a drug?

1051
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:58,960
And so for us, we can play with all turning up, turning down all the different parts of

1052
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,200
the pathway without effect.

1053
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:04,880
But then we'll find one node that may not have been ever known to be associated with

1054
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,840
that pathway before and that we can hit.

1055
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,920
We know we can turn the pathway on or off.

1056
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:15,560
And that's the beginning of the process that takes 10 years after that to make a medicine.

1057
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,080
And it can get more complicated.

1058
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:21,640
I mean, I guess I see some more things in leukemia, as some drivers describe being in

1059
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:25,440
other cancers, is that being like a cancer biologist today is being sort of like a molecular

1060
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,440
mechanic.

1061
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,680
And someone just comes to you and says, I have leukemia, which is the same as saying my

1062
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,680
car doesn't work.

1063
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,160
And you just say, well, it could be because you have no gas in your car, you have no wheels,

1064
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,920
you have no steering wheel, you have no headlights.

1065
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:39,600
It could be for any number of all these reasons that may actually intersect the same pathway.

1066
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,760
But just saying I have cancer can be very, very different for a lot of different reasons.

1067
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,840
And it's being like a mechanic makes it a bit, you know, you have to figure out which one

1068
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,720
it is, I'd say, as what the job is.

1069
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:58,200
I think the way in which systems biology impacts that I think is one way, as we were

1070
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:02,000
discussing about the molecular pathology and the pathways involved in disease.

1071
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,200
The other side of this, I think, which is a new revolution in medicine, the emerging revolution

1072
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:12,760
in medicine, which is an attempt to approach medicine scientifically.

1073
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:18,200
Medicine has evolved through these really kind of old-fashioned approaches to physical

1074
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,080
science and symptoms.

1075
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,880
And I think it has done a terrible job of doing the kind of data mining that we do on large

1076
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,160
data sets that we get from the genome that have billions of pieces of information.

1077
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:32,520
So you go to the doctor, you make all these measurements.

1078
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:38,920
You do CBC, you have various physical science and symptoms written down in paper often,

1079
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:45,720
not inputted into electronic form, in ways that could, in retrospect, much better define

1080
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,600
a subtype of disease.

1081
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,040
So we lump things together because, you know, we're lazy.

1082
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:56,640
Because we've never had a molecular pathology, molecular basis of the pathology that's

1083
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,640
going on.

1084
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:02,400
And so, we have, we can have that molecular pathology, the other side of medicine, which

1085
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:07,840
is to characterize and bin individual patients into pathologic classes.

1086
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:13,240
In order to then come up with the exact treatment that works for them based on this pathway,

1087
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,440
and I said, that's going to be really revolutionary.

1088
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:23,200
I think in the field that's most, I think, most in need of that is psychiatry, where,

1089
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:27,560
you know, a lot of the classification of disease states are still very old-fashioned

1090
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,560
and ossified.

1091
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,840
And I think that's a very exciting area where potentially the kinds of data that we're

1092
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:40,440
getting on the systems level and together with existing quantification can lead to much

1093
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,440
better.

1094
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,440
Molecular psychiatry.

1095
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,440
Yeah, I'm like, what's coming.

1096
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,440
I just can't.

1097
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,440
I just want to direct that as one question.

1098
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:50,560
One other pivot point, I guess, to comment on the, to go back with the mechanic analogy

1099
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,880
is that we, the humans are though difficult and we do have many, many genetic elements

1100
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,640
that are not in mice, they're not in chimps, not in rhesus macaques.

1101
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:02,320
You know, there is evolution and keeps adding things and moving things around.

1102
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:06,440
And so one of the big challenges people say, well, I haven't just figured out cancer yet.

1103
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:09,200
We're still discovering how many genes there are in the human genome.

1104
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,040
You know, a lot of people think 25,000 or 40,000.

1105
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:16,200
The number is at least 55,000 vectorin counts and I can promise you we're just going to

1106
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,200
end up hiring.

1107
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,240
And so, you know, we're just, you know, getting, even within the scientific community, people

1108
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:24,720
have figured out how many genes are there in the human genome is itself, you know, it could

1109
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,600
almost prompt wrestling matches at conferences and I've threatened to tackle people who use

1110
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,800
the number 25,000 genes and I'll do it again today publicly.

1111
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,760
But so it's complicated and we're still learning.

1112
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,760
Okay.

1113
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,760
So any questions?

1114
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:50,360
I have to come up here.

1115
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,360
Thank you.

1116
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,360
Breath taking.

1117
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,560
What comes to mind is a question of time management.

1118
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:01,000
You gentlemen have great goals, limited time.

1119
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:08,000
How do you want to spend your time and advise other people who might want to do this kind

1120
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:15,080
of dissemination and research to divide their time most effectively?

1121
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,080
Sleep less.

1122
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:27,760
Well, I would say it would be fantastic if we were supported at a level that was commensurate

1123
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:36,520
with the goals, ambitious goals that we have and the impact the economic and lifestyle

1124
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:40,640
impact that these scientific methodology will have in the future.

1125
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,280
So that would be great because they'll free us from not writing grants.

1126
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:48,600
Because right now we're spending 30, 40% of our times writing grants to the NIH and that's

1127
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,840
very, very painful.

1128
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:54,960
And nine out of ten of those, the funding right now is such that maybe the 10th percentile

1129
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,360
roughly maybe works.

1130
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,360
It's worse.

1131
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:03,200
So maybe the, let's be optimistic and say it was the 10th percentile.

1132
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:08,600
That means not the number we have here, but suppose there are ten of us in this room writing

1133
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:14,320
grants the NIH, nine of them or more go into the shredder and don't get funded.

1134
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:18,680
Then you go back and you spend however many hours or days it takes or weeks it takes.

1135
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,680
Months.

1136
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,680
And you write it again.

1137
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:24,680
So that's I think it's very hard to make progress when you're spending most of your

1138
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:28,320
time writing grants that will go into the shredder and not get funded.

1139
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,040
And the ones that go into the shredder and don't get funded are not by people who don't

1140
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,040
know what they're doing.

1141
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,960
They're by, hopefully we know what we're doing.

1142
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,120
People like us.

1143
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,120
And so that's.

1144
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:40,560
So it's very, it's very interesting because I spent, I did the opposite of what Marty is.

1145
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,840
So I spent 16 years in industry then I moved to academia.

1146
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,640
And I realized when I moved to academia that I had to start writing grants which was a

1147
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,960
completely foreign notion when you are in industry.

1148
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:56,360
And I realized that if the American industry worked on using the same metrics that the

1149
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:00,920
NIH works there would not be an American industry because the idea is that what you

1150
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:06,080
actually do in industry you have a track record and based on that track record you keep building

1151
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,560
funded and your track record goes down and you stop getting funded and you shrink your

1152
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,560
project.

1153
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,840
And then maybe you can grow again at a later stage when you come up with a new bright idea

1154
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:21,800
in NIH funding concepts with through the grants your track record really doesn't count very

1155
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,800
much.

1156
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,400
In fact most of these grants, old say, exception investigators you always go get top boost

1157
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:31,040
but in the end what counts is whether somebody says, oh you're a proposal is too ambitious.

1158
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,600
Well you know whether it's ambitious or not.

1159
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:38,160
You should be based on the fact that whether you accomplish in the past funding cycle.

1160
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:43,160
And so I think that there's pretty much a general understanding that we need to rethink

1161
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:49,160
a little bit the ways that sort of funds for research are managed and distributed because

1162
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,280
and then maybe we need two different mechanisms.

1163
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:55,640
One for establishing investigators that we should be based mostly on track record unless

1164
01:20:55,640 --> 01:21:00,160
you propose something completely new and one for junior investigator that really starting

1165
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,440
together their career launch and it may be some extra boost in health.

1166
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:09,640
But the way the system works right now has become really, really very difficult to hold.

1167
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:17,200
And there's a series concerning here that's from friends all the time that we're going

1168
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:21,320
to lose a generation of scientists that the next generation coming along people who are

1169
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:25,280
in graduate school and doing postdocs now they look at us and they see that we spend

1170
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:29,720
our time writing grants that don't get funded and get demoralized and they in graduate school

1171
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:34,320
and postdocs say I don't want my boss's job I want to do something else because because

1172
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,440
of the you know the tightness of the funding and how time is spent it's very demoralizing.

1173
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,800
But we're certainly bruising the American scientists because the American scientists

1174
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:47,520
are essentially is a species that should go under protection because right now it's under

1175
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,760
the... and there's only so many times you can say failure and makes me more determined

1176
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,400
I guess it's...

1177
01:21:55,400 --> 01:22:00,060
So Dr. Fishman had commented that the administration of a particular compound would not affect subsequent

1178
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:01,060
generations.

1179
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:05,160
Forgive me I missed it was it the compound related to emerald the drug that was being

1180
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:11,560
done. No we were talking about the cells that were generated artificially using a construct

1181
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:16,840
to target the T cells of a person to their own cancer.

1182
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:21,960
I'm curious if other members of the panel would feel confident making that statement

1183
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,760
that it would not affect subsequent generations.

1184
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,760
It depends on the therapy there've been publications of gene therapy that has showed up in germline

1185
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:34,560
tissue I mean I can't speak to this particular experiment but I think I know the literature

1186
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,880
you're probably thinking that's only T cell so it shouldn't occur in this particular case

1187
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:44,040
it should not as far as I know but these are not replicating viruses so you take out the

1188
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:50,600
T cell you put in something when that T cell dies eventually it can't go into the virus

1189
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,600
the...

1190
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,440
Your concern about epigenetic...

1191
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,440
Actually yes.

1192
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,440
Your concern about epigenetic.

1193
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,120
I'm just saying your PR problem really.

1194
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:02,400
So epigenetic interactions it's been intergenerational epigenetic interactions have been studied pretty

1195
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,800
well in mice but very scarcely in humans that's changing with what's called the epigenome

1196
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:11,840
roadmap project from the NIH is helping with that but most of that is not intergenerational

1197
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,160
and in the short answer is I'd say you know people probably haven't looked at what the

1198
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,160
the...

1199
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:21,320
For the audience I guess epigenetic just refers to changes that aren't to the DNA of ACGT

1200
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:25,880
but when you have modifications to those the ACGNT that the letters don't change but their

1201
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,200
state does.

1202
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:32,960
So epigenetic changes are heritable but I don't know if there's any evidence.

1203
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,360
No there is evidence that they are for example they are...

1204
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:40,000
It's been proved best in the nematode worm where you can...

1205
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,320
Something that happens in a grandfather worm can be passed on through two generations

1206
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,920
epigenetically without any change in the sequence of DNA.

1207
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:54,040
There are suggestions from old studies but they're epidemiological suggestions of epidemiological

1208
01:23:54,040 --> 01:24:02,240
effects of a grandfather's smoking in Scandinavia upon two generations later disease.

1209
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,240
Who was the diet wasn't it?

1210
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,240
No the diet was...

1211
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,240
I think the diet...

1212
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,240
You may be right with this.

1213
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,240
No no no no no.

1214
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,840
The smoking in the grandfather affected the diet of the two generations, obesity rate

1215
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,120
in two generations but that's of course epidemiological...

1216
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,480
But there are diseases that are completely transmittent epigenetically so Wilms...

1217
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,280
Wilms do much for instance is completely epigenetic disease.

1218
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:26,840
And fragile ex-syndrome is an epigenetic, red syndrome is an epigenetic but the actual

1219
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:30,640
proof of the transmission has been passed on in the nematode worm.

1220
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:34,480
Well I ask my question in an attempt to address yours actually.

1221
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:42,360
I agree the transparency is paramount as far as PR for your industry but hubris and trust

1222
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:46,520
speaking as a member of the public is something will require.

1223
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,520
Thank you for this time.

1224
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,520
Thank you.

1225
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,520
Thanks.

1226
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:56,680
I wanted to go back to the funding issue and ask...

1227
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:05,960
So for you me this is a very eastern, US eastern group here and there are companies that are

1228
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,360
printing DNA.

1229
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:12,600
You can order it online and get little vials of DNA.

1230
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:18,360
There are VCs funding this kind of stuff and so I'm curious whether you guys have gone

1231
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:23,920
and looked for your funding not with the NIH or in Boston but out in Silicon Valley where

1232
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:29,520
there is in fact a lot of money and the freedom to do really interesting stuff.

1233
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:34,360
The VCs tend to fund, I mean especially these days they tend to fund, they tend to be essentially

1234
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:35,360
bankers.

1235
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:40,360
What they want to do is to minimize absolutely every risk possible and assure themselves

1236
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:44,760
that they're going to have a huge return on investment and then jump in.

1237
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:51,640
And also there are three to at most five years horizon and this is not the way the science

1238
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:52,640
can work.

1239
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,640
Not all of them.

1240
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,640
But the vast...

1241
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,640
But the vast...

1242
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,640
Could people let us know the ones that...

1243
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:57,640
Yeah, let us know.

1244
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:58,640
Are you representing one?

1245
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:02,640
It comes to me afterwards, I don't want to take this over but seriously.

1246
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:07,960
Well, some of the VC firms that they're tied to the terms of getting that money are very

1247
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:13,520
either onerous in terms of the timeline or what strings come attached to it there.

1248
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,920
But I've done some work with industry, just grants, just well let's say we're interested

1249
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:22,200
in how perfectly you can take a single cell, amplify the genome and correctly genotype

1250
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,840
it or work like that, that's industry funded.

1251
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:29,040
There's definitely a lot of convergence of ideas and passion from industry and academic

1252
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:34,000
and government researchers and clinicians but they rarely intermingle as much as they

1253
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,880
should I think is what you're getting at.

1254
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:42,160
The major issue is the goal directed nature of that transaction and that you can't impose

1255
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:46,720
that expectation on scientists who are attempting to understand the system they don't know

1256
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,200
much about, right?

1257
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:56,760
You need to support innovative adventurous researchers to follow for five, ten years down

1258
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:01,480
a path that they don't even know ahead of time and that it might not yield anything.

1259
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:05,760
And if you do enough of that, once in a hundred you will have the breakthrough of a generation

1260
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,640
that will solve all your problems.

1261
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,840
You just don't know who that person is going to be.

1262
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,320
And that is not the kind of structure that industry receives will support.

1263
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:17,960
They just cannot quantify the risk and the ROI on that.

1264
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:20,280
Let me give you some very practical examples.

1265
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:27,600
So we are all sort of asked by many confederate companies and biotech to work and collaborate

1266
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,480
with them but the kind of collaboration that they always have in mind are the ones where

1267
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:35,400
they look at something that we've already done and is really ready for a practice of

1268
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:39,560
two years, two days ago we just signed a letter of intent to do a clinical trial in breast

1269
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:43,160
cancer that was a complete novel cancer come from systems biology.

1270
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,240
So that's now being done.

1271
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,240
That's the kind of thing that they're looking for.

1272
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,000
They're not looking to find the research that led to that.

1273
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,520
So I think the problem is that that well will dry up and there are some companies like

1274
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:59,480
for instance, Novartis and others that actually have also take a step back and have a lot

1275
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,920
of collaboration on the CCLE.

1276
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:05,800
This is the creation of this thing called the cancer cell line in CCLE.

1277
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,720
It's been one thing that Novartis has done and it's been transformational for the entire

1278
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:13,320
community and it's truly a basic science effort.

1279
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:18,120
I wish there were even more dissemination of the data that came back from that to the

1280
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:22,360
open community but what has already been put out there has been really valuable.

1281
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:26,680
And this has been collaboration with in the case the Broad Institute and other institutes.

1282
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:31,240
So there are examples like that but I would say 99% of the examples that we have are very,

1283
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,240
very pragmatic.

1284
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,040
I'll talk to you ever once too.

1285
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,040
That's great.

1286
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,040
I love it.

1287
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:37,040
If you have ideas.

1288
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,960
Crazy billionaires need more than they seem to be.

1289
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,000
That sounds good.

1290
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,120
So we're finding a lot of the end of ones for instance using that type of support.

1291
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:49,560
Well I agree with all the places where Blaine was placed.

1292
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:53,560
I think one was not mentioned as the drug companies themselves.

1293
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:57,640
I can't remember the exact numbers but if you look at their marketing budgets versus

1294
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:05,320
their research budgets, it's opposite directions and you know just the goal of the ads on TV.

1295
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:10,160
My question is wouldn't that money be better spent supporting your guys research than marketing

1296
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:12,200
and what caused this?

1297
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:17,960
Why did drug companies go in this direction?

1298
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,960
We may have on buy answers.

1299
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:25,360
So I run research so I'm happy to have as much funding as I can get.

1300
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:30,360
But you have to remember that the companies, and I'm not defending it by the way, I'm just

1301
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:35,240
explaining what I think happened historically because I'm not an expert in marketing.

1302
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,240
But these are publicly held companies.

1303
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:43,600
So these are companies that part of their job is to make money and to have a share price.

1304
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,240
It worked is the answer.

1305
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,040
In other words they were able to make money.

1306
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:51,320
So here's the history that's an interesting history and I think is quite educational in

1307
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,400
terms of thinking how they should go forward.

1308
01:29:54,400 --> 01:30:03,760
Historically, pharmaceutical companies could make a lot of money by making minor modifications

1309
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,080
in a drug that was there.

1310
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:11,480
So if you look at the history of FDA approvals over years, there's only about 20 new drugs

1311
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:16,360
approved a year which is very few considering the number of pharmaceutical companies.

1312
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:21,720
And only five, six of those are really new and would change medicine.

1313
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,240
The rest are relatively minor modifications.

1314
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,920
You say well how can a company do that?

1315
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,480
And they did that because it worked.

1316
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:36,120
It was cheaper to do the experiment because you already knew that it worked when you got

1317
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,120
into the clinic.

1318
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,920
All you had to do was change the slight absorption.

1319
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,480
See, it's not that they're always unimportant changes but they're relatively minor.

1320
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:47,400
Also patents because the new patent is running out, they just modify and do the new thing.

1321
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,400
Exactly, exactly.

1322
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:54,920
But here's the problem now which is I think good in the direction that you're suggesting.

1323
01:30:54,920 --> 01:31:00,080
As governments throughout the world, not just the United States, become more conscious

1324
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:08,040
that the medical budgets are eating up a lot of their funding, they're pushing for novelty.

1325
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:15,480
They're saying I don't really want to approve or not or to fund but pay back for something

1326
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,280
that's not really innovative.

1327
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:22,880
So the pressures from the outside are now conspiring, I believe in a good way, to force

1328
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:27,800
companies to do more innovative work and to have more breakthroughs.

1329
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:32,720
The only thing that's changing is I think that the notion of marketing which was driven

1330
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:38,000
by just no sheer mass efforts, that's why it was so expensive, is what I think is going

1331
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:44,480
to be not necessarily the future when you have a lot more that can be available online,

1332
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,640
on the web, et cetera.

1333
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:51,120
So I think there may be a lot of forces conspiring to change that balance over time.

1334
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,920
At least that's my hope.

1335
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:53,920
Okay.

1336
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,840
Councillor Hough, I mean the one thing that we've observed actually over the last few

1337
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:05,720
years is that there's been a shift back towards pharmaceutical company and biotech engaging

1338
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:12,360
academics, centers at a much earlier stage and essentially outsourcing some extent part

1339
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,360
of the research.

1340
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,640
We do it a little differently.

1341
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:19,160
We have actually markedly expanded my basic science discovery group.

1342
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:24,920
So a very large part of what we do is fundamental pathway analysis and fundamental discovery,

1343
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,640
publishable work, we have 100 postdocs.

1344
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:33,200
We also interact a lot with academia so for my bed, which we don't know if it'll work

1345
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:38,400
as this thing takes so long is that the more we discover fundamentally in the long run,

1346
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,000
the more medicines it'll be.

1347
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Hi.

1348
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,880
I might be at the wrong place, I'm not sure.

1349
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:49,960
I think you all feel that way actually.

1350
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,560
I needed a new disc.

1351
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:55,040
Is there anything going on out there right now?

1352
01:32:55,040 --> 01:33:00,040
I broke my one bar six years ago and destroyed the disc.

1353
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:05,840
I can tell you a little bit about it right now, it's early stages in what's called regenerative

1354
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,000
medicine.

1355
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:12,720
I certainly can't promise anything now, but there are two directions that you can think

1356
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:13,720
about.

1357
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:20,640
One is that there are some studies that suggest that you have in your, so the problem is the

1358
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:23,600
disc is distorted, the bone is distorted.

1359
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,720
So the question is can you regenerate normal tissue?

1360
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:33,360
And we know we do have cells sitting in our spine and in our cartilage that can do that,

1361
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,360
but they don't.

1362
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:37,840
So one set of groups are looking for drugs or...

1363
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,840
Disparked that.

1364
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:39,840
Yeah.

1365
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,040
And the other of course are devices.

1366
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:47,280
And they are not an expert at all, but newer, smarter, better devices that are less destructive.

1367
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:54,760
But you may have an extreme form of it, but everyone has degenerative disease in their

1368
01:33:54,760 --> 01:34:01,440
spine, pretty much everyone over in middle age or over has started having problems with

1369
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,440
it.

1370
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:05,120
We're not meant to stand upright, but it's a big problem.

1371
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,960
It's 94% of people over 40 that have these issues.

1372
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:10,440
Yeah, it's a huge problem.

1373
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:16,080
But I think now with our understanding of developmental biology and where the stem cells

1374
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:19,680
come from, I'm not talking about the kind of stem cells you read about in the newspaper,

1375
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:23,400
but the stem cells that sit in your cartilage or sit in your bone that could become new

1376
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,400
cartilage.

1377
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,320
And there, I can't though promise when.

1378
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,800
Has anybody working on the cure for greed?

1379
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:30,800
For what?

1380
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:31,800
A cure for greed?

1381
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,800
Greed, I think we have to understand it first.

1382
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:38,320
That was the life of the psychiatry, I think.

1383
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,320
That's an important one.

1384
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:42,160
I'm trying for that, thank you.

1385
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:48,880
Hi, first of all, thank you for extraordinary discussion.

1386
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:54,760
And to ask my question, I have to make a couple of points.

1387
01:34:54,760 --> 01:35:02,840
First, if we always simplify, it's a matter as what was said here, it's like we believe

1388
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:05,800
in evolution, but we don't like it.

1389
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,160
We like creation.

1390
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:19,760
And second point is if we start to play and we create toys, we won't stop.

1391
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:27,120
And at some point, it's a question from like your question when humanity will end.

1392
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:35,880
It's like at some point, we will be able to create something from scratch and probably

1393
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,640
in our image.

1394
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:41,920
So would we do this?

1395
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:49,920
Would we give these new creatures absolute independence and for a view?

1396
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,040
Or we try to control them?

1397
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:54,440
If they're sentient, absolutely.

1398
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:57,520
If they're bacteria, it becomes a good question, I think.

1399
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:01,600
If they're bacteria that you made, I think there should be some statutory responsibility

1400
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,920
for the thing that you created that has no sentience.

1401
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,240
I think it has to otherwise people will make them and say, well, I don't know.

1402
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:10,720
I'm thinking about something bigger, like in our image.

1403
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,720
Well, I know.

1404
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:15,800
You know, children, essentially, are made in our image.

1405
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:20,960
But we wait until they're 18, I guess.

1406
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,880
I don't give my children a few will.

1407
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:25,880
They take it.

1408
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,880
But you don't have to give it.

1409
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:28,880
They have to take it.

1410
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,880
I'm not going to give it.

1411
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:34,400
This came up to when people talked about cloned or IVF babies, are they real people?

1412
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,400
Do they have souls?

1413
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,000
Are these questions have come up before?

1414
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:42,400
I think without question, if they have somewhere between 45 and 48 chromosomes and they look

1415
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:46,040
like all of us and they are what we call human, I think it's...

1416
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:49,080
You don't even have to go that far.

1417
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:52,400
I mean, right now, there's always been a problem.

1418
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:58,040
Half of the sci-fi literature is about getting sentient organics that are actually non-biological

1419
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:00,320
and they're silicon-based.

1420
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:06,480
I think that's probably a much earlier thing to come because now they're starting to achieve

1421
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:09,520
some pretty dramatic computational power.

1422
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,040
And already, they're starting to...

1423
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,040
This place I'm pretty scary characteristics.

1424
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:16,920
I can't speak for everyone, but I'd be happy to give more rights rather than to take them

1425
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:17,920
away from entities.

1426
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:22,480
But it's easier for control purposes, I guess, to take them away from things that are scared

1427
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,480
of.

1428
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:24,480
We love one last question.

1429
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,480
Great.

1430
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:26,480
Thanks for coming here today.

1431
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:35,920
My question actually comes around to the point that each of you come from different sectors

1432
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:40,920
of the industry, private and research and whatnot.

1433
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:46,000
What are you doing or what is being done in order to have more of a brain trust and a

1434
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,600
collaboration of discoveries?

1435
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:55,000
I come from the technology sector, so we have a lot of cross-breeding in philosophies around

1436
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,400
designing and architectures.

1437
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:00,360
But it's easy for us because technology's fundamentally programming is fundamentally

1438
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,160
free.

1439
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:05,960
But it touches the funding issue of where that money comes from and then the private sector,

1440
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:10,120
the profitability of the business model, and then actually the interest in the research,

1441
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:14,600
right, the actual why are we trying to figure out these protein sequences or what it may

1442
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:15,600
be.

1443
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:19,160
So I'm just kind of curious of your opinions on that area and how you see the future of

1444
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:20,160
that moving forward.

1445
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:24,160
So that's really a great question because if I've seen something that has been really

1446
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:28,880
transformational right now, is that the old model of funding, this is I'm talking about

1447
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:33,400
academia in this case, but the old model of funding where there was, it's called R01 based.

1448
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:37,000
R01 is a particular type of grants that funds an individual investigator.

1449
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,320
So, you know, Chris gets an R01 and then his labs does specific research that they propose

1450
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:43,160
in the R01.

1451
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:50,800
But there have been a number of now sort of, we call them networks of research centers.

1452
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:55,920
One that was, for instance, participating in the last five years, we call cancer target

1453
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:56,920
discovery and development.

1454
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,160
And this is essentially a group of centers.

1455
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:02,320
We started with five centers and then it's been expanded because it was a very successful

1456
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,120
experiment to 13 centers.

1457
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:11,320
And we are essentially not just forced, but really encouraged to collaborate with each

1458
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:12,320
other.

1459
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:17,480
And it's been one of the most extraordinary experiences in terms of having really valuable

1460
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:22,120
incredibly productive collaborations that we really would never have thought of if we

1461
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,880
had continued to do the research in a more traditional way.

1462
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:30,160
So I think the NIH is starting to recognize this and I think NSF as well.

1463
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,640
And so there is a trend.

1464
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:36,160
I'm not saying that it should be only collaborative research that needs to be done, but finding

1465
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:40,600
the right balance between the two is probably going to be really instrumental because most

1466
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:45,960
of the especially things like systems biology, when we have a system biology paper today,

1467
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:49,520
it has anything from people that did the mathematical model of people that actually

1468
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,520
run the self-infrastructure.

1469
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,520
We would do the experimental validation.

1470
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,200
We would do the mouse work, et cetera.

1471
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:59,200
And it end up being humongous team efforts, not just things that you can do in one lab.

1472
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:04,680
And so I think hopefully we're going to see more and more of these separate collaborations

1473
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:08,080
and that will be very, very productive as we've seen them be.

1474
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:20,840
Thank you very much.

1475
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:42,280
Thank you very much.
