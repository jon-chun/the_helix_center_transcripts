1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Coming.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I guess you know we're the amygdalaids and we play music about mind and brain and mental disorders.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So it's fitting that we're in this particular place tonight.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And the program is we're going to play a few songs and play about 45 minutes, 50 minutes or so.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But before each sort of suite of songs, which would be one or two songs together on a particular topic,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll just give you a brief kind of background about the intellectual background of the topic,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the historical kind of place that the ideas come from, that the song is sort of based upon.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And we're going to start off with a couple of songs about one of the deep problems in psychology, philosophy,

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
neuroscience, psychiatry, all of the things that we know and care about, which is the mind-body problem.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And you know this goes back to the ancient Greeks.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We have ideas from the article at Delphi, for example, that the article said know thyself and a couple of millennia later,

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Descartes tried to solve this problem by concluding that the only thing he could know was himself with certainty.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But you know this becomes, with Freud this becomes more questionable because then we have some issues about how much of what we are is conscious and how much is unconscious.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So a couple of themes will be explored tonight through the music is consciousness and unconsciousness and the automaticity of certain aspects of who we are.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And we're going to start with a couple of songs that are more in the area of consciousness,

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:13,000
in particular with the first one is sort of a tribute to Descartes and he goes like this.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think so I am, I feel so I must be, sometimes I don't know, but it is to be me, I see your eyes,

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and they're staring at me, they're sharp as knives, oh what do we see, you can't see, you can't see inside of me,

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:14,000
inside of me there's a blade only I can be.

20
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:36,000
My soul has passion, it's trying to feel, searching for desire, nothing is real, my will is weak, it's not very free,

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:59,000
nothing to get hung about, oh that's just the deal, you can't see inside of me, inside of me, that's a place only I can be,

22
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:14,000
you can't see inside of me, inside of me that's a place only I can be.

23
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I think so I am, I feel so I must be, sometimes I don't know, it's to be me,

24
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think so I am, I feel so I must be, sometimes I don't know, but it is to be me, you can't see, you can't see inside of me,

25
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:50,000
inside of me there's a blade only I can be, it only I can't be only I can beson

26
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,240
All right, thank you very much.

27
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,440
Tyler, you'd say something for a minute while I switch guitars.

28
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,880
Well, about the mind-body problem.

29
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,400
Yes, what's the next song, Joe?

30
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
I forgot.

31
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Mind-over matter.

32
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Oh, mind-over matter.

33
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:19,680
So, yeah, yeah, we have to, well, of course, in culture, we think we have a lot of control

34
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,440
over matter, and we do in a certain sort of way.

35
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,340
But there's always a longing for more and more transcendence, and so we think of ourselves

36
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,640
as immaterial beings as the same times that were materially embodied.

37
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,520
And so this next song is a little bit about the, that kind of conflict between the material

38
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
and the immaterial.

39
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:51,440
Yeah, and it's about the, you know, the longing that you can have for someone who's not here

40
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,140
and sort of delude yourself into thinking you can overcome space and time and bring

41
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:20,120
that person together with you.

42
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:30,020
Mind-over matter.

43
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,020
There's something I'm trying to do.

44
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:46,460
I guess it's only physics that keeps me apart from you.

45
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,860
Mind-over matter.

46
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,260
Something I'm trying to do.

47
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,100
Break down space and time.

48
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,940
Be together with you.

49
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,180
I'm trying to will you here.

50
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,940
Mind you wherever you are.

51
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,900
Locate your body or soul.

52
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,980
Pull you in from afar.

53
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,980
Are you still in my time?

54
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,980
Have you slipped away?

55
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:49,940
Have you gone forward to back living in another day?

56
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:56,940
Where am I to be?

57
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,940
Different continent around the sea.

58
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,940
In the air, flying free.

59
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,940
In a place, heavenly.

60
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:21,940
No mound of space or time can keep you from being mine.

61
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:50,940
I'm trying to keep you from being mine.

62
00:09:50,940 --> 00:10:00,940
Mind-over matter.

63
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:10,940
There's something I'm trying to do.

64
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:20,940
I guess it's only physics that keeps me apart from you.

65
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,940
Mind-over matter.

66
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:32,940
Something I'm trying to do.

67
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:42,940
Break down space and time.

68
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Be together with you.

69
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,940
Be together with you.

70
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Thank you.

71
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,940
Now we're going to switch gears to the unconscious mind.

72
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:16,940
We're going to do a couple of songs about how we aren't always quite aware of what's driving our behavior.

73
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,940
There's a lot of stuff deep below the surface.

74
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,940
The mind is below the tip of the iceberg.

75
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,940
This is a song by Tyler called the automatic mind.

76
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,940
The song is about the way the mind travels by itself on its own journey.

77
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,940
You can not have any particular stimulus.

78
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,940
You could be meditating in one of the main lessons.

79
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:52,940
The first insight is about meditation.

80
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,940
This is an ongoing meditation for me.

81
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,940
The song is called the automatic mind.

82
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,940
I still have to write beyond the automatic mind one of these years.

83
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,940
Right now it's the automatic mind.

84
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,940
It's got an interesting base part here.

85
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,940
When you get there you'll write the song.

86
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
Beyond.

87
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,940
I get there.

88
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:45,940
Okay.

89
00:12:45,940 --> 00:13:03,940
Welcome to the automatic mind.

90
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:10,940
The door is open to remembered time.

91
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:18,940
Images are conjured like a dream.

92
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:29,940
Guiding actions on the waking screen.

93
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:36,940
Even though I realize it's still I feel so blind.

94
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:45,940
As I think about and can't live without the automatic mind.

95
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:14,940
We live in the automatic mind.

96
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,940
Introspection opens in her eyes.

97
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:28,940
It seems advanced yet hardly in control.

98
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:40,940
Illusion of the will is comfort cold.

99
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,940
Even though I realize it's still I feel so blind.

100
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:56,940
As I think about and can't live without the automatic mind.

101
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:02,940
Walk.

102
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,940
Talk.

103
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,940
Drink.

104
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
Think.

105
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
Think.

106
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,940
Think.

107
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,940
Think.

108
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,940
Think.

109
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,940
So

110
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,940
You

111
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:35,340
I realize it's still I feel so blind as I think about and can't live without automatic mind

112
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:44,060
All right, so let me just take that opportunity to introduce Tyler Tyler as a

113
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,940
Professor of Environmental Sciences and biology at NYU and he works on

114
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,720
Atmospheric and issues and carbon and things like that anything else you want to add about that?

115
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,060
That's good Joe. Okay

116
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Daniela Schiller is a

117
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,700
Assistant professor at Mount Sinai. She's a cognitive neuroscientist and she studies

118
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,180
recovery from fear and processes in the brain that

119
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,020
Allow people to get over fears through various ways anything else

120
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,820
And she's also an award-winning storyteller for the moth organization and other places

121
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,900
Amanda Thorpe is a world-famous international

122
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,500
musician

123
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:40,340
She hails from Derby, England Darby, I guess it's a doggy

124
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,340
And we're very fortunate to have her with us and although she's not technically a scientist

125
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:55,100
She does have a background in neuropsychology from University College London. So we count her as a part of the team

126
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,020
Okay, and under the lamp, but she's a fabulous musician with a separate solo career all together

127
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,500
With a bunch of CDs you can find her online at demandathorp.com, right?

128
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:14,420
Okay, I'm Joe LaDue and I'm a professor of neuroscience at NYU and now we're gonna do a song called

129
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
My Mind's up

130
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:27,020
So my mind's eye is another one about the the way the mind plays tricks on us and does things that

131
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:34,340
We don't always know too much about and if I can remember where this thing goes this time we're being good shit

132
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,940
Okay, so take it away

133
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:50,220
I can't think

134
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:13,020
If you look into my mind's eye

135
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,460
You would see the way that I cry

136
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,860
Deep inside in my mind's eye

137
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:35,340
We had love it was good

138
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,700
You are there you understood

139
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,380
Everything

140
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,420
Yes, everything

141
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:59,380
You can't always trust what you think you know can't trust what you believe

142
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,060
Sometimes your mind just puts on a show

143
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,140
It's simply disease

144
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:14,180
My mind's eye you were mine my mind's eye was fine

145
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:21,700
If you look into my mind's eye

146
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,260
You would see the way that I cry

147
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,700
Deep inside in my mind's eye

148
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:45,980
You can't always trust what you think you know can't trust what you believe

149
00:20:45,980 --> 00:21:06,500
Sometimes your mind just puts on a show it's simply disease

150
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,980
You

151
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,980
My mind's eye you were mine my mind's I was blind

152
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
My mind's I was blind

153
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,500
My mind's I was blind

154
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Oh, yeah, my mind's I was blind

155
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Thank you

156
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,260
Okay

157
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:11,180
Yeah, map your mind so we have automatic mind and my mind's eyes like part of the the problems with our

158
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,180
psyches and

159
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,100
But there's also a lot of joy being a human being as well

160
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:26,420
Which I hope we're all smiling about every minute of the day. So this is actually some of our favorite song. It's by Joe

161
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:42,180
It's called map of your mind. Okay, here we go

162
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:54,660
Made a map of your mind I've charted my course

163
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,380
I'm sailing deep inside

164
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:13,900
Got the winds of force got the heat of your heart keep you from the cold

165
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:23,740
Got the currents of will take me to your soul

166
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,740
I'm on a journey

167
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,580
Out of God

168
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,100
It's a boy

169
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,340
Had I knew I

170
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,700
And excursion

171
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,100
Of the inside

172
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:02,740
It's a trip fuel by fire

173
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:20,620
Made a map of your mind I charted my course

174
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:34,540
Tailing deep inside I've got the winds of force got the heat of your heart

175
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:43,700
Keep me from the cold got the currents of will

176
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,300
Take me to your soul

177
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:57,900
I'm just hoping I'll say it will be true

178
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:12,220
That they'll take me straight to you

179
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,420
Let the winds blow from the sweet

180
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,420
Joe and I land

181
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:28,420
My minds will meet

182
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:56,420
Got the heat of your heart

183
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:01,420
Keep me from the cold

184
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,420
Got the currents of will

185
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,420
Take me to your soul

186
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,420
Made a map of your mind

187
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,420
Take me to your soul

188
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:24,420
Made a map of your mind

189
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,420
Take me to your soul

190
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,420
To your soul

191
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:39,420
To your soul

192
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,420
To your soul

193
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,420
All right, thank you

194
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:05,420
Now we have a song called Trace, which is something that people here have studied

195
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:15,420
Of traces of memories, how they leave permanent records in the neurons and now the DNA and the neurotransmitters

196
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,420
From having the memory, it's really there

197
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:25,420
So it's a connection between our daily lives and the discoveries about the neurological systems of our brains

198
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,420
The song is called Trace

199
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:38,420
We're moving now into the memory part of the show, so we do a couple songs about memory

200
00:27:38,420 --> 00:28:06,420
You left a trace in my memory

201
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:14,420
A permanent place in my synoptics

202
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:21,420
Say the time feels all pain

203
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:36,420
The time can't erase your place in my brain

204
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:43,420
Days and nights they were so fine

205
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:51,420
Months and years, maybe sublime

206
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:58,420
Time stood still, while it flew on by

207
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:24,420
Time ended when you said goodbye

208
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:32,420
You left a trace in my memory

209
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:39,420
A permanent place in my synoptics

210
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:47,420
Say the time feels all pain

211
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:55,420
Time can't erase your place in my brain

212
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:46,420
Time can't erase your place in my memory

213
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:57,420
You're a dominant trace, you won't erase your a dominant trace

214
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:12,420
You won't erase your a dominant trace, you won't erase your a dominant trace

215
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:20,420
You'll never be a ray

216
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:26,420
Okay, thank you

217
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:32,420
For those who are sort of neuroscience aficionados

218
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:38,420
That song was written over a dinner with Richard Morris and Yadine Doudai

219
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:44,420
Which Richard challenged me to write a song about Yadine's theory of the dominant trace

220
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,420
Just in case you know what that means

221
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:55,420
The next song is back to the other guitar, it's glue

222
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:00,420
This is another song about memory

223
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:09,420
It's about glue and the way that emotions can glue together your memories and make them stronger

224
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:15,420
You probably noticed that most of our neuroscience songs are love songs

225
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:20,420
That's the way we kind of tell the story of the brain

226
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:30,420
We got us this on

227
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:37,420
We can go behind you

228
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:42,420
Turn that off for a second

229
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:52,420
Shisha's a good scientist

230
00:32:52,420 --> 00:33:15,420
I saw you leaving, you saw me too

231
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:24,420
You smiled at me, that's what you do

232
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:32,420
I tried to follow, but you were gone

233
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:39,420
Now I'm waiting, sitting home alone

234
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:47,420
Keep thinking about your smile and eyes

235
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:54,420
Can't believe your words were lies

236
00:33:54,420 --> 00:34:02,420
You made me happy, so very glad

237
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:10,420
I can't forget those times we had

238
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:17,420
There must be something in my brain

239
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:24,420
There must be something in my veins

240
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:33,420
There must be something in my brain

241
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:39,420
That keeps my memories stuck on you

242
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:54,420
I saw you go, I didn't know

243
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:02,420
But you'd be there in the week or so

244
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:10,420
It's so hard to realize in that

245
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:17,420
I wasn't really aware you're right

246
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:25,420
I dream about you, most every night

247
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:33,420
I dream you're there, everything's alright

248
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:40,420
I keep hoping, my dreams will come true

249
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:47,420
But I'll wake up, right next to you

250
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:55,420
There must be something in my brain

251
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:02,420
There must be something in my veins

252
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:09,420
There must be some crime over

253
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:19,420
That keeps my memories stuck on you

254
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:55,420
I keep thinking about your smile and eyes

255
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:03,420
Can't believe your words were lies

256
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:11,420
You made me happy, so very glad

257
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:19,420
I can't forget those times we had

258
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:25,420
There must be something in my brain

259
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:34,420
There must be something in my veins

260
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:40,420
There must be some crime over

261
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:48,420
That keeps my memories stuck on you

262
00:37:48,420 --> 00:38:03,420
That keeps my memories stuck on you

263
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:14,420
Alright now, so we've done memory and the mind body problem

264
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,420
The unconscious, and now returning to fear

265
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,420
We'll do a couple songs about that

266
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:46,420
We'll play a couple more songs

267
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:58,420
We'll play a couple more songs

268
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:06,420
We'll play a couple more songs

269
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:20,420
When the night is dark

270
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:25,420
When the night is dark

271
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,420
I lose my fear

272
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,420
When the night is dark

273
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:37,420
Never shed a tear, then the daylight comes

274
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:45,420
It scares me away, the daylight comes

275
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,420
And I have to fake

276
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,420
When the night is dark

277
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,420
Night is dark

278
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,420
I feel so free

279
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:01,420
When the night is dark

280
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:07,420
I feel the peace, then the daylight comes

281
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:15,420
It scares me away, the daylight comes

282
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,420
It scares me away, the daylight comes

283
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:32,420
It scares me away

284
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:55,420
Night is dark

285
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:09,420
When the night is dark

286
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:14,420
I come alive

287
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,420
When the night is dark

288
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,420
I begin to thrive

289
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:26,420
When the daylight comes

290
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,420
It scares me away, the daylight comes

291
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,420
The daylight comes

292
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,420
When the night comes

293
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:42,420
When the daylight comes

294
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,420
It scares me away

295
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,420
When the daylight comes

296
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,420
When the night is dark

297
00:41:53,420 --> 00:42:03,420
I begin to thrive

298
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:08,420
We're going to close things out here with a song

299
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,420
That ends where we started, it's called the mind body problem

300
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,420
And we're going to just solve that problem right here now

301
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:23,420
Alright, ready for a little blues

302
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:56,420
I've got a mind body problem

303
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:01,420
I don't know what to do

304
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,420
I've got a problem

305
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:09,420
I don't know what to do

306
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:14,420
My body won't you sew

307
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,420
My mind says no

308
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:22,420
You said you'd always love me

309
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,420
To me it'd be true

310
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,420
You said you'd love me

311
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,420
To me it'd be true

312
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,420
Well now you're gone

313
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,420
I'm sad and blue

314
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:48,420
Well now you're back

315
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,420
You want me again

316
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,420
Now you're back

317
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,420
You want me again

318
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,420
If I relent

319
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:08,420
I lose in the end

320
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,420
I've got a mind body problem

321
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,420
I don't know what to do

322
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:21,420
I've got a problem

323
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,420
I don't know what to do

324
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,420
My body won't you sew

325
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,420
My mind says no

326
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:44,420
I don't know what to do

327
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:51,420
I don't know what to do

328
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:58,420
I don't know what to do

329
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,420
I even tried religion

330
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,420
Get over you

331
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,420
I even tried religion

332
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:14,420
To get over you

333
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,420
My body's not you sew

334
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,420
Oh, oh, oh

335
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,420
I've got a mind

336
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,420
I've got a mind

337
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,420
I can't get over

338
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,420
I can't get over

339
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,420
I can't get over

340
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,420
Oh, oh, oh, oh

341
00:45:41,420 --> 00:46:00,420
I'm going insane

342
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:17,420
I've got a mind body problem

343
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,420
I don't know what to do

344
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,420
I've got a problem

345
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,420
I don't know what to do

346
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,420
My body won't you sew

347
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:39,420
My mind says no

348
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:44,420
I'm going insane

349
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:14,420
I'm going insane
