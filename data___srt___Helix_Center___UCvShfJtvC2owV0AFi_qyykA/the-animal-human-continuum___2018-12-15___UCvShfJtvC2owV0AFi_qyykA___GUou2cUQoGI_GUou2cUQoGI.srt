1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
In a kind of fertilizing way and today we have a wonderful group from very different

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,840
backgrounds including two of my colleagues from the Helix Executive Committee.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,480
We are the group that brainstorm these programs and then try to organize them as best we can.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:30,120
The events today will be live streamed so both in terms of knowing that sometimes a camera

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,200
will be on you and when you ask questions just remember this will be going out on YouTube

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,680
and will be there into infinity.

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:47,320
So it's just good to remember what you want to project into the world.

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,800
And just before I mention and give the backgrounds of the participants I want to mention the

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:01,680
two upcoming programs, the next two at least of the many that we're organizing.

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,160
One is on January 19 on mathematical models and the mind and then on February 9 we will

11
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:16,760
be having around table on status and what that means in society and in human relationships

12
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,640
and animal and tribal systems.

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,160
So two very interesting other events coming.

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,040
Today we have an author, a filmmaker.

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:38,800
We have a scientist and a professor of ethics, human and animal ethics and we have two of

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,560
the members as I mentioned of the executive committee, William Grassi who is a historian

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:52,560
of religion and a scholar and author and Gerald Hurwitz who is a psychiatrist and a professor

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,840
of psychiatry at Columbia.

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,320
And they're more familiar.

20
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm not going to read a great deal about their backgrounds.

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,480
They're all online.

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:11,640
And then Josh Aronson as I said is a filmmaker and he's currently after a very distinguished

23
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,720
career of many different subjects and topics.

24
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:26,000
Today in his current time he is making a film about the use of animals, specifically dogs

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,960
in the treatment of veterans with PTSD.

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,760
Does it have a title yet?

27
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,280
To be of service.

28
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
To be of service.

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,080
As in service dogs.

30
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
About service dogs.

31
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Wonderful.

32
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,520
And as I say he's done films in the past, some of which have been Oscar nominated.

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:53,000
Such as the sound in the fury about children who were capable of getting implants that

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,240
would allow them to hear when their parents were deaf.

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:03,920
He's done one called Orchestra of Exiles which was about the formation of the Palestine

36
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:11,280
Symphony and which then became the Israeli Philharmonic from musicians that were taken

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,200
from the orchestras during the Holocaust in Europe.

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,840
And a whole variety of different topics which I won't go into now but you can raise what

39
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,880
you would like to include.

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:35,160
And Elizabeth Hess is an author and she writes about animals.

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,560
She's the author of two books on animals.

42
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:45,240
The first lost and found dog cats and everyday heroes is a hardcore braised book.

43
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:51,040
And the second Nim Chimsky, the chimp who would be human, was published by Bantam in

44
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,960
2008.

45
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,320
And that book was the basis for Project Nim, a documentary film by James Mash and right

46
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,720
now she's working on two book projects.

47
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,200
One on the American Pitbull Terrier, the rise of blood sports in the USA and the racial

48
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,680
construction of bias against the dogs.

49
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,400
And the second is a book about the first primate research laboratory in New York, Lem Sip, the

50
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,720
laboratory for experimental medicine and surgery and primates associated with NYU.

51
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,640
And she will tell you more of what she does.

52
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,680
She's also the vice chair of the Animal Legal Defense Fund and a member of the advisory

53
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,800
board of Out of the Pits, the first pitbull rescue in the country.

54
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,640
She lives with two pitbulls saved from a dog fighting ring in Alabama.

55
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,800
James Sirpell is the marine, more endowed chair of animal ethics and welfare at the

56
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,160
School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

57
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:02,000
He has a bachelor's degree in zoology from University College London and a PhD in animal

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,720
behavior from the University of Liverpool.

59
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,000
He focuses on the behavior and welfare of dogs and cats, the development of human attitudes

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,560
to animals and the history and impact of human-animal relationships.

61
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,760
He's published more than 180 articles and books.

62
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,320
He's the author, editor, co-editor of several including animals in human society, chaming

63
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,560
perspectives in the company of animals, companion animals and us.

64
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,840
And he's the creator of a widely used canine behavioral assessment and research questionnaire.

65
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,400
So you can hear all of the depth and expertise and the humanity of the group that is now

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,160
going to begin their formal, informal discussion.

67
00:05:50,160 --> 00:06:00,240
Well, I thought downstairs it would be fun to start off by introducing a childhood pet.

68
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,360
So I got a puppy from my bus driver in fourth grade and called it Buzzball.

69
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,680
Buzzball was a border collie and this is in suburban Wilmington, Delaware.

70
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,880
In the 70s, the dogs were never on leashes.

71
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,840
They just wandered around the neighborhood.

72
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,160
And Buzzball was never, never lived inside.

73
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,920
She was mostly covered with ticks.

74
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,760
But she would chase cars and we would clock her at like 40 miles an hour fighting at the

75
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,560
heels of the car up and down the neighborhood.

76
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,760
She was a remarkable dog and she was very, very loyal to me and she followed me everywhere

77
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,400
on my walks and waited for me when I visited with friends.

78
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,440
And there was that line from, it was the Garrison Killer or whatever, hoping to live

79
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,360
up to my dog's expectations of me.

80
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:02,000
But I've had many intimate animal relationships since then, including working with slaughter.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,240
So we can talk more about that, but I have a lot of philosophical indigestion when it

82
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,720
comes to talking about the animal, human, continuum, the real tough thing.

83
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Anyway, that's me.

84
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
I'm William Grassy.

85
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm Josh Aronson and I love the theme of childhood pets.

86
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,760
I have a different relationship though and it's interesting because the arc from my childhood

87
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,800
relationship with animals and the relationship I have today having spent the last 18 months

88
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,240
with veterans who have service dogs, it's quite an arc because I had traumatic experiences

89
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,040
with pets because of my mother who was not an animal person at all, but somehow we could

90
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,200
have pets.

91
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,640
I had pets.

92
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,680
The first one was a Springer Spaniel, the first one I remember that was powerful for

93
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,040
me.

94
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,800
And it was very much my dog.

95
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,800
His name was Julius and we had a lot of Springer's and all of them named Caesars, different

96
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Caesars.

97
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,360
He was the first of them, Julius Caesar.

98
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,920
And when I went off to college, came to New York to go to college and I said goodbye to

99
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,320
my dog, thinking I'd come back, and I came home for the first semester and he wasn't

100
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
there.

101
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,520
My mother had him put sleep because he had some illness and didn't want to spend the

102
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,360
money to send the vet or operate on him, whatever was necessary.

103
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,960
Same thing happened to Fuzzball.

104
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Same thing.

105
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Yeah.

106
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
College.

107
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,680
Well, I was stunned that I wasn't even notified, that my mother never, it never occurred to

108
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,400
me that there was a connection that might have been deeper than just some casual connection.

109
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,000
But in fact, it was a very deep connection.

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,240
Because like Fuzzball, I used to just go around with that dog on my bicycle and just,

111
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,680
we were, he was my pal.

112
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,840
And he was exterminated without my even knowledge of it.

113
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,360
And she continued that kind of relationship with my pets very dramatically and I really

114
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
just locked it out.

115
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
I did.

116
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:56,160
And now I've been with many, many veterans who say that their dog has saved their life.

117
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,560
The fact of having a dog in their life who's a highly trained service dog, the bond has

118
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,240
saved their life.

119
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,560
And so it sort of brought me back to its deep connection to these animals and I'm talking

120
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,720
more about that as we get on with our conversation.

121
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Yes.

122
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,600
I try to get very difficult actually to pin down one childhood pet because I always feel

123
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,160
in my childhood as something like the sort of Gerald Darrow, my family and other animals

124
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,160
kind of situation where there was a sort of endless dream of animals went through my

125
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,320
household and I was usually the instigator.

126
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:36,520
And my parents were remarkably tolerant of the snakes, the lizards, the rats, the mice,

127
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,200
you name it, I had them.

128
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,640
And I was profoundly attached to them so much so that I think when I got to about the age

129
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,440
of 12, my parents decided there must be something wrong with me.

130
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,880
It took me to an actual psychiatrist in from Harley Street in London.

131
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,520
And he sat me down and he did, I forget what the test is called, where you draw a squiggle

132
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,280
of his paper and your arm is to turn it into something more kind of comprehensive.

133
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:09,360
And I saw this squiggle and instantly saw a gorilla in the shape.

134
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,080
So I completed the design of the gorilla and he said, perhaps that's how you see me and

135
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,400
I looked at it but he was a very fragile looking man.

136
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,560
I didn't say anything.

137
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,920
So yes, I've constantly been surrounded by animals, I'm still surrounded by animals.

138
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,560
I can't imagine that somehow without them be very difficult.

139
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:41,920
Yes, my first pets were two turtles, got them at the circus and my mother promptly named

140
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:49,760
them gin and tonic and they lived for a month and they were flushed down the toilet at

141
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,280
the end of their lives, something that was common.

142
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,360
We threw the lime in.

143
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,200
And after that, I had the same experience.

144
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:11,520
Our first dog that the family had was a little snouser named Churchill and my mother bought

145
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,440
at a gimbal's department store and I adored the dog, it was my dog, I walked the dog and

146
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,840
I went away to camp one summer and I came back and the dog was gone.

147
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,040
And I said, you know, where's Churchill?

148
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,880
And they said, gone, we got rid of him, you went away?

149
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,880
That was it.

150
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,080
So I think this was a fairly common experience.

151
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,720
Very interesting.

152
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Sherry?

153
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:46,560
Oh, so I had one wonderful relationship with my dog growing up, Dusty Dog, who lived to

154
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,840
the ripe age, I think of 17 or 18, so it was my entire childhood.

155
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,440
And he was a mutt, it looked like a wheat and terrier but was very lively and extremely

156
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
quick-witted.

157
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:07,720
I had to say that I really did experience him as being a person, you know, because of his

158
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,320
intelligence and his engagement with everyone, with everyone, not just with me.

159
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,560
He was very lively.

160
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:20,440
But one of the funny little stories about how clever he was was that we lived in this row

161
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,360
home neighborhood in Philadelphia and there was a dog and he, a female dog and he, across

162
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,960
the street and I think there were, because as Bill said earlier, a lot of dogs were off

163
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
leash in those days.

164
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,200
They were collection about seven or eight dogs outside.

165
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,440
The house, like with his vigil.

166
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,760
And Dusty went out to join him, but I think at some point realized that if he went around

167
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,320
the back, went around the block and came around the back, he didn't have any competition.

168
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,720
So whether or not that's what his thinking was, I don't know, or he just happened to

169
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,880
come down that block.

170
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,240
But we were wondering where is he, because all the other male dogs were out in front.

171
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,480
And so we said, wait a minute, maybe he's elsewhere.

172
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,520
And so he had camped out behind, so he had less competition there.

173
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,320
Really incredible how much I think many of us when we engage with animals can see them

174
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
as persons.

175
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,280
There's something, there's a quality of personhood that some of them have.

176
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,760
I'm not sure they all do, but I know that Dusty Dog did.

177
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:29,600
And if we pay attention, my dog first year came in heat, was had by every dog in the

178
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,640
neighborhood and had a litter of 12 puppies.

179
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:43,560
And my mother, who's a farm girl from Manitoba in the Depression, she, we looked sort of

180
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:50,240
the 12 puppies, took seven of them, put them right in a bucket of water and triumphed.

181
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
And that was a lesson.

182
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,720
I said, Mom, I'm sure you didn't drown me.

183
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,160
But that's the kind of attitude, a farm attitude.

184
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,480
And I admire that.

185
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,160
We have 900 million dogs in the world, almost a billion cattle.

186
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,080
We have these trucks, we start talking about food animals.

187
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:19,840
And I read it statistic recently that 95% of the biomass, the mammalian biomass, is

188
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,160
humans and are domesticated animals at this point.

189
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:30,120
So 10 to 5% of the remaining biomass of mammals are wild animals.

190
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,960
They must have missed the rats in New York City, I think, in that count.

191
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:42,040
But anyway, we have grown so much, it's a big business.

192
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
What did you say?

193
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
It's 80?

194
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
85 million.

195
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
85 million in the United States.

196
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:55,320
And so these relationships with our animals, the ones we love and the ones we eat, are

197
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,840
hugely complicated on so many different levels.

198
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,160
But you're involved in training, you're part of the business.

199
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:09,400
Because I'm extremely honest, since I'm trying to train veterinarians into the article.

200
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Which, you know, it sounds as though you wouldn't need to.

201
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,880
But actually, I think a lot of veterinarians have a lot of difficulty with this.

202
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,200
Because on the one side, they're required to represent their clients, who are people

203
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,960
with who have interests in animals, which may or may not be beneficial relationships

204
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,360
they have with their animals.

205
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,440
And on the other side, they're supposed to be representing the welfare and the health

206
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
of the animal.

207
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,000
And frequently, those come in conflict.

208
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,800
And it's a big problem for a lot of these young people, they're very conflicted.

209
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
They don't know.

210
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Or they have their own love affairs with animals.

211
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,600
They have their own love affairs with animals.

212
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,280
And they face to the client who walks into their practice and says, I want you to put

213
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,160
my dog down.

214
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,080
And you know, the vet says, why?

215
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,520
Well, I don't want it anymore.

216
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,980
And curiously, my daughter who's of that says that the holiday season is a particularly

217
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,560
big time for euthanizing animals.

218
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,320
Yeah, it's true because people have given it.

219
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,520
It's also great to go to a shelter to adopt an animal because within a month after Christmas,

220
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:22,400
the shelters are full of extraordinary purebred, mixed breed, every kind of dog and cat that

221
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,040
you can imagine from all that impulse purchasing.

222
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Yeah.

223
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,560
Well, it's actually, these are often animals that have been around for a long time for

224
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
some reasons.

225
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
Not just impulse.

226
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,560
No, they do.

227
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
It's both.

228
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:43,160
They give away the old one to get the new one or they buy the new puppy at the pet store

229
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,920
and take it home and it proceeds to eat through their apartment and they don't want it anymore.

230
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Yeah.

231
00:16:51,920 --> 00:17:00,280
Well, it's amazing to me just hearing our stories about pets, how dramatic some of these stories

232
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
are.

233
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
I mean, like intensely dramatic.

234
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:08,000
Not too many other things that many of us experience, I guess, in our sort of everyday

235
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,400
lives that are like these are really dramatic and intense stories about loss and killing,

236
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
right?

237
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Yeah.

238
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:24,040
Intentional killing and treating these beings as commodities, I guess, of some sort.

239
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Yeah.

240
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,640
Well, let's get it on the table.

241
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
I eat meat.

242
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,440
Anybody else here eat meat around the table?

243
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,240
So right here, I mean, you know, I've had the opportunity to see what slaughterhouses

244
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,400
look like from start to finish as a young man.

245
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,160
That's pretty scary.

246
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,960
The smell and the noise and, you know, stays with you for a long time.

247
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,240
What kind of slaughterhouse were you in?

248
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,800
That was beef in Belgrade.

249
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,600
That's a long story.

250
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,400
That's pre-temple Grandin.

251
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Yes.

252
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
So it was really sweet.

253
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Yeah, it was a small scale slaughterhouse.

254
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Yeah.

255
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,640
And it's not that much better with Temple Grandin either.

256
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Really?

257
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Really?

258
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
And it's more about...

259
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,720
The film makes it look like it's a big improvement.

260
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
It's more about it.

261
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
I think her stuff is more about how to handle...

262
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,440
No, the arrow more is documentary.

263
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,200
How to handle the cattle.

264
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,960
You know, the vets and the caretakers need to handle the cattle.

265
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Yeah.

266
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,040
But on that too.

267
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,360
So, you know, and then hand-milled cows in a summer camp in Vermont, for instance, stuff

268
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,200
like that.

269
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,680
So I always approach things from an evolutionary point of view.

270
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,480
And so in the evolution of humans, meeting is incredibly important in the growth of our

271
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,800
brain and the way that we live.

272
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,320
And apparently our ancestors, whenever they arrived, they hunted all the large mammals

273
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,880
to extinction in North America, South America, Australia.

274
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,920
So, it's a really interesting question.

275
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,920
And you know, how do we deal with that ethically?

276
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
You're the...

277
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
You're the ethicist.

278
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
You eat meat.

279
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
How do you deal with your indigestion?

280
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Well, exactly.

281
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,920
I mean, you talk about philosophical indigestion.

282
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,600
It's an indigestible topic.

283
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:20,640
This whole issue of how you deal with these moral conflicts in relation to animals.

284
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,000
So... and it's becoming more intense now, especially with the environmental concerns

285
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,760
of CO2 and beef production specifically.

286
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,960
That's the no brainer at this point.

287
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,640
This is becoming a huge issue and will continue to become a huge issue of going forwards.

288
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,200
And you know, people now say, you know, if you eat beef, you're essentially destroying

289
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
the planet.

290
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,480
You shouldn't be doing it.

291
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,200
And I think that's...

292
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,560
You know, it's adding an additional layer on the ethical concerns about the welfare of

293
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
the animals.

294
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,640
It's adding this whole component of what are we doing to the planet.

295
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,640
It's a very, very intense situation.

296
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
And we're in a state of flux.

297
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,680
That's the other interesting thing is that we've been...

298
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,760
We're coming from a time when people really didn't think about these issues very much.

299
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,240
And in a very short space of time, in a few decades, really, it's become a central topic

300
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
of conversation.

301
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,360
Everybody is thinking about it and agonizing about it at some level.

302
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,440
And it's...

303
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,920
You know, these are interesting times we live in.

304
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,000
It's interesting to see how it all pans out.

305
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's the...

306
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,200
If the scientists figure out how to culture flesh, animal flesh, without the feathers

307
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,160
and the squawking and the legs, would that be something that you would eat?

308
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Oh, sure.

309
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
I mean, you know...

310
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
You'd welcome the...

311
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,320
I eat all kinds of things, but I don't eat things where I know the animal has suffered

312
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,400
to get on my plate.

313
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,640
So I happen to live in the Hudson Valley.

314
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,920
So I eat fresh eggs from my friend's farm.

315
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,880
And I do eat, you know, sort of meat, you know, on that level.

316
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,240
But there's no question that vegan food is coming and it's going to taste good.

317
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,640
It's going to taste just like meat because that's what vegans want.

318
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,520
You know, meat eaters think that's a contradiction.

319
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:26,480
But already one of the biggest vegan burger meat producers has joined forces with Tyson

320
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,800
Foods, which is pretty interesting because Tyson is one of the biggest exploiters of

321
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,960
chickens, as I don't know if you've been in a chicken slaughterhouse.

322
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,400
I've done that too.

323
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,560
But they say if you go visit all those slaughterhouses, you can't still eat meat, but you're

324
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
far.

325
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,320
But it's certain kinds I bet.

326
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,160
I bet you want to know where the piece of meat on your plate came from.

327
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,120
I never made a living in slaughterhouses.

328
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,800
I mean, I visited them and at camp I was in charge of the...

329
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Why did you visit?

330
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,760
It was a long story.

331
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,960
Probably a good one.

332
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,720
And I lived on a horse and cattle farm.

333
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,000
So I know what's...

334
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,120
And I've worked on dairy farms for short periods.

335
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
So I know what's involved.

336
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,360
I know what it means.

337
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,200
And for me, it turns out that I also spent two weeks at Auschwitz in 1983 teaching young

338
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,640
Germans about the Holocaust.

339
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:30,000
And the images of the slaughterhouse and the Holocaust, it's the same motif.

340
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,920
And so at some level, if we can do this, if we can treat other humans like animals,

341
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,640
is it moral to treat animals like animals?

342
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Yeah.

343
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,400
And at one level, in which I get moral indigestion, philosophical indigestion.

344
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,560
Well, on the other hand, I don't think utilitarian ethics works.

345
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,760
So the greatest good for the greatest...

346
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Right.

347
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
The Peter Singer.

348
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,960
And I don't think the hierarchy of consciousness works.

349
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:06,480
I think pigs that I've known, we had a pig at the farm in Pennsylvania where the kids grew

350
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,400
up and certainly a lot smarter than the dogs, if we want to talk about animal consciousness.

351
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,920
Pigs are very smart animals.

352
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,880
They're just messy pets.

353
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
They're just messy pets.

354
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
You need a...

355
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
I don't recommend it for...

356
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,200
Well, I did see a woman with a small pot belly pig once in New York City.

357
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:31,200
There's a bunch of pigs that are therapy animals, actually, in New York City, working.

358
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:39,880
And I went to visit AIDS hospice facility in New Jersey with a therapy pot belly pig.

359
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,800
And it was one of the greatest experiences of my life because when you're lying there

360
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,200
feeling horrible and a pig walks into your room, I mean, what can you do but laugh and

361
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
get up and say hello to the pig?

362
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:59,960
And this pig brought so much laughter and joy and hilarity to this incredibly depressing

363
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:09,080
place that the pig was a celebrity and welcome guest as often as this pig's handler could

364
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
get there.

365
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:17,760
And the pig was a registered Delta Society, as it's called Pet Partners Now, therapy animal.

366
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,120
Well, what is a therapy pig?

367
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
How are they trained?

368
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,560
What is it that they do differently from a normal pig?

369
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,160
Well, first of all, they're pot bellies, so they're small.

370
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
They're not hogs.

371
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,680
You're not getting a 400 pound pig out of your truck.

372
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:38,480
But they're, you know, as you know, he just said pigs are smarter than dogs, so they need

373
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,520
to be housebroken.

374
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:46,880
They need to be socialized around humans, which is they understand a lot of language

375
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,840
the same way I'm sure all of us talk to our dogs and they don't speak English, but they

376
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,640
understand what we're talking about.

377
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,420
My question was, is there anything different between just a regular garden variety pot

378
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,640
billied pig with all these qualities and a therapy pig?

379
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,680
Yeah, not all animals are suitable to therapy work.

380
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,400
And everybody gets a dog and wants their dog to be a therapy dog now.

381
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,680
And not all animal and to have a therapy dog or a therapy pig, the handler has is doing

382
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,520
the therapy, essentially, not just the pig.

383
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,160
And it's a team.

384
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,600
And you're trained in the pet partners program.

385
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,000
To be that team in how to relate to people.

386
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,280
But the key to it is having an extremely well socialized animal.

387
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,920
And you can really socialize pigs.

388
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,960
I mean, I also went to a nursing home with a donkey.

389
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,800
And it was also a great experience.

390
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,800
The donkey wasn't so well housebroken, but the donkey walked into this nursing home like

391
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,000
he had been visiting his relatives there for years.

392
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,120
And he walked down the hall and he walked into each room, said hello, stood there for a

393
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,480
few minutes, walked out, walked into the next room.

394
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,680
And you know, there was one, you know, this was an amazing experience.

395
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,680
We walked into this room and this woman was lying asleep in bed.

396
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:21,720
And the donkey walked over to her bed and stuck his head over the rail and snorted loudly.

397
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,640
And I thought, oh my God, this woman's going to have a heart attack.

398
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,840
And instead she sat up in bed, threw her arms around the donkey and gave him the biggest

399
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,640
kiss I've ever seen.

400
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,080
And I said, you know, you seem to know donkeys.

401
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,200
And she said, yes, my husband was a veterinarian.

402
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,480
We had, I was around many farm animals.

403
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,040
And this has been my best day here by meeting this donkey.

404
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:51,120
I mean, there are all kinds of animals being used in interesting situations now.

405
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:58,200
And I think the dogs are, you know, obviously they're the most common therapy animals.

406
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,360
And dogs are so trainable and so willing to be our slaves in a sense.

407
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,760
And affection slaves.

408
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,960
Our affection slaves.

409
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,720
And we ask them to be that often.

410
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
But I think.

411
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,920
And they enjoy it.

412
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Some of them do.

413
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Most of the most part, they enjoy it.

414
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
I think they do.

415
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:21,080
I think, you know, I think dogs can be overwhelmed by people too.

416
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,480
But you know, there are more challenging kinds of animals that are used in different kinds

417
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,120
of therapy sessions, which are interesting.

418
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,160
I mean, there's.

419
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,720
There's horses are often used chickens.

420
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Yeah.

421
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Parents are used.

422
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Birds.

423
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Parents.

424
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Yeah.

425
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Parents.

426
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,760
Chickens, somebody who has a flock of chickens who has them in a school situation said that

427
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:53,440
the chickens were really good because it's very hard to get to know a chicken.

428
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,720
So therefore, if you're an adolescent that has, for instance, a lot of trouble getting

429
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,920
to know people having to work out a relationship with a chicken is quite demanding.

430
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,960
And she insists that everyone get to the point where that chicken will get on their

431
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,640
lap comfortably and relax with them.

432
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,280
And it takes some time and the kids, of course, love the chickens.

433
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,600
It never gave the chickens a chance.

434
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,440
So it's the only animal.

435
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
You still can.

436
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,240
The only animal I didn't feel bad about killing.

437
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:31,920
So Josh, in terms of the animals that the dogs that are used with the veterans, what

438
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,560
are their specific qualities?

439
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,080
I know some of them make the grade and some of them don't.

440
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,240
Well, the qualities of the dogs that are selected to be finally allowed to be service

441
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,800
dogs and are trained through completion have specific qualities.

442
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,760
They're very good with children.

443
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,880
If some dogs, no matter how much you train them, are not responsive to children or even

444
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,000
are frightened of children, those are immediately disqualified.

445
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,880
If a dog has problems in busy areas or noisy areas, they're immediately disqualified.

446
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,880
If a dog won't get into a confined space under a table and stay there comfortably for a length

447
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,640
of time, like a dinner, they're disqualified because apparently they can't train that out

448
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,120
of them.

449
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,240
So about 10% of the dogs they start with in service training are rejected.

450
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,720
And those are great pets to adopt because they've been trained so much more than comfort

451
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,200
animals that they're quite phenomenal.

452
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:34,120
And you might even object to it because they're so responsive that they lose their dogness

453
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,200
and because they're so connected.

454
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,680
I was interested to hear you describe what the comfort animals are because it's a big

455
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,120
controversy in the service dog world for two reasons.

456
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,880
One, because people are getting fake service dog certification.

457
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,000
And the reason they do that is they want to be able to travel with their dogs on airplanes.

458
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,480
And of course, if you have a dog that shouldn't be on an airplane and there have been accidents

459
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
where dogs-

460
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Which is most dogs.

461
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Right.

462
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
But well-trained service dogs-

463
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Yeah.

464
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
They're fine.

465
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,560
They're fine on an airplane and they'll be under a seat.

466
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,440
Even a Labrador Retriever will squeeze under the chair in front of you for two hours and

467
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,440
won't budge.

468
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
It's remarkable to see.

469
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,440
Yeah.

470
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
And they come right out.

471
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
So comfort dogs won't do that.

472
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,320
And they get dogs and they try and do this with them.

473
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,760
But what's important about the service, the distinction between the comfort dog and the

474
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,160
service dog is all the things you said that a comfort dog has service dogs have, but they

475
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,560
have something else that's profound, which is the ability to bond so completely one-on-one

476
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,000
with their companion.

477
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,480
So it's that bond that works in a very deep way to help them unwind the symptoms of PTSD.

478
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,240
It's just an absolute unconditional love that those dogs feel one-on-one.

479
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,080
Now any dog can feel that, but in a service dog when you combine it with so many other

480
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,680
things, it's a profound therapeutic tool.

481
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
It's very powerful.

482
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,800
It's also used in prisons very effectively.

483
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:07,040
So I'm interested in that we're so inhumane to the animals, but our pets humanize us.

484
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,840
So what do you think's going on?

485
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,080
Why is this relationship with a dog or a cat or a pig or whatever?

486
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,320
What is it that we get from them that we don't get from other humans?

487
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:28,240
Well I think in terms of service dogs with people, it might not just be veterans.

488
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,680
It can be, you know, service dogs can be blind people obviously, it can be autistic children

489
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,840
often get them.

490
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,080
It's just complete absolute devotion and what they call over and over again you hear of

491
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,800
unconditional love.

492
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,040
And how powerful the unconditional love is in the veteran community is because a lot

493
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,200
of veterans have moral injury as they call it today and they have a lot of guilt and

494
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,840
shame which are two powerful things because they've both, they've been commanded to as

495
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,720
19 year olds to do things that are morally reprehensible or they've seen things that

496
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,280
are so awful that they're embarrassed and they're shamed and they're guilty or because

497
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,320
their mates have died and what runs through their mind is what they could have done to

498
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,800
save them for the next 30 years.

499
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,160
So they are so filled with shame that they can't release it and they end up off in a

500
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,640
shut-ins and all over the country there's hundreds of thousands of veterans who are shut-ins

501
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,320
and they get a dog, a service dog and the dog has to go out.

502
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,640
So the first step is he has to take responsibility for the dog and take the dog out and he learns

503
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,040
very quickly that no matter what he does even if he's weeping, even if he's crying, even

504
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:42,120
if he's having a nightmare, if he's just sullen, the dog will love him and the dog will lick

505
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,760
him and wake him up from nightmares and be his companion and so gradually he lets go

506
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,720
and starts to love the dog.

507
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,920
It seems to be pretty consistent and it's the first time he's felt anything in a long

508
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
time.

509
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:01,080
He or she because a lot of women vets have PTSD as well and that's a powerful mechanism

510
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,280
and I once asked someone I was interviewing in the film who was a writer who knew a lot

511
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
about dogs.

512
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:12,040
I said well why isn't the unconditional love of a spouse equally good for that?

513
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,840
He said oh you know the old jib, you put your wife and your dog in a trunk of a car and

514
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,840
close the trunk, open an hour later, who loves you at the end of an hour?

515
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
They're excited.

516
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,840
They're excited.

517
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
They're excited.

518
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Yeah, you again.

519
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,040
And your wife won't speak to you for two weeks, right?

520
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
So it's...

521
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,880
Well maybe more than an hour.

522
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,040
So it's a very good story because that defines what unconditional love is.

523
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,440
One of the things that happens in a lot of psychiatric illnesses and certainly PTSD is

524
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:54,040
among them and I'm not sure if people generally appreciate this very much but it's that caregivers

525
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,840
get rebuffed off and I mean there are efforts to sort of cheer you up or encourage you or

526
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,280
it gets you to do something like get outside or get out of bed.

527
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,800
You're met with a lot of pushback that could be in various forms and we might imagine some

528
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,280
with PTSD could be irritable but there's all sorts of ways people can push back and their

529
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,880
psychiatric illness keeps them from responding to normal social cues and the failure of those

530
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:25,440
social cues often demoralizes the caregivers so the caregivers give up to some degree in

531
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,960
withdrawal and they start to dismiss the sufferer.

532
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,160
So a dog or another animal who's trained in this way just keeps it up.

533
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:40,720
That does not, they're not as readily discouraged they take it if many more iterations and that's

534
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,720
what you're calling unconditional love.

535
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,000
You could mistreat me I still think you're great.

536
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,040
And also they can't talk which I think is very critical.

537
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,800
They can't ask you how you're feeling and they can't criticize the fact that you're

538
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
not getting out of bed.

539
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
You're still in bed?

540
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
You know, you're not going to think that.

541
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:07,720
The animal is it's empathic but it's not verbal and it's very critical.

542
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,440
It's very clear though that the dogs can take on and understand your feelings and they are

543
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,160
very empathic so if you're sad or you're sick or you're in bed and you're not getting

544
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,440
out of bed the dog will come to you and will curl up with you will lick you will encourage

545
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,560
you to and make you feel better because of course when you pet a dog or look into the

546
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,920
eyes of a dog there's an oxytocin release and it feels good so it's a very very powerful

547
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,800
connection that happens with a bonded animal and a human.

548
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,440
My dogs love it when I'm sick in bed all day.

549
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,560
They just love it they just curl up.

550
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,680
But not to take it away from the psychological realm here I think the other big attraction

551
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,080
to dogs I mean there's so many dogs in New York City now it's just mind-boggling and

552
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,520
I think we live in a world where nature is receding certainly the wilderness is receding

553
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:02,840
the waters are rising and I think having this dog in our homes with us is a bit of the wild

554
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,200
literally and you know what I like about my dog is dogs are they're unpredictable you

555
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,080
know I can't really always predict what they're going to do or what's going to happen when

556
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:19,840
a stranger walks into the house or you know they take you out of the human realm and back

557
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:27,200
to you know a wilder moment and bring that into your life and I think that's a lot of

558
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,080
why city people love dogs.

559
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,600
Is it connect the connection?

560
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Yeah.

561
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Yeah.

562
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,040
And what do you ask on the test that you've developed?

563
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Oh.

564
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,040
The canine behavioral assessment and research question.

565
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:49,840
And actually came about because I wanted to collect behavioral information about dogs

566
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,120
and they're very difficult to study because they live in people's houses and you can't

567
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,320
go in there and say do you mind if I sit in your house and observe your dog.

568
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:03,200
And so I was looking at the sort of psychological literature and I found of course the child

569
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,880
psychologist had the same issue and very often they resort to question it so surveys which

570
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,320
they give to parents and give to teachers and so on to ask them about the child's behavior.

571
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,160
So I thought well let's develop something like that for dogs.

572
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,880
So I did that and what do you ask?

573
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,320
Well it's all sorts of questions about how the dog responds to different things in its

574
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:31,280
environment and it tries to persuade the owner to be as unbiased as possible and their evaluation.

575
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,840
So you don't say you know is your dog friendly you'd say how does your dog respond specifically

576
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:42,120
when this happens like a stranger comes to the door or whatever and try and pin them

577
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,440
down to very specific things.

578
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,520
It's a hundred item questionnaire you can go online and complete it for your dog and

579
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,720
it'll churn out a little chart that will tell you where your dog lies in relation to other

580
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,240
dogs in our database.

581
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,040
We have about 50,000 dogs in the database now so it's a good sample.

582
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,480
So along what dimensions like how are they evaluated?

583
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:12,040
Aggression, fearfulness, anxiety, excitability, attachment and attention seeking, separation

584
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,200
related behavior, all the you know pretty much damage.

585
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,600
Are you collecting the eugenics information too about the breeds?

586
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,320
I am collecting breed information we're doing some very interesting research on breed differences

587
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,320
in behavior.

588
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Very interesting.

589
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,680
Of course there are differences but I think dog breeds are a terrible thing.

590
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,680
What do you mean?

591
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
I just think they're really terrible.

592
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,680
Why?

593
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,680
The creative ones you?

594
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:46,000
Just you know there's I think the eugenics is bad for humans it's bad for dogs and the

595
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,440
more you mix things up the better.

596
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Dogs are not humans.

597
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,600
I mean I'm talking about genetics.

598
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
I know.

599
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:57,440
But you know I mean I think it's not a bad thing to think of your dog as a person to

600
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:05,400
treat your dog as a family member but they are animals and one of the things about the

601
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,120
you know I think it's great that the dogs are being used so heavily with vets right

602
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,720
now and for the PTS programs and I can't believe that the end of the year I must have

603
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:20,320
gotten 20 direct mail pieces asking me to give money to programs for PTS dogs for vets.

604
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,040
They're springing up like you know mushrooms after the rain everywhere in every community

605
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,760
and there's a good reason for it.

606
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,480
I think the reason is it's working and it's expensive but I would still ask the question

607
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,240
why aren't we giving our vets health decent health care and now what we're doing is we

608
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,160
have these private organizations throwing dogs at them when the hospitals are overcrowded

609
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,920
they you know vets can't see doctors and and essentially we treat them not well.

610
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,760
So I think we tend to use dogs as a kind of band aid for certain problems and we're

611
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,800
using them for everything now.

612
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,880
We're the kid average dogs, bomb dogs, drug dogs, PTS dogs.

613
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,800
I mean we want dogs to do an incredible amount of work for us that we don't want to do.

614
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Well the dogs.

615
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
I'm not shy I agree with that.

616
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
I don't think I agree with that.

617
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,080
Actually the truth is also dogs like doing those things.

618
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,840
How do you know that?

619
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,400
Well you can see in their behavior in the way they respond.

620
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,280
Maybe dogs like sleeping all day in front of the fireplace too.

621
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
Well don't do.

622
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
No they happen.

623
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,680
I mean we have done studies of for example therapy dogs and whether or not you know

624
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,640
that there's a welfare problem in using dogs for this purpose and actually every single

625
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,440
one of the studies has been done to date suggests that the dogs are enjoying it.

626
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
Like work.

627
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,720
For them it's a much worse experience going to a veterinary hospital than going to visit

628
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,120
people in a human hospital.

629
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:49,360
So that kind of makes sense when you understand the dogs perspective because.

630
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:55,080
From the human perspective not the VA perspective but the human perspective.

631
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,480
The idea of therapy you're absolutely right the VA is letting us down the government is

632
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,360
letting us let us soldiers down in every possible way.

633
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,960
Not universally I mean the VA here in New York City is quite good.

634
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,120
It's very good therapist in Los Angeles it's quite good but those are two out of thousands

635
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:16,520
and many many soldiers that I interviewed just report horrible stories about the VA.

636
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,280
But most of the therapists that I interviewed in most of the soldiers I interviewed found

637
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,440
that the service dogs in conjunction with good therapy and the appropriate meds as a

638
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,640
trio of approaches is a very good approach and of course there's something now called

639
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,080
the mass program that this program is using MDMA working with vets that's been very very

640
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,680
powerful and some of them also have dogs.

641
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,240
So I think there's a lot of modalities of treatment for PTSD that are being utilized

642
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,600
and the dogs are simply part of it.

643
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,280
One of the vets said some people have crutches, some people have walkers, some people use

644
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,440
drugs.

645
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,920
I have a dog.

646
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,320
It's a medical modality that's organic that works very well for me and has brought me

647
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,600
back to life and a lot of people report the same language.

648
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,360
Now that's the human perspective.

649
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,360
It's a good thing.

650
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
I'm not saying it's a bad one.

651
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,560
And you're arguing maybe it's not good for the dogs from my observation.

652
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,480
No for some of the dogs I don't think it is good and there are instances where dogs have

653
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,840
been pulled away from vets.

654
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,360
I don't know if you've come across any of them for your film because the dogs are considered

655
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,360
endangered for the lives.

656
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,800
I just want to point out that there are what 900 million dogs in the world right now and

657
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:30,160
half of them are feral living on our trash in an urban environment or in a round human.

658
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,400
And we're breeding dogs for these programs.

659
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:40,600
And so our dogs in New York City are treated pretty well.

660
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:46,160
One thing that I tell anybody who wants a dog is two are better than one because they're

661
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,320
very social and to leave a dog alone in an apartment is torture for that dog.

662
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,160
And we have a neighbor I keep telling her that the dogs always bark and I say two dogs

663
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,000
are better than one.

664
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
They don't get it.

665
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,120
So that you know just a bit of practical advice.

666
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,760
Dogs hate being left alone.

667
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,840
In fact all species pretty much do.

668
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,040
Now they're especially, I mean cat doesn't mind as much being left alone but better have

669
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,040
two cats right.

670
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,040
Yeah.

671
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,360
Or cat and a dog or whatever.

672
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:21,560
So just for the humanity of our pets just understand a little bit about their psychology.

673
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,640
The truth of the matter is humans are mammals too.

674
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
We have feelings.

675
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,040
We're very social and humans don't like being left alone.

676
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:36,680
And that's why one of the reasons why a dog and the person who's otherwise isolated,

677
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,680
is so healthy.

678
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,920
Not just mentally healthy, physiologically healthy in every way.

679
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,400
So yeah don't leave your poor dog locked up alone in an apartment.

680
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
Not a nice thing to do.

681
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,400
I want to go back to a comment you made earlier Bill which was this I think rather bold claim

682
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,640
that pigs are much smarter than dogs.

683
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,000
I wanted to flesh that out.

684
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,880
No pun intended.

685
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,880
I want to know on what basis.

686
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,880
I'm not challenging.

687
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,320
I think it's a general thing to conversation.

688
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,000
Which is how do we know what it means as a smart one dimension?

689
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,560
Well no the barnyard would know that.

690
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,640
What do they know about that?

691
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,840
They also understand I don't think smartness is one one.

692
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,920
No one makes that right.

693
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,200
There's no IQ test for pigs or dogs.

694
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,200
Right.

695
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,200
Maybe not for humans.

696
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,200
So anyway you can take what you want to.

697
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,200
Discretts.

698
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,800
They are very smart animals.

699
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,800
Right.

700
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,840
And you know again if we put the Peter Singer hierarchy of consciousness model of the ethics

701
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:53,280
of animal eating then squid and octopus and cuddle fish would go right out the door because

702
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,520
they are extraterrestrial intelligence.

703
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,640
I'm interterrestrial intelligence that we barely understand but they're clearly very

704
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,640
smart and sensitive.

705
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,800
But again I don't think that Peter Singer version works.

706
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,280
I don't think utilitarian ethics works.

707
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,400
I think the only thing that can work in our relationship with animals is a sacramental

708
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,080
attitude.

709
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,440
And I say that somebody who's not really speaking is religiously.

710
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,200
I just think that we eat animals.

711
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,680
We sacrifice their lives.

712
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,920
It's called the great Eucharistic law.

713
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,760
Eat and be eaten, all of us will die and the animals will be recycled.

714
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:42,520
And the greatest honor we do to the animals that we kill is to pay attention and be grateful

715
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,840
and a little bit have some indigestion and about it.

716
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,000
So that's how I frame it.

717
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,160
Well not to mention kill them humanely.

718
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,160
So this is where.

719
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,160
And thanks then when you kill them.

720
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,760
So this is again I think we're not the first humans to fall in love with our animals.

721
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,480
I think that's been going on throughout human history and it's reflected in mythology and

722
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,640
a whole bunch of other things.

723
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,920
So and we're not the first generation to treat animals poorly either.

724
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,680
No ever since the domestication of animals they've been treated poorly essentially.

725
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:25,440
I mean they've been rounded up and used for work and excess ones have been killed.

726
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,160
And along the way farmers and herders have fallen in love with those animals.

727
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,160
Yes.

728
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,160
And one of the things that they have to teach veterinarians is how to recognize bestiality.

729
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,160
Right.

730
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
As a problem.

731
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,160
We don't like to talk about it but it's there in our culture.

732
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,560
Well I think vets need to be allowed to love animals and save them.

733
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:56,520
And one of the things about vet school is you take these live animals and you cut them

734
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,680
up and you throw them in the bin or not.

735
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,200
I mean are you Johns Hopkins is that?

736
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,200
No.

737
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,200
Oh you're so handsome.

738
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,200
They don't do that to the section.

739
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:14,960
No but they have a huge school of researching alternatives to using animals in all research

740
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,720
including vet schools.

741
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,320
At Johns Hopkins they do.

742
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:24,880
I mean the vet schools are increasingly trying to avoid doing practice surgeries on live animals.

743
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,840
So that's going out the window.

744
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,040
It may be still present at some vet schools but it's no longer present at mine.

745
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:37,320
But when I first got there it was they were doing that and in fact it was the students

746
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,800
who eventually put a stop to it.

747
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,560
In other words the students said enough we don't need this.

748
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,320
And eventually the faculty were forced to agree.

749
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:53,040
And there was a tradition within the faculty that we couldn't send these students out to

750
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,680
practice veterinary medicine unless they cut up a live animal.

751
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,880
That was where it came from.

752
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:04,920
But now it's recognized that they can learn that stuff on the job under the supervision

753
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,920
of a trained veterinarian.

754
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,200
They don't have to do it in vet school.

755
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,560
And we don't use chimpanzees for car crash studies anymore either.

756
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:20,320
For instance or you know certain kinds of toxicology studies because we recognize snow

757
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,560
because there's a law that says we can't.

758
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:28,480
And we can give some surgery practice by taking them out to animal shelters where they help

759
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,640
span newtors unwanted animals prior to being adopted.

760
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,640
Tough stuff.

761
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:40,840
So they're learning the job skills in a humane and respectful way I guess you would

762
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,840
say.

763
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:48,920
Elizabeth I was struck by your new book which is on cultural bias of having pets or animals.

764
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,120
No no no this is a book on the pit bull.

765
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,520
On the pit bull.

766
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,040
Which is inherently a mixed breed and a mutt.

767
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,760
So it's not a purebred dog unless you talk to the Brits and they think it's a Stafford

768
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,720
Terrier and it's a purebred dog.

769
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,720
But I thought I heard that there was a cultural bias.

770
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,120
Yes I think there is.

771
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,120
I mean.

772
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,120
Two pit bulls specifically.

773
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,120
Absolutely.

774
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:15,000
One of the problems with pit bulls I mean they're more ordinances across the country

775
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,400
saying pit bulls can't live in this neighborhood.

776
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,400
They're not inherently violent dogs.

777
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,400
They're not inherently violent dogs.

778
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,080
They're not inherently violent dogs.

779
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:33,000
There's just more of them because they're bred on every corner by drug dealers and whatever.

780
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,720
But they're they you know all these pit bulls that are flooding every shelter across the

781
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,720
country.

782
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,160
People who understand these are the losers.

783
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,240
These are the dogs that the drug dealers and the dog fighters don't want.

784
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:53,000
Because to get one dog worth training to go into the pit for a fight you know you have

785
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,720
to breed hundreds.

786
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,640
Because most of them don't want to fight and you have to get a really gamey you know the

787
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:05,600
kind of dog that's going to end up working for the police as a cadaver dog or a bomb

788
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:10,640
dog or a because they're just so eat the police are using a lot of pit bulls now.

789
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:16,280
Because if you get a really you know hyper gamey dog and you put them to work the dog

790
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,080
excels it's got a lot of energy.

791
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:24,320
You know training them to fight each other is an ordeal cost a lot of time and money

792
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,040
and most of them won't do it.

793
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:32,800
So it's just you know they're a huge problem in this country and when most people and most

794
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:39,240
buildings for instance say no pit bulls here what they often mean is no poor people know

795
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:46,360
people who might be associated with drugs or crime often people of color I mean the word

796
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,760
pit bull kicks off all kinds of racial and economic biases.

797
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,880
The same way the German Shepherd.

798
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,120
German Shepherd used to.

799
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,120
Right.

800
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
Right.

801
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,120
Yes exactly.

802
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,760
Because for me I have a bias but only because of what I've read in the paper.

803
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,280
There are enough pit bull incidents and pit bulls going after someone or tearing someone's

804
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,280
face apart.

805
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,280
And you've read it enough so you think well it must be in their DNA that they're just

806
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,400
aggressive animals.

807
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:21,600
No there's no there's no aggression gene and there's a very well known dog trainer named

808
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:28,080
Ian Dunbar who sort of was the first trainer to deal with quote dangerous dogs and when

809
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:32,160
asked as he always says what is the most dangerous dog you ever met.

810
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:38,040
He tells a story about an older woman who had a shit sue who she was extremely close

811
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:43,440
to and the dog slept here every night and the dog was older around seven or eight years

812
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,040
old and one morning she woke up and the dog she startled the dog and the dog woke up and

813
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,800
bit the nose off her face.

814
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:59,200
And you know that was the most difficult dog that Ian Dunbar ever worked with and that

815
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:07,000
was a 15 pound shit sue and if you look at dog statistic bites at real dog statistic

816
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,800
bites you will see that the pit bulls not the number one binder.

817
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
It's little dogs.

818
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,720
It's the little guys the thing is their mouth are so small.

819
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,720
I still got a cigarette.

820
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,080
They do so much damage but it's the little dogs that bite.

821
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,520
Why is that do you think?

822
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,080
Probably frightened.

823
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,080
What is that?

824
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,080
Probably frightened.

825
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,080
Easily frightened.

826
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,080
Yeah.

827
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,080
Yeah.

828
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,080
It's a soft defense.

829
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,080
Interesting.

830
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:36,200
I thought when I heard the description of book I thought it was about how because I

831
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,680
came across this that culturally in the African American community you find less dogs in

832
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,000
their homes and I asked and in my research and the work I've done in my film across

833
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,320
the country there are very few African Americans that have service dogs several but amongst

834
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:58,040
you know 95% were white or Hispanic and I sort of and I asked around and I finally these

835
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,040
people these African Americans that had dogs sort of worked through them and I heard two

836
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,040
different things.

837
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:09,160
One was African Americans in America don't have dogs because police use dogs and the

838
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,040
dogs in the inner cities are frightening to them because they're trained and aggressive

839
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:19,040
so they're afraid of dogs and the African Americans said no that's not true anymore.

840
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,920
It was in the last generation.

841
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,240
So I thought your book was sort of on that topic because of the description of it somehow

842
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,400
I didn't get what it was but I found it a very interesting subject because we were of

843
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,280
course looking for African Americans and Hispanics to have in our film and it was hard to find

844
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,120
them with service dogs.

845
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,120
Have you found women?

846
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,120
Yes.

847
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,120
We have a lot of women.

848
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,120
Yeah.

849
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,120
A lot of women.

850
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,120
Yeah.

851
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,600
But of course the cause of PTSD in most of the women is rape.

852
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,600
Not that.

853
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,120
The statistic is horrific.

854
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,000
The 90% of women in the military have been sexually harassed if not rape.

855
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,120
90% have been harassed.

856
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:02,480
Well, I'd want to pit bull or German Shepherd by my side in that case.

857
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,480
Yeah.

858
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,480
Yeah.

859
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,480
Where that shitsu.

860
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,480
Where that shitsu right?

861
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,480
Of course I don't know how the shitsu would do against a leave sergeant.

862
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,480
Probably well.

863
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,720
There's a nose.

864
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,720
Yeah.

865
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,720
But pretty high up though.

866
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,440
Are there a different group coming into training to be veterinarians?

867
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,440
Say that.

868
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:26,280
Is there anything changing in the applicants to train as veterinarians?

869
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:32,280
Well there's been a huge change over the last 30 or 40 years from men to women.

870
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:39,600
So now we have the incoming classes of veterinary students in at vet schools are about 80% female

871
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,520
and they used to be 80% male.

872
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,760
So that's been a massive change and that's brought with it.

873
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:53,600
I think many of these changes in attitudes to animals and a resistance to buying into

874
00:54:53,600 --> 00:55:02,080
the old sort of exploitation position and being much more compassionate and concerned

875
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:06,200
about these types of issues.

876
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,040
I mean actually you often hear a lot of the older male vets bemoaning this.

877
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,640
Oh god do you know there.

878
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,800
Feminizing the profession you'll hear them muttering darkly.

879
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,400
But I think it's all for the good actually.

880
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:26,920
Well my oldest daughter is a vet and so I followed her career at Penn.

881
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:32,080
I think they have a hard, I understand that they have a hard time getting vets who want

882
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,680
to do agricultural animals too.

883
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,720
It's all either equine or small animal.

884
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:45,320
And so if you it's more competitive than medical school in terms of getting accepted.

885
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:50,480
It's a growing industry and if you do want to get into vet schools say you want to do

886
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,040
agricultural animals because it's a leg up.

887
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:58,960
There's just all the extension services around our lacking veterinarians.

888
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,960
So hard life now.

889
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,960
It's a very large animal.

890
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,960
It's a very hard life.

891
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,960
It's actually very dangerous.

892
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,960
Dangerous and very hard work.

893
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,920
You get no sleep.

894
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:14,360
But it is unusual training because unlike human medicine you have to study multiple animal

895
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:19,320
species and including reptiles and birds.

896
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,720
It's a very interesting training.

897
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,760
I'm interested in about what are, again always interested in evolutionary things.

898
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:36,200
But I think you know for a long time in the West we thought animals was sort of machines

899
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:42,000
and now we don't seem to acknowledge what's obvious that they have their sentient beings

900
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,440
with emotions and feelings.

901
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:54,920
And I don't know how much they think about the future but we're also starting to recognize

902
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:03,280
ourselves as not a height of rationality but emotions are how humans communicate.

903
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:11,040
And our feelings come prior to our rationality if at all.

904
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:19,200
And so I just think it's you know in the human animal continuum how important is it

905
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:26,200
to see ourselves as animals today and what does that help us in terms of dealing more

906
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,840
effectively with each other and the world around us.

907
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:37,320
I mean I'm just another animal on some level.

908
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,800
Well that seems to have been the sort of history of the ideas.

909
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:46,200
Well we have this idea that we started off with this massive gulf separating humans from

910
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:52,400
animals and it was really a sort of philosophical gulf and that gulf is sort of slowly being

911
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:58,000
narrowed and now we allow some animals to kind of jump across the gap and join us as

912
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,240
family members but not all of them.

913
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,360
But they represent sort of ambassadors as it were.

914
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:11,960
They represent that other group of animals out there and I think that's an ongoing process.

915
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:19,840
But at the same time you know if you look at the discourse on animals historically yes

916
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:25,400
at the level of educated people there was all this talk about how animals were completely

917
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:30,120
different from humans and they didn't have souls or they didn't do mechanisms or whatever

918
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,600
but at the popular or folk level I don't think people ever believed that.

919
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,440
I think they lived with animals and they knew that animals were sentient and had feelings

920
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,080
and would respond in particular ways in the same way a person would.

921
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:48,080
So I think there's always been this not only well that sort of tension between the people

922
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:55,080
who actually knew the animals and the intelligentsia who were kind of pontificating about animals.

923
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:00,360
Well fairy tales are filled with snakes who know and fox who know.

924
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:05,320
And people who turn into animals and animals that turn into people and you know the gulf

925
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:09,080
is obviously very permeable.

926
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:16,400
And children as we've heard some of the major emotional development is you know loving the

927
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,600
stories about animals even not just the animals around you.

928
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,080
People girls with horses.

929
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:31,120
Well it seems what is important about trying to understand as best we can what sort of

930
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:39,480
consciousness or experience animals have to inform how we treat them.

931
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:44,040
I think there's one one of the larger arguments against let's say slaughtering animals is

932
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,920
they are conscious or they have some sentient being.

933
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,720
I'm not saying that's a complete argument but that's something that is brought to bear

934
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,800
what we talk about how we treat animals.

935
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:59,400
And I find it interesting that when you ask when I've asked people to talk about whether

936
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:06,440
you think animals have sentions or not and that across a wide range of animal types.

937
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,720
There are those I think you feel well absolutely there's no data about it how could you see

938
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,120
it otherwise.

939
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:15,480
And there are others who still persist in thinking in this sort of Cartesian way that

940
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:23,600
animals are missing something that humans have that makes them less than.

941
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,840
And earlier Betsy was really interesting because I used the word personhood to describe my

942
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,080
relationship with Dusty.

943
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:35,440
I meant it in a sense because we didn't dress him up or we didn't wear human clothes.

944
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:41,120
We didn't kiss him on the list which I find disgusting but anyway we didn't treat him

945
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,080
like he was a person literally.

946
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:51,720
But I had a sense of I know it's an interesting question when we try to decide whether animals

947
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:56,320
have any degree of consciousness is it possible that we are projecting our own consciousness

948
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,680
onto them.

949
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,240
Right so could that be playing some part because there are those who think in terms

950
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,800
of human consciousness leaving animals aside that we're actually projecting our own sense

951
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,880
of consciousness you know this is sort of a dentist's view of consciousness sort of it's

952
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,240
an illusion that we are putting together a lot of sense data and other thoughts that

953
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:22,400
go from our heads and then we say we have a certain personhood we are imposing that.

954
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,040
I'm not it's not a view I subscribe to but it's out there.

955
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:32,040
So the question I think is also with animals how much of what we view as being the sentience

956
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:36,800
of animals out a projection of ourselves and I'd even extend to my experience of Dusty

957
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:41,400
as a person because in some ways I look back and think of him as being like a human and

958
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,520
I thought well he didn't talk.

959
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:48,800
Why don't I have this persistent feeling that I had that sort of the verbally intimate

960
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,800
relationship with us.

961
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:55,000
Well this is the thing we draw the line between humans and animals at language and what that

962
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,760
means is complicated.

963
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:05,800
And I think that the issue of personhood is to a large extent a legal issue because corporations

964
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:10,560
have personhood and animals are objects in the eyes of the law.

965
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:15,960
And I think you know I don't think that all of us especially those of us sitting around

966
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:21,520
this table or in this room need to be convinced that animals are intelligent that they're

967
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:27,920
sentient beings that they're capable of loving us and vice versa but the law needs to be

968
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:34,320
convinced of that because animals have very few protections and New York state is one

969
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:39,400
of the worst states in the country as far as animal cruelty laws go.

970
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:47,480
And so and I let my dogs kiss me in the face but I probably shouldn't.

971
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:54,800
Actually you're much greater risk of infection with a human bite than you are of a dog bite.

972
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,760
So yeah there you go.

973
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,760
Kiss your dog good night.

974
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,760
Yes absolutely.

975
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,800
I've trained all my family members not to bite any more.

976
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:02,800
But anymore.

977
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,800
Right.

978
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:08,880
People all know about the non-human rights project and Stephen Wise who's trying to go

979
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:14,280
through the courts to get the status of personhood for animals.

980
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:19,320
And in fact last Friday he just argued for an elephant which is in the Bronx Zoo.

981
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:25,680
An elephant ironically named Happy who's been alone in a cage for I don't know how many

982
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,360
years 40 years or something insane.

983
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:33,320
And he's trying to go through the courts to argue that the elephant should have the status

984
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:38,240
of personhood that elephants cannot that it's torture for them to be alone.

985
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,280
What you're saying about the top two dogs or two cats.

986
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,720
More so for elephants.

987
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:50,160
More so for elephants and this this elephant has one acre to move around in which is very

988
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,440
small for an elephant.

989
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:58,000
And it had a companion the companion died companion was never replaced.

990
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:07,480
And the case was argued on Friday there was a writ of habeas corpus in a previous lower

991
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:13,760
court and it went through and the case is now going to be moved to the Bronx.

992
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,720
So I have a problem with invoking human rights language.

993
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:24,640
I have no problem with the welfare of the elephant and we have an obligation to promote

994
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,640
that.

995
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:31,440
Well first off we have to recognize that human rights are a human invention and they don't

996
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,200
exist in nature.

997
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,880
I mean and it's moral progress and I'm in favor of that.

998
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:42,120
But there's a history of human rights and it's a useful fiction just like money is a

999
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,960
useful fiction right.

1000
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:51,240
So and I'm in favor of that discourse but I think when we take it into our domesticated

1001
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:57,840
animals or wild animals or fish I just think it leads to enormous confusion because now

1002
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:01,200
we're taking things that are different and we're treating them the same.

1003
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,640
And so some of the fill this is why I always have indigestion philosophically.

1004
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:13,240
So so and I don't think animals have the same obligations to us that we have towards them.

1005
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,080
So if a bear wants to maul me and eat me or whatever that's that's what bears do.

1006
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,640
Do we have any obligation to that bear?

1007
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:27,160
Yes on another level yes we do and but not to the individual so much as the group.

1008
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:34,240
So I think species extinction is much greater problem than the than the suffering of any

1009
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,720
individual wild animal.

1010
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:43,120
And I think the way we treat wild animals versus domesticated animals like so.

1011
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,120
But if we can't.

1012
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:49,760
We're in sheep get get pink eye and it's well within our possibility to treat the pink eye

1013
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:55,480
in national parks or whatever when they get pink eye they fall off the cliff and die.

1014
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:00,960
And so there's a question should we be intervening in the care of wild animals and and this

1015
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,080
is where you know we got to maybe let natural selection do its thing.

1016
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,480
I don't know.

1017
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:14,400
But that's you know how much are we responsible for habitat for sure.

1018
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,240
But on an individual level I know I have a different problem with that I think.

1019
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,480
So anyway that's one of the big debates in animal evidence.

1020
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,880
Yeah I think the legal scholars are somewhat the legal scholars they are people who are

1021
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,440
making legal motions.

1022
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,960
How animals like happy are trying to think well how do we get an entree to the legal

1023
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,920
world and I guess this is like the most expedient way they've come up with which is to try

1024
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,440
to define them that way and it may or may not be a good idea.

1025
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,240
I kind of agree with what a lot what you said.

1026
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,760
I think I understand the motivation to.

1027
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,680
The courts also recognize that this is a slippery slope you know.

1028
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:56,840
It's great if we give you know personhood to an ape or an elephant what's next and then

1029
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:01,680
you've got the whole animal industries saying whoa you know this has to stop.

1030
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,720
I hate that slippery slope argument because it just stops progress.

1031
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,520
Oh I agree it stops very fast.

1032
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,920
But it's a very real problem for the courts.

1033
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:11,920
Yeah.

1034
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,600
Because they can see the downstream effects of their rulings and the implications are

1035
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,560
huge huge for every level of society.

1036
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:27,480
I want to just switch it a little bit in terms of our focus by asking Josh a question because

1037
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,960
you're talking about the human animal continuum.

1038
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:39,160
Are there soldiers or veterans who apply for a service dog who flunk.

1039
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,160
Many.

1040
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,280
And why and what what happens can you tell us a little bit of what from the human side

1041
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,680
makes it possible or impossible to relate.

1042
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:53,320
Well it's not a matter of relating it's a matter of soldiers.

1043
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,680
If you raise a service dog and you have a facility for raising a service dog you've

1044
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:02,920
been with that dog sometimes the first years with prisoners and then the prisoners they

1045
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,040
take the dog away from the prisoners which is very traumatic for the prisoner although

1046
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,760
they know it's coming.

1047
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,560
And then for the last year they get this training so the dog is probably worth twenty

1048
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:17,160
five to thirty five thousand dollars a and they have immense love and respect for these

1049
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,840
animals that they've trained so carefully and they want to make sure that the soldier

1050
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,920
will take care of the dogs and take responsibility.

1051
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:29,120
So soldiers coming back from war with PTSD go through a huge continuum and it starts

1052
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:35,360
with rage and anger and fear and often alcoholism and drug addiction and there's a lot of things

1053
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,080
that come up with it that many of them deal with.

1054
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,400
And if you're addicted to drugs or if you're an alcoholic you will not get a service dog.

1055
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,240
So they're basically turned down if they're not prepared to care for the animal and they're

1056
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,800
grilled very carefully about that.

1057
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:56,240
But if they are prepared and they qualify they can get the dog.

1058
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:01,600
And other instances where still their nervous system is so compromised that they're not

1059
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,080
able to relax enough to relate to the animal?

1060
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:09,600
Well they don't own the animal for a year when they give them this is I can't speak

1061
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,040
for all of them but the four different facilities we worked with they're all the same in this

1062
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:20,200
way that the soldier gets the animal for one year and they have to write reports biweekly

1063
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,400
or monthly about how it's going and they have to come back and report and come with the

1064
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,400
dog and they're evaluated.

1065
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,400
That's interesting.

1066
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:31,640
And at the end of the year they're either given the dog or they take the dog back.

1067
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,080
So they're trying to instill a reflective process.

1068
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,080
Yes.

1069
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,080
Very much so.

1070
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,320
And the dogs and the soldiers take responsibility for that because they don't want once they

1071
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,760
get the dog and they bond with the dog and they fall in love with the dog they don't

1072
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:49,440
want to lose that dog because the dog is given his freedom because they can actually go out,

1073
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,280
go somewhere, go to a store at some other place not as something other than three in

1074
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:57,840
the morning to avoid people you know to feel the connection that many commands that the

1075
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,920
dogs have give them real feeling of safety that they won't have a flashback because the

1076
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:06,920
dog will know it's coming and be able to stop it and block it for them or if they're

1077
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:11,560
on the street and someone's coming too close they can simply say block and the dog will

1078
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,680
immediately go in front and separate someone coming so that they don't have to feel someone's

1079
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:22,640
coming too close and they don't overreact and attack them and end up in jail which happens

1080
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,640
a lot.

1081
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,800
So the relationship becomes profound.

1082
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:35,240
So there's a huge change in the philosophy of training dogs which is that you really

1083
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:40,040
never hit them or spank them you only use positive reinforcement.

1084
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,040
No choke.

1085
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:49,000
No choke collars no you know and this is something that would benefit humans too right if we

1086
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:58,600
understood that positive reinforcement is how you get good behavior and negative reinforcement

1087
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,400
doesn't work.

1088
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:06,040
And I'm thinking of this in relationship with the Asian elephants that I got to know in

1089
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:11,560
Sri Lanka when I live there for a year because there are about 300 temple elephants there's

1090
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:18,600
about 3,000 wild elephants and about 100 elephants who live in an orphanage as a herd with two

1091
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,720
matriarchs.

1092
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:25,840
And the temple elephants are all tortured that's how they train them they separate them

1093
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:33,880
as children and then they're tortured and the Mahoots every now and then one is killed.

1094
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:39,680
And then I'm thinking about all these the captured herd that lives in this orphanage

1095
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:45,200
about 100 elephants they breed in captivity and the possibility of training elephants

1096
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:50,640
with positive reinforcement which seemed to me like an obvious no-brainer but you know

1097
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,240
when I grew up you would hit your dog if they did something bad you'd stick their nose

1098
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:02,080
in there if they defecated inside the house or something like that that's how you train

1099
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:07,600
the dog and that's all gone and it works much better.

1100
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:13,360
So you're involved I just want to point out that there's a whole new philosophy about

1101
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:19,080
training dogs that what I grew up with and it applies to humans too.

1102
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:26,400
Some of the parallels actually changes in training of children how people advocated

1103
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,720
training children the same sort of process seemed to get.

1104
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,640
They don't allow child collars anymore.

1105
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:38,360
Well you know if you smack your child in Sweden now you can be arrested.

1106
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:43,840
Perhaps the most profound one of the most profound experiences I've had was at an elephant research

1107
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:51,200
center in southern Kruger Park in South Africa and all the houses were up on stilts with

1108
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:58,480
sort of moats around them and one night there is this tremendous thundering sound and a

1109
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:05,200
whole group of elephants came in and went toward the research center patio where they

1110
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:15,720
had skulls of recently found elephants and they recognized that it was a baby elephant

1111
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:21,520
and a female elephant that had been from their herd and they had a funeral.

1112
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:28,480
The elephants had a funeral around these skulls and since they were chipped the researchers

1113
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,760
knew indeed these were from the herd.

1114
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:41,040
That has so impressed me and the other was a giraffe that knew that the wind was going

1115
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:48,280
to change when its calf had broken its leg and when the wind changed the lions would

1116
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,640
come.

1117
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:56,840
But I don't think I've ever experienced in a collective way even with Italian waves

1118
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:05,920
and Irish waves that level of just instinctive grief not reflective grief instinctive grief.

1119
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,360
Are you witness this?

1120
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,640
Yes, I've heard this.

1121
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:13,920
Yes, elephants are extraordinary creatures.

1122
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:21,040
In the list of weird things that animals figure out that we don't is the in the 2004

1123
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,280
tsunami in South Asia.

1124
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:28,480
The elephants and the birds they just all took off.

1125
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,800
They went inland.

1126
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:33,760
They knew somehow they knew long before the waves ever hit.

1127
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:43,720
Just again there were humans that died but there were any elephants that died.

1128
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:49,960
How does a dog recognize that their owner is going to have an epileptic fit?

1129
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,960
Smells it.

1130
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,960
And the owner doesn't know it right?

1131
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,960
Smells it.

1132
01:14:54,960 --> 01:15:02,960
There are things that are sense to that we are not.

1133
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:03,960
Yes.

1134
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:10,760
You might open this up for questions from the audience.

1135
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:17,480
And if so, would you come up and speak at the mic and identify yourself?

1136
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,120
It's been wonderful.

1137
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:26,360
I'm a dog and a late, I become a cat lover and there hasn't been very much discussion

1138
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,360
about cats here.

1139
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:36,800
And I've rescued three feral cats, one from the woods in Pennsylvania who was just crazy

1140
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,640
and I wanted to bring her to New York City and I talked to people here and there and

1141
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,880
said, I can't bring a feral cat.

1142
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,840
She'll destroy your house and everything.

1143
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,840
And one of them gave me a big cage and I put her in the cage because it was going to

1144
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,400
be a cold winter up there.

1145
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,400
I knew that.

1146
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:55,760
And I brought her back to my apartment and I'm happy to report that she became the most

1147
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,640
charming Manhattan lady.

1148
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:03,320
She liked her martinis about five o'clock.

1149
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:07,360
I think that cats are very different than dogs.

1150
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,680
I've had lots of dogs and lots of cats.

1151
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,000
I've lately become a cat person.

1152
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,760
But there, and I would like to hear what you have to say about that because they're more

1153
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,200
mysterious, they're not, I don't think they're trainable at all.

1154
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,160
Dogs are, of course, trainable.

1155
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,600
They're domesticable but I don't know.

1156
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:32,200
You can, I mean, that my cat now never does anything that I told her to do.

1157
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:37,480
So, and I've found them to be enormously intriguing and interesting.

1158
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:42,360
Even maybe more than my dogs, which I love dearly, but last time my dog died, I just

1159
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,280
could not face, you know, having another dog that would pass like that.

1160
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,280
It was just so heartbreaking.

1161
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,280
I just like to hear a little bit of discussion about cats.

1162
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,280
I love cats too.

1163
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,280
I believe in cats too.

1164
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,280
I do too.

1165
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:58,680
But you're not going to find too many therapy PTSD cats.

1166
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,680
No, no, no.

1167
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:07,320
And I think for good reason because, you know, we've selected dogs for the, as animals that

1168
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,680
seek social approval, they want our approval.

1169
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:13,480
That's what gratifies them.

1170
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:17,960
They're not interested in social approval.

1171
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,080
They want approval but it's not the same.

1172
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,080
It's not the same.

1173
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,080
They're not prepared.

1174
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,800
They'll let us pet them and purr us.

1175
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,800
Yeah.

1176
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,000
They'll delight when we feed them.

1177
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,800
And they don't show that same.

1178
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,800
Sometimes they'll play with us a little bit.

1179
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,800
But after a while.

1180
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,800
Yeah.

1181
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,400
The cat I have now will not get on my lap.

1182
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,800
But about three o'clock in the morning she'll jump up on the bed and lay on my chest.

1183
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,800
And she looks right at me.

1184
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,800
And they'll just lick me.

1185
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,520
That's the only thing I want to ask.

1186
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:51,920
You know, when a cat licks you, is she trying to eat you or is she trying to question?

1187
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:52,920
Is she giving you a...

1188
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,360
I think she's gone for the salt.

1189
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,760
What's that?

1190
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:59,600
I think she's gone for the salt.

1191
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,160
That raises a question I'd like to ask you.

1192
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:07,440
I have read that cats can be feral.

1193
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:12,520
And then if they're domesticized they can become domestic and that it's actually different

1194
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,880
brain.

1195
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,600
Parts of the brain and different systems.

1196
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:20,680
That they can negotiate both a wild and a domestic situation.

1197
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,840
Is that so?

1198
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,760
I don't know if that's altogether true.

1199
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,600
Because you can have the same situation with dogs.

1200
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:30,920
So you mentioned earlier that most of the world's dog population is what they call nowadays

1201
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:31,920
free roaming.

1202
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,960
They're not really feral.

1203
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:38,720
Because people own them but the expectations in many developing countries is that your

1204
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:42,080
dog lives outside and it's free to wander about.

1205
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:46,120
But it comes home from time to time for food and what have you.

1206
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:50,600
And so dogs can navigate this as well.

1207
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,160
And cats I think are very similar.

1208
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,600
I mean their history is very different as well.

1209
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:01,240
I mean people I think in the early years wanted cats primarily to be around the house

1210
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,960
and the farm to keep down the rodent population.

1211
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,760
They weren't seeking social contacts so much with cats.

1212
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:17,920
And I think the cats have moved in on us rather than us exploiting them for you know attachments.

1213
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,680
I just wanted to say that there's a kind of confusion about feral cats.

1214
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:25,400
People think that feral cats are different species than domestic cats.

1215
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,400
They're not at all.

1216
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,440
They're exactly the same cats.

1217
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:33,800
And you know feral cats were often you know cats that were kicked out of their homes for

1218
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:34,960
one reason or another.

1219
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,920
And they got used to being straight.

1220
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:43,160
Just as stray dogs can be very hard to catch because they're used to keeping people away.

1221
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:48,480
Well if they're not fixed and they reproduce they breed like vermin.

1222
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:54,320
I mean when I lived in Jerusalem one time ago the feral cats were in and out of the garbage

1223
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,320
everywhere you went.

1224
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:59,200
You know you walked past the garbage container and ten cats would jump out.

1225
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,120
It was really.

1226
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:05,880
So you know and in Sri Lanka where I lived there were three types of dogs.

1227
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:11,280
There were house dogs, neighborhood dogs and then there were feral dogs.

1228
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:16,040
But what was curious to me that there wasn't a culture of talking to dogs.

1229
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,480
And that was very strange.

1230
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,080
Maybe people still spoke to each other.

1231
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:28,960
No I think there just wasn't a lot of history of house dogs or whatever.

1232
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:37,080
Or there's a kind of autism that some cultures might have about speaking to animals or whatever.

1233
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:45,000
But you know with the elephants about thirty people are killed every year by elephants

1234
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,560
and about thirty elephants are killed by people every year.

1235
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,840
And it's all farmer conflict.

1236
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,440
The elephants come, some bachelor comes in and tears up the lawn.

1237
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,720
They try to shoot the elephant.

1238
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:00,400
The elephant comes back, you know they don't kill the elephant, comes back and they know

1239
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:06,400
exactly who shot them, which house it was and they go after that house.

1240
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:12,040
And you know so I'm thinking well if the people knew that these are personalities that they

1241
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:17,960
had names and they could follow them on the internet or whatever and they could, everybody

1242
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:24,680
agreed to use names and talk to them and to sort of negotiate between two intelligent

1243
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:31,240
species how we can get along on an individual level.

1244
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:39,080
So somebody needs to equip the villagers and standardize the language and signaling or

1245
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:44,680
whatever, realize that each one of these elephants has a personality, a history.

1246
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,160
So there are groups trying to do that.

1247
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:50,920
That would go a long way to getting rid of human elephant conflict.

1248
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:51,920
Yeah.

1249
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:57,000
The other interesting thing about the question about cats and dogs is goes back to the question

1250
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,160
I was trying to pose before about pigs and dogs.

1251
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:03,920
That is animals, different animals are good at different things and are clever or not

1252
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,920
clever.

1253
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:09,360
In a case maybe in different ways depending on their, I guess their genetics where they

1254
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,360
come from.

1255
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:17,920
There's an interesting new development in the study of plasticity and neuroplasticity

1256
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:24,600
in brains and not just human brains in which the notion is that we inherit certain genetic

1257
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:29,040
codes that actually provide some degree of plastic response.

1258
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:37,440
In other words, the difference between some sort of hardwired instinct and then some general

1259
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,800
drive that can sort of be expressed in many different ways.

1260
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:47,760
So an animal going from what we're calling a feral state to a domestic state is what's

1261
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:53,280
allowed by their nervous system, the plasticity that's part of their nervous system.

1262
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,560
So if they're in this environment, they can adapt in this way and then if they're in

1263
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,840
that environment, they adapt in a different way.

1264
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:06,280
But it's interesting to think in terms of cats and dogs, is that the dogs wish to ingratiate

1265
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:12,480
themselves had to start with the fact that the foxes or whatever animals, wolves from

1266
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:16,520
which the dogs were domesticated showed some inclination that way.

1267
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:22,120
After all these generations of cats that have been domesticated, they still, there are cats

1268
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:24,280
that are more friendly, we'll get on your lap.

1269
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,160
And people always brag about that.

1270
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,800
My cat is like a dog.

1271
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:33,880
But that doesn't seem to be within the range of their plasticity yet they can be bred

1272
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,880
to do this probably in the future, but dogs were easy to do that way.

1273
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,760
I think it was in the range of their possibilities and with cats less so.

1274
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:45,400
So I think if so.

1275
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:52,600
One comment on the legality of animal rights is we live in sort of an abnormal time where

1276
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,040
animals don't have any legal representation.

1277
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:02,360
But in the middle ages, they would actually try animals if they trampled crops or destroyed

1278
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,600
or even killed a person.

1279
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:09,040
They'd have a trial and sometimes animals got off mitigating circumstances or they were

1280
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,520
too young to know it was wrong to eat the baby, you know, whatever.

1281
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:20,640
So post enlightenment, the Newtonian mechanical worldview that we've inherited by the way

1282
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:29,920
is an anomaly in human history where in the past people lived most more closely.

1283
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:35,840
They had a more intimate relationship with animals and was reflected in recognition of

1284
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:42,200
the animals having some sort of legal representation when they transgressed and damaged human property.

1285
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:47,200
The other thing you mentioned plasticity of the brain, you mean epigenetics?

1286
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,200
Well, perhaps.

1287
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,200
Yes.

1288
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:53,560
I mean, not necessarily though because you had to hear that in some of these instances

1289
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:59,280
the genes are conferring a trait that has some degree of plasticity built into it.

1290
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:03,200
You see, if this than that, if that than that.

1291
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,200
Okay.

1292
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:09,800
Because right now in evolutionary theory, they discovered in the last maybe eight years

1293
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:14,240
Neil Lamarckian inheritance acquired characteristics.

1294
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:20,720
So like this gentleman who was talking about cats, if he had children and he has an intimate

1295
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:29,080
perhaps love of cats, they might be predetermined to inherit that orientation towards cats because

1296
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:36,800
his brain was triggered in such a way emotionally to like that particular animal.

1297
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:42,080
So I think it's interesting that people now are having very intimate relationships with

1298
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,080
cats.

1299
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:49,480
We're in the past, they were a barnyard predator and just kept around until maybe 1930s as

1300
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:56,480
a barnyard thing animal to kill mice and rats.

1301
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:00,960
And now people are taking them into their houses and trying to domesticate this inherently

1302
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:06,880
very predatory animal and treat it like a dog and hope it responds.

1303
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:17,800
The other thing is I'm wondering, I haven't heard anybody talking here about the effect

1304
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:31,560
of zoon zenotic infectious bacteria or viruses transmitted to humans from domesticated animals

1305
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:39,360
and the effect on our brains where our brains may be conditioned by those bacteria to respond

1306
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,960
a certain way to the animal.

1307
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:48,560
And I'm thinking of Toxmos plasmosis gondi, you know, that kind of came out with that

1308
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,960
article and book by Kathleen McNichlawardly.

1309
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:58,480
Yeah, so about 10% of humans are probably infected with.

1310
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,960
No, it's more than that.

1311
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:03,280
Worldwide it's around 60% in America.

1312
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:07,640
So around 30% and with negative consequences.

1313
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,120
It's not good for your health.

1314
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:17,480
It's the interesting virus that mostly in cats and rats and mice.

1315
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:21,800
Well, compared to the revelations this morning in the New York Times about Johnson's and

1316
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:29,120
Johnson's baby powder, which has asbestos in it, I'm not so worried about toxoplasts

1317
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,920
although maybe that should be.

1318
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:34,680
But let me just say that in the history of domesticated animals that's where most of

1319
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,480
our communicable diseases come from.

1320
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,480
Cattle.

1321
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:47,800
No, cattle and sheep and I mean all, you know, most of our big diseases we evolved.

1322
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,800
But not cancer?

1323
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,800
No, no, I understand.

1324
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,800
But communicable diseases.

1325
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,120
Actually, cancer is caused by viruses a lot of it.

1326
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,800
In some cases that's right.

1327
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,000
Breast cancer is special.

1328
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,720
Thank you for raising a whole bunch of issues.

1329
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,760
I don't know if anybody else wants to.

1330
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:06,480
The animal trials one is something I looked into a while back.

1331
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:10,920
It was a very interesting guy called Bernard Chassine.

1332
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:18,160
He was a medieval French jurist who made his reputation actually by going around France

1333
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:22,000
and defending animals in animal trials.

1334
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,840
He got a tremendous reputation for doing this and he was one of the people who was very

1335
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,960
good at getting animals acquitted.

1336
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:35,960
He got a swarm of locusts acquitted somewhere in the south of France.

1337
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:42,200
Because his argument was that they weren't able to control their craving for the crops.

1338
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:47,200
So they had gone in there and eaten the crops and that if they, in the future, people wanted

1339
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:50,760
locust not to eat their crops and they had to provide the locust with something else

1340
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:51,760
to eat.

1341
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,760
And the judge bought it apparently.

1342
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,760
He said yes.

1343
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:55,760
Sensible.

1344
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,760
We'll let them off this time.

1345
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,640
Were they incarcerated so that they were in jeopardy?

1346
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,200
No, they didn't come to the court the lower.

1347
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,120
So they didn't show up for their own trial.

1348
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,120
They didn't write it up.

1349
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:12,600
But it was an interesting time because it wasn't clear that people actually thought

1350
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:17,960
the animals knew about their own culpability.

1351
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:24,960
It was more of you that if a crime was committed then somebody had to pay the price for it

1352
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,800
just to kind of maintain the social order.

1353
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:34,920
And so they went through these elaborate trials which really, they were sham trials but some

1354
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:40,160
of these jurists got very, very famous and successful as a result.

1355
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,760
I think we have time for one more question.

1356
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:43,760
Mm-hmm.

1357
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:44,760
Yeah.

1358
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,760
I'm Henry Earl.

1359
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:51,000
I live over here on your cap between the Animal Medical Center and New York Hospital.

1360
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,280
And I've been struck over the last 30 years.

1361
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:56,440
Which one are you trying to go to?

1362
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:58,040
That's what I was going to ask you.

1363
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:59,800
I bet you insurance, I'm sure.

1364
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:06,640
Over the last many years I've been struck with the sophistication of the techniques,

1365
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:10,480
diagnostic and therapeutic at the Animal Medical Center.

1366
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:16,320
And I've wondered about informed consent in both places but particularly at the Animal

1367
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,920
Medical Center.

1368
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:25,320
So of course there is no informed consent but the procedures are extremely costly.

1369
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:33,480
And often unproven and the outcomes are often very unpredictable.

1370
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:38,840
The other area that I'm interested in and related to it is end of life care for these

1371
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:43,560
domestic animals and how the decisions are made.

1372
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,720
Yeah.

1373
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:49,000
So there is informed consent but of course it's for the owner.

1374
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,600
So owners are given the consent form.

1375
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:56,600
And so if any procedure is planned that's going to be costly or potentially dangerous

1376
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:00,400
to the animal, the owner has to sign off on it as the proxy.

1377
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:06,240
In the same way that a parent might sign off for a very young child.

1378
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:10,760
The difference is the cost is all on you.

1379
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:11,760
It is.

1380
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,320
And also it's all optional.

1381
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:21,560
And if the doctor screw up and your animal dies, the best you can hope for is the replacement

1382
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:27,560
value of the animal which is not of great benefit to someone for whom this animal is

1383
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,000
the thing they love most in the world.

1384
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,480
But that's another story.

1385
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:38,160
But yes we have now this situation where the veterinary profession has actually under pressure

1386
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:47,480
from clients has all the modern medical techniques and treatments that are available to people

1387
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:51,640
at a similar cost or those tend to be cheaper for animals even though they're doing the

1388
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,880
same treatment.

1389
01:31:54,880 --> 01:32:01,040
And we get this situation now where a lot of animals are on their last legs, keeping

1390
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:05,560
them alive is probably cruel and the owners won't let go.

1391
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:08,080
The owner says do everything you can.

1392
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,480
Spare no expense.

1393
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,920
Just do whatever you can and the vet says well there's nothing more we can do.

1394
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,080
Well just try it.

1395
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:19,720
And we have the situation quite frequently now in our veterinary hospital at the University

1396
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:26,520
of Pennsylvania where everyone, the staff, the nurses, everyone is putting pressure on

1397
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:30,520
the veterinarian to euthanize the animal.

1398
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:34,200
And the veterinarian says I can't because the owner won't let me.

1399
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,280
And it's the owner's property.

1400
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:41,560
And because it's the owner's property legally I have to do what they say or I can refer

1401
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,000
them to another veterinarian.

1402
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,160
And if I refer them to another veterinarian that's going to be even more cruel because

1403
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:49,760
we can at least keep the animal comfortable.

1404
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:56,160
So it's a very difficult situation now.

1405
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:01,160
But I think one of the differences is that a lot of the veterinary services, medical

1406
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:06,440
services are actually superior to what we get as humans.

1407
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:12,320
I can't speak to that.

1408
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,560
Well thank you so much.

1409
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:19,120
It was a lively, very compelling, very enlightening conversation.

1410
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:25,200
We really appreciate you being here and sharing your experience and your knowledge with us.

1411
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,200
Thank you very much.

1412
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,200
And thank you all for coming.

1413
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,200
Thank you so much.

1414
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:44,160
Will you help me answer your lectures or is that smart enough, expand Bob's

1415
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,920
finances?
