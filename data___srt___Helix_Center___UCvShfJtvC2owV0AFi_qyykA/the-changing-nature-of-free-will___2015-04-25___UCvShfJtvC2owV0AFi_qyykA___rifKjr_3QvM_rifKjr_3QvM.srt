like

54
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
here, we're

They're on your handouts and also on the website.

83
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,480

His research focuses on the dynamics of firm competition, both from the antitrust and from

94
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,760
the strategy perspectives.

95
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,000

Organization.

99
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,280
Brigitte Kahl is a professor of New Testament at Union Theological Seminary in New York

100
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,280
and associate professor at the Religion Department at Columbia.

A biblical scholar with strong interdisciplinary and ecological leanings, a major focus of

102
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,960
a recent work has been between New Testament and Roman Empire, especially with the Groud

103
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,000
to the Letters of Paul.

104
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,920

Tech Carilion Research Institute.

108
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,560
He investigates neurobiological processes underlying human choice behavior using computational

109
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,840
approaches paired with measurements of behavior and associated neural activity.

110
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,360
Such experiments designed to expose how the brain encodes computations important for adaptive

111
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,520
choice behavior.

112
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,240
Simon Coshan is professor emeritus and senior research scientist in the mathematics department

113
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240

A recipient of the Frank Nelson Cole Prize in number theory of the American Mathematical

115
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,160
Society, his interest lie in mathematical logic, number theory, and quantum mechanics.

116
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,680
His work on the foundation of quantum mechanics includes the paper with Ernest Specker on the

117
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,680
Coshan Specker Paradox and with John Conway on the free screen and now to our round table.

118
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:16,680
All right.

119
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,080
Well, I have difficulty.

120
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,840
Usually when I talk about science with other neuroscientists, not very often with philosophers

121
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
or theologians.

122
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:33,720
So I know why myself and folks that I tell the rest of us here are interested in the

123
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,160
problem or what value you guys have placed on this idea.

124
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,320
I don't work exactly on free-wearing topics that you've heard just before.

125
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
Did that include free-well?

126
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,840
A lot of different things, not this.

127
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,480
I think it's a fascinating topic, one that I'm interested in.

128
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,440
I've been reading mostly about, and I don't do a lot of research on.

129
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,160
Just to get things started, I mean, personally, I don't think that free-well is a proposition

130
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,560
that can be proven or disproven in a way that's agree from that.

131
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,160
I see free-well primarily as an axiom.

132
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:21,960
If there is no free-well, then what's my identity?

133
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:29,640
The thing that I do that I think is just the result of the temporal events or it's totally

134
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:38,440
conditioned by particles or whatever the negation of free-well is, then I would have no identity.

135
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,320
And I cannot imagine a world where I wouldn't be I.

136
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,960
So I like to think of free-well as an axiom.

137
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,720
I think it can be studied.

138
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:54,400
It can be falsified in some way, but I would rather think about it as an axiom rather than

139
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,360
a proposition that we can prove or disprove.

140
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
Just to name you.

141
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,240
So, I mean, let's just jump in.

142
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,160
I'll add a bit to that.

143
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,400
So when I've thought about this in the past, before I really pursued a role in science,

144
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,840
trying to answer these kinds of questions, in that transition, I've found that actually

145
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:23,200
the idea of free-well, it has this kind of use as a belief to frame how we do think about

146
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,960
ourselves and how the choices we make have an impact.

147
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,680
But from a scientific perspective, I actually find that it's very challenging to use that

148
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,680
idea to go in and study the thing that it's trying to capture.

149
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,400
When you get into discussions of free-well or consciousness, a lot of it boils down to

150
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:50,080
an hour of trying for everyone involved to define and talk about free-well.

151
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,760
When we're talking about free-well, to me it seems like what it is is we're interested

152
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,560
in how humans make choices, right?

153
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,640
The choice of behaviors that we see.

154
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:04,120
We want to explain when we execute certain acts, it has some rare professions.

155
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,480
Could we have done something different?

156
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,320
Have we been at that moment again?

157
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
And we want to try to explain that.

158
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:16,560
To me, it seems like it's a useful idea, only to fill in a gap where we haven't really explored

159
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
it very much.

160
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,520
As a neuroscientist, I've been interested in studying choice behavior from a biological

161
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:32,800
standpoint and trying to understand what does lead to the varieties of choice that we express.

162
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
I wouldn't say that it's free.

163
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,280
There's really nothing free about what humans or any other biological organism does.

164
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,960
Everything comes at a cost.

165
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,520
We can't go on forever without eating or sleeping or breathing.

166
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,960
There's a real constraints on the kinds of choices that we can make and how we can navigate

167
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,840
the world.

168
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,560
On the other hand, as humans, we seem to gain some control over the environment so that

169
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,000
we can have these luxuries.

170
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,880
We can sit in a room and talk about things rather than be out hunting and gathering our

171
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,800
resources and shelters, right?

172
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:16,080
We get this kind of luxury and that expands to lots of other domains where we create some

173
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,200
freedom from our past, I guess.

174
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,840
So let me just ask you something.

175
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,040
Would you agree with the proposition that the only reason why we cannot predict behavior

176
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:38,640
of a certain agent, be it human or non-human, is lack of precision in measurement?

177
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:46,160
That one day, if we measure neurologically with sufficient accuracy, every single neuron

178
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,760
of the human brain, we'll be able to model and predict behavior.

179
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,800
Yeah, so in some ways we do predict behavior.

180
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,760
If I want to make you feel bad, I'll insult you, right?

181
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,320
Or I'll attack you physically, right?

182
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,840
And that will have very differences on how you're going to act with me.

183
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,760
I have kids, and so when I want them to do certain strategies that I could use to interact

184
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,760
with them and others that won't be very effective.

185
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:27,640
From a scientific standpoint, you can put people or pigeons into a Skinner box where they can

186
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,880
make choices and you can set up the reward, schedule the hovers in such a way that they

187
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,240
will act actually quite predictably.

188
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,480
In some sense, it's in probabilistic terms, right?

189
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,720
Decision, decision, it is not perfect.

190
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,720
It's probabilistic, as he said, and rightly so.

191
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,600
Is that error term in your models?

192
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,200
Is that due to measurement error or is it due to something that's inherent to the model

193
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
that you model?

194
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,440
I think it's the big philosophical or whatever question about free will.

195
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,080
Is it all a matter of measurement?

196
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,040
The only reason why I cannot predict exactly what you're the rat or human subject is going

197
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:17,080
to do is that I'm not measuring carefully enough, or is there any fundamental, if you

198
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:23,080
will, of uncertainty which cannot be properly predicted?

199
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:33,000
Let me interject here.

200
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,600
Part of that question is, is the uncertainty, our knowledge of what's going on as philosophers

201
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
say, epistemic?

202
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,040
Or is there an underlying uncertainty here?

203
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:49,400
So I'm a mathematician and might ask why I'm here altogether.

204
00:20:49,400 --> 00:21:01,280
But about eight years ago, I proved a result together with John Conway at Princeton, which

205
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:08,520
is a refinement of a much older theorem going back with Anchbeck as Swiss mathematician,

206
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,640
almost 50 years.

207
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:18,400
And the question there is the underlying question is not directly about the question of determinism

208
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,440
in the universe.

209
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:29,320
Is the universe strictly deterministic in a quite precise way that classical physics

210
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:37,360
in seismic Newton has said that if you know the state of the, not in the mind know, if

211
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,040
the state of the universe is whatever it is at a given time, classical physics tells you

212
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:50,720
that the state of the universe, both at any other time, both in the future and the past,

213
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,800
is totally determined.

214
00:21:52,800 --> 00:22:01,080
So that was started a century by Isaac Newton in his system of the universe.

215
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:10,720
And that brings in an old philosophical question that goes back over 2,000 years between the

216
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:18,320
Stoics and Epicurus and the Romans, with Lucretius and Cicero.

217
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:26,920
And the more modern version is what Hume started and Hobbes in the 18th century.

218
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:36,520
And it's what's called compatibilism by philosophers is free will compatible with such a deterministic

219
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,960
picture of the universe.

220
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:46,800
So the contribution that these theorems make that I was talking about is to say that it's

221
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:54,720
pointless to even talk about that because modern physics in the form of quantum mechanics

222
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:03,960
gives rise to certain experiments, which shows that, so quantum mechanics itself, if you

223
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:11,720
accept it, says that even if you're nicely the state as much as you can, what's called

224
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:20,440
a pure state, at the present time for a closed system, like a particle or several, then the

225
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,040
future, you can, for the future, you can only talk about probabilities for that.

226
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,840
And if you accept quantum mechanics, that's not epistemological.

227
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:37,720
It's not our knowledge, it's just an ontological fact that you cannot give, that there are

228
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,240
probabilities only that you can give.

229
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,680
What the theorem that I'm talking about says is, see, people didn't like that point of

230
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,780
view.

231
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,640
Even the founders of quantum mechanics, like Schrodinger and Einstein, really were not

232
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,520
very happy with this whole idea of there being an inherent probability.

233
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:06,160
And various people have tried to get back to a classical picture which reproduces the

234
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:17,000
question, but says that these are probabilities, if you knew the underlying states, would be

235
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,400
just a lack of knowledge of the underlying hidden variables.

236
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:32,600
So an example of biology is we have probabilities attached to inherited traits, like blue eyes

237
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:40,560
and brown eyes, one uses these probabilities, but men don't introduce a sort of hidden variable,

238
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:47,080
namely jigine, which nobody knew existed at that time, but if it explains the process

239
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,040
of endowment and factors, it explains the probabilities very well, and eventually they

240
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,960
were actually founders as molecules.

241
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:05,040
So people who believe in such hidden variables feel that they might try to explain the probabilities

242
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,800
of quantum mechanics in the same way.

243
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:15,520
This theorem, I'm not going to make a distinction between Schrodinger and myself, and then somewhat

244
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,720
improved on myself.

245
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,840
It says that you can't put quantum mechanics.

246
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,280
If you try to give a classical explanation of certain experiments that we came up with,

247
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,640
you'll run into a contradiction.

248
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:38,120
If you actually want to say what the future state is, I can explain this in more detail

249
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,320
if people want later.

250
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:51,040
But there's just a series of 40 experiments in this which quantum mechanics gives probabilities

251
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,440
for the outcomes.

252
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:00,080
But if you try to give, say this is the outcome for this, you simply run into mathematical

253
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,520
contradiction.

254
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,040
So that's what the theorem is about.

255
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:11,760
This is that the whole, this argument between what are called compatibilists and those who

256
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,560
believe compatibilism and free will are, in fact, they are not compatible.

257
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:27,960
That is to say that free will and determinism are incompatible, the incompatible list, that

258
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:35,200
argument is an old-fashioned argument which now since quantum mechanics for almost 100

259
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,920
years is simply out of date.

260
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:47,720
One doesn't have to talk about this compatibilism because quantum mechanics is a pro-intontologically

261
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
probabilistic theory.

262
00:26:49,720 --> 00:27:05,160
It says we will never get back to a classical kind of deterministic universe.

263
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:14,400
The question broadly is whether those who believe in free will, will find comfort in

264
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:22,520
the fact that we move from some level of certainty to predictions that are merely probabilistic.

265
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:32,760
They might say that the real threat to free will is that you should see it as that human

266
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:40,880
agency is susceptible to prediction even if the prediction is demoted to a probabilistic

267
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,880
prediction for the reasons that you and others have established.

268
00:27:47,880 --> 00:28:00,160
So, there are two questions that seem to suggest that there is a more principled issue

269
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:09,040
about freedom than one of whether the system, the school system is to be seen in probabilistic

270
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,360
terms or something more close to certainty.

271
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:28,480
One is to raise the question, you see if it is the case that all laws, even in Newton's

272
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:38,040
mechanics, laws presumably come with a heterosperivistic clauses with all things being equal clauses,

273
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:44,640
in Latin it is called cadaerosparibus clauses, that is you hold certain things steady.

274
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,440
So you can predict so long as certain conditions are met.

275
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,960
So there is a clause which says it says it were looking out for things that allow for

276
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,200
exceptions and saying those must not arise, those conditions must not arise.

277
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:09,560
Now the trouble with human behaviour is that if you were tempted to say that certain intentions

278
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:19,040
and choices and preferences, if one were tempted to say that their laws are the probabilistic

279
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:26,160
or more definite forms of law, if one were tempted to say their laws would say if you

280
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,960
made certain choices or had certain preferences you would act in such and such way.

281
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:41,560
The trouble is when we try and say what has to be in a cadaerosparibus clause, it is just

282
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,800
about everything.

283
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Right?

284
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:52,280
I mean if I say if I believe that water will quench my thirst and so I predict that I

285
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:59,760
will, if I have that thirst and that belief I will drink that water, that could go, that

286
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,400
prediction could be falsified by just about anything.

287
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Right?

288
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,720
Why am I being too lazy to pick it up?

289
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,080
Why am I being too busy talking to pick it up?

290
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,040
Why am I preferring orange juice to drinking that?

291
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,200
It could be just about anything.

292
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,160
So what has to be held steady when one says all things being equal I will drink that water

293
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,720
if I have that visit.

294
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,240
We have no ex-anti-hould over all that has to be held steady.

295
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,400
But if you compare what has to be held steady, say in the law of falling bodies in Newton,

296
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,960
you can ex-anti-state in a very general way what has to be held steady.

297
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,960
And that's part of the problem that you were raising.

298
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:44,480
We have no, all the, all things being equal clauses as it were have to come exposed.

299
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,480
We can't, ex-anti-say what has to be held steady.

300
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,360
I think that's part of the problem.

301
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,080
Isn't that the promise of neuroscience that we will be able to control that?

302
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:02,320
I mean if you get down to the really nitty-gritty of neurological activity that eventually if

303
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,520
you measure sufficiently well, you should be able to control for all of those conditions.

304
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,040
You know, your past behavior, your state of, the state of the world could also be the state

305
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,640
of your mind measured in some precise way.

306
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Right.

307
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,080
So you can't do that but by changing the subject.

308
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,440
That is, you couldn't do it with the vocabulary of orange juice first and so on.

309
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,840
You'd have to do it with the vocabulary of neurophysiological states.

310
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
Right.

311
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,320
So in a sense you change, you can do that by a reductive change of the subject.

312
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
Right.

313
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,440
You can't do it with the vocabulary of beliefs, desires, preferences, etc.

314
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,720
You can talk about brain states and then the question arises, well we wanted a prediction

315
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,480
with this vocabulary.

316
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,640
You've given us a prediction in a different vocabulary and that really is in a way the

317
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
mind-minded problem.

318
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,120
And it seems like some of the resistance to that change in vocabulary.

319
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,880
It's not the vocabulary that we use day to day.

320
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Right.

321
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,120
And the value from what I understand about free will.

322
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,280
We're not so concerned about whether or not our pet dog has free will.

323
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,400
We care about whether or not other humans have free will.

324
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,640
Because when they do, either don't accept or that we want to support, we want to assign

325
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,080
them credit or not.

326
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,680
And there's, I think, good evidence that this is something that's very important to our

327
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
species.

328
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,560
It's something that's evolved in how we process information about others.

329
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,200
It's how we organize in small groups but also bigger structures.

330
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:46,280
So if you change the vocabulary to a biological one or a physiological one, there's a worry

331
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:54,400
that then the whole social structure which is built on this other language will collapse.

332
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:00,920
And it's actually what's going to happen with exceptions based on what we understand from

333
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,680
medicine and neurobiology.

334
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:09,720
So whether it's legal or whether it's interpersonal, if a person has a particular psychiatric condition

335
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,480
and it causes them to act in certain ways, treat it or untreated, we don't treat them

336
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,680
the same way as a society, as someone who does not have that condition.

337
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Right.

338
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,880
And that's true in many cases.

339
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:32,600
Just because you can make, it doesn't seem to remove agency.

340
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,120
It doesn't seem to remove control.

341
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,320
In fact, actually, I think it actually enhances it and provides more control as we start to

342
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:47,200
understand where these constraints come from, from our biology or our environment, the interactions

343
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,840
we have.

344
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,600
Once we recognize that they are constraints, we could do things as a society.

345
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,640
We can make choices to remove them, to make things more equal, a more level playing field.

346
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:05,440
And so in some sense, by changing the language, learning what is or is not predictable, we're

347
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,520
actually gaining more control.

348
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:13,360
So wait, so that makes it sound as if the more determined we are and the more knowledge

349
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,160
we have of the determining factors, the more free we are.

350
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:22,520
As we come to understand that, so I'm not sure if you're making, but it says though

351
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,000
as we learn about it, we become determined.

352
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Right.

353
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,760
So I guess what I'm saying is that there are forces that we're completely unaware of

354
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,880
in our biology and in our environment that have impact on the way we make decisions.

355
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Right.

356
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
Right now.

357
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:43,920
But I thought your point was that once we come to know more about those determining factors,

358
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,320
we actually get a bit of control and therefore are more free.

359
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
Yes.

360
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,560
So there's nothing more free is different from completely free.

361
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
Right.

362
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
More control, more choice.

363
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,320
It is a pair of paradox in that, isn't it?

364
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:10,640
But usually we thought agency was threatened by determinism and you're suggesting agency

365
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,080
is enhanced by determinism so long as knowledge of the determinism.

366
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:23,120
So if we're going from determinism to completely free will or some version of compatibleism,

367
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:30,400
that is not the language that I actually find useful to talk about these things.

368
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,440
From the work that I do and the way that I approach these problems, I can make observations

369
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,560
that can control certain experimental settings and I can make measurements and generate models

370
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,160
for what I might expect to do in the future.

371
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:48,640
So generating essentially scientific beliefs.

372
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,840
When we talk about free will and when we get really heated debates over that, what we're

373
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,680
actually talking about is human behavior.

374
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:04,760
When we see others and so in the space of trying to explain human behavior, we can learn

375
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,840
more about what is guiding that.

376
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:16,960
I agree with you that if we know more about what is determining our behavior, we do in

377
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:28,320
a sense become more liberated because we know what the knowledge of necessity is actually

378
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,720
a liberating thing.

379
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:39,640
But here's the interesting, it's really very fastily about the docs which is that what

380
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,600
you say is absolutely right.

381
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:48,080
The more we find out about, so if I'm angry and I've figured out what exactly the well

382
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,920
springs of my anger are, I have no anger.

383
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,840
That's the point that Spinozo is making.

384
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:05,120
But here's the fascinating thing, that is true only if it is piecemeal.

385
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,320
If it's piecemeal, there is something which when it's small, my anger or some particular

386
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:18,480
thing, one thing or the other, but if one had nothing but the perspective of seeing oneself

387
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,820
say as a sacri-endless sees one, just in a detached way, if one made that thing comprehend

388
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,120
offensive, we would have no agency.

389
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:36,080
So the very thing which when it's small is liberating in just the way you describe, if

390
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,520
you just blow it up to say make it a comprehensive thing saying, well we can just see all our

391
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,400
behavior as present and future.

392
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,720
And that's the end of agency.

393
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,320
Well, it creates an interesting question I think about agency.

394
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,840
Where does that begin and then?

395
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
What are those boundaries?

396
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:02,840
So from a biological perspective, an organism has physical boundaries, but that's different

397
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,600
from I think the agency that you're talking about or the sense of it.

398
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:18,360
So while I exist in the body that I walk around in, I interact with people in exchange information

399
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,960
either consciously but also quite implicitly.

400
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,600
Just being in a room full of folks or being in a conversation, your brain is processing

401
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,360
this information in ways that's guiding how you're going to behave in ways that you're

402
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,680
not necessarily aware of.

403
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:44,640
And so for an observer of an agent in that context, our readout of their agency is really

404
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,320
based on their behavior.

405
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:55,840
It always comes back to one brain or one system looking at another system and trying to determine

406
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,240
who is the agent.

407
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:05,240
The hard question is what goes on when one is observing oneself.

408
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,760
And what I was, of course, if you observe and study yourself, you will get more control

409
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,560
of yourself in the future.

410
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,880
And if you do nothing, if you have no other point of view on yourself but that of detached

411
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,160
observation, then you've gotten rid of agents.

412
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,520
So there must be some other perspective you have on yourself over and above a detached

413
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,360
study of yourself.

414
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:39,080
That is what everyone means by freedom.

415
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:47,760
It's quite fascinating to listen to all that and trying to translate it into the way

416
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,960
which I am working.

417
00:39:50,960 --> 00:40:00,280
And I am just noticing that the same problems but in a different key have been the technology

418
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,440
throughout the centuries.

419
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,560
And it is so interesting and this is a reason why I really thought I should come here and

420
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,400
just listen to you and see where we are in that.

421
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,440
So this big kind of paradoxical juxtaposition between determinism on the one hand, so things

422
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
are determined.

423
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:29,760
And in theology, of course, we say there is this supreme being called God, the deity that

424
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:37,960
has created everything and has this kind of sovereignty over things that happen.

425
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:46,240
So that is the kind of person who destines us or destines us or is the kind of determinating

426
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,600
force.

427
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:54,120
And then on the other hand, of course, we also need free will because if everything is already

428
00:40:54,120 --> 00:41:01,160
set by God, then what the hell are we doing and how come that there is a judgment or that

429
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,840
there is repentance, that we can change, that there is conversion.

430
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:11,600
And all these things that as this constant appeal to our moral agency or kind of spiritual

431
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,840
agency to change who we are.

432
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:24,360
And I think I have never worked on free will because I always thought this is kind of a

433
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:30,160
dead end discussion because theologians have kind of constantly been in battle about that.

434
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,640
I mean, you know, you have two positions.

435
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,400
One kind of camp says and they are often well the heretics.

436
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
They said there is free will.

437
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:46,360
Even after the fall of Adam and Eve in paradise, you still can do good.

438
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,000
And then there is the other position that says no, we cannot do good.

439
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,920
And when you were talking, I just about my decisions and thinking about what I am doing.

440
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:02,160
I just was kind of thinking of Paul who said, oh, I'm miserable.

441
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,320
I'm such a miserable being because I constantly do what I not want.

442
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,080
You know, I know what is good.

443
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,840
I know what I want to do.

444
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,000
But how come that I constantly do the opposite?

445
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,160
You know, that is, you know, my freedom is restricted and why is my freedom restricted?

446
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,520
And then there is this big term sin.

447
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,000
I'm in bondage.

448
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,400
I am kind of, I see the things I would like to do, but I don't do them because the novel

449
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:40,280
law is at work in my limbs, in my hand, then what my mind tells me.

450
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,840
So and then Paul says, you know, but there is a way out of that.

451
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:52,360
And here is the question, how kind of theologians are asking them, where are we going with that?

452
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,480
What is at stake in this debate?

453
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,680
Is at stake, eat eggs or bacon for breakfast?

454
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,560
Or is this choice or is something else at stake?

455
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:13,560
Can we, can we, can we do, can we even keep the world in a state that is deliverable,

456
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,560
for example?

457
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:20,400
Or are we kind of doomed to turn it into hell?

458
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,520
I think this is the theological question.

459
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:29,840
So do we have the agency to do good or are we all under the spell of evil?

460
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:37,600
And this is why I'm so interested in listening to neuroscience and to quantum mechanics.

461
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:44,720
I think that all is this kind of, on the one hand, we are far more determined than we think

462
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,720
we are.

463
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,920
And on the other hand, there is a space of freedom.

464
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:56,640
I mean, this is what I hear you to say and do I hear you wrong or is?

465
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:03,840
I mean, I think it's interesting when we ask the question of this force, that this pushing

466
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,840
is for it.

467
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,680
And it also speaks, I think, where is agency?

468
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,600
So agency, free will.

469
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,960
These are ideas that seem to be very useful to us as human beings.

470
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,240
And it's something that we do care a lot about.

471
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,080
We spend a lot of cycles thinking about.

472
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:29,640
From a biological perspective, there is a lot of stake and it's a survival of our species.

473
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,120
And that's always been the case.

474
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,520
And that's true for any species on this planet.

475
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,760
It's always been about the survival of the species.

476
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:43,880
And so there are things that will promote the survival and things that will demote that.

477
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:50,920
And evolution by natural selection would say that basically you, that which survives

478
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
when.

479
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,480
So there's no really other direction on it.

480
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,560
Those ideas or those things that support the survival of the species on to the next stage

481
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,320
and the next generation are fit.

482
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:10,560
And so I'd actually propose a compromise between what some popular scientists view on

483
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:19,680
religion and what religion's role has been for humanity is that there has, it's been

484
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,680
a useful idea.

485
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,040
It helps organize our day to day where we fit in the world.

486
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,280
If it wasn't useful to us as a species, it would have been dropped long ago, right?

487
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,880
And we would have all passed.

488
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,120
And we haven't done that.

489
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:39,160
We hang on to these ideas of being an agent or having free will or all kinds of narratives.

490
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:44,400
And science is its own narrative based on experimentation and empirical thought.

491
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,440
So you think that's also true for free will as an instrument for all agency that's necessary

492
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,920
for living in society?

493
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,720
I think it's something that we hang on to as a species because it is useful.

494
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,800
At some point it occurred to me personally, well what if I didn't have free will?

495
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,560
Well what if I don't?

496
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,480
Well what if I don't?

497
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,720
Well my life doesn't really change.

498
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,640
I can't really change my behavior in any other way, right?

499
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:25,600
So the choices I make or the choices I make, I'm chasing some value for every choice.

500
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,440
And it's kind of letting go of that idea and looking to other ways to explain my behavior

501
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,160
or others' behavior became more interesting.

502
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:40,040
But there's all kinds of ideas that I think that do carry some value to us.

503
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:49,240
And where that comes from, where that value comes from, that's an open question I think.

504
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,280
I think it's hard to deny what you're saying.

505
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:04,200
But I'm wondering if the term useful is the right term.

506
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:14,680
All my instincts are to say that there's something more lofty about the norm which

507
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:22,560
says we ought not to shape the concept of human freedom.

508
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,360
Not that it's just that it's useful, but we ought not to.

509
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:35,840
So I have a loftier sense of the norm than norms of utility.

510
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:45,680
One way to ask the question which your work establishes that there is a notion of free.

511
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:53,760
There's a falsity about determinism in the way you've in the move from Newtonian mechanics

512
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,000
to contemporary physics.

513
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,240
One thing we might ask is what is the location for the idea of norms or the usefulness of

514
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,240
the notion of agency, which is partly what you were saying too.

515
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:17,720
Here's a very simple question, suppose you did something, suppose X did something very

516
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:28,560
harmful because it's a delightful sake or for personal gain or something like that.

517
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:36,200
And somebody else say why did the same harmful thing because he was forced to do it, say

518
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:41,320
physically forced or somebody put a machine gun to his head and said do it all, shoot

519
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,280
you.

520
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,600
So X and Y do exactly the same thing, it's a bad thing.

521
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,640
This does it because he wants to do it, wants to gain from it, etc.

522
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:59,000
Why does it because somebody's just forced him to do it, say physically.

523
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,800
Now we will never give up the distinction between these two people.

524
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:12,800
Now ever much we find out about the brain, whatever we find out, all the things that

525
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:19,400
you know that these current, you know, is it Libet, how do you pronounce his name?

526
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,480
Libet, Libet, others have done.

527
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,400
Let's see, they're all right, right?

528
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,360
All of its neuroscience establishes this.

529
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,920
Will we ever give up the distinction between X and Y?

530
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,320
I think that's an empirical question, right?

531
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,240
That's something so empirical in the sense that...

532
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,640
No, I'm suggesting we ought not to give up the distinction.

533
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,800
So I'm denying it's an empirical question.

534
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,040
I'm saying it's a normative question.

535
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,000
We should never, we should not give up.

536
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,480
We should say somebody was forced to do it, should be treated differently from somebody

537
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,280
who did it.

538
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,280
So now...

539
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,720
So just for the right, I do agree with you.

540
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,200
I also share that belief that we ought not abandon that distinction.

541
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:12,200
But when I say that it's empirical, say for simplicity sake, there's two halves of the

542
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,200
population.

543
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,960
One half the population believes that we should remove that distinction.

544
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,280
You know they have things that we ought not.

545
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,640
And then there's changes in the environment.

546
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,040
There's grand scale forces in the environment that change whether it's societal level or

547
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,240
why not.

548
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:36,680
So holding one belief or the other is beneficial to the species.

549
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:43,160
Then it'll be determined at that point in time which basically wins out.

550
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,840
So it's kind of a very abstract idea of whether or not we should maintain this distinction

551
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,840
about responsibility for actions.

552
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:57,360
But if it's not a useful idea that promotes the genes that we carry, then I would say

553
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,240
that it's empirical in that sense that evolutionary forces can kind of going forward.

554
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,920
Time will determine that for us.

555
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:13,640
Now, I do agree with you that we ought not lose that distinction.

556
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,360
And I think part of that is it's come from our past that there might have been a period

557
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,520
in time where we couldn't make that distinction.

558
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,520
Right?

559
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,360
And in this case, in the course of so we're not really clear who's actually the cause

560
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,680
of the sort of agent, whether it's a person or the person that's been manipulated.

561
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,080
And we struggle with assigning that.

562
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:39,760
First of all, when you say species, you mean the human species?

563
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:49,880
So what about all the part of us that is very similar in terms of behavior to animals?

564
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,280
What do you say to that?

565
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:59,400
And are you saying that free will is a property of being part of the human species?

566
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,280
Only in the sense that humans care about it.

567
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,840
It's a belief or it's an idea that humans discuss and debate over.

568
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,840
There's actually...

569
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,240
From what I killed said becomes more immoral.

570
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,920
What you said has a moral connotation.

571
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,000
That's also something that the human species uniquely cares about.

572
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,920
So these are ideas that are very important to us.

573
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,000
And they're probably important to us who are a very good reason.

574
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,240
And there's a reason that we don't want to let go of them.

575
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,160
Because when we do the structure of our society would likely fall apart.

576
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,440
It would just be very different.

577
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,600
We wouldn't be human anymore.

578
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,560
It's part of how we identify ourselves as being human.

579
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,200
I think what Simon said, you would not...

580
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:45,120
Your proposal, your proposition doesn't only be humans.

581
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,760
Well, we're talking... yes.

582
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:56,120
So we're talking about determinism and then we have to talk about free will.

583
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:02,880
Now my own feeling is that compatibilism really doesn't make a lot of sense.

584
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:09,920
That if things are determinant, totally, and that applies to the... exactly to the situation

585
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:17,040
where it's no different than being coerced from the outside, is that everything is determined,

586
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,840
you can't make that distinction between the two cases that you talked about.

587
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,560
So I really think that question is so...

588
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:34,720
Let me make a point here about...

589
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:41,360
Is it really possible to get rid of determinism in an absolute way?

590
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:50,680
See, these theorems that I was talking about, they're saying that a classical theory, which

591
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:59,520
is deterministic, that doesn't hold water anymore because of, say, these experiments,

592
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:08,040
those 40 experiments, but usually a classical theory is not simply telling...

593
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,120
A scientific theory is not history.

594
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,520
It tells you...

595
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:20,320
It gives you general laws and tells you whatever the state is, it'll tell you what happens

596
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:25,960
afterwards and if it's classical, it'll tell you in a deterministic theory.

597
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:33,960
If I lift this up, say, 9 feet, it doesn't know that if I...

598
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,600
It should take three-quarters of second to fall.

599
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:45,320
That's not magic, it just follows a well-known law that if you remember your high school

600
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:55,680
physics, it's that the height, the S, is equal to 16 T squared in feet and seconds.

601
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:02,840
And if I put in for the height of 9 feet, then I get 9 over 16 and it's...

602
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,920
You take it and I get 3 over 4.

603
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,200
Now, to know that it's...

604
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,920
Interesting, perhaps, but that's not what scientific theories are about.

605
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:20,800
I also want to know if I lift it up 16 feet, then it's going to take a full second by using

606
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,800
the...

607
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,560
And how that works on the different conditions that tells me this.

608
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:34,680
And this theorem I was talking about, that classical physics doesn't work, is of this

609
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,360
type.

610
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:43,800
You have to know that no matter what possibility, suppose somebody says, yes, well, I'll tell

611
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,800
you...

612
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,560
Well, in one of these 40...

613
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:55,080
A particular one of these 40 experiments and I'll be right, perhaps.

614
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,440
But I said, no, you have to tell me this in all of these.

615
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:06,600
Now, that's what physics is supposed to predict different things.

616
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:16,880
But suppose somebody says, I'm not interested in scientific theories, I believe in a being

617
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,880
who's prescient.

618
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,800
It doesn't have to be omnipotent, but he has to be present.

619
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,000
He has to tell you what happens in the future.

620
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,360
And I say, well, this experiment says you won't be able to predict.

621
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,920
He says, no, this being doesn't have to predict everything.

622
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,240
He'll tell you that you have to do this thing in particular, this experiment.

623
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,360
In that experiment, I'll tell you what it is.

624
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:55,640
So you see, this theorem doesn't act against a prescient being who tells you what the actual

625
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,160
trajectory of the world is.

626
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,080
Scientific theories don't tell you the actual trajectory.

627
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:07,640
They tell you the possible trajectory starting from any particular state.

628
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,480
And that's very different.

629
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:19,480
So this theorem that I was talking about can't argue directly against this kind of prescience.

630
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:25,600
In order to do that, I would have to put in a little bit of my own free will, namely,

631
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:31,640
these 40 experiments correspond to one of 40 buttons I pick.

632
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:38,920
You have to give me the free will to press one of these 40 buttons.

633
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,320
So some electromagnet changes in direction.

634
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:50,920
And then with that, even a prescient person cannot predict all the 40.

635
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,120
All he got into a mathematical contradiction.

636
00:57:54,120 --> 00:58:02,440
See, there is no absolute proof that that determinism doesn't work.

637
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:07,480
Let me give you a more homely example.

638
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,200
You know, when I was young, I was growing up in England.

639
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,160
I loved movies.

640
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,320
And I went to once each week.

641
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,640
And one day I saw a movie I really liked, Casablanca.

642
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,640
I think you all know the movie.

643
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:34,440
And at the movie, Rick, Humphrey Bogart, has two letters of transit, forgetting out of Casablanca

644
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,320
to the free world.

645
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:42,880
And there are three people there, Ingrid Bergman, the love of his life and her husband, who's

646
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,520
a freedom fighter.

647
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:51,240
The question that Humphrey Bogart has to make answers, which one of the two is he going

648
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,160
to give the transit of?

649
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,720
So I mean, I didn't know which one he was going to choose.

650
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,680
It really was a question.

651
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,080
And of course, we know he does the noble thing.

652
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:06,160
I'm not giving anything away at this point, I think.

653
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,840
And he allows the Ingrid Bergman and the husband to leave.

654
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:16,520
He joins the Free French with Claude Rains, the Vichy police captain, where they now join

655
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,200
the Free French at the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

656
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,640
So that's the story.

657
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:28,680
By the way, afterwards, it really was a free world decision because the script writers

658
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:34,760
had couldn't decide which way to end and then finally decided on this.

659
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,400
But I want to say is this, I liked the movie so much.

660
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,120
I went to see it next week with a friend of mine.

661
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,600
He had never seen it.

662
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,200
And he had the same thing.

663
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:49,080
Humphrey Bogart has a free world decision, right?

664
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,800
He didn't have a free world decision.

665
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,760
This was the second show.

666
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,760
Right?

667
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,080
So he couldn't, he had to make that.

668
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,400
Now my point is this.

669
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,920
You know, here's the universe.

670
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:09,400
And you know, there's a famous mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study.

671
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:16,440
And aside from his work in logic, he was a privateer also, he was a friend of Einstein.

672
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:25,360
And in his usual quirky way, he found a solution to the relativistic equations, which is a

673
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:31,440
cycle that is to say the universe completely repeats itself.

674
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,760
Now that's a possibility then.

675
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,960
So here's the universe.

676
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,800
Maybe there is free will and maybe not.

677
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:43,240
But in the second showing, there cannot be any free will, right?

678
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:51,040
So this sort of logical possibility shows you cannot get away with proving that, you

679
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:57,800
know, you cannot get away from proving that determinism, you know, that determinism can't

680
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,800
work.

681
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:04,600
It shows that, you know, that in the second showing, everything is totally determined

682
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:09,000
because it happened the same way as this just like in the movie.

683
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Right?

684
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:18,400
So you have to get, there is no, it's a little like, it's solipsism.

685
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:25,040
There is no absolute logical proof that says that you want just a figment of my imagination.

686
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,640
You know, you've tried to surprise me and this and that.

687
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:34,480
And of course you happen and we know there is such a model because when I go to bed at

688
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:41,160
night, I dream and these people are figments of my imagination.

689
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,200
Do surprise me and so on.

690
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:50,600
So it is a fact that it could be the solipsism is a logical, it's ridiculous, but it's a

691
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,680
logical possibility.

692
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:56,960
And determinism is exactly the same thing by the second showing.

693
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,320
In my opinion, ridiculous.

694
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:05,440
If you ask a child of four or five whether they have free will and I've tried this and

695
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,320
they say, well, of course I have free will.

696
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:15,840
You have to be sophisticated and talk about things like determinism either from a religious

697
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:22,680
or scientific point of view to start believing that that we aren't all robots and everything

698
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,480
is determined.

699
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:33,360
So my point is that there is no absolute proof of either the determinism doesn't work or

700
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,520
that solipsism for that matter doesn't work.

701
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,080
We have to show free will and that's the same thing with free will.

702
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:48,600
So actually I tied in a little bit with what I said earlier that I like to think of free

703
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:53,400
will as something that's not falsifiable in a scientific way.

704
01:02:53,400 --> 01:03:00,800
Therefore there's a sense in which it's more of an axiom than my point is the opposite.

705
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:06,760
You have there is no way of establishing free will absolutely.

706
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,000
Oh, I agree with that.

707
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,560
And like in this theorem we have a little bit of free will of pressing one of these 40 buttons

708
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,840
then I can say that the whole world is spontaneous.

709
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:24,440
You know that actions of particles are spontaneous in this sense given this theorem in quantum

710
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,440
mechanics.

711
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,200
But you have to, there's no absolute proof.

712
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:34,160
You have to put in a little, you know if somebody says look you're assuming free will to prove

713
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,160
it.

714
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,600
Well I can say look you know it's like the fisherman he puts in a minnow and catches

715
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,000
a trout and some.

716
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,520
There I saw you put the fish in what have you done.

717
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:50,480
You have to assume a little bit of free will and then the whole world becomes an arena for

718
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,080
free will or even of particles.

719
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:58,680
But you know it has to become simply an axiom the free will exists because there's no way

720
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,600
of proving it absolutely.

721
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:08,240
I mean may I go back to what Ken said before.

722
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:15,480
The issue of survival of species and you kind of made it look pretty easy.

723
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:22,280
I mean you know we do serve our survival but we don't.

724
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:28,480
What if we are addicted and we know the kind of the kind of the brain chemistry of addiction

725
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,200
is an interesting thing.

726
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:36,880
What if we are addicted through our whatever what happens in our brain if we like something

727
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,280
that actually destroys us.

728
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:46,080
So isn't that a step forward in the debate on free will or not.

729
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:53,600
I mean you know the kind of we are you know we the way we live is that really conducive

730
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,960
to survival.

731
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:02,560
I mean in economy in well in ecology in all in politics in all respects.

732
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:09,280
I mean so are we and then you know here's again where the theology comes in because you

733
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:14,720
know these people and I'm just realizing it while listening to our debate here.

734
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:21,240
These people have been kind of brutally realistic saying you know we have the bondage of free

735
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,240
will.

736
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:26,360
I mean this was one of the big terms in the 16th century.

737
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,720
The bondage of free will versus free will.

738
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:33,320
So that is a rasmas of Rotterdam versus Martin Luther.

739
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:38,840
So they kind of Luther says that is not such a thing as free will.

740
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:46,600
Only theoretically but practically we are kind of we are in in prison in cause by things

741
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,720
we can't control really.

742
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,120
And that is what I would call really a translation.

743
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:58,280
We are addicted to doing exactly what destroys us.

744
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,280
So how do we deal with that?

745
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:04,680
Yes so so you know addiction from a medical sense versus for the way you're describing

746
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,360
I think there's a good analogy there but but it is a very different thing we were talking

747
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,360
about addiction of course.

748
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,760
But there are certain ideas that we are compelled to.

749
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:21,240
So so if we all held the exact same idea and it was the wrong idea that would be detrimental

750
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:26,640
to our species right whether it was an idea or a behavior or something they were expressing.

751
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:31,240
But the wonderful thing about any species is its diversity.

752
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:36,760
And that's really what protects a species for future events.

753
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:43,560
And so our biology sets us up for us and that's not just expressed in our tall we are a hair

754
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:48,680
color or all these other features but it also expresses itself in our brain structure which

755
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:52,480
gives rise to our beliefs and our behaviors.

756
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,280
Having that diversity is really important for any species.

757
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:03,320
And so having this debate and having ideas kind of develop is probably the thing we want

758
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,320
to do.

759
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:09,000
We don't want to actually settle on the wrong answer for sure.

760
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,640
Since we don't know where we are going to find something future.

761
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:16,080
But addiction to fossil fuel may have a gene.

762
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:19,240
It may.

763
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:31,200
But you know what I think is when I was saying that it may be a norm, a moral norm that we

764
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:39,040
don't cease to see ourselves as agents with freedom even in the face, even if determinism

765
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:44,520
were established and neuroscience.

766
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:49,240
I was really giving a secular version of many of the things you were saying when you talked

767
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,880
about good and evil and so on.

768
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:58,800
So I mean that is certainly how a lot of people think of it in theological terms.

769
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:05,800
But you can also just think of it in secular terms and talk of just normative and moral

770
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,800
and so on.

771
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:16,240
We are both saying the same things in dramatically different idioms.

772
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:22,520
But you know that suggests and I think you want to say too partly when you say it's just

773
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,520
an axiom.

774
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:29,120
It's not the sort of thing that you will allow to be refuted by this thing.

775
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:37,400
And I'm suggesting that the disallowing is a normative stance, a moral stance.

776
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:41,200
So there seems to be some convergence on this and even you agree.

777
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:45,160
You talk of it in terms of usefulness which I've some quam about.

778
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:48,880
But that's a matter of detail.

779
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:58,120
So here's a question which I want to bring in on this.

780
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:07,480
The kinds of things you were talking about discusses free will at a level of abstraction

781
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:15,240
that is what has been surfing here is that it's a normative notion as well.

782
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:22,640
So maybe we should just say it's an ambiguous notion.

783
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,400
Free will is just an ambiguous notion.

784
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:31,800
So let's say freedom which is studied as a purely metaphysical thing in terms of scientific

785
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:36,040
laws, what interpretation we give to them and so on.

786
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:41,440
That's freedom in its purest most metaphysic.

787
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:48,600
Let's give another name to what has emerged as freedom as a normative stance.

788
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:53,160
Let's call it freedom.

789
01:09:53,160 --> 01:10:00,280
And it's that freedom is the notion that everybody's always been interested in.

790
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,280
With everybody.

791
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,080
Has always been interested in.

792
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,640
So I would call it choice behavior.

793
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,080
I mean I think that's when we talk about free will.

794
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,080
I don't care.

795
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,080
Call it X.

796
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,080
Call it X.

797
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,960
It doesn't call it anything you like.

798
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,200
The point is it's just two different notions.

799
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:26,440
So my hesitation to freedom versus free will is that first of all freedom I wouldn't know

800
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:33,240
where to start with to go looking for what to observe, what to measure there or how to

801
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,600
even think about that.

802
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:40,920
With free will it has only because we all know that phrase.

803
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:47,480
But if a simplistic point you know the word free has six or seven definitions.

804
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,680
The word will has a dozen.

805
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,680
You multiply those together.

806
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:54,560
I mean you're getting a whole variety of things that it could possibly mean.

807
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:00,800
So it is absolutely ambiguous and whether it's an axiom or I think I would actually put as

808
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,880
a belief.

809
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:09,760
It's not as useful to me for what I want to do with whatever it is that we're talking

810
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,800
about to do anything with.

811
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,720
What I find interesting is that when we talk about free will we're not talking about the

812
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:23,000
behavior of other organisms except for when the conversation kind of diverges.

813
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,200
We're talking about people.

814
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:31,240
We're talking about human behavior and how do we make judgments over that behavior?

815
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,840
How do we use it?

816
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:43,120
Do it perhaps freedom might be something useful to go in a direction and define it specifically.

817
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:48,840
But I think whatever that is it was for me it was back down to how do humans behave or

818
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,600
do those choices come from.

819
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:55,880
Okay but do we have a concession from neuroscientists?

820
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,680
That's what you are right.

821
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:06,960
So do we have a concession from neuroscientists that all the delivery research on freedom makes

822
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,240
no difference to freedom?

823
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,600
I'm not sure what freedom is.

824
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,760
If I'm going to commit to something I would want to know.

825
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,760
You know what freedom is.

826
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,640
I got the notion from your remarks about usefulness and so on with some modifications.

827
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,280
I study human choice behavior.

828
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:30,840
But you talked about the usefulness of a certain concept which we don't.

829
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,320
So I'm talking about the concept or the idea.

830
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,040
So I'm talking about what you're talking about.

831
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,640
So you know what I'm talking about.

832
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,800
I guess so.

833
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,200
Let's go with it.

834
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:48,680
So do we have a concession from somebody who researches a neuroscientist that whatever

835
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:55,680
the deliverances of your research are they leave completely untouched.

836
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:59,880
This other thing call it whatever you like but you know about it because you raised this

837
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,560
concept.

838
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:03,560
You named it.

839
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:09,440
And I would not conceive as far as the way I'm understanding what you're saying.

840
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,800
Neuroscience research and trying to understand how the brain works and how it gives rise

841
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,640
to human behavior does a lot of things on which we could observe.

842
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:21,240
And a lot of the behaviors we observe in humans are expressions of the beliefs that we carry

843
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,840
with us.

844
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:28,040
So I'm trying to gather what you might mean by freedom or some other concept whether it's

845
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:31,040
free will or something else.

846
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:37,080
And in the spaces where we can agree and do something productive as two agents.

847
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:44,680
But when we're talking about beliefs whatever kind of belief that might be.

848
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:50,800
That is an area that's not as well explored in neuroscience as a visual system or how

849
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,760
we smell things in the world.

850
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,760
But it's a real thing.

851
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,760
And it's a big problem in the medical industry with a placebo effect.

852
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,360
Where simply the idea can actually have an impact on your nervous system and it's not

853
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:09,160
just compliant behavior but you actually see physiological changes due to the suggestion

854
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,920
that this pill is going to help you.

855
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,040
So the impact that beliefs have on human nervous systems is very real.

856
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:20,240
It's something that we don't understand completely but it's something that should be researched

857
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,240
more.

858
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,240
No, no, so can it change any?

859
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:26,160
So just to try to bring it to things together.

860
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:32,760
Do you agree that as neuroscience improves its methods, its measurement techniques and

861
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:40,840
so forth that there will always be a irreducible degree of unpredictability of human behavior

862
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,680
or that it's purely a matter of measurement.

863
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:49,600
If there is an irreducible level of unpredictability, we can call that trithm.

864
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:55,520
The fact that even given all the addictions, even given all the neurological conditions

865
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,080
that people have, even given all the beliefs as you wanted to find them.

866
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:10,640
A choice in humans which is inherent to that human for one reason or another and I'm not

867
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,120
going to go into quantum mechanics at this point.

868
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:19,080
There's an irreducible level of prediction that we can agree to call that whatever you

869
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,080
want to call it.

870
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:27,680
But it seems to me that what we're entering here with this is the intractable mind-brought

871
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,800
theory problem in general.

872
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:36,440
This is a sort of special case having to do with beliefs and free will and so on.

873
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:44,680
The question is what is the neurology, neuroscience, to do with the brain?

874
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:50,320
How does that connect up with the mind?

875
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:59,160
My own feeling at the moment is that it's got interesting things to say but it does not

876
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:02,000
cross that chasm.

877
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,080
I don't know how that chasm can ever be crossed.

878
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:11,880
I've read many books by both philosophers and neuroscientists.

879
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:22,880
There's always a big gap that happens at the level of neurons and what happens, it does

880
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,440
not cross into the mind.

881
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,760
That's a separate issue.

882
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:32,360
I don't know if it can ever be crossed but it seems to me the free will and the question

883
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:37,880
of what happens in neurobiology is a special case.

884
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:41,920
I should have the frustration.

885
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:48,120
A lot of neuroscientists will say that the mind is just the brain in whatever it does.

886
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:52,720
That is stated with a lot of faith.

887
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,840
It's not clear that that's actually been demonstrated.

888
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:00,640
What we know is that when I do things to brain tissue that I can change the expression of

889
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,440
behavior, which is our proxy for mind.

890
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:13,440
It's one thing to say that what happens in the brain is a determinant for what happens

891
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,160
in the mind.

892
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:21,440
We don't actually know a great way of mental behavior other than the things that we could

893
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:27,720
measure which would be the brain activity of behavior.

894
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,760
I believe that to a large extent.

895
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:41,120
That's why I believe the relevance of quantum mechanics and the fact that there is indeterminism

896
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:49,560
in the material world outside of the brain, outside of humans, that in fact something

897
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:56,560
is going on in the brain which makes use of that freedom of particles.

898
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,280
We know very little about what happens.

899
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:04,880
A lot of people who work in neurobiology says, well, quantum mechanics doesn't play

900
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,200
a role in this.

901
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:13,120
It doesn't probably at this level that is being seen.

902
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,200
Evolution is very opportunistic.

903
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:21,440
It seems to me very likely that in the end what's happening in the brain at the level

904
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:30,120
of molecules does not use all kinds of purely quantum tunneling and this kind of correlations

905
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,320
that happen in quantum mechanics.

906
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:37,680
There are purely quantum mechanical that there's not being used at the molecular level.

907
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,760
I believe that's what's going on.

908
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,760
That's what happened.

909
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,400
That's not been investigated yet.

910
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:48,320
Well, simply because it's very hard to investigate what happens at that level in quantum mechanics,

911
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:53,200
and when it's set up in special experiments, it's very hard to deal with it, although there

912
01:18:53,200 --> 01:19:00,200
are many interesting experiments going on at the level of single particles.

913
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,680
But in the brain it's much, much harder, of course.

914
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:10,760
I believe that in the end it will be shown that there are critical effects to play an

915
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:15,120
important role in what's going on in the brain.

916
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:24,720
I think in the end that the free will that we feel it will be connected up with this

917
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:32,440
kind of spontaneity that happens in the particles because I do believe that the arguments made

918
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:37,280
by people like humans don't hold much water.

919
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,600
I think he's talking, by the way, about free action.

920
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:47,760
He talks about if action is not coerced from the outside and I do what I want, then this

921
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,240
is you, then I'm now half free will.

922
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:56,040
I think that just simply begs the question.

923
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:02,120
It could be that I don't have free will anyway because everything is determined, but it just

924
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:06,040
happens to be that he was talking about classical mechanics.

925
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:10,000
If you talk about quantum mechanics, the whole question doesn't arise anyway.

926
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,240
So if I understand what you're saying, you're making a case for something like a random

927
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,120
number generator at the moment.

928
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,520
That's another point.

929
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:29,520
You see, the incompatibleists say, I agree with what I was saying here, that compatibleism

930
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,360
is in fact doesn't agree with free will.

931
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,720
So they bring in random choice or random things.

932
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:43,120
Then the compatibilists say, well, you know better often than we are.

933
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:48,040
If part of your choice is that you throw a coin and your choice is based on whether

934
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:51,920
it's heads or tails, how have you gotten away?

935
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,840
How's that free will?

936
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,240
So random choice doesn't help.

937
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:59,160
There's a subtle point here.

938
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:04,280
What happens in quantum mechanics is not random choice.

939
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:10,200
If I do a single act, look at the decay of a single particle, it will decay at a certain

940
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,160
time, and that happens at a purely random time.

941
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,600
That's true.

942
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:20,400
But what happens in quantum mechanics is if you have several, say two particles that become

943
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:27,840
entangled or correlated in a quantum mechanical way, then what they do together is far from

944
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,840
random.

945
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:33,480
What happens here, actually in the case, what's called the Einstein Podolsky, Rosen

946
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:38,680
experiment, the EPI experiment, what happens actually determines what happens in the other

947
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,680
one.

948
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:44,440
And you get effects that are very, very different from random choice.

949
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:50,680
And it's these correlations which can happen over distances that I think play in a major

950
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:58,760
will end up playing a major role in understanding how the brain works, and in particular how

951
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:01,400
free will can occur in the brain.

952
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:10,520
It's not random, that's a classical notion, which is sort of, you know, it's supplying

953
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:18,240
something much more radical in quantum mechanics that is a relatively random choice, but it's

954
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:22,440
a kind of correlated choice that happens that's much more complicated.

955
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,400
Can I just jump in on that?

956
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:31,720
I just want to understand what you are saying, because I have the impression that for me

957
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,960
it's something like music, what you are saying.

958
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:40,760
I mean, and I don't fully understand it, but I have a sense that this matters and that

959
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:47,080
is translatable into some kind of theologians have been discussing in a completely different

960
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,360
language.

961
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:54,480
And it would be very helpful if we could make these languages compatible in order to understand

962
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,880
what we are each talking about.

963
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:05,600
And what I hear you saying about spontaneity, something about leaps that are not random,

964
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,600
but still leaps.

965
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:13,600
I mean, so something, so in theology the kind of vocabulary for that is something new is

966
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,800
happening.

967
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:21,360
You know, that is not random, but it is something things are coming together, and it is no longer

968
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:26,320
the question whether I go to Macy's and I choose a black dress or a blue dress.

969
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:32,240
I mean, this is not this kind of free-built thing, but it is something can I go beyond

970
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:38,600
the or, you know, in which I am trapped, I mean, I don't use this or that, but it doesn't

971
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:44,560
make a difference, or it makes a difference, but it is not the difference that I would

972
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:50,760
say is the theological difference, the difference between life and death, survival or not survival.

973
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:58,280
I mean, you know, kind of going out of this bondage of choosing things that are destructive

974
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:06,000
and finding a way to live that is no longer self-destructive, for example, self-destructive.

975
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:13,400
By kind of things coming together, happening in a way I don't know where, sub-atomic or

976
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:18,120
whatever you, how you call that or in the brain, the neurons or whatever.

977
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:23,000
So the, I mean, this is what theologians have been discussing, is there, and they have talked

978
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,240
about spirit in that.

979
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:33,560
The spirit transforms the ways we act and they transform the whole experiment.

980
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:40,240
It is a different, it is moved in a different space on a different, and there all of a sudden

981
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:43,280
we see things happen before.

982
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:49,400
And it is not random, it is not, it's still in this kind of oral shape, but it is something

983
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,000
that maybe we didn't expect.

984
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:02,560
Let me bring up something you said in this action, and with your two cases, one of which

985
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,720
is coerced and the other one isn't.

986
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,480
You're mentioning addiction.

987
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:15,520
As you look at a person who is really addicted to heroin or cigarettes, and he really can't

988
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,280
get around that.

989
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:26,000
Now if you say, I want a cigarette, I want to smoke a cigarette, and I smoke it, the

990
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,120
human would say, okay, you're using your free will.

991
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:34,280
But if I'm really a, I may not want what I want, right?

992
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,480
Yes, but I can't get around it.

993
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:40,080
I'm coerced in that sense internally.

994
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:48,760
And this is by the way, this argument that determinism cannot be compatible with free

995
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:49,920
will.

996
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:56,400
Because if determinants happen inside, simply because I wanted, I'm being forced to want

997
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,680
it, just like an addict.

998
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:05,840
So this idea of addiction sort of makes no one, I think, in this room would say that

999
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:12,760
somebody who's addicted to heroin and thus bad things is at the same level as somebody

1000
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,240
who's not.

1001
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,240
And that's a big distinction.

1002
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,600
We all feel there's a moral distinction there.

1003
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,440
Right.

1004
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:31,800
And I think this idea then is, you know, we all agree on this, and how it plays out from

1005
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:36,080
the idea of general physical theories is a very difficult question.

1006
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:44,440
As I said, there are no very good, current experiments that bring into the brain this

1007
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,120
idea of spontaneous action of particles.

1008
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:55,720
By the way, that's a very old idea I mentioned, Epicurus actually brought in 2300 years ago

1009
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,880
the very, this very idea.

1010
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:04,120
He said, look, you know, there was this idea of democracy, said everything is atoms, and

1011
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:09,200
things just fall into the void if they're heavy or go up into the heavens.

1012
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:14,880
He says, first of all, there are actions going on if you do this, but also he won't

1013
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,320
get free will.

1014
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:25,760
So he posited tiny little, what do you click, you know, kilomens, is that what's called

1015
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,240
now swerves.

1016
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:32,600
And some of you may have read the Greenblatt's book called the Swerve.

1017
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:37,720
It's about, you know, the cretious book on Epicurus.

1018
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:46,680
And he introduced a sort of spontaneous action of the examples to interact, but also so that

1019
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:49,200
the re-will can exist.

1020
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:54,960
Because he didn't believe what these Chrysopus and the Stoics believed that you can have

1021
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,080
free will if everything is determined.

1022
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:04,280
So this I want my ideas really goes back to the Greeks of 2300 years ago.

1023
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:10,160
So I guess I'm curious where you get where this goes from spontaneous action and molecules

1024
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:14,560
because there is some evidence actually in the brain that there is a lot of spontaneous

1025
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:15,560
activity.

1026
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:20,560
And you could take tissue preparation to see the spontaneous activity.

1027
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,120
Now whether that's tied to something we don't understand yet or if it is some kind of spontaneous

1028
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:28,120
action that's a whole other area of research and it's ongoing.

1029
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:34,560
I don't think, I don't know, people have talked about that there are articles saying

1030
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:42,200
quantum mechanical effects already existed at the level of animals and they give examples

1031
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,720
with bird flight and various other things.

1032
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:48,520
I'm not convinced that doesn't sound.

1033
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,280
The experiments are not that.

1034
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:53,240
I mean are retina sensitive and have to detect a single photon.

1035
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:57,120
Single photons are detected by the retina and go to detect them.

1036
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:04,440
So it's clear that single particles like photons have an effect on the brain.

1037
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,480
We essentially see one or two or three photons.

1038
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:13,080
The thing that stunned me is that you could set things up so that a single photon could

1039
01:29:13,080 --> 01:28:57,180
cause a per-

1040
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:16,540
Right?

1041
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:21,120
You set them up, you get the experimental controlled and you give them the instruction.

1042
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:25,400
When you see a photon get up and run a marathon and if they're willing participant that will

1043
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,400
trigger it and they'll go.

1044
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:32,800
That's a whole lot of activity that is spontated by a single photon.

1045
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:39,960
It's kind of, but there are certainly other effects in the brain that are likely taking

1046
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:40,960
on these effects.

1047
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:46,800
So I'm curious, I guess where do you get from the spontaneous action to kind of a freedom

1048
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,800
in choice?

1049
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:52,000
Because when we talk about free choice the question is about who is in control, right?

1050
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,360
Is it me, the agent that's in control or is it a control external to me?

1051
01:29:56,360 --> 01:30:03,480
You mustn't think of this, that a single particle in the brain, this spontaneity of

1052
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:09,600
a single particle, I don't see that as translated into our free will.

1053
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:19,720
It's a whole unknown network which is partly spontaneous, partly regulated by the network

1054
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:23,040
itself that somehow gets translated.

1055
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,960
I'm not saying I have any theory at all about it.

1056
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:34,280
I just have the hope and even the expectation that nature works, evolution works in such

1057
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:35,360
an opportunity.

1058
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:40,840
I can't believe that it doesn't make use of these quantum mechanical effects.

1059
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,480
I would share your disbelief.

1060
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,480
I'm absolutely nature's.

1061
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:45,160
I'd like you to get into these.

1062
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:52,360
Is there any reason to expect that the kinds of non-random forms of spontaneity that you

1063
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,360
feel is established within?

1064
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,360
I call it random.

1065
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,960
It's a non-random.

1066
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:57,960
It's non-random.

1067
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:02,760
It's a realistic thing, but these correlations are not random.

1068
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:03,760
That's what I say.

1069
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,760
Oh, sorry, non-random.

1070
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:14,220
So the question is, is there any reason to believe that what you, let's say rightly

1071
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:23,880
claim that there's non-random forms of spontaneity that counter the deterministic aspect, that

1072
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:32,520
those things will coincide with the things that in understanding the free will we talk

1073
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:36,360
about such as intentions to pick up this thing.

1074
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:43,800
I mean, it just seems to me there's absolutely, we have no framework by which to say this

1075
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:52,240
non-random spontaneity that's established in case by case translate into the intention

1076
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:56,680
that with which I drank this, which constitutes my freedom, the intention with which he picked

1077
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:03,160
up the microphone, which we have no framework to say that these two things will coincide.

1078
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,560
No, coincide.

1079
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:13,880
But there are experiments in which single molecules, I suppose, that you recognize your

1080
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:14,880
grandmother.

1081
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,120
You know, what's sometimes called the grandmother cell.

1082
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,840
Single cells, I should say, not particles.

1083
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,960
Single cells may have such effects.

1084
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:33,400
So the fact that, you see, there are some correlations of this type between what happens

1085
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:39,280
in neurobiology and what happens at the level of mind that you're talking about.

1086
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,840
Whether free will will be one of them, I don't know.

1087
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:47,320
I'd have, that's only a hope and pay maybe, you know, an expectation, but that's all

1088
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,320
it is.

1089
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:55,600
There are some sort of more simple things in your bio correlate.

1090
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:02,160
Because if you take Liebe's experiments, you know, these RPs, which are detected by

1091
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:09,240
the EEG and so on, are speaking directly what's measuring what's going on when somebody's

1092
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:13,840
flexing, you know, contracting a muscle to raise the wrist and so on and so forth.

1093
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:19,760
But there's a, immediately, I mean, the observations of the evidence are immediately linked to things

1094
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:24,640
which have to do with the intention that's involved when I flex my wrist, et cetera.

1095
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:30,160
But you are talking at a level of abstraction and distance from this when you talk about,

1096
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:36,040
you know, the non-random, sort of spontaneity that is then, I'd be have no framework by

1097
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,000
which to bring these two things together.

1098
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,080
So maybe there's something here.

1099
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:49,040
So one thing that humans are really good at are telling stories but also filling in details,

1100
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,040
right?

1101
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:56,040
So I can imagine that there might be some kind of spontaneous action that gives rise

1102
01:33:56,040 --> 01:34:01,920
to behavior that's unpredictable even for the agent themselves or for others.

1103
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,120
But then it's filled in with, well, why did I do that?

1104
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:09,840
Well, and then you kind of fill in these confidedly the stories from the agent's perspective.

1105
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:14,480
But if you don't have a framework which connects them, it sounds like pure fantasy to me.

1106
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:19,520
You have to have a framework which says the spontaneity established at the quantum level,

1107
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:26,280
et cetera, are the sorts of things that are relevant to the intention to drink this or

1108
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,080
to pick up that mic and so on.

1109
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:36,320
Whereas, we have a framework by which to link what is delivered by Libe's experimental

1110
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:40,640
objects and things like flexing the wrist and so on.

1111
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,280
These things are just theoretically.

1112
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:44,880
There's a chasm between them.

1113
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,840
And you have to say, well, we can expect the two things will be brought together.

1114
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:53,920
If you don't have a framework to think, it sounds like a completely idle speculation.

1115
01:34:53,920 --> 01:35:02,000
But there are some not free will or more complex, but at least there are things in the mind,

1116
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:08,880
for instance, recognizing a person which are connected to single cells having certain

1117
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:09,880
things.

1118
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:14,120
I was hoping that another speaker would be, another discussant would be here.

1119
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:19,280
Peter say, I think there was talk of inviting him.

1120
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:25,040
He does experience, I don't know a lot of what he does, but I read an article at the

1121
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:31,320
level of the scientific American in which he does experiments in which certain decisions

1122
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:41,960
are connected up again to a single molecule, large molecule, an organic molecule, but activating

1123
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:46,880
the molecule is connected up to certain decisions.

1124
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:52,160
I'm not, this is far from anything like that.

1125
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:58,680
I think we'll continue to have these and many more experiments that I think made extraordinary

1126
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:03,200
progress in the understanding of the working of the brain and the human family.

1127
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:07,760
The question I think, the fundamental question is, what is it going to say about free will

1128
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:08,760
ultimately?

1129
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:13,400
And I think we're always, correct if I'm wrong, but I think from a point of view of

1130
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:20,080
theory of quantum theory, we're always going to hit an undecidability wall as it were regarding

1131
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:23,880
the true nature of human choice.

1132
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:24,880
Correct if I'm wrong.

1133
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,320
We're going to understand it a lot better, exactly.

1134
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:36,400
Remember, this spontaneity of, you can't explain, well, it satisfies these quantum

1135
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,200
mechanical rules.

1136
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:46,200
Why is a particle choose to go back in a famous Stern-Gail Act experiment that silver atoms

1137
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:52,640
sent through some kind of electromagnetic field and it's a size to go this way or this way?

1138
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,040
And that's the end of the story.

1139
01:36:55,040 --> 01:37:01,520
The choice it makes between this and that simply is left as part of the theory and there's

1140
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,800
no explanation.

1141
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:07,800
If you try to give an explanation of this, then you're back to classical physics and

1142
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:11,160
you run into this kind of contradiction.

1143
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:18,600
You just simply cannot explain, you're stuck with this spontaneity is like as it is with

1144
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,160
Epicurus.

1145
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:23,120
It's there and you have to accept it.

1146
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:27,000
The question is how do you connect that to free well?

1147
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I can't tell you.

1148
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,560
I mean, I don't know.

1149
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:33,520
I think we will go now to the audience for their questions.

1150
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:39,480
I want to be brief.

1151
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:49,960
Please questions in preference to comments.

1152
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:56,640
With all respect, I believe this discussion has confused the indeterminacy of the Heisenberg

1153
01:37:56,640 --> 01:38:04,600
uncertainty principle which governs subatomic particles with the nature of our behavior.

1154
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:13,120
I mean, our behavior is determined by the firing of neurons so that it is completely

1155
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,120
deterministic.

1156
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:17,560
No, it doesn't go at all.

1157
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:25,600
I mean, if a photon hits our retina and that may be a random event or a non-deterministic

1158
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:30,120
event, our subsequent behavior is still deterministic.

1159
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:33,920
I don't know how you come to that conclusion.

1160
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,280
The firing of neurons.

1161
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,280
So what?

1162
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:42,120
I mean, how do we don't know how there's a certain classical level at which they fire,

1163
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:50,520
but there's all kinds of things going on at the atomic level which we know that atomic

1164
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:55,720
interactions satisfy the rules of quantum mechanics.

1165
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,720
How this counts?

1166
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:57,720
How ever once?

1167
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:58,720
I don't know.

1168
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:05,240
However, once the neurons fire, our behavior is completely determined.

1169
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,640
We don't have control over that.

1170
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:14,840
So there's room in between a neuron within the brain firing in the actual expression

1171
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:15,840
of the behavior.

1172
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:22,080
So you could have folks who have had physical injuries that would actually block that communication

1173
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,800
reaching to the muscles.

1174
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:28,680
So just having neurons fired doesn't exactly mean that you're going to get the expression

1175
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:29,680
of some behavior absolutely.

1176
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,920
I mean, it's always going to be probabilistic.

1177
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:37,040
You might have that window defined so that it's extremely high probability, but all kinds

1178
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:41,600
of things could have been not just within the biological agent, but also the environment.

1179
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:47,840
So we're talking about making the connection between neural activity and some kind of behavior

1180
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,400
or choice and all things being equal.

1181
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,400
That's more.

1182
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:59,080
But we don't know exactly how the quantum effects within the molecules that make up

1183
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:00,080
the neurons.

1184
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,080
And that's just an open question.

1185
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:03,480
So I'll just end that.

1186
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:08,240
And the firing is at the end of the...

1187
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:11,720
Or once everything is fired, you can say the decision is made.

1188
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:14,080
Yes, but what about what happened until then?

1189
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,080
I mean, that could be...

1190
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:17,400
That's beyond our choice.

1191
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,080
That's beyond our choice.

1192
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,080
That's random.

1193
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,080
Or non-deterministic.

1194
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:23,080
It's life and non-choice choice.

1195
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:25,080
That doesn't follow.

1196
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:32,240
So some of the choices we make now will have a huge impact on where we end up five years

1197
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:33,240
from now.

1198
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:34,800
And so that's not just in our choices.

1199
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,560
That includes the kind of neural activity that might go on five years from now.

1200
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:44,960
So there is an idea in decision neuroscience of goal-directed behavior and goal-directed

1201
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:48,480
decision-making where we might have some goal put off in time.

1202
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:52,440
And so we can start to do things between now and then so that it's not immediate effect,

1203
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:58,440
but start to build support and structure so that we could achieve those goals, right?

1204
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,560
But how is that non-deterministic?

1205
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,400
I'm not saying it's not necessarily...

1206
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:06,360
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1207
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:15,520
The firing of the neurons in the brain, some in collective manner.

1208
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:19,960
That's what constitutes the decision itself.

1209
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:29,040
And the firing may itself have a spontaneous or free will...

1210
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:34,680
We don't know what causes this firing, that firing, how they come together in some complicated

1211
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:35,680
way.

1212
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:40,080
To say that because after the fire...

1213
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:45,600
There's no decision after they fire, yes, but we're talking about what happens until

1214
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:51,760
there's some collective firing of the neurons, leads, gives us the decision that we make.

1215
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:59,000
All of that, as a matter of neurobiology, may have a spontaneous element, which is what

1216
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,240
we call making the decision.

1217
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:04,240
Okay, thanks.

1218
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:11,840
Just going to sound like that, I'm picking up on the same as previous question, but it's

1219
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:12,840
different.

1220
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:24,000
I'd like to offer obviously, obviously, overly simplistic, but causal model that attempts

1221
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,880
to integrate some of the different things I've been talked about.

1222
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:33,520
So it starts at the quantum level with virtual particle pair creation.

1223
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:36,800
This is being a quantum phenomenon.

1224
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,280
It's a non-deterministic event.

1225
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:43,440
It's also the case that some of these virtual particles emerge and typically fall back to

1226
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:47,040
the vacuum state once they emerge.

1227
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:52,560
Sometimes they're energetic enough to remain in our level of physical reality, if you would

1228
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,960
allow that.

1229
01:42:54,960 --> 01:43:04,720
So if we couple this happening within neural tissue, and one of those newly created, non-deterministic

1230
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:13,080
and virtual particles then interacts with the intracellular neuronal environment in such

1231
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:19,240
a way that it contributes to the firing or not firing threshold of that neuron, then we

1232
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:27,760
have a potential example of the relationship between quantum non-determinism and neural

1233
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:28,760
particle.

1234
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:33,680
So then we take it the next step and to the research that you mentioned about the effect

1235
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:39,760
of partially magnetic fields, the neocortex generates a weak electromagnetic field, which

1236
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:49,400
may in fact have also an effect on the way in which the virtual particles enter or not

1237
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:54,800
acts on that may or not be about approaching firing threshold.

1238
01:43:54,800 --> 01:44:00,200
And it's also the case in terms of the molecule mentioned that we now know a great deal more

1239
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:07,680
than we knew even last year about the molecules that are recruited in the, say, memory formation

1240
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:14,680
process and the DSBs, the dual strand breakages and reconstitution that caused the formation

1241
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:15,780
of America.

1242
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:21,280
All of these events involve the recruitment of the effect of molecules that could be brought

1243
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:28,320
about by the activation of the virtual particle made real.

1244
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:32,120
That's my idea and I would like, first of course, your opinion.

1245
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:38,240
There are many quantum mechanical effects, including the virtual particles we have created

1246
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:43,840
and go back and forth and some that say, I mentioned another tunneling, there's another

1247
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,480
one.

1248
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:51,440
To me the question of quantum mechanical, what are called entanglement or correlations,

1249
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:52,440
play it probably.

1250
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:54,880
But all this is speculation.

1251
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,240
It's all speculation.

1252
01:44:56,240 --> 01:45:04,080
But it does, you know, it's worth speculating in this way, because without that, we're

1253
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:11,520
back to the compatibility question, which I think is now a relevant given quantum mechanics.

1254
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,520
Okay.

1255
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:15,520
Thank you very much.

1256
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:28,480
We're talking about the utility of belief in free will, regardless of whether it might

1257
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:31,480
be an illusion or not.

1258
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:36,360
Pew research in 2014 conducted a poll and they found that 54% of Americans deny that climate

1259
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:40,000
change is happening and that human beings are causing it.

1260
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,480
Now, let's take me as an example.

1261
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:48,080
Let's say I believe in free will and you're a scientist and you're telling me I am of

1262
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:54,840
my free will, I'm causing climate change that may cause, you know, catastrophic effects

1263
01:45:54,840 --> 01:46:00,160
to the entire world, to civilization, then wouldn't that free will believe, perhaps,

1264
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:07,280
contribute to my denying that climate change is happening in order to preserve my self-worth,

1265
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,280
myself identity?

1266
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:15,920
I can't even want to tackle this.

1267
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,520
So let me have it in.

1268
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:26,080
We've been ignoring the information about climate change and making decisions that are

1269
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:29,720
destroying the planet, let's say.

1270
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:40,120
And your question is, is this not an exercise or will for an exercise at free will?

1271
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:45,040
No, the question is if I believe in free will and scientists are telling me that I'm doing

1272
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:51,120
this, wouldn't I be much more likely to go into denial in order to not feel guilty and

1273
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:53,280
indict myself and other people?

1274
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:54,280
I see.

1275
01:46:54,280 --> 01:47:04,800
Well, this may be, you know, I mean, on this subject I feel that the causal links between

1276
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:17,080
our behavior, fossil fuel addicted behavior and the differences to the climate have not

1277
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:26,360
been established with the same spectacular public visibility as, for instance, the causal

1278
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:36,760
links between nuclear power and the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki establish.

1279
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:44,320
The reason why we all know about the nuclear possibilities of nuclear disaster is that

1280
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:52,480
the links, the causal links between our behavior and some disaster were completely, in fact,

1281
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:59,040
spectacularly established in the nuclear case, there's still a matter of arcane knowledges

1282
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,200
in the climate change case.

1283
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:05,000
And that's the real problem.

1284
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:11,760
We just have not got the causal links established for the public mind everywhere.

1285
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:18,760
And maybe we're doing this out of guilt and maybe there are people who are doing it willfully,

1286
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:23,920
but corporations are paying people to hide the facts and so on.

1287
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:29,680
But by and large I think the real thing is to get the information out in a way that it

1288
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:32,040
was out in the nuclear thing.

1289
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:36,720
Nobody denies that the knowledge is in the nuclear case.

1290
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:39,520
It's just different in the climate case.

1291
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:45,160
And it took Hiroshima and Nagasaki to establish that causal link.

1292
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:51,240
But I think that is a difference because the, I mean, changing our behavior with regard

1293
01:48:51,240 --> 01:49:02,920
to fossil usage and climate change and ecology requires us to kind of change, I mean, the

1294
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:04,320
things we like.

1295
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:05,720
It is the addiction issue.

1296
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:12,960
I mean, I like my cigarette and if I'm a drunk user, I need that and I don't want to

1297
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:13,960
change.

1298
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:18,600
So, you know, if they tell me this is going to happen, I mean, we see it is happening

1299
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:24,520
now, but you know, if it's still the powerful happen in 10 years, in 20 years.

1300
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:28,520
So why not cave in and just enjoy it?

1301
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:29,520
That's absolutely true.

1302
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,720
I agree with you.

1303
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:35,040
And I think what you mentioned of St. Paul actually goes back to this.

1304
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:40,360
This is, if you put it that way, this is no different from the fact that most of us know

1305
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:47,240
that if we fill our gut at every meal, we're going to die before we would if we didn't

1306
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:48,840
do so.

1307
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:51,840
And yet most of us do fill our gut.

1308
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:56,560
So it's, the climate change case is not different once you describe it that way.

1309
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:01,400
And in that sense, it's an irrationality of the kind that Paul and others mentioned,

1310
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:02,400
right?

1311
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,400
We know the better.

1312
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:04,400
We do the worse.

1313
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:08,880
And also, in some sense, a perversion of what used to be rational, right?

1314
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:12,880
So it used to be the case that we should fill our gut at every meal because our meals didn't

1315
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,120
come three times a day, right?

1316
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:17,560
And likewise, the addictions to cigarettes.

1317
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:22,800
I mean, these are experiments that I have participated with and looked at in the groups

1318
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,320
that I've worked with.

1319
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:28,560
Nicotine gets into your brain and it changes the chemistry fundamentally.

1320
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:34,480
And we have experiments, Terrell Rans and Reid Montague to my colleagues, Rann, that

1321
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:40,800
show that fundamental computations that are very important to how we learn new information.

1322
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:44,520
That representation in our brain is changed by these drugs of addiction.

1323
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:52,320
And there's new work coming along where we're looking at how beliefs could either insulate

1324
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,200
us from taking on new information or not, right?

1325
01:50:55,200 --> 01:51:00,160
And I think as far as with the climate change issue, people know what's important to them

1326
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:02,640
and their family.

1327
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:07,840
And that either insulates them from new information or allows them to bring it in.

1328
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:15,760
And I mean, if it's 50-50 split, it just gives you an idea of how the variety of beliefs

1329
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:20,960
that we have will have an impact on what comes next.

1330
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:27,360
It's a connection to free will, I think that it's not so clear to me.

1331
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:28,920
Okay, thank you.

1332
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:32,640
I just want to say thanks for having this discussion.

1333
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:35,080
This is the most important topic in the history of time.

1334
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:39,240
So whoever's in charge here should have more free will discussions because there's no more

1335
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:40,240
important topic.

1336
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:41,520
I just want my name is Nick.

1337
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:46,920
I'm actually the producer of a TV show Wednesday, channel 56 time one.

1338
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:48,280
It's called free will question mark.

1339
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:52,840
You debate free will every Wednesday at 11 K Blaxes Manhattan, George is my co-host over

1340
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:53,840
there.

1341
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:54,840
And he has a show on white planes.

1342
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:55,840
I went back to my question.

1343
01:51:55,840 --> 01:52:00,640
Can any of you geniuses who, all right, can any of you guys give me one example in your

1344
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:05,280
entire life that was a free will decision or anybody in the audience?

1345
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:09,720
Just give me one example of a free will decision.

1346
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:11,840
Coming here today.

1347
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:14,600
Was there a cause for that decision?

1348
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:17,280
Was there a cause or a reason for that decision?

1349
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:20,600
Well, there's, I'm an economist.

1350
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:23,720
So I think there's, that costs their benefits.

1351
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:26,280
I've balanced them and I made a decision.

1352
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:27,280
What's.

1353
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:28,280
So there was.

1354
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,880
Or a reason to your decision.

1355
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:31,520
You just admitted it, right?

1356
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:32,520
Yeah.

1357
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:33,520
Yeah.

1358
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,520
That cause and a cause to that cause.

1359
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:38,400
You can regress your cause and cause will change back to the moment before you were

1360
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,400
born.

1361
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,400
We didn't self cause ourselves.

1362
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,880
Our parents had sex.

1363
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,520
Therefore that's an easy reputation of free will.

1364
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,720
I don't know what's so difficult for you to admit.

1365
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:51,160
So part of the cause was, was my own decision of my mind.

1366
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:53,400
Our self cause, you're a little guy, you're a first cause.

1367
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:55,360
You can cause things without any prior causation.

1368
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:56,800
Is that what you're telling me?

1369
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:57,800
No.

1370
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:58,800
So you're just saying.

1371
01:52:58,800 --> 01:52:59,800
You jump in actually.

1372
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:03,560
Wait, wait, so you said his decision to come here was a freely willed decision and it had

1373
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:04,560
a cause.

1374
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:06,560
You just said that, right?

1375
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,560
Yeah.

1376
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:09,560
And that cause has a cause and that cause has a cause.

1377
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:13,080
Regressing back to the moment before you were conceived, before the planets were, you

1378
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:15,000
know, evolved before the big bang.

1379
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:20,280
The cause is, just because there are causes doesn't mean there.

1380
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:21,280
I'll tell you what the cause is.

1381
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:22,280
I know what the cause is.

1382
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,280
The cause is a cause.

1383
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:27,720
It doesn't mean it's a determining cause.

1384
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:35,240
You know, Leidenitz had a certain principle of sufficient reason and which he says, everything

1385
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:41,080
that happens has a cause that actually determines it.

1386
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:45,120
Some mechanics tells you that that law is false.

1387
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:46,120
It's simply false.

1388
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:49,120
Okay, so determinism or indeterminism does not prove free will.

1389
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:50,960
I mean, if you make an indeterminism.

1390
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:51,960
Wait a minute.

1391
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:52,960
Wait a minute.

1392
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:59,280
So I'm just saying, you know, there are restrictions on my freedom.

1393
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:04,160
Certainly I can't grow through that wall even if I want to because it won't stop.

1394
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,640
It'll stop me from going through it.

1395
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:09,240
On the other hand, I can walk around in the room.

1396
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:14,960
I mean, just because it's not a question of randomness or complete free will or what

1397
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:22,080
have you versus completely determined things by causes.

1398
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:30,520
There's a whole complex of causes that says, I'm going to marry this woman determining

1399
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:31,520
some of them not.

1400
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:33,400
I want to make this more simple.

1401
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:34,400
Okay.

1402
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:35,400
I don't know any of you guys.

1403
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:39,680
The cause is always the pleasure principle, otherwise not as hedonic imperative.

1404
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:42,480
You're always predicting what will give you the most amount of pleasure and the least

1405
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,920
amount of pain.

1406
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,520
So that's the cause for every decision.

1407
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,520
You have no choice but to do that.

1408
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:49,520
No free will.

1409
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:50,720
I don't know why we have to have.

1410
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:51,880
That's your theory.

1411
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:52,880
But I think we can.

1412
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:55,760
I think I'll be happy to.

1413
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,560
It's after the meeting.

1414
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:59,120
But I think so.

1415
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:03,640
You're going to tell me how I can promise you after the meeting.

1416
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:06,160
After the meeting you and I will discuss it.

1417
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:10,480
My thing is every cause is going toward your every human being has no choice but to attempt

1418
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:11,480
to go.

1419
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:12,480
No, I heard that.

1420
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:13,480
I heard that.

1421
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:14,480
So no.

1422
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:17,040
The belief in free will is very harmful.

1423
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:18,040
It's very toxic.

1424
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:19,800
It makes people hate other people.

1425
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:21,000
It causes suicide.

1426
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,480
People want to punish themselves because they think they could have done otherwise which

1427
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:25,200
is obviously BS.

1428
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:27,480
And it makes people feel like failures when they fail at something.

1429
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:31,000
I think whoever believes in free will needs to take a hard look in the mirror and just

1430
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,320
know that you believe in free will because you have no choice but to do what makes you

1431
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,680
feel best about yourself for going toward the part of the way.

1432
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,680
Thank you.

1433
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:38,680
Next question.

1434
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:39,680
Hello hello.

1435
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:40,680
He's constrained to do it, right?

1436
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:41,680
Yeah.

1437
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:42,680
Everything alone.

1438
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:45,680
It makes people hate their personal history as a conditioner.

1439
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:47,680
The next question.

1440
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:48,680
Next question.

1441
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:49,680
Okay.

1442
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:58,040
So that was a perfect segue for me.

1443
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:00,040
My name is Sheila Meats.

1444
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:01,600
Okay.

1445
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:03,680
And I do this work as a profession.

1446
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:06,240
I've done thousands of sessions.

1447
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:13,240
And what some people here may know about energy psychology is what we're learning as all negative

1448
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:19,520
emotion comes from a disturbed energy field and tapping on certain points while we hold

1449
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:24,760
consciousness in mind to tuning it to an issue actually brings it up to the surface.

1450
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:32,720
And what I have found is that there has been no evidence of free will from my work with

1451
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:38,080
my clients because once I clear whether we talk about the information or morphogenetic

1452
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:43,040
fields that you may know about as a scientist from Bruce Lipton's information on cellular

1453
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:48,920
biology wherever you go with that, once we find that information and we remove that information

1454
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:52,560
that person starts unfolding in different behavior.

1455
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,160
So it's still on some level determinism.

1456
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:59,680
But what I'd like to do is talk about the spiritual aspect.

1457
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:02,160
And I'm probably going to be a pain in the buck is every time I'm going to come here,

1458
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:04,040
I'm going to talk about spirituality.

1459
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:06,680
But I feel like people aren't talking about it enough.

1460
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:10,680
As far as first cause is concerned is being pleasure.

1461
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:11,840
That's a possibility.

1462
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,760
That's certainly a belief.

1463
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:16,120
But I'm going to go beyond that.

1464
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:18,400
And I really want to hear what you have to say.

1465
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:20,400
And I'll sit.

1466
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:26,320
But I had an enlightenment experience that deeply changed my life where I got to experience

1467
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:31,920
myself as that or as God or divine or whatever.

1468
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:38,600
And what I want to say is and hear what you have to say is if there is nothing but God

1469
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:45,680
creator divine and God contains all that there is to be known and nature is God expressing

1470
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:53,600
as law and law runs everything which is sentient and non-sentient isn't that determinism.

1471
01:57:53,600 --> 01:58:00,280
Isn't it possible that free will is essential in us so that we as God expressing itself

1472
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:05,080
will be able to abandon oneself to egoic experience?

1473
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:07,080
Thank you.

1474
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:09,080
You're wonderful.

1475
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:16,920
The interesting thing is if God is the all determining cause you could just quote one

1476
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:23,040
of these interesting by the versus where it says yes but God created human beings in God's

1477
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:24,040
image.

1478
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:30,160
So we have part of the part of this divine capacity to choose also.

1479
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:36,800
And you know of course, in theology God is the supreme free will and that is no our free

1480
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,600
will like that.

1481
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:44,600
And then you have and you see there are this is what this is why I am not a systematic

1482
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:46,680
theologian but a biblical scholar.

1483
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:55,040
So my area is the Bible because this there is something else in storytelling than in constructing

1484
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:58,600
dogmatic big buildings.

1485
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:02,320
Stories tell things from the one side and from the other side.

1486
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:08,640
So you have a story where you hear that human beings are there to rule the earth and even

1487
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:14,200
subdue it which is a little bit horrible in light of contemporary concerns but they are

1488
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:15,760
there they have free will.

1489
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:23,320
The next story you read that is Genesis one Genesis two human beings are there and to

1490
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:25,040
preserve the earth.

1491
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:26,600
No freedom at all.

1492
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:32,040
They have just to kind of to accept their role as stewards of creation and they have

1493
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:35,320
to and what is necessary.

1494
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:42,840
So how do you reconcile the two and yeah by telling stories and stories like that that

1495
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:49,480
change you or you know and and I am kind of I'm finding these stories very interesting

1496
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:55,560
what we tell each other about the moments where we we were not following the pleasure

1497
01:59:55,560 --> 02:00:00,280
principle but did I follow the pleasure principle in coming here.

1498
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:06,800
No I was scared to death because I never really thought about free will you know this is not

1499
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:14,440
my area you know I feel uncomfortable but I thought it is important and you see the

1500
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:20,880
moment when we went out go out of our way and do something that we think is necessary.

1501
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:26,280
This is why I'm interested in silence and in your I mean these kind of switches that

1502
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:35,200
happen when we change the cause of our own habits and habitus and and kind of go into

1503
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:40,840
a different mode and maybe look more at the other than at ourselves and all that.

1504
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:46,920
I think and these things happen I know they happen so but you know this is what I think

1505
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:55,400
is free will becomes a power that can change things and that's what I'm interested in here.

1506
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,200
Thank you.

1507
02:00:57,200 --> 02:01:05,720
You know Isaac Bashaevis Simba said we must believe in free will we have no choice.

1508
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:15,480
I want to preface my comments and questions with a statement that I appreciate everything

1509
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:21,720
and everyone on the panel said today so this is a respectful if I have criticism it's respectful

1510
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:25,200
it's not meant to be negative.

1511
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:26,960
A little bit about myself undergraduate.

1512
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:28,800
Keep in mind we have four other people.

1513
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:30,240
I do that much time.

1514
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:33,160
You don't have to worry about me being the case I'm very to the point.

1515
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:37,840
So I appreciated that gentleman's passion and to the point.

1516
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:43,800
My undergraduate molecular biologist from MIT JDMBA year spent at Penn Medical School.

1517
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:47,400
I loved hearing all the comments reminded me of grad school.

1518
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:50,880
Unfortunately it also reminded me of the fact that you guys are so brilliant that you're

1519
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:57,080
talking up here and for the rest of us unfortunately it's very difficult because you're not defining

1520
02:01:57,080 --> 02:01:58,920
what you're operating terms are.

1521
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:01,480
What is pre-determinism versus free will.

1522
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:05,800
Dr. Cochin obviously a brilliant mathematician I appreciate that.

1523
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:12,640
I spent time on the trading floor as a market maker and I understand probabilistic theory

1524
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:19,200
but are we saying that free will it has to be a conscious decision in our own rational

1525
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:22,280
best interest given what our probabilities are.

1526
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:24,880
We never really nail that down.

1527
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:30,920
So I to to the point shortly I have two very concrete questions.

1528
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:36,840
One is and my almost respect to philosophy I think this is a philosophical exercise.

1529
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:39,440
Philosophy informs everything we do.

1530
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:45,720
My first question is, is this a philosophical exercise what is the purpose because from

1531
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:50,320
my point of view people are rational beings.

1532
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:52,360
But they don't always behave rationally.

1533
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:55,280
So you cannot always predict their behavior.

1534
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:58,920
Dr. Kribal I'm sure you would agree economists have this problem.

1535
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:03,520
Keynesian economists have had problems with the economy all over the world.

1536
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:08,600
We're looking at a currency crash and I'm not getting political but the Austrians their

1537
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:12,640
main criticism is you can't quantify all human behavior.

1538
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:17,640
People are rational beings but they also act with passion and irrationally.

1539
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:22,080
I was saying to my colleague that maybe someone who would be very good on this panel would

1540
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:24,520
be someone from the intelligence operations community.

1541
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:28,760
They have to use game theory to predict human behavior.

1542
02:03:28,760 --> 02:03:34,560
Both in populations and excuse me let me just let me just let me let me tell you you have

1543
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:35,960
two concrete questions.

1544
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:38,680
I would like you to ask those two concrete questions.

1545
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:43,880
I don't want you to expand on them because we have other people and then we have I limited

1546
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:44,880
time.

1547
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:48,240
And I don't know your name I don't know your background sir.

1548
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:54,120
So intelligence community has failed to predict several instances.

1549
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:55,680
Economists has failed.

1550
02:03:55,680 --> 02:04:00,080
Do you acknowledge that this is a useful exercise?

1551
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:01,400
Interesting.

1552
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:09,240
But there is no concrete end point in this because unfortunately you cannot always predict

1553
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:13,880
human behavior and you I'll put it in more concrete terms in experimental design.

1554
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:19,240
In experimental design it is important to define your independent as well as your dependent

1555
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:20,240
variables.

1556
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:21,720
This is multifactorial.

1557
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:24,600
If we want to talk about photons all day long we could.

1558
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:25,600
Certainly there's an effect.

1559
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:28,240
The sum of those effects does it affect us?

1560
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:29,400
Yes.

1561
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:34,200
What is the point of the exercise and what are your operating definitions?

1562
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:37,000
It's a why and I don't mean to be disrespectful.

1563
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,080
I really just want to understand.

1564
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:40,080
Thank you.

1565
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:41,080
The why is important.

1566
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:46,840
But as far as I'm concerned let me try to answer.

1567
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:51,400
Talk about prediction and of course it's very close to related to the issue of free will.

1568
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:54,600
If there's free will then there's no prediction whenever there's human behavior.

1569
02:04:54,600 --> 02:05:01,200
I actually think the distinction or the distance between human based endeavors like economics

1570
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:08,000
and non-behavioral endeavors like physics or thermodynamics or what have you is smaller

1571
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:13,280
than distance between simple models and complex models.

1572
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:17,960
Simple models in economics for example studying treasury bill auctions when people do models

1573
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:23,840
of that they actually pretty good fairly accurate in predicting price levels and trade volumes.

1574
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:29,120
If models trying to predict the economy which is an incredibly complex system we do very

1575
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:30,120
poorly.

1576
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:36,440
The thing is true in fact if you think about it nowadays with physical sciences it's very

1577
02:05:36,440 --> 02:05:41,320
easy to have laboratory models of Newtonian classic mechanics that are extremely good

1578
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:45,760
at predicting whatever you want to predict but we still cannot successfully predict whether

1579
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:47,720
more than five or six days.

1580
02:05:47,720 --> 02:05:48,720
Why?

1581
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:50,160
Because it's an incredibly complex model.

1582
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:54,960
So I don't think it's so much an issue about I don't think free will in here displaying

1583
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:59,640
a very important role it's more a matter of model complexity that's the economist answer

1584
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:00,640
to that.

1585
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:01,640
Thank you.

1586
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:02,640
Thank you.

1587
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:06,600
As a biologist it reminds me of nature versus nurture it's interesting but thank you for

1588
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:08,640
everything you've done.

1589
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,640
Okay.

1590
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:15,280
Thank you so much for your round table this is wonderful.

1591
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:24,400
What is your definition each of you of will not free will but will and how does it exclude

1592
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:35,080
animals or exclude animals it's been a very it's it was brought up briefly but just how

1593
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:39,760
does it exclude animals or does it.

1594
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:45,000
So I'll just start with my shared confusion I think on what we mean by free will and we

1595
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:50,680
talk about it being ambiguous or what is it exactly right so.

1596
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:57,040
For me when I think about this question I actually set it aside because the notion of

1597
02:06:57,040 --> 02:07:02,640
free will or will it could be choice it could be intent to choose it could be a whole range

1598
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:08,840
of things that we all as individuals kind of share some stake in with the definition ends

1599
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:09,840
up being.

1600
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:13,800
But what it is we're talking about when we talk about free will is how do people make

1601
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:20,800
choices where do those choices come from what motivates them and so for me as a neurologist

1602
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:27,000
I study that behavior I study the organism which we call humans and I give them choices

1603
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:35,560
and I study their brain activity and so so the idea of a will or free will is a provocative

1604
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:41,240
concept and it has used to discuss these kinds of things but what I'm interested when I think

1605
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:46,920
about that is our capacity for choice in what controls that.

1606
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:55,280
I do think that's a very important and I think I'm not going to say anything about the will

1607
02:07:55,280 --> 02:07:59,560
because I think the issue can be raised by just talking about freedom and not talking

1608
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:05,400
about some particular faculty called the will.

1609
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:14,000
And this sort of sums up I guess my angle on many of the interesting things that have

1610
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:20,840
come up in what have surfaced and what my colleagues have said.

1611
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:32,080
You see I completely agree that in the end this is a special topic within the larger

1612
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:41,680
problem of the mind-body problem and I agree with people like Libet they're not really

1613
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:51,080
with the conclusions he becomes to on that particular evidence that he provides but I

1614
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:58,320
generally agree with the view that there is a real sense in which if you talk about the

1615
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:07,880
dispositions of an animal's mind which yield the animals behavior and you talk about the

1616
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:15,440
dispositions of bodies whether animals are human beings there is bound to be a reduction

1617
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:23,280
in some sense of the dispositions the mental dispositions to the physical dispositions.

1618
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:31,960
So if there is freedom and if the mind is in some way not in these ways dependent on

1619
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:41,440
or reducible to the dispositions of the body it can only be I think it carries the mind

1620
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:46,440
contains an element that is normative.

1621
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:52,560
If you think of the mind human beings or animals or if you think of human beings as being just

1622
02:09:52,560 --> 02:10:00,080
like animals then the mind has tendencies just because they are mental tendencies rather

1623
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:06,120
than bodily or physical tendencies doesn't mean that they are outside of nature.

1624
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:13,720
So if nature is deterministic and not as you suggest it is if nature is deterministic then

1625
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:20,560
the mind because if it contains nothing but natural tendencies is determined and there

1626
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:28,320
is no sense as you have been saying but if the mind contains a normative element that

1627
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:35,520
is when people so suppose an animal has its behavior it does something it's frustrated

1628
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:41,080
it changes to something else you might think well that's animal rationality well maybe

1629
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:47,560
it is animal rationality but the animal doesn't change the behavior by thinking what I did

1630
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:55,160
was wrong there is no normative element right it just gets frustrated and it moves to something

1631
02:10:55,160 --> 02:11:02,040
else that's not normative in the full fled sense of thinking this was wrong I ought to

1632
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:09,600
do this it's normativity of that kind which I think is not possessed by animals it's

1633
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:16,720
possessed only by us and that's what I think if anything shows that the mind is not just

1634
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:21,360
tendencies in nature but it's such a part.

1635
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:28,960
You know the question of will really touches on the psychology question of motivation but

1636
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:36,000
Rob and I both of us stayed out of this discussion because we didn't want to bring that in.

1637
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Which I not to get tongue tight here.

1638
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:48,360
Most of the dialogue was focused kind of from this anthropomorphic viewpoint on specifically

1639
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:53,720
around the problems concerning the individual.

1640
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:59,680
I think that's maybe because like the first step is to conquer this idea of losing our

1641
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:07,400
self or our dualist intuitions that we have this kind of privileged seat in the Cartesian

1642
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:15,840
theater and that science can't probe the subjective but and I think that's my maybe it's a language

1643
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:21,040
thing that if we develop the language but my question what I was interested in more so

1644
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:28,640
was supposing that we can overcome that for the moment and suspend our disbelief.

1645
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:36,760
Move away from this anthropomorphic perspective on free will and think about it.

1646
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:43,640
Kind of superhuman and purely materialistic level.

1647
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:53,280
The question is is matter moving towards and possibly if it's not capable of achieving

1648
02:12:53,280 --> 02:13:05,240
free will and would that be a kind of way to move towards a kind of designed determinism

1649
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:10,440
in a way that makes any sense.

1650
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:12,360
Who can take them this?

1651
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:19,760
So one of the things that I tried to put forth and the way that I see the progress of science

1652
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:25,040
on these kinds of problems is that as we learn how the system operates right our brain, our

1653
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:32,480
bodies and system it gives us new options right so so there's lots of ways in which we

1654
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:35,840
might not be able to make a choice that we might be constrained.

1655
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:38,000
One of them is that we don't know what the options are.

1656
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:42,560
If you don't know the option you don't ever have the option to make that choice.

1657
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:49,760
So as we learn about what guides our choice behavior what constrains that we can have

1658
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:54,760
longer term goals where we can intervene on that and actually the space of possibilities

1659
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:56,280
right.

1660
02:13:56,280 --> 02:14:05,640
We do that by inventing new medicines or new technologies that give us 10 years ago.

1661
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:11,120
In some sense we are increasing for our species the options going forth.

1662
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:15,320
Some of them might not.

1663
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:17,320
Thank you.

1664
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:29,760
Hi, well there's been a very constructive flow of ideas.

1665
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:31,560
I'm an undergraduate student and I'm really interested in artificial intelligence and

1666
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:38,800
its impact on future upcoming technologies and especially more so how is quantum theory

1667
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:44,520
going to I won't say determine but anticipate these future technologies and the impact on

1668
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:58,240
our society and do you think that if given unlimited resources and unlimited I guess the

1669
02:14:58,240 --> 02:15:04,280
ultimate proficiency in algorithms could we create a machine that's capable of replicating

1670
02:15:04,280 --> 02:15:08,680
itself enough to maybe free willing.

1671
02:15:08,680 --> 02:15:18,680
Actually, so there is just within the last month or two is a paper study published by

1672
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:25,520
a team at Google where they've developed an algorithm that could basically human level

1673
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:28,080
control in the context of a video game space.

1674
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:34,880
So it's a really interesting development kind of a cute experiment so they have their algorithm

1675
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:41,800
play Atari 2600 games and they basically give the algorithm very little information about

1676
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:45,960
as much information as you might have coming into a game and the algorithm can learn how

1677
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:51,240
to play it to the level of a professional game tester with not better on some of the

1678
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:52,240
games.

1679
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:58,200
And so the report is called human level control through this deep reinforcement learning algorithm

1680
02:15:58,200 --> 02:16:05,760
and this is a the core of the algorithm is something that we look at how mammalian brains

1681
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:09,280
and actually other systems do learn.

1682
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:14,760
And so here it's not going to necessarily quantum level depictions but this is just

1683
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:20,000
a computation that this algorithm is able to execute where it's able to learn from its

1684
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:27,760
environment and feedback to the level of how you and I might play a video game.

1685
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:34,480
So I mean if you're interested in that you should look at that.

1686
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:39,640
So I mean I have a point of view in what I've said that the idea of free will isn't necessarily

1687
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:43,080
a useful one for the world we're actually interested in studying here.

1688
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:45,760
What we're interested in is how do humans behave?

1689
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:47,280
What's the sources of that?

1690
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:52,360
Whether it's free that's not necessarily useful.

1691
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:54,040
All of our choices are constrained.

1692
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:58,800
We're biologically so there are constraints there's limits to that.

1693
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:03,760
Now that we can get a computer algorithm to display a level of control that a human can

1694
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:09,760
within that environment I think is an interesting kind of demonstration of where technology

1695
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:10,760
is going.

1696
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:12,760
It does provide by the way I think an interesting test.

1697
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:17,440
I don't know if you could run that test if you had a very large number of such highly

1698
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:24,640
evolved artificial intelligence and intelligence beings.

1699
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:29,720
It would be interesting to see whether there was any distinctive feature in their behavior

1700
02:17:29,720 --> 02:17:32,480
vis-a-vis humans in a variety of situations.

1701
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:37,960
I think it would be an interesting test for at least some notion of free will.

1702
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:40,960
If the answer is no then I would say that there is no free will as we're defining it

1703
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:41,960
in here.

1704
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:45,560
As at least as I was thinking of defining it I think.

1705
02:17:45,560 --> 02:17:52,560
Okay thank you very much.
