Bury Hassan

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Athena Viscuzzi

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,440
Mars Vogel

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,440
Beverly Zabriski who is?

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,640
Helix Center executive committee member organized this wonderful program and we're very grateful to her

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,220
Also Simon dang is on his way and will be joining the discussion as soon as he arrives

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,960
So without further ado

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Well we were talking

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,560
before this about

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,360
the effect of people's stories on each other and I guess

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,800
You're the one that's done the research on this so maybe if you could start us off with how you think that relates to this topic

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,520
So we

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,560
Basically what we're doing in my lab we look in how people communicate

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,360
So I'm an old scientist at Princeton University and my lab we're looking now

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,800
a

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,440
Storyteller

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,440
convey his ideas

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,080
To the audience, so basically we're scanning the brain of the listeners

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,040
Why they listen to me speaking for example and my brain while I'm speaking to you

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,040
And basically

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,560
What we see that in good communication

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,760
The brain of the listeners become coupled to the brain of the speaker and

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,320
And the stronger the similarities between my brain patterns now and your brain patterns

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,480
Mean that we managed to communicate and you can really understand me

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,040
Most likely it's not happening now, right?

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,520
You see on that

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,480
You need to get used to my accent. We need to develop a common ground. We need to

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:10,720
have common ideas of what we talking about and then it will emerge at the end of the conversation hopefully and

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,760
And I think that especially in these days we see more and more that it's very easy to interrupt

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,000
communication it's very easy not to be coupled to the other

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,200
anything

33
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,800
When good communication happening is like a magic

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,860
I thought I will eventually become coupled and I think the question in these days

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,760
how can we can really improve communication and

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,200
In

37
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,480
Increase the similarities in our responses and serve background and certain understanding of the topics

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,920
We are talking about instead of dividing and biking because it's very easy for the listeners to be decoupled and

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,080
Not to want to be engaged in communication

40
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,720
So since we're talking we're in a climate, let's say where people are being othered a lot, yes

41
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,760
What are those conditions that we need to create so that people can listen to each other I

42
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,000
Think that the two really important things for communication to happen

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I think first we need to develop

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
similar

45
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:34,920
joint language like if you were talking about different aspect and have different beliefs and

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,840
and

47
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,320
Filters by which we perceive reality

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,440
It's very easy to be decoupled. So for example

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
when I was

50
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
reading the news yesterday is

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,120
In the attack on the media I got really scared by

52
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
trying to say that

53
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,720
For example, journalists are the enemy of the people because that means that one of our basic

54
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,600
Knowledge and way to create a society now is

55
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
undermined and

56
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:17,680
If we don't know what is the fact and what are the tools will be very difficult to establish this coming down and

57
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,840
It will be very easy to divide us more and more and anything that basically

58
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,240
We're living in a water to become more and more fragmented

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,960
And I think there are some forces that like it

60
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,000
That can gain power from this fragmented reality and that's something we need to fight against

61
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,640
We're very much a story

62
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,640
We did not exhibit the stories

63
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
These are

64
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,400
How these is third-person stories these aren't these aren't stories of our educators

65
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:08,560
But the goal is to create a sense that this is that the experience of others is very much like the experience of immigrants

66
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,640
And very much like the experience of visitors who don't identify naturally with the immigration experience

67
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,080
We don't have that sense of whether we're connected at that sort of a granular level for us

68
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,720
It's it's it's very superficial

69
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:35,040
Are people saying to us things like yes, my grandparents experience the same thing or are they saying things to us which they are increasingly

70
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,760
Today I don't have to listen to that crap anymore. There's been a change

71
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,560
And we can tell our story we own our own stories and we don't have to connect our stories and stories of other people

72
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,720
It would be wonderful to be able to to see the kinds of connections that you

73
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:03,160
That you study and and what it is that facilitates would facilitate our ability to make connections more real

74
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:14,800
So you were talking about the exhibit that doctors without borders did earlier this this year about

75
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
So that's the organization I work for

76
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:27,520
I'm highlighting our experiences with refugees all over the world and the whole point of that was that in telling the stories and

77
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,120
Making people more than telling the stories but actually making people kind of go through a simulation of that experience

78
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,640
that that's

79
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,960
It's impossible not to be moved. I guess, you know, I think we come from I come from a place where

80
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
it's

81
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,680
Stories are moving, you know, and we encourage forms where people can tell their stories because that's what's going to shift

82
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:03,600
People's minds, but I guess what you're saying is kind of challenging not necessarily. There have to be some conditions. Yeah, I think that

83
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,800
There's something really interesting about storytelling and it's way more effective way of communication than anything else if

84
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,840
If a doctor will come and we tell you that you have a cancer and we start to detail all the facts

85
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
To be very difficult for you to process

86
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,600
But if you will talk with someone that went through this

87
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,080
To the therapy and will tell you his own personal experiences

88
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
suddenly will get information

89
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,320
So I think in storytelling, it's a way for us to communicate

90
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
the way more effectively because

91
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,520
You know, we all humans we all suffer we all have families we all have friends

92
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,720
We we went to the world

93
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,680
So it's very easy to connect when you have this like very basic common ground to use for

94
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,920
When you go and and really become very abstract

95
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,280
and then it's more difficult for people to be coupling in

96
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,280
in the understand the situation

97
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,640
Well, I think that's the premise of having

98
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
the work that you're doing

99
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,000
retelling stories from history and then also in the kind of presentations where we were having I

100
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
guess all

101
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
when when we're trying to

102
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,480
Talk about the displaced and raise empathy for them and

103
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,080
services and funding hopefully

104
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,240
We do rely on story. I think that's kind of the idea. We do rely on stories

105
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,200
But I think what you're I think we're all increasingly

106
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,400
Just talk

107
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,360
You said you need a common language in order to hear somebody else's story, and I think we're all

108
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
increasingly siloed

109
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,440
And just listening to the people who speak our language, you know, I mean in terms of

110
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,960
Yeah, I mean, you know and that there would be words

111
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,160
Like if if somebody's telling me his story

112
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Was an illegal immigrant

113
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,440
That's it. I've stopped listening, you know, because I don't

114
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,000
In my language, there's no such thing. There's no illegal immigrants

115
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,400
So we speak a different language so finished look you know my empathy

116
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
And

117
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:40,200
Some guards, right and in your intuition is absolutely right. This is exactly what do we see basically

118
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,800
I can we did an experiment that was a very simple experiment. It was like listening to

119
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,640
50-minute story by JD Salinger. So basically everyone listening to the same story

120
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
the story was about

121
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,480
a husband that lost track of his wife in a party and

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,920
He calling his best friend in the middle of the night asking did you see my wife?

123
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
It's a very simple story

124
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,480
For half of the audience we say that the wife even affair and is with the friend at this

125
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,960
actual moment and for the other group we said

126
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,080
that the husband is lunatic and

127
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,880
And really we have a very iraqi man way

128
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,760
And it's like one sentence was enough

129
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
to make the audience

130
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Understand the story in a very different way

131
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,520
It and it was so strong that we can look on the brain of each listener of Intel

132
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,400
You believe that the wife even of her or you believe that the husband is lunatic and

133
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,280
If you think that one sentence

134
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Can filter your reality

135
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,360
Right and think about what happening if you listen to Fox News

136
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,800
424 hours a day or you read the New York time

137
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,920
Then for the same news event that you exposed to you have very different filters

138
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,440
And as you were saying this filters going to change everything

139
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,240
And if I was saying that if we want to have the same filters on reality

140
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,200
we

141
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,200
It's more challenging to communicate and

142
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,760
There is something good about it because you want

143
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,960
The different opinions coming to so you don't want everyone to have the exact same or something about the reality

144
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,360
And but also you want some common ground then the question how to balance it

145
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:45,560
It's something that we don't really know how to do and it's always the same thing

146
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,600
And then there's quite a difference is you've already raised

147
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:00,080
Between telling someone else's story that is your story because you're engaging it and then telling your story

148
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
which is much of I

149
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,760
Believe what you have done is that you have told your own story

150
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
She when we talk about

151
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,600
From the experience of a person's that happened to leave in it

152
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:34,200
It is something that cannot be

153
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,440
Tall to somebody who have no clue

154
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
What it means for instance

155
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,520
To be in a situation knowing that

156
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
What tomorrow would be like

157
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
To be in a situation

158
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,440
Whether they're going to be tomorrow or not to be in a situation where

159
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,040
Somebody will be in charge of your

160
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,560
life

161
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
yourself

162
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,640
Somebody will be giving you a margin order that

163
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,040
You have to be left right or you shouldn't be there

164
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
but

165
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
In 21st century

166
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,040
For me looking back

167
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,560
The darkness and sadness

168
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,280
Demonization and helpless and this is what

169
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,880
The displaced person or refugees or immigrants

170
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Is the same thing just different names a different circumstances at the time

171
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
in 21st century

172
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:55,360
For me myself when I look at the suffering of the others knowing that I've been there

173
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
But I'm not longer there

174
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,880
I'm now a different person

175
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,120
who

176
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
is in a position to

177
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,360
Talk about a sufferings of the other persons who

178
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Don't know how to say now

179
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
who cannot I

180
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,240
I

181
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,080
Won't be and I don't want this and I don't want this

182
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,560
and this is what I so I

183
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Always ask myself

184
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,120
Why?

185
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,120
any persons

186
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,760
At the moment in 21st century should go through what I went through

187
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,000
maybe 40 years ago

188
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,640
At the time when the

189
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,200
We the world's talking about the

190
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
the

191
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
global

192
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,560
economy global environment

193
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
What about the global humanity?

194
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,760
Where we have to sometime to look

195
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,000
at the time when we have a technology that

196
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,680
We know

197
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,600
What is happening in South Africa within 24 hours?

198
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,240
Which was not like that 50 years ago 40 years ago

199
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Why

200
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,280
a person have to fuck up in

201
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,360
In a tree and climb in a boat risky

202
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
a journey

203
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,040
Without knowing what would happen in the middle of the oceans

204
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,320
But they decided so

205
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:43,320
These are the things that they the the rules should be addressing what make that persons be so desperate

206
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
That

207
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:52,800
To leave the place where he or she was born the place where any person is proud

208
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,560
To call it home because the place where he was born

209
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,080
Sometimes cannot replace even that how bad it is

210
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,600
And then even the the metals of the the sense of where you what was born

211
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
It's good because

212
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,080
God created you to be in that place

213
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,160
God didn't create a you to be in heaven

214
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,240
Creating you to be in that place. So this is the miss that

215
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,800
We in the world are not discussing

216
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
To address the issue

217
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,680
What makes a person so desperate?

218
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,480
to risk

219
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
his life or her life

220
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Seeing

221
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
immigrants

222
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,200
Washing out by the oceans and after the drown

223
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Seeing

224
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,600
People risking their life to be shot at

225
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,040
To go to rather side so I think there is something fundamental that

226
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,280
We in the world that we are in especially we in a better world where we are today

227
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
We have to look into it

228
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,920
if there is a problem sin

229
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,600
the home where I come from I

230
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,080
think the solutions

231
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,720
should be

232
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Can we address it?

233
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,560
Can we find a solution to that problem so that?

234
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,600
Simon will not risk his life

235
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,200
for a journey with our knowing

236
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,920
What will be ahead of that? I think that's the

237
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
That discuss it if you want to do that

238
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,240
So I'm thinking about Simon is the way that you

239
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:54,120
Believe that people are inextricably tied to their homes, you know and are fundamentally identified to whole

240
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Sorry, I lost my

241
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
the way that people are

242
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Fundamentally tied to their homes and

243
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,040
the particular problems that refugees have

244
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,080
When they are essentially homeless and stateless

245
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
and

246
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,680
Also the responsibilities then that governments have to create

247
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:26,120
or not create a sense of home in those kind of interstitial moments when people are traveling and

248
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,640
Morris I was wondering, you know at the Tenement Museum given your own research on home

249
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,760
how

250
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,760
People form those neighborhoods organically we're talking about that downstairs

251
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
as Americans

252
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,440
We assume that movement is natural we assume that people are created

253
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,200
with

254
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,160
Opportunities to go somewhere else where an end stage at least for the moment of

255
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:05,680
That process but in most of the world it's very much like the the world that Simon speaks to people

256
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,040
Didn't expect to move they moved only under the most desperate

257
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:19,440
Circumstances so we tell the stories of people who for whom there was a differential the lower east side

258
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:27,000
The streets were not paved with gold as the the language of of some of American history has it

259
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,560
These were extraordinarily difficult circumstances

260
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:41,160
People encountered struggle they were strangers. They weren't they weren't the victims of terror in the place to which they came

261
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,040
In many cases they were victimized by terror in the places they left

262
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:53,200
They came because there was marginally more opportunity and significantly more

263
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,640
Safety the question then was how do you reconstruct something? How do you make a community when you're there?

264
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,080
not because of of something that you had always dreamt of doing but

265
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:13,800
Something that that was forced a choice that was forced on you because of conditions in the place you came from

266
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:21,400
I mean, I I think of this personally what would I be at this age still? I don't know living in Poland

267
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
if if

268
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,280
My parents hadn't gone to Siberia and wound up

269
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
wound up here I

270
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:37,960
Don't know that if as an American I think oh, I can think of nothing worse than spending my life in Poland

271
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,880
But so there there is a there are positive outcomes

272
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:50,360
But we assume those positive outcomes and yet what we need to do is realize just what the difficult the difficulties are

273
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,360
of that movement

274
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,360
how

275
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,400
How

276
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,560
undesired that movement is in almost all cases

277
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
so so came from

278
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,360
look from the story why

279
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,160
the borders were more open on the faulty is it because

280
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:16,840
The situation in the state was after the depression there was a need for new power

281
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:24,400
To come in and so they opened the borders a slight remote. It wasn't like they clear up and right because now we see that

282
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,360
the borders are closing more and more

283
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,280
But I think the economic situation of the people around

284
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,320
Actually is better than what was on the 40s. I titled now the process. Why we closed the borders?

285
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,240
In this particular moment in time in history

286
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,680
We we have more resources to give we closed them for the first time in the 1920s

287
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,080
In the laws of 1921 in 1924

288
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,960
established a racial system

289
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:03,120
That determined who could enter this country and cut immigration back from a million a year to

290
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
150,000 a year

291
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:12,680
Favourying people of superior racial backgrounds Northern Europeans Western Europeans

292
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,160
cutting out altogether Asians

293
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,360
cutting out altogether Africans and restricting to a handful Eastern and Southern Europeans so

294
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:31,120
Eastern Europeans polls and Russian poll Russian Jews and Polish Jews had been entering at 300,000 a year

295
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:38,480
They were cut back to 5,000 story the Holocaust is the story of the 1924 Johnson Redact

296
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
Past in this country

297
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,720
After the war there's a slight opening

298
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
not because as

299
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,000
And by the way then the key to those 1920 laws or that the United States was experiencing great

300
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
prosperity in the

301
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:03,480
1920s it was one of our really great periods, but an awful lot of people in America

302
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,960
Thought they were losing their country's identity. They were

303
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,680
Agriculture collapsed essentially as a source of employment

304
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,600
Small towns gave way and people whose lives were built up in

305
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:25,240
In their identities were tied to rural America or small town America

306
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,120
To what we would today call red state America

307
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:36,960
Thought that they were losing the future and so they cut off anything that threatened to continue change in

308
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,600
1945 when the horror of the death camps became unavoidable

309
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,720
President Truman wanted to allow

310
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,880
In refugees to enter the country

311
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,800
Congress wouldn't go along it believed that the same conditions that had prevailed in the 20s

312
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:06,680
Still obtained Truman had signed an executive order that allowed literally a handful a couple of thousand survivors of the camps

313
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Into the United States

314
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,520
Without congressional authorization in 48 they signed

315
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,960
Congress passed the first refugee act that wound up allowing about 200,000

316
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,880
European refugees and and

317
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,280
That included about 80,000 Jews actually more Ukrainians came in under that law

318
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,240
It's an irony there

319
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,920
Then Jewish survivors we didn't change our laws till 1965

320
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:47,600
In the city of the as part of the civil rights movement and now we're at another one of those moments probably with great prosperity

321
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,920
And yet with people who who are losing

322
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,240
There there it's like the 20s in a lot of ways people who are losing their sense of the nation

323
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,080
Belonging to them and wanting to go back to a pre-civil rights America

324
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,000
wanting to go back to a white America indeed to a white protest in America and

325
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,480
That's where we are where we are and how it has been and some people would argue that there's a

326
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,440
fundamental change in the economy not the

327
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,400
Superficials of of prosperity or lack of prosperity

328
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
It's economics and identity

329
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,040
So if you take this another three of

330
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:40,360
Lucky the 20s in 1920s then we should be really worried because we all know what happening in the 30s and the 40s

331
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,200
What what happened was the same thing that's happening in the 30s and 40s in Europe

332
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Yeah seems to be happening again

333
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:57,800
Yeah in in Europe right the irony for us is that usually after an election in

334
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,640
some

335
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:06,800
Emerging part of the world the American president calls up the new dictator and says will will be your will

336
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,720
Collaborate with you as long as you respect

337
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,400
for a rule of law and human rights and this time after our election was on

338
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,000
Hala Merkel of all people who called Donald Trump to offer the same

339
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,760
collaboration going forward if the United States respected human rights and rule of law

340
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:36,360
There there's also such a difference between waves of immigration when there is some choice involved and

341
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,840
the homo T for forced from home and that was the exhibit of

342
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:51,040
Doctors without borders that forced from home and you've worked in many different kinds of refugee camps in different countries

343
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,360
Yeah, when you were talking every my worked in Maban County in South Sudan and

344
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
the

345
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Near the shilok people

346
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,080
And

347
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,360
You were I thought I heard you say how people

348
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,600
Downplay that experience of being wrenched from your homeland how it really is

349
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,520
You know a loss a death a grief, you know to be

350
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,600
forced from home like you say but that there's the loss of the of the

351
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
What you were saying you're God given

352
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Homeland, you know

353
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,480
Now you know other people have used that idea

354
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,800
anyway

355
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,240
But it was I think that's true that people really you know

356
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,760
We when we think of trauma even we think of well, it's somebody died or you you witnessed this

357
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,240
But just the loss of homeland just the loss of of of of common language

358
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,640
You know of but not just the the tongue but the

359
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Markers, you know

360
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
Is so

361
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,920
It's something you need to recover from you know that it's this loss and I was working

362
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,120
With a very small group of people from

363
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:33,320
Sudan who would take it were in a refugee camp in South Sudan and they had no

364
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:40,280
Language and they had no word in their language for depression and so I was trying to explain

365
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,880
What's depression and we were trying out different words and?

366
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,680
the

367
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:51,040
educated people in that spoke Arabic and then their native language and

368
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,200
And then so we're going back between the few languages trying to figure out

369
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,080
You know what is depression?

370
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,960
You know when people are crying and they can't get over it and they're staring out the window and they can't function

371
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,880
And they said oh you mean when you're missing your village

372
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,840
You know and so that became our word for depression like missing your village

373
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,720
You know that it's that fundamental, you know that it's a it's a

374
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:26,000
It's a mental illness to to be wrenched from home, you know, I always remember that

375
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,520
and

376
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,920
You know talking to I

377
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,840
Was

378
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,040
Talking to a young man from Central America the other day

379
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,840
Who had to flee his father was murdered by gangs, you know and the

380
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:52,600
You know his father was murdered all these horrible things happened, but the biggest component of the grief was

381
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,480
The the future that he had anticipated in his own place his own God

382
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,040
Yes in place, you know

383
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:06,960
And that he was never going to have that again and that one person with a gun could take that away from him the rest of his life

384
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
You know I

385
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
really think we

386
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:18,600
estimate that I mean the idea that people are crawling over our you know borders to take our jobs or some

387
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Thing like that

388
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,720
But you know then I think in this goes back to the story telling then

389
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,720
Can it really be only people who've experienced this who understand are there?

390
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,960
You know like when you tell the story of the 1920s immigration laws I

391
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Wasn't there, but I'm having that experience right now. I can understand your story right of how the

392
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
in prosperity xenophobia

393
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,520
Arises

394
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,200
So I didn't have I have you know, how do we create these?

395
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:06,840
environments where the language where people can understand people who have not been rinsed from their home can

396
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,480
Understand the severity of that and and you know or people who have not been oppressed can understand

397
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,960
what that really means and how wrong it is and

398
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,760
Hopefully, you know so that people who are oppressing

399
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,560
Can understand what they are doing and stop doing it

400
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
But that that presumes empathy

401
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
And it can't be presumed

402
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,340
Yeah, I will go to my grave presuming

403
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,440
They can't take that away from me

404
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,640
Home is such an elemental concept

405
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:55,000
But even if we haven't been driven from our home or nation

406
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:02,120
Or the people whose language that we share that idea of leaving home is

407
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:10,440
Something that we can all that we've all encountered even if it's just that struggle. Let's say to leave home and

408
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:17,720
I was telling you that we I was recently in Greece at a refugee camp and

409
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,280
One of the camps it was a Syrian camp

410
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,680
And it had just opened about two years ago and the people who had the military who organized the camp

411
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,800
Basically just organized people numerically and they gave them their

412
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:42,120
boxes they call them isoboxes to live in based on whatever number that they happen to be assigned when they entered

413
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,400
So all of the mostly Syrian families were there and they were just organized

414
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,160
numerically, but then over the space of one summer they reorganized themselves

415
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,120
according to

416
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,440
communities or tribal affiliations or whatever

417
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,320
kinds of smaller cultures

418
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:07,680
They wanted to affiliate with and I think that that was a really powerful experience

419
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,480
The amount of agency that any one person has

420
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,320
When they are in refugee camp was remarkable to me

421
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,480
You know the idea of being able to leave your box and where would you go?

422
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,760
You needed to have an appointment at another box or you need to be you know

423
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,160
You need to have an appointment with the medical staff where you need to be going to a class

424
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:39,280
But people didn't just walk around and wonder what they might do for the afternoon

425
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:45,640
I mean this idea of what it means to be home or what it means to be at work

426
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:51,960
Or what we currently call a third space right that place that we hang out with our people

427
00:33:51,960 --> 00:34:00,000
You know this is something that's really missing in a camp and it was it was somewhat remarkable to me that the people would

428
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,840
Organize the camp. I mean certainly for reasons of efficiency, which are completely understandable

429
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,280
You know that they would just organize people numerically, but it was also

430
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,400
Wonderful to see the agency that people took

431
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,560
Upon themselves to reorganize and to see how that was allowed for you know that shift once there

432
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,600
We've had that in this country with the resettlement the refugee resettlement program has put people

433
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:33,240
You know the long here and this and everybody has reconfigured themselves

434
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,760
You know that there was a study like within five years everybody had

435
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:44,560
Migrated to find their own people and create the little Italy's in the Chinatowns and the the things that that people

436
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,760
need I also saw that in South Sudan where there was a

437
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:57,440
Society that was organized around shakes and so they all moved themselves around and we would call the different parts of the

438
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,960
camp according to the

439
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,080
the shay who you know I'm going to

440
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:11,960
Shake so and so's part. I'm going to the according to the clans the whole camp had been renamed as opposed to ABC

441
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,680
According to

442
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:22,800
But even among economic migrants who are much more fortunately situated in a city like New York

443
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:30,240
You've got dozens of hometown societies organized by Mexican villages. You've got these hometown associations

444
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,200
organized by Chinese regions and and communities

445
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,720
and

446
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,160
if you go back in time you'll have in the on the Lower East Side

447
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:47,600
the Lonsman Shaftan people who came from some god forsaken village in Ukraine and

448
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,960
Banded together with others of that same background because there's something of home

449
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:05,280
That that was that significant to their identity to who they were to really empower them to help make their way in this very strange world

450
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
You see

451
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:15,080
There is a word which we learned people like me that it said nothing like home

452
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,360
And come down to

453
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,400
Why you replace home to your refugees can

454
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,520
This is a refugee scale there have to be

455
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
something

456
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:42,480
Undescribables that took home away and make you a displaced persons

457
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
and

458
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,840
Nobody within this audience

459
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
Can describe it

460
00:36:52,440 --> 00:37:00,040
Be a refugee more than a person's who was from home and become a refugee

461
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,120
for instance

462
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:09,320
We all know about their slavery you read from the books how bad it is

463
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
demonizations and but

464
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,840
If you tell me to explain to you

465
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
You will be in tears

466
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,760
different from what you read in the book because

467
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
there are certain things that a

468
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:35,400
Person have to withhold it within inside you cannot throw it out

469
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,640
Nobody should be a refugee

470
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
What should be a displaced persons?

471
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,640
That's my

472
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,640
opinions and

473
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,200
If that's the case why we have a

474
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:58,960
Flow millions and millions of refugees again at the time when we talk about

475
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,280
Globalizations and so on and we have the beautiful organization here talk about the issues

476
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,480
Which they supposed to be responsible about the UN

477
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,800
We sometimes make me to be disappointed

478
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,520
Of the UN how it move away from the principles of the university declaration of the human rights

479
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,960
When you have and you mentioned in southern students

480
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,560
Where at the moment with speaking we have about

481
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
four millions

482
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
southern Sudanese

483
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
our refugees

484
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Question is why?

485
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,120
Yes

486
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,080
southern Sudan has been from refugees to the refugees

487
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:54,080
Since the time of independent of sedans in 1965

488
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,720
The war has been going on and on and off and on and so on in other words

489
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,000
From the refugees to the refugees to the refugees

490
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,640
Even those those who find better like me

491
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,360
There is nothing to replace home

492
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,880
I remember when I went back to

493
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,880
southern Sudan

494
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:29,040
The place where there is nothing absolutely nothing there is no running water. There is toilet. There is no nothing absolutely, you know it

495
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
But I feel

496
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
something joy

497
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,800
I feel like even that I didn't eat for a day

498
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,600
There is no hunger because I feel full

499
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,880
Of home

500
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,480
It is not compared to my daughter, which was born here if I took her over there

501
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,840
There's no connections. She will be like I'm going home

502
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,920
Which is where he's supposed to be so

503
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,520
the point I'm trying to make I

504
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,440
think we

505
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
have to

506
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,440
have

507
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,440
a commons of

508
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Humanity in us

509
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Where we have to look at?

510
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,040
The problem what make people become refugees

511
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
Sometimes it is very complicated

512
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,080
To explain to the person who was not but to me for instance if people of southern Sudan

513
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,280
Become refugees then there is somebody is responsible

514
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:36,200
The father of the house of southern Sudan is responsible

515
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,440
It is in my house if my kids running around then who is going to be blamed

516
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
It have to be me as a father

517
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,560
Somebody have to say and say we have to hold these call these person and explain to us

518
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,800
like

519
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,720
this

520
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,080
Father why his kids are running around

521
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,520
making thing difficult for the others and

522
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,440
That's it, you know, I feel very strongly that

523
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,320
the solutions to any

524
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
Crisis where

525
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,820
vis-a-vis

526
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,680
Immigrants and refugees is it's not to bring them into your house

527
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
The solution have to be home

528
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,880
Because bringing it to your house is not a solution at all

529
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,360
The question if if it is a solution, how many you are willing to take?

530
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,240
Because yes, there is

531
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,920
Go to East and Asia there are maybe a hundred a million the one to come in your house

532
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,480
Go to Africa. There's another hundred million go to Europe go to

533
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:52,400
Anyway in the world if your place is a better place for these problems

534
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
How many you willing to take?

535
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,560
And that's why I feel very strongly always

536
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Where the refugees came from

537
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,880
We have to address it what made them to be a refuge now the world talk about the refugees of Syria. Yes, I

538
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
Personally half as a lasset

539
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,520
He's responsible if he's responsible, how can we let him?

540
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,360
replace destroyed life of millions, and he is one person's

541
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:35,320
And then now we have a crisis the problem blaming I was why you're not taking 10 and why you're not taking 20 and why you're not taking 30

542
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:42,760
Why we don't even take one man out and let people stay in where God given right?

543
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,200
Do you think that there's a difference and this is to the whole group

544
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,800
Between those who feel they have to leave their homeland because of famine or drought or

545
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,400
Some uncontrollable nature aspect versus a

546
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,920
power dynamic versus a totalitarian

547
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:18,720
Submission aspect because I I would imagine that the way the psyche processes that is quite different

548
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,280
It's one thing to be you know upset

549
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,640
I mean we know that the river is drying comes back to us, but it's a different thing

550
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,480
Then let's saying someone from another

551
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:36,240
cult within your own religion or a tribe within your own country push you

552
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,360
for survival and I wonder

553
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:46,040
Have there been studies of the different kinds of trauma in that regard?

554
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,800
Did you see anything different from the Afghans and the Syrians for instance and

555
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,880
So I guess I'm struck because how the psyche processes it is

556
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,560
very different from how the UN and

557
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:12,240
International law codifies it right so at the camps that I was at the Syrian refugees were given

558
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,640
very different

559
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:21,880
resources and treatment then at another camp where the Iraqis and Afghans were

560
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,680
because

561
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,680
the Afghans and

562
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,800
Iraqis were not going to be eligible for

563
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,480
refugee status because they weren't considered to have fled as war time

564
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,040
refugees whereas the Syrians

565
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:45,600
Were going to be entitled for refugee status therefore their children got to go to Greek schools

566
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,920
They lived in very different kinds of circumstances in terms of the psyche

567
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,640
I think that they did understand that they had a different status

568
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,880
Which was one that was more prospective

569
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,920
You know they were able to look toward their future and see a different place

570
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,520
I mean to your point Simon the Iraqis and the Afghans knew that ultimately

571
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,480
I think they were going to have to go back home and in a different way than you mean it

572
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:22,040
I think which is that going back home is a kind of healing return. They didn't see it that way

573
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,320
Because it wasn't going to be that way for them

574
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:31,680
So I think that that's a real difference in how people are treated as refugees

575
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:38,040
You know those conditions under which they left. Yeah, I totally agree that the differences are

576
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,440
artificial differences that we impose all

577
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,760
displacement is because of inequality

578
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,200
It's all

579
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,440
All a power dynamic

580
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,280
People who came

581
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,040
You know

582
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,560
My grandparents came because there was less there and more here

583
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,640
That's a power dynamic. It was unfair. Who's wrong?

584
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:12,000
You know, it's all because of injustice and then we compound it by making

585
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:24,960
Categories, I think you know when we treat people with trauma, I mean to me

586
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,920
And I'm not a researcher so I just make this stuff up

587
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:42,160
You know, but the big difference is the level of helplessness that was involved right and that a traumatic

588
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,960
You know, which is why sexual violence is so difficult to get over because it's it you've lost control over what comes into your own body

589
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,960
right it's just

590
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,760
So the the level of

591
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,640
disruption and and

592
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,520
so if I have been

593
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:13,400
Raised knowing that the world is unjust my whole life and then I'm going to have to make decisions based on that injustice and do the best

594
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,000
I can I

595
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
might be less traumatized

596
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,600
when I

597
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,840
move

598
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,840
to to save my

599
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,840
So then if I grew up thinking

600
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,860
There is maybe some you know that there is justice in order in the world and then I

601
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,120
violently find out that there isn't and have to flee in the middle of the night

602
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,400
however, I would say that all of this is

603
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,440
power dynamics and that

604
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,360
we have a world of globalization and

605
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:55,360
All it does is give us more information about how unequal it is, you know that now any kid

606
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,720
in

607
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:05,120
Wherever me and mark can be on his Facebook seeing what other people have that he doesn't have you know

608
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,840
That that's what globalization has given us and not read distribution

609
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,840
Distribution do you think the way?

610
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:22,560
Your topic and say you have the power now to change dynamic is there even a solution to that

611
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,840
Yes, I mean, I think you know, I think we're always

612
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:41,920
Trying I mean, I think humanity has always tried to evolve situations of greater justice and greater distribution

613
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,560
You would just not going to interrupt anyone. No, no, please just it, but I would challenge them

614
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:54,320
Yeah, I don't think that that's hardwired into us by the way, and I say that without evidence except as a historian

615
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
Yeah

616
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,440
Because Simon was saying we should let everyone go back

617
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,920
But the conflict brought people away from me and

618
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:12,160
And we were saying that people want to protect what they have so why should I give more

619
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,120
Texts more money from what I'm earning lose my income for other people that's coming I

620
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,640
Want to protect it so so the

621
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,480
This feeling of honor I've

622
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,680
Two meanings right and I think it's the source of the conflict

623
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,200
First it's like it's like really

624
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,800
pure feeling of this is where I belong and

625
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,360
The other is this is mine and not yours, right?

626
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,320
So it's also create a boundary between one and another

627
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:50,240
and this is why people if you take serious for example, it's not like an

628
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:58,720
Asset that is in power it's a minority the alloy that controlled the majority of the Sunic and

629
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,240
They know that if they will lose

630
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,960
The Sunic without their majority going to

631
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,640
Pinance them so it's fight of their life

632
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,560
and it's also their own and

633
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,280
and

634
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,480
And the question because we cannot fix it from the outside

635
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,960
And then we cannot open the borders for everyone that want to come

636
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:31,280
In this dynamic I think we a bit stuck I as liberal as we do not know how to fix it and

637
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,800
as conservative they don't know how to fix it then and

638
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,360
Sometimes I'm feeling that

639
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,840
We don't really discuss

640
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,240
the complexity of the situation and

641
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:51,920
And we go to the place that is our comfort zone we believe everyone are equal for example that

642
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,880
Something that we can operate with but we don't know how to make it a pen I don't know how to fix it I

643
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,160
Think there is something she mentioned about when she passed all of us

644
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:13,800
but the kind of refugees and immigrants because

645
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,640
There are too so many layers when it comes to

646
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:27,680
Immigrants or those who the refugees there are those who want to go to choose for the better life

647
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,600
there are those who

648
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,240
false

649
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,120
to become

650
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:39,240
displaced persons and this is the real refugees in my opinion and

651
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,560
And come down to what I said before

652
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:48,240
about why a person have to be refugees

653
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,880
What is the problems and if we?

654
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,120
Genuineing I'm not talking about we talk about the the global rule that which is today

655
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,040
Focus and invest in

656
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,040
in solutions

657
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,760
of the crisis of very refugees to

658
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,640
diagnose why they become people become refugees I

659
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,520
Things will be better than investing in

660
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:25,080
Sending the refugees things and so on and so on and so on it will be less cheaper by

661
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:34,760
If saw the students refugees are four millions and the father of that saw the student in the problems

662
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,560
And and we focus on that person

663
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:46,360
Why he became a problem and identify and address this and solve these things I think we will save ourself

664
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,360
You know time and energy and resources

665
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,640
of debating one another and a qi you know taking and why

666
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,680
You refuse into text for instance

667
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,280
It my opinion is

668
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,080
the world should have to look and

669
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,320
invest in

670
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,120
Solving the problem what met the refugees as refugees

671
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:18,980
I guess what you're saying is who is this for who's the world who is the world the United do nothing nations

672
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,980
Because

673
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:29,700
Based on it is this true. That's why we keep you know going because we are not they are there because all the

674
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:36,900
The country the nations where the problem come they sit where and they sit in one place, which is the UN

675
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,140
Let's take two examples listen to him in Iraq

676
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:47,220
It was governed by the tactic the capital right Saddam Hussein the US went in

677
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,660
To cover the country replace it with like a democratic

678
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,860
government and the country collapsed

679
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:01,460
I don't think something good came of the Iraq war. Maybe Isis came out of it. Hey take Syria

680
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,580
Obama was about to attack Syria and

681
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:09,820
At the end he decided to back off and not to put military ground on Syria, right?

682
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:15,580
And then the lesson came into Syria are they fixing it? Who will fix Syria?

683
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,580
I will fix the luck it's

684
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,640
As you think it's like the people in the place

685
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:25,020
Need to fix their country and if and if they cannot

686
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:31,340
Because the power dynamic and I agree everything is about power dynamics is too complicated

687
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,540
It's very difficult from the outside to fix it

688
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:39,540
and and and now we really stuck in in in the crisis and

689
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:43,260
And because everything is connected. It's one thing

690
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:47,180
Syria on you like it coming out to Europe and I would say in Europe and

691
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:54,060
exchanging the US and we are all part of this dynamic because it's a global world in the centers everything is connected and

692
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,540
It's a very serious

693
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,220
Problem that we don't know how to fix

694
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,780
And we have for a long time

695
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,900
To go back to barbers question about

696
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:13,700
Is there a difference between people leaving for one circumstance or another?

697
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:21,060
Obviously people who leave because their lives are at risk are one end of a continuum and

698
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:27,300
People who leave because there's some differential that they think that life could be better

699
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:32,980
Somewhere else are at the other end, but people have been leaving for both of those reasons

700
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:43,300
Leading places for a very long time whether it's the idiot sons of English aristocrats who realize there was nothing for them

701
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:48,520
If they stayed in England in the in the early 17th century and wound up

702
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:54,820
Populating the American or leading the American south or whether it was people whose whose

703
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:00,260
livelihoods disappeared as Europe industrialized in the late 19th century

704
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:04,900
Whether it's people who fled a flood of war in none of those power

705
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,740
Embalances has anyone figured out how to stabilize

706
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:19,060
Sending societies different as the dynamic involved in the sending was I don't want anyone to think that

707
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:27,260
Leaving England because you're a cavalier as opposed to a Puritan is the same as as leaving Syria

708
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,420
Because your life is in imminent danger

709
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:36,380
Well, yeah, I mean maybe this is going too far off track, but one thing I've always been

710
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,740
perplexed by is

711
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,060
the desire to colonize

712
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,900
right like that's like

713
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,540
Because we're always dealing with people who are fleeing

714
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:54,140
You know like who don't want to leave home because they're fleeing or then we talk

715
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:59,620
You know, so that's a refugee and an immigrant is somebody who thinks there's something better on the other side

716
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,620
I mean, what's a colonizer like that's really sick

717
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:09,100
Which is how this country started like it like what's that that you leave your home to go take somebody else's?

718
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,220
How does that fit into this?

719
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:18,740
Sorry, I'm like way off, but you know when I go to these places. I I really it really puzzles me

720
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,540
Like why do people want to take other people's homes?

721
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:31,540
Instead of improving their own because that's what colonialism is answering your own question your question was

722
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:38,620
Why don't we find a way to improve societies where they are and the answer is we haven't

723
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,260
And we haven't for a very long time

724
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:46,100
Colonization is one element to that one aspect of it

725
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,820
And I think that is that this the

726
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:56,300
The argument should be focused on and that's why I said before there is nothing like home

727
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:02,100
For instance, and I seen the works of doctors without borders

728
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:09,260
In many places in the south of Sudan even before the peace agreement between the north and the south

729
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:13,700
I always take a risk to go to into the war zones

730
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,700
And

731
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,340
sometimes

732
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,340
We have to carry the patience

733
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,380
for the whole day and

734
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:29,340
Reach to the where the deltas without borderized station I in the midnight and

735
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:35,420
I remember I was in northern by the south which is not enough and I

736
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,660
and

737
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,660
The child and a mom

738
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:46,740
They just felt six and you know something had to be done all day and we have two doctors with us

739
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,340
but there's no medicines and

740
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:54,020
According to them if we find a medicine these people will

741
00:58:54,940 --> 00:59:00,140
Will survive if we are not going to find a medicine then within 48 hours they

742
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,060
So we have to walk

743
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,500
for

744
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,140
nine hours

745
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,820
To reach where the doctors without border so in my opinion

746
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:14,340
The investments of the argument should be finding a solution

747
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:22,260
And wish that the doctors without borders and instead of they because they like their life sometimes are in dangerous

748
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,860
You know it. I don't need to tell you how many

749
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,540
your workers

750
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,740
in in in my band was kills

751
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,180
in in in in because the

752
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:36,820
The environment is hostile environments

753
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:43,900
So the solution have to be invested in finding a solution where they is and the doctor without border instead of risking

754
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:48,740
They have to go there and train a person. Okay, and instead of you relying on

755
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:54,780
Tradition medicines which probably you know there are people in my band are lying

756
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:58,860
They're on medicine because there is no other way to find

757
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:03,780
Doctors, so this is where the focus in my opinion should be today

758
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,540
in a state of

759
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,100
taking

760
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:13,940
Four million Syrian refugees whom are now need to get our who already refugees to take them somewhere

761
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:20,500
To my opinion. That's not a solution to take four million in southern Sudanese who are now refugees in their own country

762
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:25,980
Is not a solution we have in Uganda one and a half million southern Sudanese

763
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:29,660
They're living in in in life

764
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,860
I don't want to describe it

765
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,060
There is no dignity by

766
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:40,460
Being a dispersed person in a place which is not your own

767
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:44,360
For you to survive you have to do ABC

768
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:48,620
And you just figured out what do I mean by ABC to survive?

769
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:54,860
But if we find a solution to their home believe it or not I would write there

770
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:59,460
Be in my village you mentioned before and

771
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:05,060
Figured out how would I survive whether I want to go to the river in Nile to get a fish?

772
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:09,580
in instead of be in an hostile environment where

773
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,980
There is no dignity of my child

774
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:20,940
There is no sense of human of home I become homeless and helpless

775
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:26,020
So I think that's this that's what we in the world have to be addressing

776
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:29,900
And I'm just you know who am I to to to to to tell the world

777
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:39,580
There are so many different levels to address here and it seems to me though that it's

778
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:48,540
Also really important to address the ethical practice of how we respond to people in need

779
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:52,820
Even while maybe the primary

780
01:01:53,460 --> 01:02:01,300
Response needs to be to fix the situation because there are always going to be people in need on the sidewalk

781
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,980
Right in front of this building that are displaced and that are homeless

782
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:09,980
So the question becomes I think how do we ethically respond?

783
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,420
You know we don't have any behavioral

784
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:20,100
A con economist on the panel who could explain game theory and why we take from other people

785
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:26,140
You know like they have to have something and we want it so we take it and it would be maybe

786
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:30,220
Interesting to have somebody like that on this panel

787
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:37,980
But how do we how do we respond ethically with the few resources that we have?

788
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,900
and I continue to you know to

789
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:51,420
Reflect as I hear you talk about the primacy of home and how that may change for any of us depending upon where

790
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:56,780
We've been raised. I mean in Queens where I'm from I

791
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:04,980
Don't feel a really powerful affiliation with Queens as if I'd be ripped out of my home

792
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:08,940
If you know to like God and then God thank you

793
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:16,780
So, you know what is it about certain circumstances that evoke that really powerful

794
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:23,860
Elemental affiliation where if you did not live there then you're homeless

795
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:29,060
You know that's a really powerful thing to say and what are the

796
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:33,460
various conditions that shift for people

797
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:39,740
You know that makes some people have that primary affiliation and others not

798
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:45,500
But is it really the case that it's not if if we will take you and

799
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,020
Departure out of the US and

800
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:52,700
Africa what you feel displaced not from Queens to Brooklyn

801
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,940
Yeah, I would feel yeah if I had to move to Staten Island

802
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,940
I think

803
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,340
Really displaced

804
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:12,580
Yeah, so who are your people right? That's always the question is how how do you constitute a community of people around you?

805
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:19,340
You know you're asking what kinds of resources are available actually pointing to how few resources there are

806
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:25,540
It's really how few resources we make available because resources are

807
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:31,780
in in the case of homes for those seeking better lives

808
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,020
They're nearly

809
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:40,300
There's there are so many that they're uncountable

810
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:45,540
We we had from Simon the numbers of refugees

811
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:52,540
4 million here 4 million there those are large numbers until you realize that this country alone

812
01:04:52,540 --> 01:05:01,980
Between 1865 and 1914 took in 25 million people that's a big and got nowhere near full

813
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,060
Nowhere near full

814
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:12,300
So the resources are there what's missing is the empathy the will the willingness to

815
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:15,220
Not so much share

816
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:21,220
Because with one mindset we realize that we are enriched by movement

817
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:26,240
we've we've talked about people who are displaced and and

818
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,580
moving and

819
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:33,580
Seeking something we can shift that to the society that

820
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:36,980
societies that in the past have welcomed them and

821
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:44,460
Part of our argument that the tenement museum and all history is an argument by the way science is not I understand

822
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:53,020
that you free but part of our argument is that almost anything we could point to in terms of this country's

823
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:57,340
Prosperity its culture its dynamism

824
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:02,780
Literally its health is the result of immigration and

825
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:11,860
To cut ourselves off from that now you don't need to repaul Krugman or David Brooks, though I do

826
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:19,020
To to to hear the argument pulled out of the literature that if we do this we do

827
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,100
ourselves

828
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:29,780
Really to economic not just lack of growth, but ultimately in significance and boredom and well that too. Yeah

829
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,740
People like us are blessed to be given an

830
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:41,740
opportunity

831
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:50,140
And we cannot take this for granted and that's why some of us we

832
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,700
Felt that being here is a place

833
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:58,380
but at the same time we have to stay and

834
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:03,780
Look after those who are not

835
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:12,740
Fortunate to get what we get and we become the voice of those who have no voice

836
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:19,340
We speak on people who have cannot speak for themselves for instance one time I have

837
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:25,140
About 300,000 southern Sudanese

838
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:33,380
flee from Egypt after they was attacked by the police in a gift since that

839
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:35,820
In front of the UN in Cairo

840
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:44,700
Because what happened was that there was being considered as refugees without knowing where they're gonna go and then when southern Sudan's

841
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:51,500
Peace was being signed between the north and the south all the issue of the refuge through their name already there they

842
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:59,380
Nobody talk about it because nobody sure what would be the future of southern Sudan is going to be a piece within or

843
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:03,420
Independence or separate to countries

844
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,380
So they want to know and then they went and you know

845
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:10,380
peacefully camps in front of the UN in Cairo and then

846
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,860
The UN call on this Egyptian security

847
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:16,620
We're almost 100 and something people were skills

848
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:21,260
So they they they felt that they are not welcome in

849
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:29,460
Egypt and then some of them takes a risky journey to a crossing the border from Egypt all the way to Israel and

850
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:34,620
The numbers at that time but 28 people who went there

851
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:43,580
We got information there are southern Sudanese being detained because they are carrying the Sudanese passport saying that you cannot

852
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:46,380
You can go anywhere, but you cannot go to?

853
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:51,420
Bela daradu the enemy country that's Israel to them

854
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:54,700
So Israelis of course there was very concerned

855
01:08:55,340 --> 01:09:00,420
People coming without knowing then they're coming from and a country which is hostile to them

856
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:02,820
So they want to know who are they and so on

857
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:10,420
I have to get involved some there because they cannot reach to the levels of the government to

858
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:16,740
To to tell they the the the the Israeli that these are not your enemy. These are people who just

859
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,620
Run for their life. They run from southern Sudan

860
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:27,180
They end up in Egypt assuming that there is safety there they're being attacked in Egypt and that's why they came here

861
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:32,420
They are not even threat to you

862
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:38,180
Because if you ask them that do you have a problem with Israel?

863
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,900
They're gonna say no, that's why they came here. So

864
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:45,540
I'm begging you let them give them a chance

865
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,740
Yes, that peace agreement until

866
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,140
Six years from now

867
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:58,900
We'll southern Sudan probably will become independence even nobody believe me then so I have to be loving on their

868
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,820
on their behalf and we end up with

869
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,420
30,000

870
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,420
southern Sudanese

871
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:13,100
People from the north people from the arforean and the issue of refugees in Israel become a crisis at the same time

872
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:18,500
But I have maintained my position with them that these are people

873
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,260
Who are not seeking to be here?

874
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,460
Believe it or not

875
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:27,500
One sudden Sudan become independent all these people are going to go back

876
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:34,180
Because to me as I said before there is nothing like home and you cannot replace home because

877
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:37,340
Running away from where you was born is not a solution

878
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,220
Then who is going to remain there?

879
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:46,620
If that's the case then let find any place where there are problems in the world and take everybody out of there

880
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:50,620
And then they're going to be a crisis where we putting them to so

881
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:57,620
Eventually they was given a chance of opportunity and so on and then southern Sudan to come independence

882
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:03,900
And all these are refugees who happened from southern Sudan all of them are back in southern Sudan

883
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,900
Even though very unfortunately

884
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:11,620
We didn't respect what happened in southern Sudan today should have happened

885
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:15,420
So come to the to the to the argument of refugees

886
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:19,780
the solution always have to be home and

887
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:29,220
We have to address why a person have to go. Yes, if there is a way where we can give him because we are human being

888
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:32,420
Sometimes even we

889
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:39,180
Hear when somebody begging for something you always if you have you feel some kind of humanity

890
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,500
We give even the law say that you don't do that

891
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:50,140
But I'm a human being my conscious telling me that I have to do that and that's even why people like me was given

892
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:55,580
Opportunity in this country and that's why people like me should not take that opportunity

893
01:11:55,580 --> 01:12:00,340
And then look for my own affairs and instead of looking for the affairs of the others

894
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:04,260
I think Simon there's a piece underneath that that you're really addressing

895
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:11,060
Though which is a sense of choice. I mean some people would choose to leave

896
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,420
Some people would choose to go back

897
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:19,300
but the most profound sense of displacement is when you don't feel you have choice and

898
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:24,060
I mean I probably would be among those

899
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:29,580
Would flee as I did from Rochester, New York, you know, and

900
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,060
Others would certainly want to go homes

901
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:40,940
But the issue is that that sense of autonomy and that's what gets taken away in terms of

902
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,740
the displacement the refugee

903
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:49,940
Situation it is absolutely and if you look at that those who was given a choice

904
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:57,260
The majority will then will prefer to go home if there's a my place will be a place where I will

905
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:03,380
For instance, and I will speak for myself as an American sitting with this suit

906
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:14,620
What for bend me not to go back to saw the students and in my village and make that place a place to look like United States

907
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:21,940
If there is environment safety and peace and security in that place and

908
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:30,020
That's why we have to focus on what make people to become a refugee because those who flee of the conflicts

909
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:36,020
Their numbers are you compare to those who flee with with a choice of

910
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,660
Immigrant or better life

911
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:43,340
Those who have been driven by when I talk about millions in southern Sudan

912
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:45,340
These are people who did a choose

913
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:50,060
Compared to somebody who want to okay. I want to go to Brussels for instance

914
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:56,500
But these two four millions if you ask them where a Brussels data have no idea

915
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:01,660
So we leave the issue of me immigrant those who want to leave for individuals

916
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,940
Who want to take a risk a gambling to?

917
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,060
to explore the world

918
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:11,540
but a human being should not be

919
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:12,540
a

920
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:20,820
Refugees well, I think we're talking about the difference between choice and force that and the power dynamic as you were saying

921
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:27,660
I mean you're a you you chose to you chose to move to a country different from the country of your birth

922
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:31,260
so you're talking you come from a

923
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:34,500
Perspective that is different than this

924
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:42,380
Yeah, this is why I'm not a few three I because someone is right. I wasn't forced out. It's a very different

925
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:50,060
It was your choice it was my

926
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:54,580
I will never say that I'm in the future. I mean that would be like email to say

927
01:14:54,580 --> 01:15:03,660
so I had options in my country and I had options over and I choose to come and explode them and

928
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:10,140
I'm following my dreams and the society give me opportunity to follow my dreams

929
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:15,900
I have only to be thankful. I cannot do and that is not a crisis. That's not the crisis

930
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:19,860
Refugees who might be in this place. Yeah

931
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:25,780
I have a question I want us to get into before we wrap up and ask for questions

932
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:32,820
Were you surprised by the outpouring of support in this country?

933
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,620
for

934
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:38,060
Organizations that deal with refugees and human rights

935
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,500
ACLU

936
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:45,220
International Rescue Committee doctors at that borders when they were threatened I

937
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:54,220
I one has the sense that people found that they really had a value in the acceptance and

938
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:59,780
Facilitating of others and that that but it took a crisis it took a challenge

939
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:04,700
Before that really came out. Could you could you address that?

940
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:08,460
Morris sure I think that what you're speaking to is that

941
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:18,300
What has for a long time been the dominant American narrative the story we tell ourselves about who we are and where we come from and

942
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:26,060
probably a majority of Americans believe that the immigrant story is their story and a

943
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:31,020
Conscious

944
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:38,660
denial of that narrative threatens their sense of who they are and there and really their their

945
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:49,180
Deepest values the question is how long that can be maintained. It's it's it's not just a matter of being able to

946
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:58,460
Mobilize people or or have them write checks. There's a political system out there that doesn't necessarily respond to the majority or

947
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:00,500
responds to a

948
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,500
majority that's constructed and

949
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,940
reconstructed and is

950
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:09,700
There are powers that play here that threaten that narrative

951
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:14,780
So where we are right now at least when it comes to the stories we tell ourselves

952
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:20,740
To storytelling and empathy at that level. We're in a good place

953
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:24,820
What our feet what my fear is will we be in that good place?

954
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:28,380
Five years from now a generation from now

955
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,900
That's what's scary. I was

956
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:38,980
joking to my wife who's sitting behind me earlier today that while there we're being part we are rightfully paranoid

957
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,780
about what's going on today as

958
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:45,180
Opposed to the 60s, which is the last time I recall

959
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:52,740
This level of oh my god. They're out to get us this time the FBI and the CIA on our side

960
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:55,620
Who would have thought?

961
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,620
Oh

962
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:07,740
Yeah, I just think of the power of visual storytelling in the media in in terms of how it I

963
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:14,580
Think galvanized a response for people. I think about that now famous

964
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:21,940
image news image of the little boy in Aleppo sitting in the back of an ambulance and

965
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:25,700
And how so many people saw in that little boy

966
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,900
children and

967
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:37,140
vulnerable children and and trauma you know for once a face of what trauma looked like you know to just see that boy

968
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:41,460
So disconnected from whatever was in front of him and it really

969
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:49,180
Galvanized people as as well as I think the image that had come out in the news of maybe a few months before of

970
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:59,100
The little child who drowned on lispost right and how that got people speaking in a way that we weren't quite speaking before

971
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:06,340
And have you have you seen an outpouring of more attention?

972
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:15,220
Um, yeah, I mean we're all raking in the cash. Yeah, but I mean there um, you

973
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:27,060
Know even this nation of immigrants thing is a story because the history is its

974
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:31,620
a

975
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:39,220
Country that colonized and other people and then imported a lot of people to involuntary slavery to build a country. That's

976
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:43,580
That's this what this country is. Yeah, okay

977
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:48,900
And then some people immigrated after all of that, you know

978
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:59,460
Um, so even that's a story and the fact that we can see the face of trauma in that little Syrian boy, but we can't see it

979
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:09,620
When a child is shot by the police in our or by a vigilante, you know in our own communities

980
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,180
Um, so it's

981
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:19,460
It's always difficult as much as I'm I will go to my grave being an optimist

982
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:23,620
They are never gonna take that away from me, you know because I really believe that's the last thing

983
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:33,460
You know, I've been rereading Victor Frankle a lot. You know, I really um, they can't have that, you know, um

984
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:37,060
but um

985
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,260
Where am I going with it, you know that it's

986
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:47,700
It's that these are illusory victories, I guess, and that we still need the big victory, you know the one

987
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:53,060
And who is the we that's going to drive? I don't know

988
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,980
That's going to redistribute everything

989
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:02,180
Equitably and sustainably and

990
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,180
Make it snow in February again and

991
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,740
Um

992
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:12,100
I don't know but um so so

993
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,140
Um

994
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:20,100
You know not to be cynical but just to be accepting of the fact that there's always

995
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,300
a lot of things going on at once and so that the

996
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:32,260
um outpouring of goodwill towards refugees and immigrants is um, I

997
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:35,940
I

998
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:42,580
Is a lot due to compassion and a lot due to self-preservation that I I

999
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:47,940
I want to be sure that we are not this guy, you know, I want to be sure

1000
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:53,700
I um went to the woman's march with a sign saying

1001
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,900
white women we need to do better

1002
01:21:57,460 --> 01:22:01,700
Right because 50 and 53 percent of white women voted for trump

1003
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:04,980
And white women would say to me really

1004
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:09,220
But not me I didn't

1005
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:16,660
And to me that's our country, you know, so I want to be at this march to be sure that that's not me

1006
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:19,780
You know, but what

1007
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:22,900
What are we doing to change the conditions that create these things?

1008
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:28,180
It's just really what you're saying, you know, what are we doing to create the to change the conditions that create displacement

1009
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:33,860
What are we doing to to change the conditions that created this

1010
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:41,860
Hopefully very temporary regime that we're facing and so so is this outpouring of

1011
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:44,580
of

1012
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:46,420
funding and goodwill

1013
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:52,260
Really changing the the conditions and I don't want to down I think it's great

1014
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:56,420
You know, I don't want to say I don't want to be cynical about that because

1015
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:59,940
Maybe this is what's going to get

1016
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:04,820
Everybody thinking and and willing to mobilize on a whole new level

1017
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:06,340
um

1018
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:08,340
You know, I I

1019
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:09,540
I

1020
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:11,540
You know

1021
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:12,740
I

1022
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:18,660
Have seen that in my life, you know, gay people can get married in this country now. I mean

1023
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:25,940
In my lifetime, you said you people thought you were crazy to say that south Sudan would be an independent country

1024
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:28,260
I mean we have seen things that were

1025
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:32,180
unthinkable, you know, I mean we

1026
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:42,340
You know, I think we we forget thing and we forget like when HIV hit this city what was going on? I mean that that felt like

1027
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:45,860
You know an unimaginable

1028
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:54,580
Um and and the reactions and the othering talk about othering right. I mean the the pariah, you know, and

1029
01:23:56,420 --> 01:24:00,100
These things change they do go for the better and you know, um

1030
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:03,060
and so I just

1031
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:06,900
This this is part of going towards

1032
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:13,860
The better, but it's not it. I guess, you know that the outpouring is just a little part of it. I guess I don't

1033
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:21,700
Yeah, well to be more inclusive here in the room. Um, I would like to ask anyone who would

1034
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:25,380
Of course, and you know

1035
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:32,580
For what this country has given to me and I seen it's given to the others in the world

1036
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:39,940
I still believe that the generosity that come from america

1037
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:44,260
Will steal there and I'm very optimistic

1038
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,860
Based on what I

1039
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:50,820
Have seen that american has given to the others

1040
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:55,940
To the point that you mentioned even today we have in a book where

1041
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:02,500
American can bring in the settlement program 250,000 a year

1042
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:07,380
There is no side things in any other countries that we have

1043
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,460
you know

1044
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:11,460
Numbers which is being fixed

1045
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:16,180
Uh, you go to england. They don't have that thing you go to german. You go to anywhere

1046
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:23,940
But in america there is even sometime go beyond that so I'm really uh, remain better optimist of american in generosity

1047
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:28,100
And and and and we have that's why we're talking about that. We should not

1048
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:33,780
Try as in a country or immigrants. We should not take things for granted. Let's look

1049
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:37,620
After others who have no voice and let be their voice

1050
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:39,620
Okay, thank you very much

1051
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:44,660
So, um, if anyone would like to ask a question

1052
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:50,260
I'm going to keep this constructed to questions not not statements

1053
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:57,940
And I have to apologize in advance if I have to cut off anybody, but i'm going to if I need to

1054
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,860
So

1055
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,860
Please would you begin for us?

1056
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,420
Yes, um

1057
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:08,980
I'm probably i'm not allowed to say this but I really want to make the moderator feel a little better

1058
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:12,420
Only about 12 percent of white women voted for donald trump

1059
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:15,780
You know if you go back only 50 percent of the population voted

1060
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:20,340
25 percent of the population voted for trump another 25

1061
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:26,180
Maybe half the women now the question thank you all so much, but I do have a quick question

1062
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:29,540
Thank you for allowing me to say that. I really want her to feel better. Yeah

1063
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:32,740
the um

1064
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:34,740
No, I want to feel better. I want to do better

1065
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,540
Do you think

1066
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:43,860
And you're so you each have so much wisdom. Do you think that?

1067
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:49,540
That we as americans have become so in your to to suffering

1068
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:55,860
To displacement to violence to trauma that that has a very

1069
01:26:56,500 --> 01:27:01,220
Serious consequences on the way we respond to it and if the answer is yes

1070
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:03,700
What if anything are we or can we do about?

1071
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:07,380
indifference towards trauma violence

1072
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:11,380
I'll defer

1073
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:18,500
I'm supposed to be the moderator, but i'm going to put my two cents in here. No, no, no. I don't mind

1074
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:21,940
Tupperay. I don't have that kind of complex, but

1075
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:23,700
um

1076
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:26,660
I think the capacity to feel shame

1077
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:33,780
Has been extremely important. I think the outpouring of support has come from a feeling of shame

1078
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:38,900
and a feeling of shame of what goes on within our own culture

1079
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:45,620
That we really have to allow ourselves to feel it is an impetus and a stimulus, but i'd like to hear

1080
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,940
americans

1081
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:49,700
through philanthropy

1082
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:55,700
Probably give only tens of billions of dollars a year to deal specifically with

1083
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:59,860
Those issues the issues of those who are underserved

1084
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:06,180
The issues of those who are in some ways unfortunate that's not matched anywhere in the world

1085
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:13,460
I would not make the case that we're that it's the best way or that it's effective totally effective

1086
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:16,820
But if you're talking about people's feelings

1087
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:22,740
That somehow there is something unjust out there and they ought to address it

1088
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:27,140
And offer a lot of people in this country address it through their pocketbooks

1089
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:40,740
There is a feeling that something dark happened and I think we feel it and we are afraid of it now from the same

1090
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:46,900
And we all I think this is there is a lot of fear and most of us came today to talk about it

1091
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:50,740
And I think it's only the beginning because it's

1092
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:53,860
It happened a few months only two months ago

1093
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,500
Even less I

1094
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:00,020
So I think when at the beginning, I think it's not going to change quickly

1095
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:04,420
I think it's going to be way darker than it is now

1096
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:08,020
So we all wore it and we all think how to change and

1097
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:12,740
I think we need to act as you are doing basically

1098
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:16,660
You're going out and trying to change and someone trying to change and

1099
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:18,340
Only by

1100
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:21,620
We tend to be active with in a way and

1101
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:25,540
Expecting that it would be a long process

1102
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:28,660
Maybe we will win at the end

1103
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:32,020
You did mention, you know

1104
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,380
There's always

1105
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:39,220
A homeless person in front of us, you know outside the like

1106
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:44,660
We can all start there like today, you know

1107
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:49,620
Like you don't have to send a hundred dollars to doctors without borders

1108
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:53,780
You can give a dollar to that person and I really believe

1109
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:57,460
You know, that's

1110
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,460
You know

1111
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:01,700
You know

1112
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:03,700
That's what we're doing to

1113
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,980
Whatever you called it, you know if we've been in your to suffering like

1114
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:11,460
Let's make sure let's they can't do that to us like they can't

1115
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:16,580
You know, we will defend our right to give a dollar to somebody who may not deserve it

1116
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,620
You know, they can't have that

1117
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,500
Sorry

1118
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,660
You should really make me set up

1119
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:33,540
We're comparing

1120
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:38,500
Americans attitudes towards immigration in the 1920s versus now

1121
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,500
Is the issue more

1122
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:46,340
Not so much the relative wealth of a country, but the amount of inequality in the country

1123
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:48,980
I've read that

1124
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:55,620
Well, any cause a major problem now and it hasn't been this bad since the 1920s. So maybe that's the common thread

1125
01:30:57,460 --> 01:31:04,340
It I would say yes inequalities in issue, but the displacement is the larger issue

1126
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:07,860
People by the 1920s who had

1127
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:13,860
Spent their lives and assumed that their futures would be in small towns in New Hampshire

1128
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:16,660
Or in farms on the Great Plains

1129
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:23,380
That had been ripped from them by economic change by

1130
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:29,300
The transformation the industrialization of agriculture by the rise of industry

1131
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:36,420
In the same way today. This isn't this is Joseph Stiglets's argument. This is their so

1132
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:39,540
People today

1133
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,540
Who are?

1134
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:51,300
Industrial workers or coal miners and those are the the constituencies we've heard most about in the last year

1135
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:55,700
Those folks have seen their world disappear

1136
01:31:55,700 --> 01:32:06,900
Their world is being displaced by Silicon Valley and all the best and the brightest coming in on h1b visas and disrupting everything

1137
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:15,060
All right, that's that's the similarity. It's it's uh, I don't think it's poverty and

1138
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:18,020
Much as I don't like inequality

1139
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:25,700
I don't think it's inequality either and by the way the 20s happened 10 years after the United States began to seriously

1140
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:32,500
Address the question of inequality to the progressive income tax and any number of other

1141
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:40,260
Literally progressive measures like laws against child labor. So the 20s were a good time if you're looking at the

1142
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:45,300
the trajectory towards social justice much better than now

1143
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:49,380
I think there's been a lot of science psychological studies that claim that

1144
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:58,020
Your relative well-being is not as important as how you compare other people in that in terms of their total happiness

1145
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:00,660
If everyone's poor

1146
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:05,620
Doesn't bother people as much as when you're poor and you see other people very wealthy

1147
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:13,060
And yet the people who most loudly speak against inheritance taxes are people with nothing

1148
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:16,180
So a lot

1149
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:20,340
I would like to believe that logic matters

1150
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:22,580
I've

1151
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:30,660
You know, I've got a PhD and demonstrated I could keep that keep a consistent thought through 300 pages of text

1152
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:33,460
Uh, I don't think it does

1153
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:40,900
I don't think if we if we tell them that it's their health insurance that they'll lose they won't do that

1154
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,900
They'll do that anyway

1155
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:47,220
So that's another issue why Americans vote against their own interest

1156
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:54,980
I want to address something Athena said

1157
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:59,380
That you believe very deeply that there is an innate empathy

1158
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:08,740
The people who do you believe that the concept of the other is also innate? It's been certainly through every civilization we know every time we know

1159
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:10,740
um

1160
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:15,860
Mm-hmm. What do you think of that? Yeah, maybe they go together. I don't know that's yeah. Yeah

1161
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:19,060
Unfortunately, um

1162
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:22,180
Yeah

1163
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:24,180
It's still shocking

1164
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:29,700
The you know and and how it meant I mean south to then is shocking how

1165
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:33,140
the

1166
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:36,500
People can slaughter each other after having fought so long for their

1167
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:43,780
Freedom from another entity that was slaughtering it's it's shocking. It's it's shocking

1168
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,020
um

1169
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:48,020
I don't know if you've read

1170
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:54,660
Maybe I'm going off on a tangent here, but Sebastian younger's uh latest thing about

1171
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:59,060
Um

1172
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:01,060
Yeah, tribe. Yeah, but that that um

1173
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:07,700
Um, oh no, it wasn't in that I was reading something else. Anyway, that's really interesting stuff in there about how

1174
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:10,420
the actually the

1175
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:16,340
Symptoms of PTSD are more from the the loss of connection than from the actual thing that happened to us

1176
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:20,580
And I see that in my work a lot my current work which is working with

1177
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,180
uh

1178
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:26,660
expatriates when they come home from very difficult situations and

1179
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:30,980
There's definitely a correlation between those who are still connected to a

1180
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:37,060
A base and those who have lost that connection from working all over the world so much that

1181
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:42,500
Totally I subscribe to that, but no, I was reading something else on combat by this

1182
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:44,340
um

1183
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:47,380
Bill clays piece in the times no his um

1184
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:54,100
vessel band or it's no it's anyway a guy who writes military stuff and um

1185
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:56,500
saying

1186
01:35:56,500 --> 01:36:02,340
And he's talking about resili- preparing warriors for resilience blah blah blah, but he's saying that there's um

1187
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:05,220
uh

1188
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:10,100
There is a taboo in all cultures against a human killing a human

1189
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:13,140
You know

1190
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:15,620
Yeah, yeah that guy. What's his name?

1191
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:19,220
Yeah him. Yeah, yeah, yeah

1192
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:21,220
Um

1193
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:26,980
Right, that's like that was a really that was soldiers on this on purpose and they

1194
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:30,020
They don't actually

1195
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:44,500
That's one aspect right but then and then that the trauma of killing somebody is not just a trauma

1196
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:49,300
It's a taboo trauma, you know what I mean? Like it's it's just so wrong

1197
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:51,300
So

1198
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:53,300
Where am I going with this? I don't know where I'm going with this

1199
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:58,580
I'm saying they're boasted maybe you're right that they're both innate and that their flip sides of the same coin maybe

1200
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:05,620
I'm not sure that I know that they're both innate and that the only way that you can overcome that taboo is to other

1201
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:11,380
The only way that you can overcome your natural empathy. Okay. Now it's making sense

1202
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:17,780
Yes, we're hardwired for empathy. I don't know. He's the hardwired guy. Don't ask me. I make all this up

1203
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:25,780
That you know our natural inclination is empathy and and and love and unicorns

1204
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:29,460
And the only way to do it is to is is is to

1205
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:36,740
Other somebody and make them less than human and that's what you see all over the world in these conflicts where people

1206
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:41,380
Just make somebody less and and I think that's why I've been going

1207
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:44,340
Back so much to reading

1208
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:46,500
When I started working with riff

1209
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:48,900
Refugees reading

1210
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:54,660
Literature from the Holocaust, you know, how can people think this of each other? How does this work in their heads?

1211
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:58,980
It's the oppressors that fascinate me, you know, like how does that happen?

1212
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:01,380
Then Yuri from your work

1213
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:07,460
So, you know, so I'm coming from a dynamical system perspective and not from innate

1214
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:10,420
Perspective so I would say the following it up

1215
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:16,660
And I can connect it easily to the other cost and I'll go up in in in Israel and

1216
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:19,220
being so and by like

1217
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:22,260
second generation and first generation survivors and

1218
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:26,820
There was was the question. How did German could be so evil?

1219
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:33,620
Right. How can they not to operate the camps and any two? It's like it's not human, right?

1220
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:37,380
And again

1221
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:39,940
Realization that

1222
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,940
Each human being and it doesn't include each one in the room, okay?

1223
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:46,740
No one is excluded from that

1224
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:50,340
every divine aspect and a dark aspect

1225
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:54,900
And it's all a matter of dynamic of the play between them

1226
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:56,100
and

1227
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,100
and sometimes

1228
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:02,980
The best can come from human and sometimes the worst can come from the same human

1229
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:08,100
and and being in difficult situation and I was in combat situation. I saw

1230
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:13,140
dark things coming from people that I loved and I was really surprised by it

1231
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:15,940
and

1232
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:19,380
This is human and I think it's a matter of times and context

1233
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:22,580
I can remember even there was like

1234
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:24,820
out

1235
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:26,820
black out in Manhattan for three days

1236
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:29,940
from 23rd below

1237
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:32,660
And my friend that was living there was saying that

1238
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:38,180
after two days of people become kind something become more nasty even in

1239
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:44,740
this very rich Manhattan Island, right? So it's two about all of us and

1240
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:52,340
And as humans what we need we need to strive to bring the best in ourself even in dark times

1241
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:55,220
And and that's what we need to do and I think

1242
01:39:55,860 --> 01:40:02,500
We need to find a way to to improve the dynamics even when it's spiraling down and start to get pretty

1243
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:05,780
dark

1244
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:10,020
You have to come and

1245
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:18,100
I think you have to come up and get in line here

1246
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:24,740
Thank you. Did you want to say any and do you want to come down?

1247
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:33,460
It's better. Yeah

1248
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:39,060
Okay

1249
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:42,500
I'm from South Sudan and we go back and forth

1250
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:46,340
My person is

1251
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:51,620
How could you let a government could be such an other countries

1252
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:58,180
Because we talk about this this place and refugees so

1253
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:03,700
Displaced people they do not choose to lick their homes

1254
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:10,180
Right now I have my own family my my sister and 16 other kids they ran off

1255
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:15,540
So basically if they don't run it are they gonna be killed or otherwise

1256
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:22,500
So how could we stop a detector government from doing that to each people?

1257
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:29,780
Is there a way either the UN or the US because South Sudan didn't come

1258
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,500
independently that the US fight

1259
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:36,740
And everybody in other american helped us to be free

1260
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:38,740
And I believe

1261
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:44,740
Whatever they are doing to each other is absolutely wrong

1262
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:51,460
And I remember earlier someone mentioned about certain things he don't want to touch or he don't want to it's dehumanizing

1263
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:56,580
We are talking about children getting raped women getting raped

1264
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:03,220
And not only that couple of days ago they announced that South Sudan is

1265
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:07,540
Is stopping basically the whole country is stopping to death that family

1266
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:11,060
So

1267
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:12,660
This is

1268
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:18,340
It's like getting out of control. So how can we intervene at the US or the UN

1269
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:22,740
To stop this from getting out of control like completely

1270
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:28,740
I

1271
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:34,740
Prepare you guys check it first and then uh, no, I'm not I don't know the the political solution. I you know

1272
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:39,700
Yeah, okay, okay

1273
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:47,060
Political power about humanitarian because if people are fleeing or they're hungry the whole country is stopping

1274
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:53,780
Should we do anything or you know to help them at at least like humanitarian

1275
01:42:54,980 --> 01:43:00,180
Assistant, yeah, I mean the only thing that's happening in South Sudan is humanitarian assistant

1276
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:03,380
There's no government functioning that I know of I don't know maybe

1277
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:08,740
Yeah, actually, yeah, what my sister here

1278
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:11,140
saying it is

1279
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:13,700
What she's asking it is the question

1280
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:16,660
being asked by

1281
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:18,980
the four million that I talked about before

1282
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:22,420
uh, that question is being asked by

1283
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:25,940
280 000

1284
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:32,340
Uh, those whom are under the united nations protections

1285
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:37,060
And you know them even in jubah in jungula in apanil

1286
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:40,260
Since 2013

1287
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:43,140
They are in the capital, but they cannot get out

1288
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:46,420
But because of the security of the president

1289
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:52,900
Will execute them even to the point that the security are just around there in jubah the capitals

1290
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:55,940
Uh, there was something terrible happened

1291
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:58,500
Uh to those who came out

1292
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:03,380
Including the angios who went there to work and help them

1293
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:06,740
They will be attacked by the bodyguard or the president

1294
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:11,060
uh, american citizens humanitarian with rapes

1295
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:14,420
Uh, in that in the capitals

1296
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:20,500
And nothing being said by the u.s. So the question she asking it is a genuine question

1297
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:26,260
Uh, southern Sudan didn't fall from the sky and become a nation in one night

1298
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:30,340
It went through the united state congress

1299
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:35,220
a united state senate the president of united states

1300
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:37,380
that

1301
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:42,340
Put a bill called sudan peace act to stop the war between the north and the south

1302
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:48,100
And which that the president and his follows and we're talking about all parties by the way

1303
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:52,020
There was nothing happened for the two party to come together

1304
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:54,980
To to vote as one block

1305
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:57,940
Except in the case of sudan peace act

1306
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:01,780
Where that the issue that the slavery have to be stopped

1307
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:06,980
The war the longest war in the in the world have to be stopped between the north and the south

1308
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:11,460
And based on that seeing everything being signed by the president become law

1309
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:14,500
Uh, you had yet to have an obligation to assist

1310
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:18,420
Billions of dollars to the people of sudan's

1311
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:22,100
Humanities and others follow because when american take the lead

1312
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:28,100
Other would follow and then there was given a chance because there was a debate whether

1313
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:32,180
The the the the referendum should be delayed or not

1314
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:38,980
I personally I went walk barefoot in all the offices of the elected official in the congress

1315
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:43,140
And in the senate to deliver to them address them one each individual

1316
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:48,180
If you if you delay these referendum then there's a

1317
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:54,980
The the bomb will go up because southern Sudanese then you're telling them that

1318
01:45:54,980 --> 01:46:03,300
Then you remain go back to the miserable situation so the war will go back against so the southern Sudan was given a chance

1319
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:09,940
Independent was a referendum was conducted in sousadisto understand the defendant through american help

1320
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:15,300
After we did that help that we give them millions of billions of dollars

1321
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:17,700
People who doesn't know how to balance the books

1322
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:25,940
Without accountability without even somebody to follow what this money being used for for the first time to have a nations

1323
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:32,500
Uh come out when we depend on with wealth in their hands oil money

1324
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:40,420
In the in the hands of individual who doesn't have an account that was fighting war and so the president offers become a place where

1325
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:42,820
You become rich in one night

1326
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:48,980
Where millions are being stolen every day in the office of the president by his relative and so on and so on

1327
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:51,460
For god sake if you guys are aware of it

1328
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:54,180
four billion dollars

1329
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:57,540
Was distributed by the president to his cabinet

1330
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:05,300
Because he's taking a big chunk about of that and then later on he turned around to tell them that bring the money back

1331
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:08,660
And then now we have joj kuni

1332
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:14,500
I leading this investigation of recovering this much that I'm going to be covered

1333
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:19,540
All we need in southern Sudan today is to recover

1334
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:23,860
The life of a child who is dying now

1335
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:31,620
And then since the world came out last week that there is a femme in southern Sudan they talk about 20 people a day

1336
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:47,620
die in our hunger and it steals uh we're still talking with the man who is in charge who who replaced them the man who brought the catastrophe on southern Sudan and this is where uh my sister is questioned combat

1337
01:47:47,620 --> 01:47:52,980
In my opinion if there is a way we have to reach out towards entrance

1338
01:47:52,980 --> 01:48:02,740
The united states have more obligations to rescue southern Sudan in the situation where they are in today

1339
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:08,020
Based on what they did what they showed them as I

1340
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:15,060
When when these peace agreement was not being signed between the two parties. I have to go on hanguage five or 45 days

1341
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:17,620
I want to die and she was with me by the way

1342
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:22,260
Until the president of bama realized that I don't want him to die in front of me

1343
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:26,660
And then he went to add this peace was signed but the president of southern Sudan rejected it

1344
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:32,340
He said and I quote this peace agreement. It is not a grand or if he's not a bible

1345
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:37,140
I'm signing but I'm not going to implement it and nobody even hold him responsible

1346
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:39,380
to me

1347
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:44,260
That person the president of southern Sudan by the name salva keel mayardit

1348
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:51,380
Have to be whole accountables of a half a million southern Sudan who paris in four years

1349
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:56,660
Half a million of four million summa now displaced

1350
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:02,580
At kids are being rep on a daily basis rep in southern Sudan become

1351
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:05,460
You know it

1352
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:07,220
Ever but talk about it

1353
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:10,580
Then why we don't have one would I correct

1354
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:18,340
To say to this man enough is enough simply because of the dollar we give you that's the question why why don't we have

1355
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:23,540
Why don't we hold them accountable? Well, there was a problems with my cousins

1356
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:26,180
The president of the united said brok obama

1357
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:29,140
You know the policy of not don't rock the boats

1358
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:31,780
uh lead to

1359
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:38,260
This situation because southern Sudan if as I told them I told him the president of the united state

1360
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:40,660
southern Sudan is an american baby

1361
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:45,620
And that's why I went on a honger's life to tell him that the baby you brought to the world

1362
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:49,220
He died before our own hands and we don't want to hear that story

1363
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:52,500
I think again it goes to the story. This was a great success

1364
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:57,940
We got south Sudan free from the horrible Islamic people and walk away in Sudan and hanas

1365
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:01,940
Very sad

1366
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:03,940
Yeah, no and it's absolutely

1367
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:08,900
Thank you for asking that question very important

1368
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:11,460
That was incredible and

1369
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:19,540
Several times during the session people said why did it happen now you just gave this exemplary

1370
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:27,300
Explanation that's incredible. You know, I don't think many of us knew that but I'm wondering and this kind of goes to the other

1371
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:30,580
When we look at the other then we can do things

1372
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:36,580
And we've always looked at Russia as the other and when south america went all the trouble there

1373
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:41,460
That was that was the other and even today it's the other and we don't necessarily

1374
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:44,900
Well, I'd like to know what what you think of that and that

1375
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:48,580
Because I think we do have the UN as you suggested

1376
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:52,740
And then the gentleman there said that it's never going to improve

1377
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:56,180
I guess until we have another on another solar system

1378
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,900
You know, they will behave

1379
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,900
But anyway

1380
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:03,300
As uh, steve bannan

1381
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:05,540
Says the other day other

1382
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:10,580
Uh that we're not part of a global community. There is

1383
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:14,580
We are part of a nation that defines itself

1384
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:19,300
As every nation does in opposition to every other nation

1385
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:20,980
Uh

1386
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:26,500
For us for americans for a long time that other was ideological

1387
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:30,340
It was hard to have a racial basis for our nationality

1388
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:35,060
Because the united states was separating itself from britain

1389
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:38,980
And there was an awful lot of overlap there if you used race

1390
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:43,700
So we emphasized those things that we learned about in third grade

1391
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:46,660
Religious freedom

1392
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:49,220
What was it political democracy?

1393
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:52,660
Social opportunity they weren't quite real

1394
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:56,820
But they made us different from britain. They were real enough

1395
01:51:57,780 --> 01:51:59,380
Over time

1396
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:05,060
We've used those or at times when we've become a little bit more insecure

1397
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:06,980
We've reverted to race

1398
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:13,940
Uh, we shifted to race over the course of the 19th and early 20th century

1399
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:17,380
Afterworld where too we went back to ideology

1400
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:21,460
As you pointed out the Russians were extraordinarily important to us

1401
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:23,460
When they were the soviet union

1402
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:27,300
They were the they were the communist world

1403
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:30,820
The enslaved world and we were the free world

1404
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:33,700
Free world included. Oh, I don't know

1405
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:38,740
Franco spain it included lots of things that maybe weren't quite free

1406
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:41,380
But weren't in the soviet sphere

1407
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:44,260
Then the soviets did something horrific

1408
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:47,060
They evaporated in

1409
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:48,820
1989

1410
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:51,780
We woke up one day with no other

1411
01:52:52,260 --> 01:52:58,420
after 25 years of a civil embracing a civil rights view of who we were

1412
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:01,140
toward racial equality

1413
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:03,380
toward economic opportunity

1414
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:06,980
toward I don't know a culture built intolerance

1415
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:11,060
toward accepting one million immigrants a year

1416
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:16,740
That's what the 1965 law as amended is about without racial basis

1417
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:18,980
We still do that by the way

1418
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:25,380
But it's in those other areas that we've then begun to shift back to race

1419
01:53:25,780 --> 01:53:29,300
George hw bush now the sainted

1420
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:36,980
One of the great presidents of the 20th century got elected by running ads about willy horton

1421
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:40,580
Remember a black convict in massachusetts

1422
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:46,180
So we moved we have been moving for the last 20 years

1423
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:52,340
Increasingly toward a racial definition of who we are and that's what we

1424
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:58,180
Because that's all of us as a nation embraced at the polls a scant

1425
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:01,460
Form of is a bit only three months

1426
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:09,780
Let's get three months or so three and a half months, but who's counting a goal a racial definition of nationhood

1427
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:14,820
Don't get me off on race

1428
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:20,340
No, we're back we have we

1429
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:23,220
Right now what we have is great back

1430
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:29,300
What we the people who've lost their jobs in the coal mines the people who've lost their jobs in the industrial plants

1431
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:38,100
That that is that's it's a group that it wants to make america white and great and racially based again

1432
01:54:42,100 --> 01:54:47,380
Um, so thank you. I'm alif and aviary. I really enjoyed the diversity of perspectives of the panel

1433
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:50,500
Um, i'm going to try to make a question out of the comment

1434
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:55,780
I just had a really quick comment, but i'm going to now that i'm rocking the mic try to transform it into a question

1435
01:54:55,780 --> 01:55:02,340
Um, so I wanted to say a quick element about i know you talked a lot about

1436
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:06,020
um aspects of empathy and the

1437
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:10,500
The one comment that i'm trying to transform has to do with when

1438
01:55:11,860 --> 01:55:13,220
um

1439
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:16,660
You look at a lot of the cadre of empathy studies they really

1440
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:19,380
demarcate the capacity for

1441
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:22,180
um

1442
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:25,540
Empathy breakdown really tends to be around um

1443
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:31,620
different social identity categories when you know, there's the in-group kind of outgroup and that tends to be

1444
01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:38,660
What we are hardwired for is the identification for um, you know, whatever I identify as my

1445
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:40,660
kind of in-group

1446
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:47,540
However, my community is defined or my social identity categories are defined and then whoever I other which is my outgroup

1447
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:53,300
And that tends to be the ways in which empathy is the quickest and the fastest to breakdown

1448
01:55:53,540 --> 01:56:01,460
So that generally is like, whether it is nation states or nationalities or cultural identity categories or races

1449
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:06,900
And that is the- i'm getting into my question. Yeah, and that is generally that was my comment is around

1450
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:10,420
Ethnocultural empathy and so I think it's really um,

1451
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:15,220
Misopportunity whenever we're talking about empathy to not talk about the specificity of

1452
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:22,260
Ethnocultural empathy because that tends to be where empathy tends to be the hardest and tends to be where

1453
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:31,140
It breaks down so that we do get the outcome of war and the missed capacity to see somebody as not our equal or as

1454
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:35,940
um, not even deserving of our time attention and love or capacity for

1455
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:38,420
um, compassion

1456
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:42,980
So it's around differing social identity categories where we have the hardest to

1457
01:56:42,980 --> 01:56:46,020
identify with another person so with that

1458
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:48,420
um, my question now is

1459
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:50,660
Uh, when you guys were all talking as a panel

1460
01:56:51,620 --> 01:56:57,860
You said americans are very very generous with our capacity for giving funds. So

1461
01:56:58,580 --> 01:57:01,780
uh, you raised the idea that when

1462
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:04,740
Recently we are

1463
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:08,180
You know giving and uh donating a lot toward

1464
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:10,340
um new

1465
01:57:10,340 --> 01:57:17,140
Well cherries recently and uh with seeing pictures and um connecting a lot with refugee

1466
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:18,980
um

1467
01:57:18,980 --> 01:57:23,220
Individuals and not so much with you know the black lives matter movement and a lot of other

1468
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:25,780
um

1469
01:57:25,780 --> 01:57:32,900
Social justice activities that we really need to kind of garner but not feeling a lot of connection with so how do you see there being a capacity

1470
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:34,180
for

1471
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:36,740
other social groups for us to connect to

1472
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:39,460
And having more empathy

1473
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:41,140
with

1474
01:57:41,140 --> 01:57:48,580
different social identity categories. How do you see these connections being able to be made across different groups as it's

1475
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:56,260
Kind of maybe garnering from our pockets to actual people. How do you see more connections being able to be made?

1476
01:57:56,820 --> 01:58:03,780
How do you see emotional connections being able to be made and more connections across different categories being garnered?

1477
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:06,100
How do you think that can be done?

1478
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:10,340
So Yuri do you want to keep that on? Okay. Yeah, I can tie

1479
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:14,020
Thank you

1480
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:18,420
I think again, it's it's the story that we tell and

1481
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:21,540
finding a common ground

1482
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:24,180
So

1483
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,220
You know

1484
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:31,380
We can all be very empathetic and we cannot be very close and see the other and it's in group and out group

1485
01:58:31,460 --> 01:58:33,460
It's the right term so very

1486
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:41,460
Because you know sometimes as we were saying we go out in Manhattan and see people on the street living and we don't see them at all

1487
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:44,420
But we're going to denote

1488
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:49,780
Money for people that are starving in Syria, right? So and now you ask why

1489
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:53,540
You don't know so do not to the armlets but in front of you

1490
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:58,340
So it's we can all have this we all have this like two sides, right?

1491
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:05,700
We can be open to some and we can close to other and and if we want to amplify something we need to create

1492
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:10,900
To change the boundaries and they discuss and that's the only way to do it. So

1493
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:16,820
If now is the focus or is on something then this organization will get the money, right?

1494
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:20,260
If the focus will be on I think the other organization will get the money and

1495
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:23,140
And now we need to decide as a group

1496
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:29,060
giving delimited the sources and giving our nature for in-group versus out group

1497
01:59:29,940 --> 01:59:33,380
How do we define our group? Oh, yeah, are we Americans? Are we

1498
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:36,100
global citizens? Are we

1499
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:43,460
from Queens? I mean we can we can have many different entities, right? Are we liberal? Are we conservative?

1500
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:47,620
Are we reading the New York Times? I mean we can divide it and

1501
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:49,620
and it's

1502
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:55,220
Up of us now in this moment of crisis to define the way in which we can

1503
01:59:56,580 --> 02:00:02,180
Build a common ground that can move us forward to where we want to be in 20 years and if we will fail

1504
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:05,940
Other people will do it for us like Steve Bannon

1505
02:00:07,460 --> 02:00:10,340
There really I have a question I guess for both

1506
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:16,900
Alison and Uri are you saying that it's a rhetorical problem then that

1507
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:26,340
How we language who the other is is dynamic and one can actually be strategic?

1508
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:31,620
I don't think it's rhetorical. It's the rhetorical sound like it's world with no accent

1509
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:35,860
I don't mean it now. We're just talking about language and I think

1510
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:40,820
Worlds are accent. I mean you do think with words

1511
02:00:40,820 --> 02:00:48,660
I don't think that if you speak you do something and you can really change the reality and I think what we see now

1512
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:51,140
For the moment the attack on the media that

1513
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:57,940
It's an act it's deliberate act to change something in the strikes of the society

1514
02:00:58,820 --> 02:01:00,820
And if they will succeed

1515
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:06,020
They will gain power for many years to give them a lot of power. It's a very smart move

1516
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:07,540
It's not

1517
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:10,260
a crazy guy that's talking this

1518
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:17,140
It's not it's not a crazy guy. It's simply know what he's doing. It's a very smart move

1519
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:21,460
And and now that you see the move

1520
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:26,900
you want to react and people reacting and now there's

1521
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:30,740
It's not a rhetorical world. It's it's a real world

1522
02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:32,660
but

1523
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:37,700
The concept and there are some sense and how we move forward for me and that's

1524
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:41,380
That's what's happening now. I think

1525
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:46,020
I think what you're really pointing out is that it's as if within all of us

1526
02:01:46,180 --> 02:01:49,620
There's the fight between affinity and empathy

1527
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:53,940
And we're seeing a clustering around groups of affinities

1528
02:01:54,980 --> 02:02:01,620
But I would like to thank this affinity group those of you who have come and stayed with us through this

1529
02:02:01,620 --> 02:02:04,340
And the wonderful speakers and presenters

1530
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:32,980
Very much appreciate the really wonderful level of discussion and your good energy for being here today. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you

1531
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:36,340
