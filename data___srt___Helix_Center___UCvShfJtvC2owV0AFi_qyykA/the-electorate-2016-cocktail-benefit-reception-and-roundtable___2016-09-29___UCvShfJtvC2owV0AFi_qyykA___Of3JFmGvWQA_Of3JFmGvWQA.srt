1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I want to thank all of you for your support of the UNIC Center.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Without your help, you will be unable to present the unique kinds of programs we organize,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
more to attract the high caliber of people who are physically busy banks, and some of them are here tonight.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And benefit Gala is an occasion to talk about the successes and achievements through the last Gala.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We certainly have a success with UNIC to find it difficult to focus on that given the loss of tenism ten value.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That was instrumental in making UNICs possible.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As served as our chairman, the tennis was not only an art that supported, but also a mineral-opepic community.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
More importantly, from their area, and I know that several men of the UN tonight, they were greatly beloved friends.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Friends with such grace, elegance, and generosity that we consider ourselves fortunate and blessed that they were part of our lives.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We are also happy to be considered a friend of ten value junior and tomorrow value.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They are honored that they are here tonight and has graciously accepted to read two poems at this point.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Thank you.

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you.

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay.

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Can you hear me?

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Just two poems of my dad's.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'd love to see you.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Just two poems from my father that he wrote many, many years ago and published.

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The second one, sure, the first one is not very long.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It kind of reflects my father's belief in the importance of philosophy and learning.

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So I thought I'd be a Catholic person.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's called the Scholars Brigade.

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
At the dawn of the faithful day, the sun piercing the rim of the gently curved horizon.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The sand swells cool with night.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The brigade appears, a march of ants swaying, shivering in the distance, then dropping down into dark again,

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
only to reappear as some relentless apparition upon the height of one's sand.

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So many times it has begun to end the flight.

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The sun dried, courage spilled as blood to stain the sand.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The evening breeze to shift the sea of hopeless particles.

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Each, once each thousand years, the scholars writ victorious.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They cut a path wide enough for the philosopher to be king.

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The soul is written deep into the sand, and the sun and sand cannot obliterate the changes he has made for day or two.

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The second one is called a song.

35
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I have danced and rolled in the rain and snow.

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
In the night and cold, I have dashed old wall.

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There's a day for peace and a year for love, and a flash of heat.

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I have worn that glove.

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Do you see the room? It's cold and taught.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's so easy to ruin a heart that's caught.

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you.

42
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thank you, Tim.

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you.

44
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I would like to now turn to this evening's event and thank our discussants here.

45
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
They're going to talk about the electorate.

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We ask them to do something very challenging and not to talk about the election.

47
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Rather than to talk about how we can understand the state of the electorate.

48
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Starting to my right, Janet, is an Emmy and Peabody award winning television and radio producer, vice chair of the women's media center, and communication strategies, and management consultant in policy, media and education for many organizations, including National Urban League.

49
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Next to her is Lester Crystal, retired president of Neil Darrow Productions, having previously served in many journalists from executive news positions, including as executive producer for NBC 90 news and president in NBC News.

50
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Next to him, Casia Rump, was elected in 2008 at age 22 to Vermont House of Representatives, representing Burlington's Old North End Hill Section at University District.

51
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Among her numerous ex-religious ladies and donors, she is served as the public engagement specialist in the city of Burlington Community and Economic Development Office.

52
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Next to her, Michael Goodwin is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, currently a columnist at the New York Post, and a commentator on CLOPS News, whose past journalism homes have been the New York Times, and the New York Times.

53
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Including as executive editor of the latter.

54
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Next to him, Elizabeth Harris is an education reporter at the New York Times.

55
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
As a reporter and columnist there, she's also covered real estate business, New York State politics, and breaking news.

56
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So we're going to try our regular format where we're going to leave you without a moderator.

57
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And we want just to talk to one another in his spontaneous ways of asking.

58
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So I open it to anyone who wants to start the conversation.

59
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, I'd like to say that about the election, obviously the election informs our opinions about the electorate.

60
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I think about a friend of mine, the great litigator of Ted Wells, when they ask him why he's so successful, or from jurors, he said, because jurors are smart.

61
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
They want to do a good job. They don't often know what to do.

62
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So you treat them with respect, and you're not condescending.

63
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He doesn't put a barrier between himself and the jurors when he does his final summation, he doesn't outlast.

64
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Our American electorate has been talked about with great disdain. I think that they are confused. They want to do something.

65
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:35,000
They really do leave in hope. They showed up with the last election to even though Obama never won the majority of the white vote, and either one of those elections.

66
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But a couple weeks ago, Heather McGhee, who's the president of D.M.O.S., was being interviewed, and was called in.

67
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And I called and he said, I'm a white woman, and I'm racist, and I want to know what I can do to not be that way.

68
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And her response is response, I think, about the electorate too, where she said, well, that's the first step, why 12th step program here?

69
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And she said, I appreciate your courage and your sincerity.

70
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And I think that that's what we need to do. Both parties, all parties have treated the electorate with such disrespect over the years.

71
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
They're not involved in it. It's a game of who can confuse people. Most of them are not wonderful actions.

72
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So that's what I think about the electorate. I think I have a great deal of hope in the American people.

73
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I feel that once we can talk to them in a way that makes sense to them, that we will see even more change from.

74
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And we have to do it.

75
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm certainly confused, but there was some recent report from Pew's meeting this matter a week or two weeks ago,

76
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and did an interesting survey of voters. And it was a flavor that the voters are very, I don't know if I had my statistic right,

77
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:19,000
but about a third of the people who were supporting a particular candidate were voting because they were voting against the other candidate.

78
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That was a critical factor. Certainly it was a factor of supporting something that the candidate was stood for.

79
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And in terms of Donald Trump, the highest item was being a change agent, making a change in terms of Hillary Clinton that was experienced.

80
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But the basis of their decision of a lot of voters going to know is because they're voting against the other candidate.

81
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And that certainly is a negative or a reflection of an electorate that's very happy.

82
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, Dr. Bell or Janet were raising first names in this.

83
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You said something that really struck me and it was that people want to be, we have to figure out where we speak to the electorate in a way that they have been supported and heard and validated.

84
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And I think what's come across so much is that people want authenticity for politicians right now in a way that's very hard to create in the political system by currently exist.

85
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And I think there's three things. Three systems that I see as someone in politics that make it very difficult,

86
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and even in Vermont, which I was just asking, I'm writing poems in my system, I don't know if it's a new topic.

87
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We talk all kinds of books and we don't have party registration at all.

88
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So people just identify often as basically conservatives and socially liberal and mostly libertarian.

89
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But can they finance, to hear a politician who's promising things or speaking about things when you know where their money's coming from,

90
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:23,000
that is what made Bernie so successful is taking a very, Bernie Sanders, taking a very non-slashy topic and making it really relevant

91
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
because people hear someone talk at a website or they're not going to be captured or something else,

92
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
two would be redistricting.

93
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We now have a political districting process where a majority of people think alike are packed into one district

94
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and it's all about self-preservation so you're going to get a more polarized population electing,

95
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
more extreme Republicans and more extreme Democrats.

96
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And third, and I'd really like to hear from folks in the media world, I mean, there's no longer the geography of Vermont or New York.

97
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's the geography of who you choose to associate with online in many ways or what publications you read or take part in.

98
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And that geography is so isolated.

99
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But I think we're not even defining things the same way.

100
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Someone can say they won the debate in whatever, you know, Twitter-verse they're living in and that's their reality.

101
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And, you know, I find that to be such a great divide for the electorate to overcome is that system of their occasion.

102
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Just before the record, I asked that question about my ever-never-grandma and that's required.

103
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The assignment or the idea of looking at the electorate but not the politicians.

104
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I will try to do that this way.

105
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I think the two candidates we have still standing at the major parties reflect the electorate.

106
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And the way I see that is the two biggest surprises that I think nobody saw coming.

107
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Of course, the larger would be Donald Trump getting this far.

108
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But I think almost as big a surprise is how weak a candidate Hillary Clinton has turned out to be.

109
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
When you wind them up originally, you would have thought why this would be a walkover.

110
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But in fact, I think that his strength and her weakness both reflect, as Les said, the unhappiness of the electorate.

111
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That they want something very different than they've been getting.

112
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And I think that that's how the unhappiness, the sense of not being fulfilled, is being manifest.

113
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And I'm a believer that we should listen to the electorate.

114
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And I think just two quick things I think that strike me.

115
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The first, I don't know whether any of you have read Charles Murray coming apart.

116
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's an excellent book about essentially the white working class and how it has split from a general white world

117
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
in terms of marriage, education, everything.

118
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That it is now, as he puts it, as he's following up with two, the bottom is following out of the original class.

119
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And he talks about how this is such a significant event because it's so large that it's not as though it's an isolated community or two.

120
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He talks about prison records, people who don't work, you have anywhere.

121
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He says in many communities, 18% of young men not working.

122
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's really a fascinating examination of the middle falling down economically and socially.

123
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And so I think the other thing that I wanted to say quickly to Les' point, in case it was to about the media,

124
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Gallup has a new survey out.

125
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Only 32% of the country trusts even some or a lot.

126
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So those two combine that, 32%, that the news they are getting from television and radio in newspapers,

127
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
the question doesn't distinguish, that they trusted somewhat or mostly.

128
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So 32%, it's a historic blow.

129
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's dropped eight points in one year.

130
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
This is a question that Gallup has been asking since 1972, when of course,

131
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and the Nixon and the Watergate era, the investigative journalism era really, the numbers shut up.

132
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But they've been going down slowly, but now they are falling off of the wall.

133
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And I think this is a major issue for society if people simply don't trust.

134
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's another institution that they don't trust.

135
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And maybe like a social media, there's an introduction to me.

136
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's actually a theme back to being able to trust what they, the papers, the MTV and on their Facebook page,

137
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
they see things that reinforce what they, what they're sort of in line to believe is going to go,

138
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
be driving, sorry, never will look.

139
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I can't use why other panelists make this, if it's eight percent dropped just in the past year,

140
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
but I think one is about the selection of particular that's, you know,

141
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I think part of it is generic in the sense that they're fed up.

142
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
They're fed up, and so I think Donald Trump was a reflection of the fed up caucus.

143
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But I think they're fed up with society, they're fed up with Wall Street, they're fed up with Washington,

144
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
they're fed up with many are fed up with their religious institutions,

145
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
they're fed up with their media institutions.

146
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I think it's a general unhappiness with their lives in this country.

147
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
A sense of broken dreams, lost hopes, problems overwhelming them.

148
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I think part of it is still a recession that a lot of people feel they never got out of,

149
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
maybe they lost their home, they lost their nest egg, they lost their job,

150
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
they never quite recovered the income level.

151
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That would be my guess.

152
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But what's interesting is while people have lost more faith in journalism or in the media,

153
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:33,000
you do have this phenomenon in parallels, but for people who are watching a particular or meeting

154
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
a particular following of particular one, that they feel reflects their views.

155
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And this has been a common denominator for a long, long time.

156
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We tend to trust someone that we believe agrees with us.

157
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And there's a tendency as well not to want to bother to get the other point of view.

158
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And go with the person who believes the way you do.

159
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And therefore you cross the, how may I'm related, but I'll tell the anecdote in any case.

160
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
When I was working for NBC, it was a long time ago, and there was some research done on the Berkeley.

161
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And the agreement, I think, was done by the marketing people today.

162
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:38,000
They called people that were, that liked viewers that liked that way and were great.

163
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And the viewers that were big fans, frankly, and who were conservative, that he was conservative.

164
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And the viewers that were big fans, and particularly in liberal, thought he was liberal.

165
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And the same thing with that, and that's where part of the question is,

166
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,000
we also, we don't want to be exposed to those kind of reviews which may disrupt our own balance.

167
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And that place of factor, and that place is given to social media, given cable news,

168
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I think that's a phenomenon that's never been stronger.

169
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But it's always fascinating.

170
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You know your question kind of gives rise to my own question, which is,

171
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:39,000
when you're in the industry of media and news, do you feel like you can present a story that's actually accurate

172
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and doesn't have a lot of spam and has just a descriptive headline and expect that people will need it and pay attention?

173
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Because I think sitting in rooms where a lot, there's a lot of content and there's a lot of rich work that happens.

174
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And yet it's much easier to report on the conflict or the top line message about the name of the week.

175
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:12,000
For example, we have a partner space going on right now in Vermont, and we had the Republican and then the warmer picture of the Red Sox,

176
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and we are running in Vermont right now. And he's allowed to participate in all of the debates,

177
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and he's just making inflammatory, optimal statements.

178
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And yet a real substantive debate happened between the two of the communities.

179
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yet our public radio, Vermont public radio, I mean we reported on this Red Sox picture and how inflammatory statements were,

180
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
everybody was looking for a assessment to art well.

181
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And so we were having a conversation on social media, what happens to the real art well?

182
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What's going on with the media that they feel like they can't tell a real story and that there's no desire to consume real information?

183
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So I guess there's some kind of disconnect where the perception from my view is that the press is struggling with this growing pain and this transition to be relevant.

184
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And how can they be relevant but still present us with accurate content?

185
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Anyone who thinks of me?

187
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes, no.

188
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So I disclaimer the group is I have a reducation, I don't prefer politics, and I think this is a particularly political, particularly true for political coverage.

189
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:34,000
In the world of education, there's some of that happens, but there's more room for sort of the policy articles people are interested in because their kids go to school,

190
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and there's a little bit more rounding for a long experience.

191
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I don't know, man.

192
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I think that does happen and a lot of places are trying to do both.

193
00:22:47,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Now, you know, trying to do the fun stuff, but also not try to lose the policy, you know, the policy pieces of it, but, you know, the ones that are more widely read are generally the ones about the fights.

194
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And I think that's problematic. I don't think the media can ignore those stories, and I think they can't not write about space man.

195
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
With space man?

196
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
There's no space man.

197
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So they can't not write about space man, but they think that there is definitely a responsibility to also do, for a substantive story, and maybe break them into it that way, or you can make space man just like, oh, a little piece of it.

198
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And that would be the, you know, the little gift of lavatar. But, yeah, that would be, there are still places that try it very hard to do that.

199
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
But sometimes, you know, our own even, you know, the, you know, our little cacophony is, you know, what rises up is the story about space man.

200
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And maybe there is a debate story that was written by some publication in the movie, right?

201
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah.

202
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You know, in 2001, when I was the executive of the Daily News, and I've also thought back to that day, that the world had changed forever.

203
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And in many ways it has, but if I were to jump forward and say, did I ever see kind of the trivialization of the media, the fascination with gossip, with celebrities, I would have thought that would not have happened after 9-11.

204
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And I believe you could argue it's intensifying, which is a very strange phenomenon to me.

205
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And I, many of you in the psychological field perhaps can better explain that.

206
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The only thing I would say too about the media that really one of the dirty little secrets is that with the websites and the readership, the critics, everything is counted now.

207
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So you can tell within a news organization they keep track of what stories got how much traffic online.

208
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Now there was always that with television ratings, newspaper circulation, but now it's instantaneous.

209
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And so I think that does drive a lot of these stories because, well, look at the traffic, we might be able to sell some ads against that.

210
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That's good for the paper, isn't it, when, you know, 100,000 people clicked on that story and only 5,000 clicked on that one.

211
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Which one are you going to do more of?

212
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So I think that is driving a lot of decisions in newsrooms and also newsrooms in the future.

213
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So a few people doing, I think, good things.

214
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But talking directly about the, like, I think people can't really tell the difference between fact and fiction many times.

215
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And so they're confused and they think that facts, that the fiction really becomes facts.

216
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And you know, and that opinion is factual and it's not necessarily the case.

217
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Now there are the whole, but there are lots of studies that say the facts don't mean anything anyway.

218
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's whether people relate to, do they like you, do they assume because of their particular point of view that you share that point of view, what have you.

219
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So there's a lot of that.

220
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
But we no longer, as an electric, have a public square.

221
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:14,000
We don't have the same kind of way to talk about issues, civics, even our history in a way that's civilized, that's informative,

222
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
that makes sense to people. People don't have these conversations about important ideas.

223
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And it's hard for people to grasp how you get into that conversation.

224
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If you want to make a change, people know there's something wrong.

225
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
They know that. But they don't know what's wrong.

226
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And they blame the wrong sources for their anxiety. And then we have not as a nation dealt honestly and completely with the issues of race and sex.

227
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So Obama brought out racism. He didn't create it as some of the commentators tried to put on him.

228
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And the way that racism was more exposed, Hillary Clinton, on sexism. I mean some of the stuff I've listened to because I take New York City cats and they seem to listen to W.A.B.C. a lot, which is very conservative.

229
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
We don't know about that.

230
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It drives me crazy, but for those few moments, at least I get a chance to hear the other side, because frankly, I don't seek it out. At least I don't seek it out, it would drive me crazy.

231
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And I tell people, sure for some reason- Why would it drive you crazy?

232
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Because you- We know that media bleeds and bleeds, right?

233
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And we know that people are intentionally pushing the emotional buttons. And so when people tell me that they can, that they're really anxious about the new society, it's a turnoff.

234
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Don't read any book. Turn it off. You need a break from that. That doesn't mean that you need a break from reality. You can get into that and you can do it in a way that made-

235
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:12,000
that you can absorb the information, but you're not manipulating. And so of course that the electorate is anxious. And they-

236
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:25,000
people don't talk straight. And so they run what learn. And they can't now tell the difference between someone's opinion and someone's factual statement.

237
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And that's because of the state- I mean, the- the milieu that we live in, the state of public education, the fact that people are still talking about creationism in schools across the country.

238
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I mean, what does that say? Form the electorate. What does that say about the education? We are a country that depends on the educated population.

239
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And our country is- is becoming less- we have more information and less knowledge. And I think that someone needs to really start-

240
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:03,000
it's going to be a while to pull that ship around so that people see that these things are inter-movement.

241
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But I have to concede that I think today that it's been a universal problem or a long-term problem that not enough media are taking the time to delve into the issues in the movie.

242
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I think that's a very emotional analysis. Some are, but many are not. I guess it's partly the gravitate to the current university.

243
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And partly we don't think it's going to be that interesting. And sometimes it's not.

244
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But it's- I- I share with you, I think, that you're not enough journalists and organizations are taking the time to do it. There are those that are, and they're readily available.

245
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And I keep- I keep- I keep people that don't have access to one, have access to one, because the Internet also gives you-

246
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:17,000
you don't have to get six papers delivered to the house. You know, the other folks speaking. So you can get a broad range of people.

247
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You can go on the Internet and get six, seven different perspectives will people take the time to do it.

248
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And real organizations, not enough organizations, are taking the time to do it, because they don't think that's, I guess they don't think it's a problem, but it's a series of kind.

249
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You know, Michael, you brought up the white working class and just the metrics and the indices and quality of life for that population.

250
00:30:49,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And I think a lot in this moment about the psychology of whiteness and the- and obviously not purposely, you know, like the psychology, but the feeling of being a protagonist in the story and politicians were always needing to talk to you, because your problems were the ones that matter most.

251
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And, you know, white men are seeming to reach this awakening and possible uprising around the fact that there are other people and other narratives that are also relevant, and that the population is changing the considerations of politicians that millennials are an incredibly diverse generation,

252
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and you can't rehash these same narratives that pick one population against another.

253
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You can't think of the war on drugs so one dimensionally. They're just not going to accept that.

254
00:31:46,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And yet, I think what we're seeing in the rage and the rising Donald Trump is this kind of glass gasp of a population that feels unheard, and that we care a lot about, but we have to put their experience alongside a lot of other folks in the world.

255
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And we think that the diverse laughter.

256
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I think there's still a truth to that. I wouldn't agree with all of it. But I do think that the numbers are staggering. That's why Charles Murray, for example, has focused on that group.

257
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Because it is true. If you have a problem in a Latino or an Asian or a Black neighborhood or community, it is a real problem, but it is not necessarily affecting a whole society.

258
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And that was Murray's point. I'm already myself. I've gotten in trouble in the past. I mean, Belkor and things like that.

259
00:32:38,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But in these most recent books, his argument is we're still talking about 60 to 65% of the country being white. And so if you just isolate that and find out what's going on there, he says you can compare what's happening to whites today to what happened to Black families 40 years ago.

260
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That the trajectory lines are now, they're not the same, but they're in the same direction. And so that's why I mentioned that it is such a large phenomenon.

261
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's not special in the sense that it's not distinct, but it is now fairly new. And it's reached proportions that they are, I mean, when you talk about stagnant income, that's largely whites have been a huge factor in that.

262
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Right, that the white incomes have also stagnated or gone down as the rest of the country. So I think that it is meaningful in that way, not because they're special, just because they're so large, but statistically, it is showing up everywhere.

263
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:00,000
We drop out rates in high school, growing prison populations, opiate deaths, which is particularly an issue in the lower news.

264
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So I don't know if country like Ohio.

265
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Right, right. So I think that these are troubled situations, whatever the rates are at the city.

266
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And it is now cutting across, of course, different groups, different answers and different candidates. They think we will be the answer, but I think the phenomenon now is fairly similar.

267
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Right, I mean, I read recently that the expected, the life expectancy of white women has gone down because alcoholism is a suicide depression.

268
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And I think there's this tendency, and if we see a repeated in history, to create a parade of efficiency out of that, to say, and then, you know, the parade of efficiency, that that very life expectancy or their quality of life is going down because others are experiencing a greater quality of life.

269
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And we can blame those folks for that. And I feel like that is, that is the narrative of the right right now. And it's not nothing new, but how do we challenge these individuals?

270
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And I think we're going to have to acknowledge these indicators of this quality of life, these quality of issues in the right community without blaming others.

271
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I mean, what is the message that kind of cuts across all identities that talks about a tie that lists all boats.

272
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Right now, it still feels like we're stuck in race politics where the Democrats might start saying, well, we're just going to go after communities of color them because they're a base now and they're going to have a very racialized party system into the future.

273
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah, I think there are some things that are common to everybody, right? The economy, I mean, your family income, your standard of living is economic, larger health matters, education, of course, safety.

274
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So I think there are four or five basic things that define quality of life for everybody.

275
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So I think the economic is probably the most common, most of the strongest one that people recognize right away, they have higher expectations for economic well-being, I think maybe even the health or education.

276
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So I think that is a common thing that, because the economy we're doing better, I think that would solve a lot of problems in a lot of places.

277
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:27,000
In some cases, the color and the casting group, I mean, the jobs support, seem to be a simple group, and it doesn't seem to matter for some people.

278
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The fact that people have health care, who didn't have health care, and somehow because it's associated with Obama, think that that's a negative thing.

279
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So it's certain facts don't really resonate with people. And I was reading another article, another two study I think it was saying that the reasons, the more popular reasons we ascribe to the rise of Donald Trump are not necessarily the case.

280
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's not necessarily the economy.

281
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I said, oh, that shocked me, I didn't realize. I didn't think about that, but I have to delve into that a little bit deeper. But then after going through all of these things, what were not necessarily affecting people, the study said, well, we still don't have the answers.

282
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So, okay. But at least it raised some of the questions. What do you think it is? It's not necessarily what it is. So, so where are we? How did we get here? And what can we do to make a change?

283
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And now when you saw that case, that's fine.

284
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
That was a joke.

285
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah.

286
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Well, actually, I was reading something in the New York Times. This wasn't recent, but for policymakers, this is kind of a meta look at how successful we are. And it was essentially this data argument that red states actually have less income inequality than blue states.

287
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And it's sort of intuitive when you think about it, we have financial centers and academic centers. And there are reasons in blue states that we've become much more unequal in our income.

288
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But it sort of reminds me that as we try to do good in the world and redistribute wealth and make sure everybody has what they need, everybody has this desire for kind of an inalienable right to a house, a car, and air conditioning.

289
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And that's what they, if they have that, when they feel their quality of life is good, a lot of other things aren't as important to them.

290
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And in red states, that seems to be the case that they just feel happier with who's leading them than in blue states because they don't have the same income inequality.

291
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And that's something we, as policymakers and blue states, have to think a lot about them.

292
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Well, I read one, picking up an airport in years two, that if the economy is getting better, more people have jobs, though we know that that's been a slow rise in terms of productivity and income and so on.

293
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:34,000
But there was an interesting story I read that those people who are unhappy, even though things have improved, they feel someone at the back, that used to be at the back of the line, is now in the line or ahead of the line in terms of, I'm going to use the word largesse in terms of benefits that they've received, and they're not being treated as well.

294
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I don't know if that's the case, but I think it's a factor in the perception of being unhappy.

295
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I guess I would have another view, though, on state of the economy.

296
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I really do think it's fundamental to where we are as a country.

297
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And the fact that we've grown so slowly out of this recession, I mean, the slowest growth ever after a recession, there's a very deep recession in a very slow world since.

298
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And the average growth after a recession is between three and a half and four percent per year.

299
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
In the last eight years, it's been closer to two percent.

300
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And the difference is roughly 10 million jobs that were not created.

301
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Now, those 10 million jobs had they been created, would have pushed up wages in all jobs, in all working-class situations, would have created more prosperity down the walk, around the corner, over the hill.

302
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And I think it's like the dog that doesn't bark.

303
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's hard to identify it because it's not there.

304
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But comparison to the story norms does show, I think, that there is a gap.

305
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
There is an economic gap that has not been filled in in this economy.

306
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And look, I think the world is changing.

307
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
There are all kinds of issues.

308
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I think the president deserves a share of the credit for what happened and a share of the blame for what didn't happen.

309
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
But I think federal reserve, I mean, what's going on in Europe, what's going on in Asia?

310
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It's a very complicated global situation now.

311
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I don't think the United States is at all solely responsible, but we are feeling the brunt, I think, as other countries are.

312
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Our own brunt is what we're feeling.

313
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And again, you look at Brexit.

314
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
The Brexit vote.

315
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I think it caught a lot of people by surprise.

316
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
But I think those people who voted to leave primarily were outside of London.

317
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,000
They were outside of the big metropolitan areas that are having the financial markets that are booming.

318
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But I think their message is, this is not working for me.

319
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
They didn't understand Brexit.

320
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,000
What was the highest numbers were people were, for the definition, they say, what is Brexit's after the vote?

321
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
People have looked it up before.

322
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
What people looked up after the vote.

323
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I think most of them knew what they were voting.

324
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I think they were voting non-ackness with the current situation.

325
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Unhappiness, but not understand what ramifications work for them.

326
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I mean, so if you have a small town and an indoor lane and what have you, and they had a story about that,

327
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and then the new York Times, where the person said, well, I didn't realize that this would have an impact on me.

328
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So they voted their feelings, and that's what a lot of people are doing.

329
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:47,000
The candidates were not supposed to name, and somehow someone's got to explain that we can't redo the vote.

330
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
What's November 8th is here? That's our vote.

331
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
They may be able to redo Brexit if we're going to compare that.

332
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,000
They know the explanation of how our country really works.

333
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
People don't really know how our country really works.

334
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I don't blame the American population.

335
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I blame the people who are funneling the money away from public education

336
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
and doing all these crazy things.

337
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I don't blame the people.

338
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
The people are ready for solid leadership and positive change.

339
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I believe that was in my heart.

340
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I have to do that.

341
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
We're from a working class family, and that's the way we got ahead,

342
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:42,000
because we actually believed in what the promise of this country was in terms of fair play community.

343
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The fact that, I mean, I hear the abamas who really believe this.

344
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,000
A little bit Pollyanna, she's saying that if you work really hard, you can make it if you try.

345
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I hear them saying that all the time.

346
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Well, not exactly, and not for everybody.

347
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
There's structural problems that have to be overcome.

348
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
People individually cannot do that.

349
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
People who are sort of elected as our public servants, who have forgotten that they are supposed to be serving people.

350
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
What they are doing is lining their pockets. You write about some of them might take on occasion.

351
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
They are trying to manipulate the system so that it has greater benefits

352
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
for those people who are going to give them campaign contributions.

353
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
There's just a whole bunch of things going on with how the things that are,

354
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
and they're not problems that they cannot be fixed.

355
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I do not believe that these are problems that are unfixable.

356
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I think they are fixable. I think that with intergenerational leadership and cooperation

357
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
and people reaching out to people, they would not necessarily talk to all the time.

358
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
That's what made a difference in how we approach solving the problems.

359
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Can't bring on sort of the campaign finance thing that sort of goes back to the media.

360
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I think one place there's a huge knowledge gap that comes from sort of the

361
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
economic problems of the media is in local elections, statewide elections,

362
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
because those are the newspapers that have been absolutely decimated.

363
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Nobody is writing those stories and no one is keeping an eye on that entire,

364
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
enormous, powerful things are happening.

365
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I'm tempted to just take it off and shout.

366
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Should I just do that?

367
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I don't know.

368
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I think that makes that creates a huge knowledge gap in people's lives.

369
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It also creates sort of a farm team problem for national campaigns.

370
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
The Democratic Party in particular has had a huge problem in recent years

371
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
getting anyone elected on sort of large statewide offices

372
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and they've just been swept out of lots and lots of state houses.

373
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
There's no kind of farm team coming out behind the sort of people

374
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
putting your bite in that generation has all been pushed aside.

375
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
That's a bit of a problem with that party.

376
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And as someone who's run for statewide office,

377
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
the flip side of what I asked before,

378
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
do you feel like you can be kind of irrelevant if you don't make it the

379
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
sponsorship headline in there?

380
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Politicians are facing the same thing where if we don't break the root with

381
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
you know, on either side of a particular wedge issue,

382
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
whether it's requiring guns in schools or taking guns away from

383
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
those who maybe shouldn't have them, someone's, etc.

384
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
We have to go for those issues to go viral, to be heard,

385
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
and we don't break through otherwise.

386
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And so when you're just trying to run a race about red and butter

387
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
economic issues, people are telling you,

388
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
yeah, but you have to say something inflammatory to cut through the noise.

389
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
There's always that temptation and sort of a millennial candidate.

390
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I just still polyenish and I would like to believe you don't have to do that.

391
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
We know you're not in for office.

392
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
If you have that feeling that there was a need to do that.

393
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Well, you know, my opponent who won a race for lieutenant governor statewide,

394
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I just said, you know, I really want to believe that I could talk about

395
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
early childhood education and the opiate addiction crisis and the issues

396
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
that are cutting across the entire population, whereas he was talking about

397
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
GMOs and marijuana legalization, etc. and he did win.

398
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And I don't want to read the tea leaves to assume that there wasn't other factors,

399
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
but I was sort of waiting to see if those issues,

400
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
those single issue voters in a primary or whether it's not in a press coverage

401
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
or down that race, what's gonna break through?

402
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It's gonna be, you know, the people who are passionate about wanting to kill

403
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
the issue, like marijuana or a civil rights issue.

404
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You've all been so interesting.

405
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I mean, we could well go into the night and continue to listen to you.

406
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
But I think we're going to take questions from the audience.

407
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Anyone?

408
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,800
So I have a question of the role of the media.

409
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,480
You have a situation that you all sort of express

410
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,680
rather eloquently about, I guess,

411
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,280
the past to lead to lead or something like that.

412
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,200
So I think that's really well put.

413
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,200
But what is the responsibility of the media?

414
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,360
What are you supposed to be teaching the electorate

415
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,480
in a way that's sort of middle of the road?

416
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,560
Here's the information.

417
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,120
You assess what you figure out what you want to take from it,

418
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,960
because CNN tried that for a long time.

419
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,240
And they went in their ratings and their revenue went down

420
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,740
forever.

421
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,720
And then Donald Trump single handedly

422
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,120
pulled them out of the morasts,

423
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,440
and they chose to go with the money.

424
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,040
So what is the responsibility of the media,

425
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,840
and how do they survive by doing it?

426
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,840
Well, I'm all tired.

427
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,400
I still believe that we take the broadcast

428
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,200
and the airways belong to the public.

429
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,000
They have to do.

430
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,040
And so what I thought in broadcasting in 1969,

431
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,960
that was something that was drilled into our heads.

432
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,600
So it was drilled that you present.

433
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:23,320
It wasn't your subjectivity to union as a psychologist

434
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,520
and a psychiatrist is probably an elusive thing.

435
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,080
But you present things in a fair enough way

436
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,000
so that people can decide.

437
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,040
That's what we were told.

438
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,480
We're also told that you covered people up.

439
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,160
You took the issue to the people in power.

440
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,800
The community people, you brought them along.

441
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,200
So what I've been astounded about over the decade

442
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:53,280
is that they treat it as the way community issues are covered.

443
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:01,520
And they will take Jane Smith and treat her with disrespect

444
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,040
and then treat this politician who

445
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,960
does a post-made questioning with the greater respect.

446
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,880
And so I think it's part of the training.

447
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,240
And some of these people aren't trained.

448
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
They don't read.

449
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,600
Let's just be honest.

450
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,400
So I think the responsibility of the,

451
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,200
and then they're part of the corporations or people

452
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,560
to group.

453
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,880
And so their job is to maximize profits.

454
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,320
So I don't know what you do about that.

455
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,320
That's your crystal.

456
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,840
Yes, maximizing profits is important.

457
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:39,800
So where do you find the higher levels of any organization

458
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,800
that we're going to maximize profit?

459
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:47,160
We feel we have an obligation to inform and educate

460
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,080
and to give both sides.

461
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,080
And if the risk of doing that means

462
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,720
we're going to be outrun by competitors who

463
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,320
are not doing that.

464
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,760
That's a serious problem.

465
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,440
There is no law that says how you have to function.

466
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,000
You should function.

467
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,160
And I think those of us who grew up in journalism,

468
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,480
and at least that was a least where I was working.

469
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,000
We're lucky both at NBC and public television.

470
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,120
That was a mantra.

471
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,120
That we need.

472
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,120
That's what we have to do.

473
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,320
That was the goal.

474
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,280
And yes, we wanted to make it as interesting as possible.

475
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,320
And yes, we dealt with some of those things

476
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:41,400
that were more entertainment than they were informational,

477
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,200
but still had to make sure we did

478
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,080
what was informational.

479
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,720
Not enough organizations feel responsible to do that,

480
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,880
even though they say so and not.

481
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,320
But you know where you can find the organizations in Newland,

482
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,960
and those that don't.

483
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,920
But for a lot of economic reasons,

484
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,600
and also with the explosion of the social media

485
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:10,240
and the internet, there's no way to force that.

486
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,480
And that's a real problem for the country.

487
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,040
There are some places where you can still find it.

488
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,640
But the viewer, the leader, the digital user

489
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,160
has to have the desire to do that.

490
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,160
That's, like, sure.

491
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,720
It's an interesting column written in Washington

492
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,160
because today, traditionally, it's

493
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,080
a certain editorial board.

494
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,200
It's in places like Texas and Arizona,

495
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,760
who have endorsed Hillary Clinton,

496
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,920
and have lost subscribers and are getting threats,

497
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,400
and all sorts of things are happening.

498
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,360
And the interviews with the heads of those editorial boards

499
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,320
basically saying that we anticipated

500
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,480
that we would lose subscribers, we anticipated heat,

501
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,280
but we felt like this was the right thing to do.

502
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,480
And there was a, I believe it was the Arizona Republic

503
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,320
today in North Donald Trump.

504
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,720
And it was the first time, I'm sorry, Hillary Clinton.

505
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,520
And the first time he had endorsed a Democrat,

506
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,440
it says 18, 90 something, I think.

507
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,440
So that happens.

508
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,560
I'm sorry by Janet.

509
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,560
You reminded me of a thing in journalism

510
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,520
that I heard when I was very young in the business,

511
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,480
which is the job of the journalist

512
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,680
is to comfortably afflict it and afflict the comfortable.

513
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,920
And I think, as we're all seeing tonight,

514
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,840
that people now are reading only what they agree with.

515
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,680
I know when I get, some will say it's a brilliant column.

516
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,720
I know what that means.

517
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,000
They agree with it.

518
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,560
And so I think that as a result of this change,

519
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,760
there really are so many options now

520
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,760
that you can take and choose just what you're comfortable with.

521
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:56,040
So we are largely providing comfort food to the committee.

522
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,440
And I think that is a major change.

523
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,680
But it's being done for purely business reasons.

524
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,840
There's publishers, owners, broadcasters,

525
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,280
the major decision.

526
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,480
This is the only way to survive.

527
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,920
We've got all these new platforms, all these new options.

528
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,960
When the internet has cut the legs out from newspapers

529
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,360
and magazines, in much the same way

530
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:23,000
that the iPhone cut the legs out from publishing and music

531
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,200
publishing, it's a change.

532
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,280
The technology has dramatically changed the business.

533
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,800
And because the business has changed,

534
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,480
the content and the motivation and the behavior

535
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,200
of the providers has also changed.

536
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,560
First of all, I would like to say how a refreshing

537
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,920
business is to see a super travel with women

538
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,680
out of non-regband three to two.

539
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,000
My end, I'm a hero at the C-4 event.

540
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,200
So the question is actually going back

541
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,880
to the very initial instatement about the vilification

542
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,840
of electrodes.

543
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,840
And I want to turn around and ask,

544
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,840
what about the impact that the electors are having

545
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,720
on candidates?

546
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,320
Because electors are typically driven by, I think it's fair

547
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,440
to say, really tactical issues as opposed

548
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,640
to strategic ones, there are strategic backgrounds.

549
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,120
But essentially, the balance that they check on a day-to-day

550
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,920
basis is a major component of what you pride in.

551
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,440
So in many cases, you see candidates

552
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,480
that have sort of stepped back from some

553
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,680
of their strategy directions in order

554
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,920
to cater to the desire of the electorates.

555
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,280
And some of the candidates have been

556
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,200
able to have the biggest impact of being

557
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,040
in the one-hundred-day warning.

558
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,520
Some of the sort of broader tradition,

559
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,840
like Churchill, the war, the European, the racial issue,

560
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,160
et cetera, to actually do what they thought

561
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,840
was the right thing to do despite the electorate.

562
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,560
That's your deal.

563
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,000
That's your deal.

564
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,080
I've seen that show up in two places

565
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,480
in this election cycle, this is physically one

566
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,840
with betrayed policy.

567
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,120
I think we're releasing a populist message

568
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:13,040
about portrayed and portrayed agreements.

569
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,720
But I just can't believe that Donald Trump really

570
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,880
believes what he said last night in the debate,

571
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,880
because I just lost my tune.

572
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,880
I did that.

573
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,200
Then he doesn't believe in free trade

574
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,440
and that he wants to slow down to TPP, et cetera.

575
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,080
But I'm not at the national level,

576
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,360
but I look at the other foreign policy

577
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,120
reasons why we need a free trade agreement that doesn't

578
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,200
get China all the power in that region.

579
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,120
And I don't know that we have the comfort level of our ability

580
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,440
to talk to voters and tell that story.

581
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,160
Talk about it as more than just where jobs are going,

582
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,560
because as people have said in commentaries today and yesterday,

583
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
there's no jobs to bring back.

584
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,400
And yet we're completely cow time to the electorate

585
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,000
and trade policy in a way that's kind of irresponsible

586
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,200
some way for me to be recorded.

587
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,960
But it's a really difficult conversation to have.

588
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,640
We could call it.

589
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,520
And the second is higher education.

590
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,120
And I'm actually really hurt by that one.

591
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,120
I think as people try to get millennials excited and out

592
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,240
to vote, they can't ignore the suffocating way of student

593
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,480
death of their experience.

594
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,760
And you see a shift to try at a cognitive young

595
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,680
voters by having a platform that's inclusive of that issue.

596
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,880
I mean, and I just think it's the candidate's like Bernie

597
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,360
Sanders maybe because I'm biased because of Trump or not.

598
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,880
But who have gotten a lot of small donation

599
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,400
from a wide swath of the electorate

600
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,760
that people are hearing that populist message and trying

601
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,480
to answer it.

602
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,200
And I think there's some value in that.

603
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,040
But it also is very difficult, given the system and the climate

604
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,440
that we're in, to challenge the big institutions that

605
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:55,520
fund your campaigns, whether it's labor or big business

606
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,520
and whoever it may be.

607
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,360
One percent of the population in this country

608
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,800
contribute to political campaigns.

609
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,400
So when we talk about the 1%, that is a lot of who

610
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,480
will end up having their voices heard.

611
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,480
And right now, there's some populist issues

612
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,480
that I think are going to shape what

613
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,920
happens in the very near term that aren't necessary,

614
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,880
that need some leadership of some of things

615
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,880
to write into.

616
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,380
Yeah.

617
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:31,380
I'm an amateur of history, but I know enough to know

618
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,580
this is not the first time history of this country

619
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,580
where we had a divided electorate.

620
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,780
I just think for the first time, the obvious instance

621
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,580
that most of you would this Lincoln state.

622
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:47,220
But it seems to me, from this discussion,

623
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,780
that it's a very different kind of issue now

624
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:57,100
than an issue which was primarily around a single override

625
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,580
concern about which they would do this opinion.

626
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:04,660
And by the way, I think we cast out

627
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:09,100
the notion of the prejudice of different outlets,

628
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,700
because this is a wonderful book Harold

629
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:14,020
Ozergogh, Lincoln and the Press, which

630
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,780
makes it very clear that although that time,

631
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:20,140
the press was the only major means of communication,

632
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,660
they were very divided and very different.

633
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:25,700
And if you read one and read another,

634
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,940
you aren't reading about the same world.

635
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:32,660
So that fact is not different today than historical,

636
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:36,140
but it seems to me from what you guys have been saying,

637
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:40,860
that we do not have a single issue dividing this electorate.

638
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,020
It's much more complicated, maybe

639
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,660
because our population is more complex.

640
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,460
Well, the world is more complex,

641
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,220
but I'd like to hear you say something about that,

642
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,460
but it's hard to understand.

643
00:59:53,940 --> 01:00:02,460
But on the issue of the olden days in terms of the media,

644
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,820
I completely agree with you, Senator.

645
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:09,460
But I think what happened in the United States,

646
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:13,180
sort of after World War II primarily,

647
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:17,220
I think journalism itself became a more professionalized,

648
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,660
occupation.

649
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,260
I think the standards went up.

650
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,540
I think that the separation of church and state, which

651
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:26,300
the New York Times, where I grew up,

652
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:30,140
very strict dividing line between opinion and news gathering.

653
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:33,380
Different editors who separately reported to the publisher,

654
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,700
there was no real communication.

655
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:40,060
So the news side did not reflect the opinion side

656
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,660
of the paper.

657
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,340
Other papers did it in similar ways.

658
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,500
I think that was the ideal.

659
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,180
And I think it was almost unique,

660
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,740
because I believe in many countries,

661
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:56,260
papers are much more alive with political parties,

662
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:01,060
and our spokespeople in many ways, who are part of it.

663
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,420
So I think the American experience

664
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,100
was different in that regard.

665
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:08,020
And now I think it's reverting back.

666
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,300
Again, I think the technology is a large part,

667
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,500
but I think we're losing something that we had.

668
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,940
We didn't necessarily have very long,

669
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,380
but I thought it was very good.

670
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,260
And I think we're losing it now.

671
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,260
I want to see something about the consolidation media.

672
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:25,220
And in the Civil, American Civil Rights Movement,

673
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:28,420
some of the southern papers were particularly courageous

674
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:31,580
in terms of their editorials at land constitution,

675
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:36,780
the nationalton of theme papers, who really, first of all,

676
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:40,740
they had news coverage, which I'm sure many people didn't

677
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,660
agree with, and then they had editorials, which really

678
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,420
talked about fairness.

679
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,820
And I think that they certainly would not

680
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:52,660
have considered themselves allies of the Civil Rights Movement,

681
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,380
but they considered themselves, they

682
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,580
considered that they had a responsibility to tell the truth

683
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:02,940
and to be a little bit more expansive with how they treated

684
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:08,260
these various populations and how they treated this.

685
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:11,300
I mean, they were involved in living history,

686
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,500
and everybody really understood that.

687
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:19,340
But the courage that some of these newspaper people had,

688
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,980
it just, for me, is just astounding and heartwarming

689
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:22,980
that they would do that.

690
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,740
But being taken over by, and there's still some outlets

691
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,940
that are still courageous.

692
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:34,380
And I hope that the Arizona paper republic still exists.

693
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:39,860
But there are a few crazies that push people to the extreme

694
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,820
and not do what they might want to do.

695
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:46,580
But I think we have to lift up those who really continue

696
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:50,340
to do what I think the work of journalism is supposed to do.

697
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,420
Here, Rick, first of all, I'm in favor of making

698
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,420
immediate reading it.

699
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:09,700
There's a sort of line of thinking that I want to point to.

700
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:13,500
It's a idea that they are confused.

701
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:19,380
I think that's worth really thinking about what that means.

702
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,260
Because there's a theory, which I think

703
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,940
there's some people who are marginalized actually

704
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:30,420
can see some things, that people who are at the center

705
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,340
can't see.

706
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:37,420
And I think I'm not sure that these people are confused.

707
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,860
I think they might be seeing things.

708
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,900
They might be wanting to see things.

709
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,180
Seeing things that we don't see.

710
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:48,740
And in particular, this idea that, well, people

711
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,660
have lost faith in their institutions.

712
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,940
Surveys, I think, is absolutely right.

713
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:59,260
But what we don't say then is, is that telling us

714
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,940
that our institutions are failing?

715
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,060
And what do we do about that?

716
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,380
We tend to take it as, well, somehow

717
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:10,580
we have to convince people that they're wrong.

718
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:17,500
And I think this drop and Bernie both movements

719
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,660
are really posing a very serious question.

720
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:23,620
Not about people's faith in institutions,

721
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:26,580
but really about the institutions themselves.

722
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:27,820
And that's a question which I think

723
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,820
is much more difficult to take out.

724
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:36,060
I completely agree with you.

725
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,420
I think the idea that the public is wrong

726
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:41,060
is a danger of slope, a slippery slope,

727
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:46,260
because then government becomes another self-interest group,

728
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:47,340
protecting itself.

729
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:52,620
I think in a real democracy, the individual was sovereign.

730
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:54,740
And I think we do have to listen.

731
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:57,740
When people, especially millions upon millions of people

732
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,780
are saying, this is not working for me.

733
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,940
Instead of saying, well, then you're just wrong,

734
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,740
we have to say, well, let's hear that out.

735
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:06,740
Let's figure that out.

736
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,740
Right.

737
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:08,740
Right.

738
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:09,740
Yeah.

739
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:13,980
I think the question becomes how you achieve that change.

740
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,220
I mean, if the status quo is broken,

741
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:22,100
can you achieve gradual change that answers that call?

742
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:26,300
Because it's hard to envision how you transition

743
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,220
an entire system right now without a crisis

744
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,180
or without a serious disruption to the status quo.

745
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,460
And I think that's what we're seeing right now.

746
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:36,180
It's people, usually you have election years

747
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,900
where it's hope and change or everything's going great.

748
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,580
But this year, it feels different.

749
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,460
It feels like people are saying the status quo

750
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,140
is absolutely unacceptable.

751
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,620
And if it's not this year, then very soon,

752
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:49,300
we as institutions, whether it's political parties

753
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:52,460
or government itself, are going to have to shape the change

754
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,100
before the change shapes us.

755
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,900
And what that looks like, I think, is really dynamic,

756
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,580
but it has to be faster than the natural evolution.

757
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:05,820
And I don't know what shape it will take.

758
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:09,700
I do think that that is a very good point.

759
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,740
But let's consider this.

760
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:17,180
It's not working for one block and another block

761
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,380
and another block and another block.

762
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:22,540
Say, you have all these groups that are saying,

763
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,340
it's not working for me.

764
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:28,620
How are you going to have a coalescence that

765
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:36,540
allows to us to have our values persisted?

766
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:41,220
Well, you need a political leadership.

767
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:46,900
And this is why it's so tough that wants to solve it

768
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:50,820
and wants to address it and not to divide.

769
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,980
And I don't mean just the president,

770
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:56,380
but it's got to be the president and the Congress

771
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,420
and the state legislators.

772
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:01,860
But there has to be some commitment

773
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:06,820
and not to change it to meet ideology,

774
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:10,620
but to honestly address whatever institutional problems

775
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:12,900
they are and deal with them.

776
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,180
And you need an atmosphere where there's

777
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:19,580
a desire to try and fix it.

778
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:24,740
And what we risk again, I think, in this coming election,

779
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,140
and depending what the outcome is,

780
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:31,420
at the particular at the presidential and congressional

781
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:36,740
level, if we have the same kind of divide where the two

782
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,620
are just going to be pitted against each other

783
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:42,300
for another four years, likelihood things

784
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,420
aren't going to those questions won't get addressed.

785
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:48,980
And that could well happen.

786
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,980
I wish we could go on forever.

787
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,620
This has been absolutely fascinating.

788
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:55,580
Please join me in thanking our wonderful panelists.

789
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:57,580
Thank you.

790
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:26,580
And thank you all for coming.
