1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,440
Are you ready?

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,320
I'm the associate director of the center.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,400
Before I introduce the participants of today's round table, I have two brief announcements.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:36,720
One is that the next program on the beauty and unity of mathematics is on December 1.

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,600
And then on December 15, it's a program on animal consciousness.

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,480
And then other programs you will see if you go to the website.

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,840
I will make a very brief introduction of the participants today.

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,400
If you want more information on them, you go to our website.

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:02,800
There's a detailed bio there.

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,640
Michael first, who is sitting right there, is professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,840
University.

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,960
Laura Hirschbein is professor of psychiatry at University of Michigan.

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,800
Francis Lee is the chair of the department of psychiatry at Cornell Medical, Cornell

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,280
Medicine.

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:31,480
Robert Michaels is the Wach McDermott University professor of medicine at psychiatry at Wyl Cornell.

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:38,800
And Miklo Stott is the neuroscientist professor of pharmacology at Wyl Cornell.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,320
So as you know, the format is a spontaneous conversation amongst the participants.

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Thank you.

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:02:13,040
Who wants to get the going?

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,360
Well, we were just talking a minute ago before everybody started about the fact that I'm

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,880
a historian and I'm the only woman and the only non-New Yorker, so I guess I have a perspective.

22
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,000
But we were talking about wondering whether the history should start first if we're looking

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
to the future.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,240
But the problem with starting in the past is if you're imagining a narrative, do we want

25
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,800
the way people tend to use history is to tell the story about the president.

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,080
Are we talking about the past as the battle days that are leading to the future with new

27
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,360
discoveries, new advances, new neuroscience, new whatever, or are we going to use the past

28
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,840
to tell a story of decline that we've lost track of the things that we used to do that

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,800
we used to do well and now we're in soulless territory of just symptom counting with due

30
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,360
appreciation to DSM.

31
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:13,000
So you can use the history to tell the story of decline, the story of progress, or as I

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,160
tend to see it, the story of things that continue, the themes that come up over and over and

33
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,120
over and over again.

34
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,840
The things that we discover and rediscover, we discover brains, we discover symptoms,

35
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,320
we discover statistics, I'm reading a great book on the history of statistics now that

36
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,040
it points out that we psychiatrists were doing statistical counting in the 17th century.

37
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,200
And so the idea of counting and looking at numbers is not new.

38
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,720
We humans like to do that.

39
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:55,080
The first step of trying to understand things is to put some order in things that hopefully

40
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,280
patterns will emerge and will have understanding.

41
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,760
So that's what going on for a very long time and that continues to be the main way everybody

42
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,760
wonders in the DSM diagnostic statistical manual, what was the statistical part?

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,680
And that was because it originally was used for collecting statistics in mental hospitals

44
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,160
and nowadays I guess you could argue the coding allows people to collect statistics but that's

45
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,680
really the only reason they keep the assets for historical reasons.

46
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,240
It's a well-known document.

47
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
It's really not a statistical anymore but you're right.

48
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,720
The idea of starting out by the DSM unfortunately remains a descriptive observational system

49
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,160
with almost no depth to it at all and people have criticized it for that reason which is

50
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,000
certainly a valid criticism but it remains useful because there's no alternative.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,560
It's always the thing when somebody trashes the DSM it's okay so what do you want to replace

52
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
it with?

53
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,960
It usually don't get much response.

54
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,960
So it's incredibly limited but it continues despite all of the advances in neuroscience

55
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,520
and everything else it continues to have value as an organizing principle.

56
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,440
It's very limited.

57
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:08,600
I think the perspective actually is very useful.

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,520
I remember 15 years ago I think when Paul the Genius came out I'm looking at everything

59
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:24,520
from the basic science point you have to just a disclaimer but I remember that one of the

60
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,320
traction of what this field is that this new genes came out and everybody believed that

61
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,240
after a while we will be able to explain some of the symptoms and maybe actually we can

62
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,600
define a certain disease based on diseases, disease genes.

63
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,840
And historically now we know that it's actually absolutely another case.

64
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,280
If anything it's even more complicated.

65
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,640
So I've been struggling with this in my whole lab and in the university that how actually

66
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,760
to solve that problem and we can discuss it later but obviously we have to move out from

67
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,440
the single gene and even multiple gene because we have to understand how the environment

68
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,520
is really impinging on this whole gene network and if you have time maybe discuss about that.

69
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,440
I think still the genome is a hope that the genome can or epigenome rather can explain

70
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,000
a lot of things.

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,720
So historically I think we really moved a lot from genes and now we have the epigenome

72
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,920
and hopefully we have some chance to get a little bit deeper into this how because that's

73
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,880
still yes we are in a very simple case we have an epigenome now but like in the 780

74
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,440
90s that we have a lot of things but we don't understand how they work together how to interact.

75
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,960
But I think it's a little bit more bad execution now we have more players so it's almost

76
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,160
that we need another level of understanding.

77
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,720
I think we do know more I'm also a neuroscientist and I was just out of symposium at Cornell

78
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,680
and yesterday and from a lot of different neuroscientists I was coming from the sound

79
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:11,440
of the video and was actually clear it was muffled here too.

80
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,000
Is this better?

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,720
Is it really or not actually much closer to understanding the pathophysiologists like

82
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,680
yeah this order despite the hundreds of genes that have now been found.

83
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,560
The best example I was at this meeting was that the success story now the best success

84
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,840
story in psychiatry is autism.

85
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:44,920
99 genes will now have met genome wide significance very penetrative high effect sizes they account

86
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,480
for 1% or less than 1% all autism in this population.

87
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,720
But each of these papers is a nature paper.

88
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,320
This is considered the best advance of what we can do at this point.

89
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,120
And it's actually not clear how to move forward and I think this is something that I struggle

90
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
with also.

91
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:13,160
It's just that the hope as Miklo said was that 20 years ago or 30 years ago was just

92
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,720
like in pulmonology or nephrology we could just get a bunch of genes and then be able

93
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:28,440
to move forward and what's clear is that this is not a linear path.

94
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,720
The brain is probably more complicated.

95
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:38,600
There's some number like 150,000 or 150 trillion synapses.

96
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:45,240
This is just us for us to think that a single gene or 100 genes could help explaining this

97
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,520
is going to be difficult to answer.

98
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,320
It was very sobering meeting.

99
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,320
But if I may just to defect that so basically I think it's specific issues like 15 years

100
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,640
ago in the Facebook was or Amazon started.

101
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,200
So basically the idea if you think about it is that you get all of this information,

102
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,000
they collect information, personal information and 15 years ago they just started.

103
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,080
Now they have a tremendous amount of information and that's for me to ask.

104
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,240
Now they have arguments that they can actually figure out what next move is and maybe send

105
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,640
you an advertisement and we want to say that's saying some pet food or something because

106
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,800
you know that you have a pet at home and more complex.

107
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,760
So I was thinking maybe that kind of strategy because we have now genes, epigenomes and

108
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,080
a lot of that low side.

109
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
We have thousands of tests.

110
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,560
So how to put together all of individual players as they would pull out the society

111
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,160
to a comprehensive understanding of how the society works and how the brain works.

112
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,600
But I was just thinking another day about this but it's still probably not the right

113
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,680
template because it's a very two-dimensional of what they do.

114
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,280
They just collect and they can interpret.

115
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:09,320
What our problem is that we have multidimensional, we have genes, then we have synapses, connectivity,

116
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,360
then we have circuit functions and then behavior which is very elusive.

117
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,680
But most people work at that level.

118
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,840
So I think it has to be something where you could integrate these data sets like the

119
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:30,840
UN and Facebook interface but sets but you would be able to actually in a 3D almost fashion

120
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,600
to integrate all of this information to a comprehensive understanding of the brain.

121
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,840
I have no idea what basically I'm talking about here but I'm just basically saying that

122
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:46,160
it's just something which will be the next most of time this research you don't really

123
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,240
know what is the next big step but if something has to be very beyond this two-dimensional

124
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,360
understanding what we have now and probably nobody knows this.

125
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,120
It's just somebody will come up.

126
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,720
So that's why I think it's a good idea to invest NIH and IMH puts a lot of money in

127
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
these things.

128
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,720
There are a couple of people now, artificial intelligence comes in.

129
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,160
So maybe something is coming out but we don't know what it is and unfortunately we will

130
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:19,360
not be able to answer the future if I can't see I'm afraid but we just have to put money

131
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:27,040
and then beating 14 internet as a concept to coming out from this and I don't see it

132
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
yet.

133
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:36,680
I'm not for the major conditions let's say bipolar disorder or schizophrenia for example.

134
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:49,440
Are the studies focused on finding out what causes the condition or are the studies also

135
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,560
focused on dissecting it into the symptoms and trying to figure out what causes each

136
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
symptom?

137
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:04,040
I think at this point the main, at least from what I can get, the main thrust where the

138
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:11,760
money is going is collecting as many samples as possible to get hundreds of thousands of

139
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,480
samples of biological samples from ME, DNA and other and to try to do large statistical

140
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,240
analysis essentially genome-wide associations and they've succeeded in finding now over

141
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,240
200 schizophrenia genes accounting again for low percentages of the risk, like 0.5% of

142
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,840
the risk for schizophrenia.

143
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:41,680
They just completed in England a study where they took 100,000 people with depression and

144
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,920
they were able to find 50 genes that looked like they might be affected.

145
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,960
15, 5, 0.

146
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:56,360
Again, low effect sizes for each of these but essentially this is where efforts are to.

147
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,400
Again this is sort of like counting, it's sort of like they just want to accumulate as

148
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,560
many potential genes that might be a risk gene at this point and these are still early

149
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,840
days I would say.

150
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:15,320
20 years ago there was, there were none so if you divide by zero this is infinitely

151
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
better.

152
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,880
If you say 50 genes are responsible for the depression then what?

153
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,560
But they account for so little of the risk so it's sort of like it's a small effect size

154
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,120
so that there is a, the best example is one of the genes is a glutamate receptor which

155
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,720
makes somewhat sense glutamate receptors are everywhere now.

156
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,200
So but the problem, this one glutamate receptor they found is that it's everywhere.

157
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:51,440
So how you're going to actually target a drug to or something like that is going to be very

158
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
difficult.

159
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,520
Drug companies have been targeting this class of receptors already so in many ways we know

160
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,920
that this demiurs are stuck then with them again the complexity of the nervous system

161
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:10,080
in the brain and then even if we have one hit that makes some sense it's still very hard

162
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,640
to move forward.

163
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,680
You know it's interesting thinking about all of this data because again this brings

164
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,600
me back to this book I'm reading on the history of statistics and statistics in psychiatry

165
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,480
in particular where they were drowning in data in the 19th century.

166
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,760
You know one of the, one of Emil Cropelen's arguments was that he was spending all of

167
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
his time with data.

168
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,720
He had so much data he didn't know what to do with it and obviously we have a better

169
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,000
capacity for managing data but the thing that came after all of this data gathering in the

170
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,880
early 20th century was Freud and psychoanalysis has said okay we're not going to talk about

171
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,520
these big groups we're going to talk about one person and we're going to talk about how

172
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,880
what makes up this one person and how this one person's inner conflicts manifested in

173
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:58,280
these symptoms or these experiences and so I'm wondering if the future maybe if somebody

174
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,840
gets to the point where we have all this data and it's little pixels and it's everywhere

175
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,560
and it doesn't cohere to a particular picture that we're going to have another wave of people

176
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,480
saying no actually what we need are individuals, individual relationships.

177
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,640
You know we're spending all of our time bumping into people as we're looking on our phones

178
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,320
not engaging with people or we're going to have a backlash where maybe psychiatrists

179
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,920
will leave maybe will follow to say no actually what we need to do is work on interpersonal

180
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,720
interactions and that one patient again and go back in a different way.

181
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
I don't know.

182
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,360
Have we stopped doing that now?

183
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,280
According to some of our patients we have.

184
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:44,480
I think it's really they are not exclusive and they absolutely you have to just do both.

185
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,280
We do certainly the last day but in the clinics you do certainly the individual but they

186
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:58,280
our our goal is really to understand the basic framework of a disease rather than an individual

187
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:07,240
and maybe how an individual can end up with a disease phenotype from this overall concept

188
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,200
and you are more interested in obviously why this person got that but I think it's just

189
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,880
the two sides of the same story and we just have to do both.

190
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,920
There's an interesting sort of like similar backlash going right now in this other field

191
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,120
of systems neuroscience where people thought that you just need your image more people

192
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,840
and as they're going through various tasks or even whether sitting just to look at their

193
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,560
connect their brain connectome just as a to bring everyone up to speed.

194
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Twenty years ago it was found that the brain actually organized itself into sort of like

195
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,920
hubs within their in the brain and you can actually just get a right what they call a

196
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,840
resting state without any task you can actually get a scan and actually see these hugs in

197
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:59,240
the brain and this is the work of Marcus Rakel at Washington University and people were fascinated

198
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,800
by this and no one has really been able to sort of understand how is it that you can

199
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,800
measure blood flow in the brain and actually see these self organized networks and and

200
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:14,600
so then everyone got excited and just kept on collecting thousands and thousands of

201
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,440
scans so now we have hundreds of thousands of scans within studies now at WashU where

202
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:28,880
Marcus was there they now decided that everyone's network is individualized everyone's brain

203
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,600
is that when you average it you get some average of brain that looks like no brain on the planet

204
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,560
earth so now what they're doing is that they're they're actually taking individuals and actually

205
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:45,360
just scanning them over and over again for example during the course of depression or

206
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,200
during something so they can scan them at the height of symptom pathology and then at

207
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,440
some other point when they're not so I think this is the goal now that that you might want

208
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,440
to basically go back to into and then learn something from these individuals in a way that

209
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,920
that they're not they're not been thought of before.

210
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,560
I think there's a there have been some drug studies on that that this end of one studies

211
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:14,400
where you you take a single person is the study and how they interact with medication

212
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,360
and that's sort of this new thing that's being there.

213
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,960
There's so many individual differences this is essentially this is that you can't the

214
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,400
principles that even of trying to put together a brain connectome is very difficult even

215
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,640
though NIH is spending lots of money on these connectome projects that ultimately you it

216
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,760
might actually just sort of like you sort of like if you want to understand fruit you

217
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,760
don't blend it together.

218
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,240
I believe that response is a little bit simpler because then you ask the question why this

219
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,360
drug is actually working in one individual actually understand the pharmacology of that

220
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,440
based on an enzyme which is either stronger or weaker in certain individuals it's called

221
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,960
seep enzymes but basically they just metabolize the drug many times this is crucial so and

222
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,440
we can even now a patient can be screened because it's genetically based one can take

223
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,920
a sample from blood and it's every cell is the same and we can basically figure out

224
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:20,360
that it's a fast metabolizer a slow metabolizer and maybe that's the reason somebody is actually

225
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,440
a side effects or another person does not respond and it's just a dose relationship

226
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,760
so that that maybe somewhat easier to understand than what the underlying cause which could

227
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,440
be thousands of different ways but I still believe that there's a still something common

228
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:45,760
feature or features that it is a circuitry I kind of start to believe in circuitry no

229
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,480
nobody's but maybe it's just to be as it's fashionable but but circuitry in animal models

230
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,040
at least you can understand how the circuitry can be linked to a certain behavior we can

231
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,600
model the circuitry we can activate we can deactivate certain very different secondary

232
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,960
even we can we can tailor we call it synaptic transmission in certain areas of brain and

233
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,840
we can we can't respond but of course after below and underneath there's a lot of genes

234
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:23,920
and synapse and other things you just don't really understand I'm gonna go back to where

235
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:32,080
we started and be a little provocative to me psychiatry's defined like all medical

236
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:40,520
specialties as everything that's relevant to helping people with a certain kind of problem

237
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:49,720
and the neuroscience research base that we've been talking about is fascinating exciting

238
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:59,280
intriguing and essentially totally irrelevant to helping any living patient it may have

239
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,280
some hope for the future although a possible outcome of the work is that this strategy

240
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,840
won't lead to anything helpful for patients or maybe to some modest twists on some of

241
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:21,080
our current drugs almost all of our current biologic treatments were discovered by happen

242
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:31,120
stance not by scientific research they're serendipitous if we never spent the penny on

243
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,760
any neuroscience basic research over the last hundred years it would make trivial difference

244
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,480
the current psychiatric patients but we didn't know that I mean obviously clearly that's

245
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,920
the problem I mean it was that we were going to crack the problem by going neuroscience

246
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:54,680
but as our historian warned us we have to study the past to find out we won't repeat

247
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,680
so it wasn't money weight it was wasted in the sense it didn't give us what we wanted

248
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:07,240
but it was wasted but it led to nothing yes it was a very intelligent gamble that lost

249
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,920
so it's short term lost we don't know about the future I just want that for background

250
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,680
because when we talk about the excitement of contemporary neuroscience research we're

251
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:27,840
talking about possible hopes for a fairly distant future we're not talking about anyone who's

252
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,120
mentally ill today or anything that might help that person but one of the side effects

253
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,640
of the neuroscience thing is I believe it's been partly responsible for lowering the stigma

254
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,160
of mental disorders and it's unfortunate because somehow if it's in the brain therefore people

255
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,480
shouldn't be stigma I mean the fact that it has helped stigma in a way is sad that it

256
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,080
took something like this but I think it has people having a brain disease calling schizophrenia

257
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,240
brain disease I mean all over and calling substance abuse if you believe it's a brain disease

258
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,240
but people call it a brain disease partly to try to reduce the stigma so this angle to

259
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,480
split the besides the fact we're trying to look for answers is actually I think had an

260
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,920
improvement with respect to the place of psychiatry and medicine and also the place of patients

261
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,480
with mental disorders within the myths of medical history that's the rhetoric of neuroscience

262
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,280
yes exactly no no but that's a part of the plan of all this money was well if it achieved

263
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,600
nothing but that then it would have been well spent as much as I think it's my thing

264
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,200
the problem the downside of that though is that the patients expectations of what we

265
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,240
can do for them are sky high you know that they they sit there and wait for us to fix

266
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,720
their brain disease while they don't want to put any I have too much serotonin I read about

267
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,000
that which can give you a drug to reduce that and I'll feel better right right and so the

268
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,520
expectations are very high our drugs are okay we our therapies are good but people have to

269
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:58,400
put effort into it right I think these happen really outside of the neuroscience for example

270
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,400
if it's infectious diseases going back hundreds of years and then figure figure out if it's

271
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,880
a cleaner environment probably can avoid something we need a little microbiome or microbiome

272
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:16,760
or microorganisms but I think eventually when this boxers discovered cloned the gene structure

273
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,400
understood then we know the target we can design antibiotics more precisely not just by by

274
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,080
lock like not that is silly most certainly a lot but now everything is designed or age

275
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,120
would have not been treated the way unless you know we had the virus we had the structure

276
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,920
we have the genome and actually the drugs which are double up that are targeting a particular

277
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:46,520
gene so I think we are just a few hundred years maybe behind psychiatry but basically

278
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:54,960
a history tells me that yes this is the typical curve their accidental and then for just findings

279
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,840
and we use it because that's the only way we have maybe they are not even useful to

280
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,400
them of further drugs like in a certain in blockers so that we couldn't go further behind

281
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,360
that so we need some other information to build another way and be just not there yet

282
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,960
but I think we have to just patient and I don't know we will be see that time but it

283
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:24,120
just have to be this is the normal course I think every since and I said I mean first

284
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:33,840
of all as I always say I agree with you Bob is that and I think it's sort of sort of

285
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,400
reflected by the fact that the the Cornell resident's psychiatry residents really have

286
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,160
to know nothing about the brain in order to be an outstanding resident that the training

287
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,880
itself does not require us to even know the mechanism of action of any of the drugs that

288
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,600
they're given because we actually don't know for example even how this year maybe it's

289
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:58,920
not a good each them medical school it's not taken very seriously but will you say the

290
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:06,400
way forward is if instead of putting our X percent GDP into neuroscience research how

291
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:13,320
do you construct moving the field of psychiatry which is to help these people that are that

292
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:21,240
are leaving very difficult lives and you but more proportion for example in prison and

293
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:30,040
how do we help these with that psychiatrist and possibly difficult but very important

294
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:37,040
question and I'll translate it pragmatically how should the nation devote its resources

295
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:44,560
for toward the issues of mental illness and we're doing it wrong we're spending too much

296
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:53,000
money in tertiary care for people with serious mental illnesses not enough money in preventive

297
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,120
medicine even where we know certain things that would make a difference and would work

298
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:09,200
we certainly would do much more for the next x years 50 hundred of the populations psychiatric

299
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:18,920
problems if we put more money into early child development mentoring experiences at a facility

300
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:34,200
then in tertiary care strategies for the persistent and chronic mentally ill that are biologic

301
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:46,560
in nature we know that the pattern of drug use in this country has more to do with physicians

302
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:54,040
needing to placate dissatisfied and angry patients rather than with knowledge about the impact

303
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:01,600
of the drugs on their behavior or their brain but we know that the skillful physicians know

304
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,000
that can reduce the patients dissatisfaction with the treatment by writing a description

305
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,560
and more expensive the medicine better the effect of the pharmaceutical and this is triggered

306
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:21,720
out of walls and we're going along with it but it's very hard to revise the system so

307
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:33,920
the goal is total public health rather than satisfying individual consumers and current

308
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:41,960
health delivery system has as its output satisfying consumers rather than the health

309
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:49,360
of the nation that's a public health disaster which is supported politically that's not

310
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,880
really psychiatry but it has a lot more to do with mental health in the next hundred

311
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,760
years than neuroscience.

312
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:07,000
The only thing I would say that is we've already put an x number of billions or millions

313
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,400
hundreds of millions of dollars in these sort of early intervention studies public health

314
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,280
efforts such as Head Start and I've not yet seen any data that that is it's just that

315
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:25,000
we have not put enough or is it that it's not clear to me that we're making we're moving

316
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,960
the needle even with the programs we have now or is it that the needle is just a part

317
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
to move?

318
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,040
Well I'm not sure Head Start's the answer Francis but for example you know the study

319
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:43,680
of sure better than I do that the children of depressed mothers who are depressed during

320
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:49,200
pregnancy and in the postpartum period have been mental health outcomes.

321
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,560
We know how to treat depression better than most things we know how to treat including

322
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,920
depressed pregnant women and depressed women postpartum but we don't deliver that treatment

323
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,480
effectively to lots of populations.

324
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:12,760
We would have more public health mental health benefit by organizing a more effective intervention

325
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:22,120
to assure the mental health of pregnant and postpartum women.

326
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:31,360
Then almost anything else we get for our dollar and mental health.

327
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,240
I think the neuroscience is fascinating.

328
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:42,680
I believe we should invest in it but I think that there's a there's a image probably

329
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
wrong.

330
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:49,320
I think we sell it with the implication that it's going to make a difference soon and

331
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,400
I don't think that's true.

332
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:58,640
On the other hand if we tell the truth we're going to lose resources so people act rationally.

333
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,360
The way you get the largest grant and the greatest congressional appropriation is to

334
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:12,160
suggest not that the connect homes are fascinating but they may lead to a cure for Alzheimer's

335
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,520
disease possibly Thursday.

336
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:25,600
You can't imagine anyone not using that strategy because we do have data that that strategy

337
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
works.

338
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:32,520
Well the trade-off there is a fixed amount of money available for research and we've

339
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,880
seen it NIH the amount of research that's going into treatment development.

340
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,720
If all got shunted over into this neuroscience thing.

341
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,200
If we had unlimited money we can do neuroscience and we can do this but it doesn't work that

342
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
way.

343
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,760
We are we or somebody is getting the money or certain portions of psychiatry and neuroscience

344
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,400
are getting the money but the patients I think the treatment research is really dried up.

345
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,720
A lot of it is going to form a sort of depending on pharmaceutical companies and they have

346
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:09,200
unfortunately their motives aren't always aligned with ours so it's a real problem.

347
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,840
That's right this is the way you sell money from the government but unfortunately by diluting

348
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,800
the government into these promises we get don't get good results for the research and

349
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,560
we're really depriving the use of the money elsewhere.

350
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,160
Again I don't know what the solution is but I think that's a problem with the success

351
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,760
of getting money for neuroscience.

352
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,320
What is in the hope that the research is going to give you the tools?

353
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,680
Oh no that's right but I think it's Bob was implying that's not happening.

354
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,680
Well the fact that's not happening Bob said it's not happening soon but what does that

355
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
mean?

356
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,840
It's not happening tomorrow it's not happening in 20 years it's not happening in 50 years.

357
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,640
But maybe never is the problem.

358
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,080
The one thing that's been very clear is everybody said the more we study it the more difficult

359
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,080
it gets.

360
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,680
That's the you know years ago this neuroscience thing see oh all we have to do is sequence

361
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,040
the genome all we have to do is this all we have to do is that and every time we do that

362
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:09,160
we're just waiting for that one is not a single biological test in psychiatry for diagnosis.

363
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,640
One thing I remember when I was working with Alan Francis of the DSM 4 we wrote this guide

364
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,960
book and we put a set to the guide book it was in the Alzheimer's section and we were

365
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,480
saying that we're very confident in the next five years by the time this book is out we're

366
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,880
going to be a biological test for Alzheimer's and boy was that all I'd still offer it 30-

367
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,400
25 years later and we're still you you speak to the Alzheimer's people they said oh another

368
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,760
five year or years to get that right but there's this elusiveness to actually turning these

369
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,760
into now it's not clear what you do about that you don't want to say well let's just

370
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,600
give up and stop doing it but there is this problem with putting money in a direction

371
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,840
that has proven to be very very complicated at what point again if we had an element of

372
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,560
money I'd say well let's keep pursuing that but it's coming at the cost of resources being

373
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:58,120
spent on research for better delivery of treatment you just mentioned the thing with the delivery

374
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,280
of the treatment you know how to treat depression in pregnant women but there's a delivery problem

375
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,800
I mean putting all our money into figuring how to solve those problems would probably

376
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,720
get better short-term results but that's much harder to sell let's spend money on delivery

377
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,040
of care when I was in medical school in a pathology lab one of the professors would

378
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,680
walk around the lab while we were looking at microscopes of cancer cells cancer tissue while

379
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:33,680
he was smoking and so we as medical students told him you know you are a professor of pathology

380
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:38,320
we are looking at cancer there's a connection between lung cancer and smoking where are you

381
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:47,720
smoking he said cancer is cured in ten years I'm talking about the six days so but that doesn't

382
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:55,040
mean that the research in cancer has not borne a lot of fruit so that today with immunotherapy

383
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,760
targeted therapy and so on we are so much further than when I was a medical student so

384
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,280
why wouldn't the same thing happen and you're right the parallels there of course right

385
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,200
that it's going to be cured in ten years the hubs all over medicine they've actually made

386
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,240
a lot more progress like the precision medicine is a good example that entire field and all

387
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,360
that you know when you apply that to psychiatry we are so far away whatever precision but

388
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,120
it's discussed it's always cancer I mean that is has been the area of medicine with

389
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,520
I guess you could argue infectious diseases always precision medicine but cancer is a

390
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,760
great example and they have made I mean you could argue that all that money spent on cancer

391
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,880
which is by the way historically much much more orders of magnitude more than was spent

392
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,280
in mental health but you're right that's finally beginning to pay off and part of it I think

393
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,000
however complicated the cancer story is it is more tractable than I think the psychiatry

394
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,920
story because the of all the it's just it's just so much more complex the brain then I

395
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,920
think that we always assume the cancer thing would be that hard because it looks like it

396
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,800
should be simple that's turned out to be extremely complex or there's just a parallel there

397
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,040
it looks doable then we see it's not and you put a lot of money in it and finally we're

398
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,080
getting some results and that would be the argument let's just do it in our field and

399
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,520
the same thing will happen and it's possible but I think the only downside of that is there's

400
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:19,600
a limited pie of money and what's not being spent on by pursuing this goal but just as

401
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,240
follow up with me closest as and what you're saying it probably means that we will probably

402
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,920
have to spend as much money as we do in cancer which is probably ten times as much as being

403
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,560
spent on all brain disorders so it's not surprising we've not moved the needle at this

404
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:40,640
point in effect and that it took cancer maybe a better analogy is to think that we're about

405
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,200
thirty years behind cancer that might be the best way to think about it at this point

406
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,080
you know and that but that in order to get to work cancer is we're going to have to

407
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:57,080
put more money in and I would not be as provocative as Bob I would actually say that the money

408
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:04,720
that was spent on sort of fundamental neuroscience or fundamental biology is probably the best

409
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,760
money spent because we really don't know the brain that well we think we do if you think

410
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:17,240
about how why we move so quickly in terms of tackling HIV to a sort of a chronic disease

411
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:23,680
is because of the fundamental biology of understanding how viruses replicate you know and so just

412
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:30,040
basically emphasizing that neuroscience is not necessarily just linked to side cafe but

413
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:37,240
we have to talk about neurology and then many other basically this money first of all is

414
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:43,400
not a big amount from the basic science perspective to be honest compared to the cancer is like

415
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:49,400
there would be not but but basically so this money is really not only understanding disease

416
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,000
but also understanding how the brain functions which has different implications in the computer

417
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,800
science or a society of problems or behavioral things which is nothing to do with an exact

418
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:06,600
disease necessarily but still how we interpret each other social behavior wars and peace

419
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:14,360
and a lot of implications so I think in fact I think there's no portion of the so would

420
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:20,480
be a continuous and freshly spent on directly disease related and it's not a lot of money

421
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,040
unfortunately and there's a lot of competition for this money that's I totally understand

422
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,760
that it's not enough other field but I think it's not whether you put left or right the

423
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,400
money just has to be conceptually different thinking of the governmental level for the

424
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:43,240
city level so it's just a thinking but what we have not enough money going there I totally

425
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:49,640
agree but it's not a problem the social basic science budget because it has to fight for

426
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:57,200
no reason I pretty much agree with what's been said I would add something and suggest

427
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:05,560
a possible inference one is I'm a strong advocate of basic research neuroscience is basic research

428
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:12,560
like molecular biology or genetics the yield on that is greater than any other research

429
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,440
we do but it has woefully little to do with psychiatry that's all I'm not arguing it's

430
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,920
not interesting not relevant not helpful not practical it just isn't particularly related

431
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:33,040
to psychiatry it's major relationship to psychiatry is the rhetoric of social funding

432
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:39,480
you can't get somebody who's in control of a foundation to give you a hundred million

433
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:46,320
dollars for connect dome study but you can for Alzheimer's study and therefore it requires

434
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,520
someone who knows how to write the paragraph that starts with the statistics about Alzheimer's

435
00:39:52,520 --> 00:40:09,160
and ends with something there and ends with something about connect domes the other thing

436
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:15,720
is that there is a sort of public image which makes perfect sense that we have these huge

437
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:22,480
problems we have heart disease we have cancer we have mental illness and neurologic disease

438
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:30,440
but it doesn't work that way from a biology point of view the brain is more complicated

439
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,960
than the rest of the body put together the brain diseases are more challenging in terms

440
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,200
of their understanding and treatment than all the other diseases we ever think of or

441
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:51,560
treat that they're helped me we have basic scientists and I want help about 40% of all

442
00:40:51,560 --> 00:41:00,080
the genes go to the brain how much is it expressed probably 60 60% that's a measure of something

443
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:07,000
or other but how do you express that's the question of course but just the magnitude

444
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,440
is relevant in that we're dealing with what the maker thought was half of his problem

445
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:21,000
and we know that anyone who ever went to medical school knows that you can slice all the other

446
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,320
organs and then most biomedical research when I was involved in laboratory work started

447
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,200
by slicing an organ and putting it in the wearing blender but you can't do that with

448
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:40,360
the brain doesn't work that way so the fact that the brain is more than everything else

449
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:49,440
in terms of the complexity of its problem is an important proviso so certainly we need

450
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,760
more basic research psychiatry deals with very difficult problems and I think Francis

451
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,920
is optimistic when he says 30 years that we're about 30 years behind you said that yeah

452
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:18,240
Francis and I met 30 years I think we have to recognize that there's an order of magnitude

453
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:27,000
difference in the problems we face when we talk about the future of cardiology or oncology

454
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,680
or orthopedics or ophthalmology on the one hand and the future of psychiatry on the other

455
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,440
one of the startling things we're going to face in the future of psychiatry is that most

456
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:45,080
of the people will be treating 50 years from now we don't think of as being patients now

457
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:51,020
because we haven't conceptualized how we can make a difference in their lives but the

458
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:58,800
history of the last 50 years in psychiatry is we move from Ed's to major diseases schizophrenia

459
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,520
and bipolar disease to recognize the huge pools of people out there who have personality

460
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:10,200
disorders who have addictions who have problems in living that we're never thought of as

461
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,200
medical or psychiatric but can be helped by interventions even at the food level we're

462
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:23,400
at now I don't think we're going to see that growth of patients with cancer or heart disease

463
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,760
or any other disease category but we are with mental health diseases but if I can't just

464
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,160
go back to this cancer example I remember because Memorial Camp so cancer is just next

465
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,680
door and we have a lot of collaborations so they were stuck with cancer like 20, 25 years

466
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,880
ago they have been developing new drugs which are a little bit different than the previous

467
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:52,080
one they certainly got a little increase but it's not tremendous movement and then suddenly

468
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,640
there was a part of shift with this in therapy which was mentioned and nobody knew that it's

469
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,720
coming nobody just came out from the dark and then obviously people have been working

470
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,200
on it but suddenly there was a critical mass or critical finding the mass of critical findings

471
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:14,200
which were translatable to humans in amounts one could do that well before but it had to

472
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,680
be developed a technology where you could actually use it in humans and humans would tolerate

473
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,960
this and I think in cancer research will tell you that there was a part of our shift because

474
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,360
now I thought only personally but the the the curate is incredible it's very expensive but

475
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,200
I think it's just you never know when it happens it can happen in next year and it can be

476
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,760
in 50 years so but I'm just waiting for such a part of our shift which we don't really

477
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,480
know as they didn't know that this will pan out because they are trying different things

478
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:49,600
from bone marrow transplantation to different things but this for some reason became practical

479
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:55,720
feasible in humans and actually this is but was it because of a I don't know it so well

480
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,800
but is it because there were some basic meat made in immunology that made this happen?

481
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:08,880
I'm not familiar I'm just hearing from them that this was just suddenly a change labs

482
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,600
which switch to this kind of strategy they're far better and now we have these people who

483
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:20,080
have been not not a spandex they suddenly a deeper of their throat basically they they

484
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:26,880
have no chance they just come back this is what people need in psychology that somebody

485
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,880
would be treatment treatment to just ask if a phoenix which is a really serious or an

486
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,320
orthopedic side and then suddenly you have a treatment which we just cannot be comprehended

487
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:44,960
today we should all study immunology at this point we have to return to study immunology

488
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:53,360
that are important constraints for example the reason why they made the part of the reason

489
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,960
why they made the progress immunology and so on is the ability to study cancer cells

490
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,880
out there it's not that easy to study schizophrenia cells so cancer allowed you to study things

491
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,720
in a completely different way from different angles and even now the treatment comes in

492
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,720
from different.

493
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,920
Well the lack of an animal model for schizophrenia I mean animal models for cancer have always

494
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,960
been around it's a huge barrier I mean theoretically if there was an ant that could be a breakthrough

495
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,760
some really amazing animal model for some of these illnesses came up that could be opened

496
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,960
the door for a lot.

497
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,360
I would say though that I think it might have been basic understanding of immunology because

498
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:40,000
that actually also now we have drugs for MS multiple sclerosis that we didn't have and

499
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,680
they're also in the immunotherapy realm also where they target the T cells so it turns

500
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,880
out even if even neurologists just got lucky that it turns out that these advances that

501
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,080
the drugs that they were making to basically make T cells quiescent are actually very

502
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:01,400
effective for MS which and even and they didn't so I think this will and it's still a chronic

503
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,880
disorder which was there's but they had nothing a decade ago you know the fact that they have

504
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:13,480
four to three to four new drugs in the pipeline is still quite impressive so I think we were

505
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,280
waiting for that moment also.

506
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:22,920
So in terms of research where is the research in psychiatry in terms of those major illnesses

507
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,160
I mentioned where is that research focused on?

508
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:34,920
I think the genetics I would say most of the money right now is in genetics connectome these

509
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,280
are the brain initiatives essentially in your imaging and then there's this continuum.

510
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,000
A lot of money goes to epigenetic which is my epigenetic.

511
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,600
But epigenetics I think just to mention for the audiences that basically what most people

512
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:56,840
realize that genes do not solve the problem and we know that environment cannot work through

513
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:03,360
genes so the concept came in that environment will actually produce some change in the DNA

514
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:10,000
structure or the DNA function without changing a base pair so the sequence is the same but

515
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,920
there are secondary modifications but if you view it from a function of perspective it

516
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,240
doesn't really matter whether you have a mutation and it alters a gene function or

517
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:26,440
you have a we call chromatin which is the larger assemble of DNA and surrounding proteins

518
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:32,080
you can have that same functional change as a result of.

519
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,280
So what we many people I know because it's pretty competitive know what is to write a

520
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:41,800
grant but basically the chromatin is that you propose that environment whether this is

521
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:50,240
early childhood adversity whether maybe it's a during pregnancy maybe the mother is depressed

522
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:56,560
but there is something memory built into the child or a field DNA which is again not a

523
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:01,680
change of the sequence but it's a permanent so the child will work with born with this

524
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,600
it's a regulatory problem like a mutation would be and it ended up with a little bit

525
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:13,000
different function at the gene level which is translated to a circuit level and then

526
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,120
functional level one the child is less than typical even when his connection is made so

527
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:24,200
I think that a lot of money goes into this which is fundamental is a very good concept

528
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:31,000
and very new because we don't really know this we call this areas as a and want to sensitive

529
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,880
areas maybe or we can call it marks or whatever you want to call but we don't really understand

530
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,560
those but even outside of neuroscience epigenetics is also cancer cancer it's actually cancer

531
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:47,080
is a more more developed phase again so we learn a lot from cancers but some of the cancer

532
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:51,000
findings cannot be translated because the genes which are regulated are totally different

533
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,080
and cancer you would have that how fast it's as proliferate or divide grow and in a sense

534
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:02,880
more important how maybe a synaptic function is a little tailored so it's a little bit

535
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,240
different and it's just several order of money to the more complex that's the problem

536
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:15,080
the complexity but you pointed out which means that it takes more time but just to sort of

537
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:22,000
simplify your work make less but what you've found in your own lab is that that this the

538
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,640
level of stress of the mother the grandmother or the great grandfather or whatever all have

539
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:36,520
impacts on the infant so we can trace down on the granddaughters I'm talking about animals

540
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:42,880
here but there are some human studies but the granddaughters will carry the memory of

541
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:52,920
a grandparent either you can have like stress infection or even early childhood adversity

542
00:50:52,920 --> 00:51:00,000
which is very relevant to psychiatry so so we can actually tell from the granddaughters

543
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,960
DNA that the grandmother had some impact so that would be very useful to let's say you

544
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,400
have a child and you are not sure whether the child will be more you see some sign maybe

545
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,840
I'm not clinician but I can imagine that you have a child and you are not really sure

546
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:21,640
whether the risk is very high or no but you see some signs you could go back and then

547
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:28,760
test whether that child actually had some impact through some ancestor's life and you

548
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,320
would say yes I see some impact so I would be more careful and maybe treat that particular

549
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,200
individual and you can actually sample the epigenome not by having to get a brain biopsy

550
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:45,440
but yeah we are doing from the blood actually from below we don't have to take cuter models

551
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:51,520
so we just take a little blood and we can because the blood also responds to this and

552
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,720
there is a correlation between the blood response to the brain response these are not so it's

553
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,320
my talking of memory the memory in this case you cannot say this is how precise like an

554
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:08,880
episode would be in our life or as room or remembering this environment it's really just

555
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:15,160
the adversity component it's a negative balance of this whole situation which is really somehow

556
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:22,680
alters certain genes which will be a genetic fingerprint so it's not a memory we like to

557
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:27,800
use memory because everybody understands memory but it's a lose memory so you will not just

558
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:33,520
remember you will not remember that the adversity occurred in A or B or C environment but you

559
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:39,640
know that was some really bad experience it's not post-Trump Express's order where somebody

560
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:45,320
can recall the exact location and going back to the same restaurant or a same battlefield

561
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:52,320
it will have a reaction it is more of a general anxiety that in general the anxiety level

562
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:57,520
is really high almost sometimes you don't even know why because the person doesn't have

563
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:03,760
to have an input it's already built in the DNA chromatin or epigenome which was somehow

564
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:10,120
predated maybe not even in the individual's life but in the ancestor's life so your mechanism

565
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:16,920
is is beautiful and articulate and very sophisticated but that that that basic understanding that

566
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:22,880
a person is affected by the the their ancestry psychiatrists have been saying for 150 years

567
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:33,360
that's not new right so so the thing that worries me of course is that exact thinking

568
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:39,160
is what got us to eugenics this idea that the best thing to do would be just eliminate

569
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:45,800
those genes eliminate those people eliminate those races you know and with the obvious

570
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:52,040
conclusion and what happened in Germany and so and the thing is that the scary part of

571
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,600
those kinds of interventions is they they start off well intended and in the United

572
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:02,600
States so it wasn't just you know these crazy folks in another country so again the question

573
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:08,560
is so all right so you found this then what but yeah but but just expanding so what you

574
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:15,080
would say that is known it was totally anecdotal there was no scientific evidence for that

575
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,800
and in science you never believe so at least in basic science you never take it really

576
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:26,240
true until you actually prove mechanistically so our standards are really mechanistic but

577
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,920
for the standards of the time I mean but they looked at pedigrees they gathered data they

578
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,160
interviewed families I mean for the standards of the time they do exactly the same thing

579
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:43,520
yeah but yes so that was certainly a such an association we got association and now from

580
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,760
scientific point of view you want to have the association to cause a relationship because

581
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:53,320
if this association you cannot do anything about it because if two things can be associated

582
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:58,880
and you influence one thing it doesn't feel like tonana things but my point is though

583
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,280
for the standards of the for the scientific standards of the of the time 150 years ago

584
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,960
that was true absolutely that was the true it wasn't I mean they believed that was causal

585
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,080
now you're saying this is true and so I'm I wouldn't doubt that your science is more

586
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,480
sophisticated question is 150 years from now is somebody going to look back and say well

587
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:23,640
you know your science was all very nice but so and that's the that's the kind of but

588
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:28,720
but a big difference is when you have a causative relationship then you have a chance to actually

589
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:34,160
manipulate the system if an association then basically the two things are independent

590
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,000
from each other it's a coincidental so you don't have the two you don't have the opportunity

591
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,960
or a chance to actually influence your outcome with something which is correlated with so

592
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,840
that's a difference but they thought they did I mean they thought they did but it's

593
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:54,680
it's wrong the law of things I mean science we don't know that we don't know that our

594
00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:00,280
that our crude treatments because they're crude you know would match the sensitivity

595
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:06,800
of that kind of science the treatment even in a SSRI sorry that's not really causative

596
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:15,160
we don't want causative because it's a association so causative when you have an absolute known

597
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:20,640
player molecule pathway which is linked to and then you manipulate the pathway and then

598
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:27,800
then you fix the outcome so that's what we need for develop new drugs or any conditions

599
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:36,720
where it is being shown specific epigenetic change is responsible for it so this is a

600
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:45,040
this is this is another problem so there's not one single gene or single logos but and

601
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:51,120
then we don't have a manipulation very multiple so that's very difficult to make the but I

602
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:56,920
think that that's actually one way to think about it to figure out a way to work with

603
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:06,520
multiple genes but I remember when I was school manipulating one gene was a total order nobody's

604
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:11,800
that student field starting the lab and in my month the person can change that gene or

605
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:19,800
single gene we can manipulate me three genes and if you asked these people this would be

606
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,920
just a single cell and a lot of same cell they can manipulate thousands at the same

607
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,240
time what we would need is that to manipulate hundreds of genes for thousands of genes in

608
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:36,480
a complex mammalian neuron and just don't have a technology but people have been very

609
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,800
working but in cancer aren't they using various H stack inhibitors right now yes try to affect

610
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:49,160
the gene yes but they're not because selectivity that's also not enough they don't have it yeah

611
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:54,280
select selectivity is really important that you basically target only those nothing else

612
00:57:54,280 --> 00:58:01,360
yeah and there's the the classical manipulation but we had 20 years ago develop we don't have

613
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:05,960
to have we don't have any multiple genes a lot of genes because at all marketing so but

614
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:12,600
not only the psychiatric condition of cardiovascular diabetes hypertension there's all the same

615
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:17,800
problem and they cannot really prove because they have tens of hundreds genes one person

616
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,640
has this combination other person that combination but we do know that this probably a lot of

617
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:29,200
genes each has a very small contribution but you still need they have different constellations

618
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,760
so these are all systems by which is I think system biology is another field which might

619
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:39,240
need a lot of money but again much higher level than artificial intelligence would do

620
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:45,920
nobody's which is one dimensional set fail I want to use this to segue to something that

621
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:54,400
I think is often not seen this way but the availability of our finer tools for assessing

622
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:03,560
genetic risk at the level even of an old means that we're really into a form of euthanasia

623
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:12,880
except very early so when we decide to not implant a fertilized egg that's carrying the

624
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:26,160
Huntington's gene that's just early euthanasia early eugenics biologically is the same thing

625
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:32,080
we're clearing the population of a noxis gene by selecting who will support and who will

626
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:41,400
destroy the Nazis waited a few decades afterwards before doing the same thing and we don't really

627
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:47,600
have a dialogue socially about the meaning of that in our attitude toward it we're doing

628
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:54,840
something you know way even more intriguing because the methods for doing this are available

629
00:59:54,840 --> 01:00:02,400
to some social classes and not to others so we've set up a system where if you're in a

630
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,400
certain social class you get eugenics to get rid of bad genes and if you're in a different

631
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:16,200
class you don't and we're going to distribute the bad genes class wise in the culture that's

632
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:22,760
a very interesting psychiatric I don't know if it's a psychiatric issue maybe I think much

633
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:35,560
of what our effective interventions might be in the next few decades maybe at the pre-implantation

634
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:43,800
level of eugenics we can possibly get rid of some major psychiatric disorders if we have

635
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:52,880
enough community acceptance of screening and selective implantation of fertilized of them

636
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:59,120
that don't carry those disorders the thing that is I mean apart from the larger ethical

637
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:04,760
issues of which there are many the other thing that strikes me is if we're trying to help

638
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:11,200
say schizophrenia for focusing on schizophrenia where if we're trying to convince our patients

639
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:16,400
who have schizophrenia that they have lives worth living that that that disease is not

640
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,280
going to define them that they can live full lives that they have worth as a human and

641
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:27,960
then at the same time we say that we're going to try to eliminate the genetic risk for that

642
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,000
you know what does that say you know we care about you but actually we wish you hadn't

643
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,280
been born I mean that and that you know we're not at a stage where we really have to wrestle

644
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:42,280
with that other than as a thought experiment but that's we're close to it well depending

645
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,760
on who yeah depending on who you talk to you know so just yeah totally agree and I guess

646
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,880
we are just for accidentally open NIH and that's national super health that there's a whole

647
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:58,800
branch trying to really address this question very relevant but I recall another effort

648
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:06,960
from NIH which is more of a repairing the gene or genes so there are a lot of money goes

649
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:12,560
into our field which is basically say this is a situation and it's a chart is born but

650
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:19,680
can be really reestablished in normal regulation or whatever situation and now just a couple

651
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,920
of weeks to people of you know the new technology where you can actually get in to sell again

652
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,440
it's just a cell level we don't have the brain level but some yeah now some can do it

653
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:37,040
and a single gene and you can actually repair it you can eliminate the physical or or or

654
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:44,280
molecule problem and basically you it's very similar to to repairing an enzyme defect for

655
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:49,640
example with a virus where you would have a child with an enzyme defect and it's pretty

656
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:54,400
technically speaking is relatively simple because it's just an enzyme which is everywhere

657
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:00,360
so you make make a white blood cell and this white blood cell be produced now and you exchange

658
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:05,360
the deficient cells to their new the gene therapy so that's a similar concept except

659
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:12,320
that you go to the brain cell or brain region and then you basically re-establish the normal

660
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:19,480
situation it's it's a fiction and it's just laboratory things but it's certainly in the lab it's in

661
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:24,680
a one-genent can be done and it's just five years ago that was the first of four years ago so there

662
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:30,600
are new things happening yeah and we just need a larger I'm not only new things but we need a

663
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:37,400
scale up from one it's always with one gene and then we have to have hundred genes simultaneously so

664
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:45,640
it's going a little slow obviously well some degree of the repair of genes the technology is there now

665
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:52,000
it's not only a mutation can repair you can reap this so-called epigenetic what I refer which is

666
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,360
you know which is more complex you can repair that as well but the issue is in terms of mental

667
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:03,760
illness is to first determine what genes we have talked about sugar yeah 100 dreams a small fact

668
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,600
you can't be fixing those genes it's not going to make any difference but the whole idea is science

669
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:13,000
that you have these hundreds of tracks of research and some people working with it and suddenly

670
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:20,840
everything is just converge and that's the hope so they scale up the technology that they bring

671
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:25,960
and we don't have access to the brain so we need new technology to get to the brain so when

672
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:31,880
everything converges maybe a hundred years from now then then this is this is where you say maybe

673
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:38,040
that was a birth to invest this money but otherwise we wouldn't be there and that's the hope but I

674
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:44,320
think that was a hope in care sir the thing is though that our we do need to help our patients now

675
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:50,920
and you know sure it isn't sexy but there is a lot in systems of care that we in psychiatry

676
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:55,280
used to do a lot with the whole asylum movement the whole beginning of the the profession of

677
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,160
psychiatry in the United States was based on systems of care this idea that we build the

678
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:04,960
silums to take care of people to restore them to sanity and and so we have similar problems to

679
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:10,200
what Dorothy the Dix was complaining about a hundred and seventy years ago we have people in the jails

680
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,040
people in the streets people who are suffering who don't have family looking after them and in

681
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:20,040
Michigan we are reinventing the idea that we need to take a look at state hospitals our

682
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:25,200
Republican governors over succeeding decades closed most of our state hospitals and now all

683
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,120
of a sudden we have to have a conversation about maybe reopening some reopening new new kinds of

684
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:36,720
new systems of care and working on ways of taking care of people because gene therapy isn't

685
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:43,320
available in our lifetime and it's hard to talk about that it's hard to say we need bricks and

686
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:49,640
mortar we don't just need two different things so we have to talk about yeah I mean I'm not saying

687
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:54,840
that you know the money should come from there I mean this is more a political issue actually what

688
01:05:54,840 --> 01:06:00,680
you're saying but for the patient the next 20 years neuroscience is probably not going to

689
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:11,840
touch the problem at the social it's like you know probably be with all the astrophysics is

690
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:17,640
not necessarily in our lifetime but we still pay or fund astrophysics or going to move or

691
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:26,840
probably we won't be there in the next few years but still in some respects that's how humanity

692
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:34,560
and then technology develops just to segue into something that might be a little more positive so

693
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:40,600
even though I think that neuroscience is going to take 20 years there are certain things that and

694
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:47,400
it just happens by Kirk Winston it's happening in my department but I put it in a Cornell we have

695
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:53,880
figured one of the investigators at Cornell who's a psychiatrist has figured it out a way to use

696
01:06:53,880 --> 01:07:02,640
neuroimaging to subtype depression into four categories by the connectome and he is able to

697
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:11,320
do it granted it's only one study of 1200 patients but he's able to basically get to do it with 90%

698
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:20,120
specificity and sensitivity so he has the shot of actually possibly getting the first biomarker

699
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:26,360
for a psychiatric disorder what subtypes where did the subtypes come from so what he did was he

700
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:36,920
got 600 patients with major depression and then and for so of control made match controls got

701
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:43,000
their resting state scans which I described theirs and basically through machine learning

702
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:49,480
slash artificial intelligence asked the computer to tell them is there do these people fall into

703
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:55,640
different subtypes do the brain connectomes look different from the controls and then the computer

704
01:07:55,640 --> 01:08:01,480
gave what they call a classifier sort of like yes here's a template where this this is the template

705
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:10,040
for depression number one two three four then he took another set of samples of of 300 new people

706
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:16,760
with depression or not depression or schizophrenia and this classifier could separate out people with

707
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:24,120
schizophrenia versus depression with a hundred ninety nine percent precision and so so these are

708
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:32,040
these are different subtypes and I'm just doesn't have no they're not phonological subs no these were

709
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:37,880
the computer was not taught DSM so the computer was agnostic to it it was just looking at it essentially

710
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:44,520
and each subtype has a slightly different abnormality in connectivity with the prefrontal cortex or

711
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,600
first of all he can he confirmed that the prefrontal cortex is probably very important for major

712
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,520
depression and they all have slightly different what they don't look different clinically is the

713
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,160
point right I guess that was they really don't look that different clinically miraculously

714
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:06,120
subtypes actually fall into anhedonic anxious they actually do really amazingly do and it was not

715
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:11,640
taught the computer was not taught this and so that felt that's life yeah so that essentially

716
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:17,160
they naturally which makes sense that if you're anhedonic then the hub that's involved in the reward

717
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:21,880
circuitry is probably going to be the one that's broken while the one that's that where you're sort

718
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:28,280
of more anxious is going to be probably more prefrontal cortical because of the anxiety

719
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:35,320
circuits related there so it fell out naturally and now we're going but what is so remarkable is

720
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:40,200
that so there's another form of treatment called trans-magnetics stimulation which is

721
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:47,640
which we had wild enthusiasm ten years ago but has shown to be only effective for 40%

722
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:55,080
than mild for mild to moderate depression what he found was was that only one subtype responded

723
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:01,480
optimally to TMS so now the new clinical trial he's running is to do a that was a retrospective

724
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:06,760
study that he did now he's doing a prospective study to see whether or not he can subtype them

725
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:12,840
ahead of time then give them TMS and basically see whether or not that this is actually going

726
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:18,280
to hold up but you can sort of now see how you can use this not obviously we say psychiatrists

727
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:23,880
and psychologists and social workers we can diagnose pretty well but what this can tell you is is

728
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:30,120
that what he noticed was was that after the people who responded to TMS their connect home

729
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:36,760
changed to normal so basically you now have not only a diagnostic tool but something that could

730
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:42,600
probably tell you whether or not the treatments you've had will possibly effective or not effective

731
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:49,800
in changing at least one sort of non at least some objective measure and stuff but the future

732
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:55,080
would be at least only in Cornell the media other than you would get your brain scanned

733
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:01,640
in the outpatient clinic if you come in for depression and then basically then then different

734
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:08,600
treatments would be tailored to that it sounds very but human one brain scan will tell you this

735
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,960
yes so basically because he got the computer to come up with what they call it a computational

736
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:19,400
classifier so then the classifier will then sort of sort it out and just say this you fit into

737
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:27,480
biotype one two three or four and and so then and and if you put in someone who has schizophrenia

738
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:33,160
they go you don't fit into any of these biotypes you know you do not you're not depressed so he's

739
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:38,360
now trying to develop the schizophrenic biotype and the bipolar disorder biotype but for now he

740
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:44,760
started with depression so but you but the reason why this was possible was because so many people

741
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:53,800
country and and we're doing resting state scans so he didn't have to scan 1200 people he got people's

742
01:11:53,800 --> 01:12:01,880
data from 1200 people from 1200 subjects from and then just use the computer to basically do

743
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:06,600
the analysis I think this is probably what's going to happen and that's why it's still important to

744
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,960
do all these studies because who knew that this 10 minute resting state scan was going to be so

745
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:18,840
important for this type of work I think you know and some ideas that we could be basically be able

746
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:24,840
to tailor things but it is really quite remarkable even to me it's hard to wrap my mind around the

747
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:31,720
fact that the brains has an intrinsic connectivity that can be picked up in 10 minutes it's an

748
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:41,560
fire an MRI machine essentially that's been around for 50 years essentially technology was always

749
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:47,320
there you know what he only what he did is he used just like he just put the pieces together

750
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:55,080
and he was able to do it so but replicates psychiatry is full of 50 years of starting to

751
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:01,640
DSTF tests that look like they're going to be great so two replications are now being written up

752
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:07,240
for the replication spittifier type things so people from other universities not us really that's

753
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:11,640
for depression not for any other depression that'd be pretty damn good if you have that

754
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:20,760
yeah we're very we'll see what happens but what's really nice is is that and and I the thing that

755
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:26,120
I got from it was then we've we've we've also begun or he and begun doing

756
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:35,560
anxiety disorders because that's the disorder and the people with anxiety disorders fall into

757
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:46,600
that but again as office the brain did not read DSM and truly gonna be these gonna

758
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,120
and they're not the sort of

759
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:02,520
problems are probably going to be very different for each

760
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:11,880
sorry I can assure you that I hope it replicates too but that's enough the mystic notes so we can

761
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:17,640
stop the open if you have a question you want

762
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:23,320
to

763
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,080
have

764
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:31,880
facts and look at various fields of science over the years and how many years it took for

765
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:37,880
half the things before the truth to be no more true so I'm wondering if you should

766
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:47,160
you how many years will take care for what you think is true now if you're not true yeah I'm not

767
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:51,480
gonna predict the future but I will tell you a funny story about yeah I found a book that was written

768
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:58,200
from the American College of Pharmacology

769
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:07,160
and in I think 1965 they wrote this book called

770
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:10,360
Psychopharmacology in the year 2000 where they were predicting it's gonna

771
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,280
and they were

772
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,520
drugs that people have

773
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:20,360
helping them

774
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:29,400
work happy and help them that weren't happy that because we weren't going to solve the food problems but

775
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:40,680
velocity was the answer to everything was gonna cure outcome it was gonna cure

776
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,800
and then two years after this book was

777
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,840
in the United

778
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:50,600
take long

779
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:59,080
right well what I was gonna say we're back we're back to hallucinogens now we're back to

780
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:03,400
we're not getting it have they not banned it maybe over the 30 years we'd actually have

781
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,040
to

782
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:17,080
that was a big mistake

783
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:20,280
that's going to be true and not true yeah like that

784
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:25,240
that's the way paper that you can laugh at when it's

785
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:29,800
it's

786
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,000
funny the other you know

787
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:36,760
your head of nature he was writing a paper by the RDoC project the people so RDoC project was

788
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:41,320
an attempt to toss out the DSM approach on immunology and

789
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:45,480
the tree base the idea is we're going to discover the the circuits of the brain

790
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:49,160
and then we're going to build up you know this huge

791
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:55,080
uh all these studies we're going to explore treatments went out in the limit said in 15 years

792
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:03,720
will happen it was so off and the thing to me is the full

793
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,440
it's predicting something in 15 years because those are

794
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:11,400
these are all you can't ever so you're right I mean assume a lot of what we now is going to be

795
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:20,360
thank you doctor Lee the end you mentioned a lot of

796
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:22,920
two different

797
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:30,520
in a rest brain from a typical brain look these are in huge these are in patients

798
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:43,400
patients um and it's made me wonder what what is a healthy brain

799
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:53,080
someone that doesn't meet any criteria for any DSM disorder but are there people who don't

800
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:57,240
know

801
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:05,720
you know it's sort of a circular argument but so I think what I think we don't have a really good

802
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:10,520
idea of what brain is it's just what we call a brain so a brain

803
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:16,360
besting codified as we have an idea of what the healthy mind is

804
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:21,640
that the analyst to figure that out

805
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,960
thank you for the

806
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:32,920
my question is with some question about which way the funding should go

807
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,280
what will be um the field what's the

808
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:40,280
patients and patients

809
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:45,640
what goals and what values should guide institution uh what values should

810
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:50,680
guide medicine and administration what's the future of pakari grants

811
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,200
no questions

812
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:05,720
so

813
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:10,760
so pakari grants are supposed to be so there's been a

814
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,880
whatever various new things then we'll

815
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:20,840
to the community

816
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,880
that seem to look what really

817
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,680
center but they're too complicated or something to be implemented and so

818
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:36,680
the

819
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,920
supposed to be something where you take a treatment and

820
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:47,400
grant is to actually dominate it's for example I think the types of

821
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,400
grant

822
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,240
really

823
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,960
into behavioral therapy that has been validated

824
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,320
institution can you

825
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:02,440
to the queen's the queen's clinic and have trained the people there

826
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:06,280
and then rally around

827
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,480
lots of money isn't being poured into these human

828
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,480
how

829
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,280
are

830
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,520
sorry

831
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,520
treatments

832
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:30,440
we would have to say uh that the bigger question is is that we actually

833
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:34,280
don't just to sort of segue we actually don't have the workforce

834
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:41,720
liver met to the treatment percent of 20 percent of our population

835
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:50,280
how that workforce sure I'm not actually sure I would say that

836
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,600
no I think what

837
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,080
the rationale for the

838
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,320
grants has been mainly due to other treatment

839
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:05,000
more sophisticated behavioral treatments have been able to be implemented

840
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:11,000
and but it's probably because they don't have enough providers that can

841
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,680
deliver it somewhat

842
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,000
I think

843
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:20,040
to pick up a thread that two threads of Dr. Mike

844
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,760
one of them about about prevention and the allocation

845
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,760
uh

846
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,760
about being

847
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,880
going to I'm going to echo that also

848
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:36,920
uh given how we started off with the um

849
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:41,080
progress with the genetic research

850
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,680
um

851
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:49,880
given that we spent most of the time talking about that

852
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,000
that this means

853
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,200
so what what does that mean so I will offer a an interpretation

854
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,960
considering where we are

855
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:04,600
and that and that and that there's an enormous cultural almost delusion of the

856
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:09,160
Nile of um of the source of most

857
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:13,640
technology which which Dr. Michael's mentioned which has something to do with

858
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:18,520
early development early development early attachment traumatic uh dramatic

859
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:24,360
abandonment early childhood even even we know data from moving to another country

860
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,360
the the the

861
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:35,320
and mental illness and yet there's no money um

862
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:39,800
being provided for that kind of research so I suggest we take all of the money

863
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,040
and

864
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,040
for

865
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,040
my

866
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,040
then we may

867
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,040
as far as

868
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,040
um so now

869
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,040
wasn't being brought

870
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,440
just

871
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,440
the second

872
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:02,440
the

873
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,440
neuroscience research

874
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,440
uh

875
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,640
I think you mentioned

876
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,640
expectation

877
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,640
the

878
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,040
to get back

879
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,040
that's random

880
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,040
in

881
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,040
I think

882
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,040
part of the

883
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:44,520
is getting rid of stigma I think we're getting rid of stigma okay

884
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:50,840
this is if they were broken brains we we've just added another type

885
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:54,840
of

886
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:05,640
a person

887
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,640
then he did at case conferences okay

888
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:22,040
the conferences had less details about

889
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,560
interests are

890
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,560
that is a strong

891
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,560
information

892
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:45,560
which is a war farm kind of far farm a go genetic testing and getting history

893
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,520
several comments

894
01:24:54,520 --> 01:25:05,320
um our call for uh I'll start with the last one I think the psychological psychodynamic

895
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:12,760
broadly in favor of talking to patients listening to them and getting to know them

896
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:19,480
in fine texture and detail which you feel a member of I suspect from what you said I think

897
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:26,040
that community has failed to demonstrate value added from the information it collects

898
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:32,840
for the majority of psychiatric patients so although we may not like it the fact is that

899
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:38,760
if you want to be cost effective the first thing you do is make a dss

900
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:45,800
then use the standard treatment for that diagnosis and wait eight weeks a third of your

901
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:50,680
patients will be better and there's no point in finding out how they felt about their mother

902
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:58,200
it's irrelevant to the outcome of the intervention if your focus is on the outcome of the intervention

903
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:07,960
you'd focus your subtle nuanced history taking and relationship development on the group of

904
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:14,280
patients who need it and might profit from it but the community doesn't like doing that

905
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:22,440
and it has an almost ethical quality it's un it's not humanistic no orthopedic surgeon

906
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:30,040
worries about being humanistic before setting a colleagues fracture but psychiatrists do sometimes

907
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:36,680
or conversely they don't because they're tired of those that do and they're arguing with them

908
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:46,680
so your dss diagnosis begin to in many psychiatrists hands substitute the person is sitting next to

909
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:54,920
you on the bus it's an unsolved problem it's a major problem in psychiatric education so that

910
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:01,480
if you travel around the country and you make rounds and things like that you find a fair

911
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:07,800
number of young psychiatrists are very happy if they can document a dssm5 diagnostic

912
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:13,320
uh conclusion even if they're not the biggest idea who it is they're talking about

913
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:21,240
on the other hand the the research problem not resolved is when does it make a difference

914
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:25,720
and very importantly when does it not make a difference

915
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:30,360
even more provocative i think the lack of engagement

916
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:37,720
in the future of the proper diagnosis sometimes people being in analysis i don't know about

917
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:44,040
even doing it properly sometimes well what i would agree with it i think too often i think

918
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:50,920
you can't do uh not i you know i i created a structured interview for research and i see people

919
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:56,200
do horrible jobs because they don't ask the right you know get below the surface i mean it's not a

920
01:27:56,200 --> 01:28:00,760
checklist and nobody who's ever worked on the dssm has ever claimed otherwise however because

921
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:07,720
it looks so simple people there's a human nature here to do the simple quick thing and the dssm you

922
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:12,040
could argue is one of the worst things that happened because it's a left psychiatrist to do what our

923
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:15,160
colleagues and the rest of medicines it was just trying to do the quicker thing like getting a

924
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:20,040
bunch of blood tests and not talking to the patient so it's facilitated that it's had a plus i think

925
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:24,920
it's treatment and people have responded better but there's a huge cost and i agree about the

926
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:31,960
psychiatric education it's up to psychiatric education to to go against that tendency for people to

927
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:35,480
want a cookbook approach and tell them over and over again that is you're not going to get good

928
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:40,040
results now unfortunately it'd be nice if there were studies that could actually show for sure

929
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:48,840
check actually in uh alpham it's hard for me to believe that you're right it'd be

930
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:52,200
somebody could do some kind of god people who

931
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,520
got my gift with the out the

932
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:01,720
what why do you don't

933
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:09,080
who's going to fund that you're right i'd be great things to do

934
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,880
there's also an idiotic in the profession

935
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:19,480
you're patient in depth that it's almost

936
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:27,560
a virtue rather than efficiency or efficacy right and that's a weak argument in a competitive world

937
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:33,800
no you're right you see how we've gotten where we are and i'd be great if we can undo that with

938
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:41,880
data if you had thought like the head of some federal finance health finance

939
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:47,960
and said well we need to do this then they would ask well just show me why we should invest

940
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:53,080
billions in this direction rather than in this direction maybe that study a series of

941
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:58,120
well we may be going backwards and having to do that retrospectively with the current generation

942
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:04,360
of kids we're raising now so we're raising an entire generation of consumers of mental health

943
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:09,080
care who think that all they have to do is sit there and somebody will do it they will do a checklist

944
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:12,920
they'll get a diagnosis they'll get a pill then

945
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,600
they roll in that it's something that they again are it's our failure to treat rather than their

946
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:26,840
failure to engage so i just had a patient in the hospital a 19 year old student and we get a lot

947
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:32,040
of university students that umm on the inpatient unit and she she had depression i don't know what

948
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:37,960
that means for this teenager but she'd been on every drug i could name she'd gotten ECT

949
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:43,320
she had never engaged with therapy because as far as she was concerned that was effort that she

950
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:48,680
didn't want to put into and and we were done she was still depressed she was not bothering to go to

951
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:54,200
serve and you know she needed to actually put some work in and she didn't want to hear that she

952
01:30:54,200 --> 01:31:00,280
wanted the magic the magic pill or you know raising its generation of consumers of mental health care

953
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:07,160
to not take a role in their own recovery and i i worry about that

954
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:17,000
i'm pleased that we've positioned the position and we still have

955
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:26,600
to submit from the beginning the sociologic

956
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:38,600
the

957
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:44,360
my question

958
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:49,640
I that statement have any of you um been studying

959
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:59,720
abilities now there's anxiety anxiety may be identified as

960
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:06,680
a good state if it's no guided correctly

961
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:13,000
the person is facing something in society that is not right

962
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:18,680
yeah

963
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:26,200
again he is a symptom not necessarily it's a state it's not bad i mean we all know

964
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:30,040
you know if you have a test to and you don't have enough anxiety to study for you you're

965
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:45,000
gonna fail it's anxiety or adaptive parts of being human being you can't live with that exactly

966
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:50,760
perhaps even

967
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:58,040
and

968
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:06,440
deal with illness in that context but

969
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:16,840
when you have these symptoms coupled with some disability that's causing

970
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:25,080
it somehow impacts ability to function what you need

971
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:31,480
ships work you know that these symptoms are being severe enough

972
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:37,320
always been

973
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,000
in normal

974
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:52,920
grieving for one year after the loss of loved one every day in pre-op

975
01:33:52,920 --> 01:34:03,960
they agree right with that person say it so there's always a point where you figure out when these

976
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:12,120
symptoms are when you know that's when they become educated

977
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:18,440
it's

978
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:23,000
by case basis it can be very do but it's a bullet theory

979
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:24,680
let's let's

980
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,920
my name is

981
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:40,760
I am interested

982
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:47,240
I have a suggestion to me and I would like to have an answer to it

983
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:55,320
David

984
01:34:55,320 --> 01:35:02,600
the man who can

985
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:09,320
obsessive compulsory disorder my question

986
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:24,120
a statement here is that in the review of the book that I have Adam argues

987
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:40,040
he is in favor of a more complex

988
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:50,120
I suggest from my category I'll approach

989
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:55,160
time mental illness which the category

990
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:03,080
approach driven by the DSM thank you I'm gonna

991
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:09,240
I was the driver when the preparation the

992
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,440
approach the whole one of the

993
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,720
I don't know what was just to move it

994
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:25,400
anyone in the knows that the categorical approach is a fiction there's no hard boundary between

995
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,200
any you know mild depression

996
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:33,880
life

997
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:45,240
not so medicine the rest of medicine is categorical and dementia people's

998
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:53,880
a you have category so this tension between measuring and recognizing that there has to be

999
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:59,800
a point where you go from a measurement to a category

1000
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:03,960
the DSM it's been people reified I think these boundaries in the book

1001
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:07,960
handed down from something not the high

1002
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:16,200
and and somehow they have some meaning to really shouldn't have so I've always here as a

1003
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:17,560
lifelong

1004
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:26,840
you know it's a thing with it so we're struggling with what happens to the

1005
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,440
cat and how they become real

1006
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:35,400
clinicians to practice because you wouldn't know

1007
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:41,720
time to give medicine right now if you have five out of nine symptoms of depression

1008
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:46,360
and you all the clinical trials would use that definition you could say well if my

1009
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:51,400
patient version of depression the one that was in the trial I don't know their

1010
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:55,160
probability of responding to this treatment is because that's what the study

1011
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,320
should be in the

1012
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:04,760
not enough for an illness

1013
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:10,280
boundaries are yes that you have to that's why it says at the front of the book

1014
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:13,320
but

1015
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,440
go into training and see patients to be able to get the feel

1016
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:17,960
what they are

1017
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:18,120
but

1018
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:35,800
is they opened the door up to continuous revisions they realized that it was

1019
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:41,080
or to see years we're going to redo the whole book now they said that you know

1020
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:44,360
one of the reasons they did that it's very difficult to roll it in the electronic world

1021
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:45,160
the belief is you

1022
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:53,560
but now there's actually a committee set up and anyone outside can make proposals now if you

1023
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,720
make a proposal you have to have the data to back it up but

1024
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:00,520
the other thing with

1025
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:07,800
the system it's great in theory and you know very critical of

1026
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,160
the

1027
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,120
have had issues

1028
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:12,120
and this

1029
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:18,520
does something have it or not criteria but the dimensions are incredibly

1030
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:27,240
sort of a lot of

1031
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:31,320
want to put a

1032
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:36,680
controlled on

1033
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:38,920
here you don't but

1034
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,960
systems that were created by a second

1035
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:45,400
so we have their own professional state in all

1036
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:49,240
so complicated that I can imagine anybody actually

1037
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:54,920
use these factor analyses with you know 20 different domains and if you're high in this

1038
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:57,240
it's like it's only on

1039
01:39:58,760 --> 01:39:59,720
yeah yeah

1040
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:05,640
it's incredibly complex so it it's any more

1041
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:08,360
real it's not

1042
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:14,360
it's one set of problems

1043
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:19,480
thank you

1044
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:32,680
issue which

1045
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:37,960
is

1046
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:39,800
some serves in general

1047
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:41,320
dimensional approaches

1048
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:43,320
observe information

1049
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:46,680
categorical approaches discard

1050
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:47,800
information when you reduce multiple

1051
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:52,120
dimensions and

1052
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:52,120
up

1053
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:58,200
willing to spend a lot of time

1054
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:00,200
clinician

1055
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:06,040
they have

1056
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:05,960
so then you might guess

1057
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:12,920
20 diagnoses and certainly not much

1058
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,120
and there's an argument DSM is a

1059
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:24,360
free purpose

1060
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:29,640
it says the first sentence of the introduction

1061
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:32,840
but the authors of DSM are largely not

1062
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:40,280
they're largely invested in primary loyl

1063
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:46,520
well

1064
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,520
well

1065
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:51,560
of the disorders lots of data but the

1066
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:55,640
dimensions are most complex so

1067
01:41:57,240 --> 01:42:00,760
the committee that was supposed to solve the problem came up with the

1068
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:04,360
dimensional system then the parent can

1069
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:09,960
worried about it and extra committees were brought in to review it

1070
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:14,360
and decide about it and we ended up with both of you lose it

1071
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:20,520
if somebody was in treatment that was correlated with the dimensions

1072
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:23,720
dimensions would suddenly become very very popular

1073
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:26,520
yeah i agree with that

1074
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:27,640
thank you

1075
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:34,040
thank you very much for participating in this

1076
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:36,760
it's been very good to hear everybody's

1077
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:41,480
I just when you guys were referring to the

1078
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,920
issue that as

1079
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,600
the separation that occurred at the turn of the century

1080
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:54,840
with Freud versus Josper you know

1081
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,720
don't really

1082
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:59,720
I

1083
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:04,520
in the proper way I think that there was a group of people

1084
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:10,200
that were mainly in psychiatrists dealing with the population

1085
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:13,800
which was you know history

1086
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:18,680
in the individual whereas Josper's and the German

1087
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:24,440
philosophical psychiatrist were looking at people who were much

1088
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:27,560
more profoundly dysfunctional they were

1089
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,560
in

1090
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:35,640
and

1091
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:37,800
of

1092
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:42,040
Josper's and his treaties had

1093
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:44,200
the

1094
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,200
meat

1095
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:53,560
and the biological psychiatrist have seen some kind of biological basis

1096
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:53,800
for

1097
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:57,800
whereas

1098
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:01,800
the outpatient psychiatrist predominantly were

1099
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,800
what is that that

1100
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:09,800
or that

1101
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:13,800
but continued for a century

1102
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:17,800
and in complete

1103
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:21,800
it's pretty clear that the first

1104
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:25,800
predominant

1105
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:29,800
based psychiatrist

1106
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:31,800
was introduced

1107
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,800
then

1108
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:37,800
it was

1109
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:45,800
a

1110
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:51,800
a

1111
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:57,800
biological markers were

1112
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:03,800
a

1113
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:07,800
a silent

1114
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:11,800
a patient

1115
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:19,800
biggest

1116
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:21,800
as if they are

1117
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:25,800
you know

1118
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:29,800
discipline these are

1119
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:33,800
a

1120
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,800
event and that's

1121
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:39,800
one of the leading misunderstandings

1122
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:43,800
because what's happened is that

1123
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:47,800
you know 100 genes

1124
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:51,800
about the brain is a

1125
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:59,800
psychiatry from a lot of the

1126
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:03,800
disciplines that deal with the brain

1127
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:07,800
which is much more linear

1128
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:11,800
and I mean of course they've expanded

1129
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:15,800
because at one point they were

1130
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:19,800
pointing out because they could find a lesion

1131
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:23,800
and they thought they were all going to be

1132
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:27,800
part of

1133
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:31,800
which was initially known for community

1134
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:35,800
and that

1135
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:39,800
that represents

1136
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:43,800
a hierarchical level

1137
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:47,800
that has its own code so

1138
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:51,800
answers

1139
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:55,800
that becomes misleading it's too linear for the majority of

1140
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:59,800
psychics

1141
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:03,800
that are based on genetics usually it's in the

1142
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:07,800
why there hasn't been more

1143
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:11,800
literature that has been able to prove is because

1144
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:15,800
of course linear mechanisms are much much

1145
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:19,800
easier to so now we start

1146
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:23,800
to understand that those people

1147
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:27,800
may not know the world is

1148
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:31,800
what is making them feel

1149
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:35,800
when they take those

1150
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:39,800
can you come to a closure because they have people waiting we have to stop

1151
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:43,800
but

1152
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:47,800
about online

1153
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:53,800
that's why you

1154
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,800
that's why you can't prove water

1155
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:01,800
those are the most important things

1156
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:05,800
that make life worth living

1157
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:09,800
those are the things that are of the mind and even

1158
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:13,800
the information

1159
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:17,800
when he said you know it was the father of information

1160
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:21,800
it's not really about information that he proved it was just

1161
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:25,800
a statistic

1162
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:29,800
of data

1163
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:33,800
I think you made your point

1164
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:37,800
Hi

1165
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:41,800
as a data person myself I wanted to offer up

1166
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:45,800
the results from a literature review out of the University of Colorado Denver

1167
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:49,800
School of Medicine they looked

1168
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:53,800
at analysis of all the published studies up until 2012

1169
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:57,800
on antidepressant use versus the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy

1170
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:01,800
and what they found was that the effect size

1171
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:05,800
and there were 74 studies on the use of antidepressants alone was

1172
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:09,800
0.3 which means about three standard deviations between the control group and the

1173
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:13,800
intervention group that received antidepressants and when they

1174
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:17,800
looked at studies where they had control groups versus patients that

1175
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:21,800
had received psychodynamics that could be the average effect

1176
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:25,800
understanding

1177
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:29,800
it seems that there's something about establishing a

1178
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:33,800
science or a relationship with the system on expressing feelings

1179
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:49,800
things are established in the treatment patients

1180
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:25,800
Cancer, or myocardial infarction, or tuberculosis, or dentistry, or dentistry, right?

1181
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:29,800
We've been horrified. That's important.

1182
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:35,800
There are different treatments. There are several types of psychotherapy

1183
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:41,800
cognitive behavior therapies very popular. Dynamic therapy is the beloved of

1184
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:45,800
dynamically oriented psychiatrists, pharmacotherapy.

1185
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:49,800
All the treatments seem to have

1186
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:55,800
a order of magnitude similar effect to mild to moderate depression.

1187
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:59,800
One reading is that with severe depression, the pharmacotherapy

1188
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:03,800
shows an advantage but even more striking, you don't even mention it,

1189
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:07,800
the most effective treatment for severe depression is electroconvulsive

1190
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:11,800
therapy. There's a huge amount of data on that. It's not even in your

1191
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:15,800
survey. But again, more important

1192
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:25,800
I think the average

1193
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:29,800
range of depression is your well-depressed

1194
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:35,800
cover or your main need treatment and then you get better and then you're well again.

1195
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,800
That's not the natural history of depression. The majority of depressed

1196
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:43,800
patients have a long term usually lifelong predisposition

1197
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:47,800
or vulnerability to depression and they have more than one

1198
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:51,800
episode and therefore an important goal of the treatment is to modify

1199
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:55,800
that vulnerability and the likelihood of subsequent episodes.

1200
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:59,800
We've been dramatically affected in that with bipolar disease

1201
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:03,800
but that's a small amount of total depression. It's not

1202
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:07,800
quite clear how effective we are

1203
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:11,800
long term.

1204
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:15,800
That if you continue the treatment indefinitely, it continues to work

1205
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:19,800
but no patient continues treatment indefinitely.

1206
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:23,800
Pathologic transfer to their therapist

1207
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:27,800
so we have a problem you want me to end.

1208
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:31,800
We have a problem.

1209
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:51,800
A blind though is...

1210
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:55,800
that the drugs are effective. Take the drugs first. In fact

1211
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:59,800
the best drugs we have help about one third

1212
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:03,800
of the patients who take them. That's not widely recognized.

1213
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:07,800
Partly because the pharmaceutical industry doesn't

1214
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:11,800
advertise it that way. They'll tell you two-thirds of the

1215
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:15,800
patients who take the drugs get better which is true but

1216
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:17,800
with a placebo, one-third of the

1217
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:21,800
logic of efficacy, our best pharmacological treatments

1218
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:25,800
affects one-third of the people who take the treatment.

1219
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:29,800
The same might be true over psychotherapy in terms of

1220
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:33,800
treating depression. If you look on your face you don't like that idea.

1221
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:37,800
I'm trying to know the multiple studies on the use of psychothermology

1222
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:41,800
versus psychotherapy for some to come blind.

1223
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:45,800
As my understanding, I have not seen any literature with psychothermology

1224
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:49,800
but more on the better outcomes that I've done.

1225
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:53,800
I'm looking for R&D, the education program.

1226
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:57,800
I'll be quick. I'm interested to know what the panelists think about the future.

1227
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:01,800
Oh, for psychiatric treatment by hallucinogenics, specifically

1228
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:05,800
psilocybin and chemin.

1229
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:09,800
Interested to know what the state of the situation is now

1230
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:13,800
and what the prognosis is.

1231
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:17,800
I'm interested to know what the state of

1232
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:21,800
the situation is now and what the

1233
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:25,800
prognosis is for future research and

1234
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:29,800
application. It's still pretty early.

1235
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:33,800
I think that studies are not. So certainly the ketamine story,

1236
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:37,800
ketamine is legal to give and easier to study.

1237
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:41,800
As with most things, it's got a little height in the beginning but as more studies are being done

1238
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:45,800
it's clearly solid evidence that people respond to ketamine

1239
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:49,800
and people who are treating resistant to depression and don't respond to anything else

1240
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:53,800
sometimes respond to ketamine. The problem with ketamine of course is it requires continuous

1241
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:57,800
treatment. And we don't know how often we can do this.

1242
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:01,800
There's a signal there that has been now established.

1243
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:05,800
It takes it will be better for one week but that's about as far as we know.

1244
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:09,800
As far as the rest of the psychedelics go, again there's a signal there as well.

1245
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:13,800
This is a sad thing because of what happened in the 60s and the overreaction to

1246
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:17,800
the misuse of psychedelics. These things have been out of the hands of

1247
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:21,800
the patients for 40-50 years. Now luckily it's coming back in and the

1248
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:25,800
studies are now coming in more and more. The clinical trials for all kinds of

1249
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:29,800
you know, originally cancer patients who were terminal because

1250
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:33,800
only people who could be given the meds, they were allowed and they got very good results

1251
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:37,800
and it's now they're trying for more and more application than the

1252
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:41,800
future of psychedelic treatment is

1253
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:45,800
very promising. But the problem is we don't want to start telling people they should go

1254
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:49,800
and buy mushrooms on the street and start taking it because there's so much that's

1255
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:53,800
unknown dosing and these things have bad effects even the studies

1256
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:59,800
that you still aside in there are certain things that are complicated.

1257
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:05,800
What is the placebo?

1258
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:11,800
That's a problem because you're right. People know I think I have

1259
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:15,800
something that has effects.

1260
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:27,800
I think we'll stop after this.

1261
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:31,800
There were two areas that were brought up. One was between medicine and psychiatry

1262
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:35,800
you know somatic medicine doctors and psychiatrists

1263
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:39,800
and the other congress was this between

1264
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:43,800
medicine and psychiatry.

1265
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:47,800
The other book was from my generation the way that patients is better

1266
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:51,800
than the other patients.

1267
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:55,800
But it seems to me that there's kind of been an irony in the course of my

1268
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:59,800
career as a psychiatrist where I watched medicine people

1269
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:03,800
very interested in narrative. So now with Columbia you can get a master's degree in

1270
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:09,800
medicine and the medical school courses.

1271
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:13,800
That's psychiatry.

1272
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:19,800
We have to be abdicated with great skills in the sense and it's funny to me

1273
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:23,800
that we're not the ones teaching narrative medicine to the generation of

1274
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:27,800
medical students.

1275
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:31,800
Almost universal myth

1276
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:35,800
that's untrue and is interesting.

1277
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:39,800
Of course it was not a psychiatrist. Freud was a neurologist

1278
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:43,800
who treated patients who ended up with

1279
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:47,800
the rest of the story. But the psychiatry

1280
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:51,800
grows out of general medicine. Neurology

1281
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:55,800
wasn't a specialty. Freud was seeing his patient

1282
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:59,800
outpatient with physical symptoms.

1283
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:03,800
The history

1284
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:07,800
of the sciences into its moving away

1285
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:11,800
from medicine and away from psychiatry.

1286
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:15,800
But in fact, my view on the

1287
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:19,800
political interview skills and patient recognition are most

1288
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:23,800
with not

1289
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:31,800
with collided patients.

1290
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:37,800
Who are supposed to learn the

1291
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:42,800
or used to be supposed to learn these things. Although the inpatient seriously

1292
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:47,800
mentally on population.

1293
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:51,800
Skittling or disease.

1294
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:55,800
Are probably the least

1295
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:59,800
people

1296
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:03,800
and people. They're much more important.

1297
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:09,800
Physically ill

1298
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:11,800
or

1299
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:15,800
not mentally ill

1300
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:19,800
but they

1301
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:26,800
are

1302
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:31,800
all stuff on an inpatient.

1303
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:51,800
Deafs, you know.

1304
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:55,800
Hospital.

1305
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:59,800
He's not taking his meds anymore

1306
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:03,800
after him.

1307
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:07,800
So there's a

1308
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:11,800
story. And it's funny at University of Michigan

1309
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:15,800
reinvented a medical humanities program.

1310
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:17,800
Because we say, yeah,

1311
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:19,800
our stuff, we need to

1312
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:31,800
do the same thing.

1313
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:39,800
I'm gonna

1314
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:43,800
and I'm gonna afford your medical student applying for psychiatry.

1315
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:47,800
So very interesting to talk. And I really thank you all for being here today.

1316
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:51,800
And when I visited the future and understanding all the neuroscience we're talking about

1317
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:55,800
immunology and more target therapies, nanobots, hallucinogens,

1318
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:59,800
all the neuro stimulation. Before I'm hearing from

1319
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:05,800
this is the future of psychiatry. It sounds more like reallocating resources, delivering care.

1320
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:10,800
Is my future of psychiatrists, are we going to see more of the acceleration of kind of the fancy new therapies,

1321
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:14,800
modalities? Or should we really be advocating for spending money where it's going to be

1322
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:18,800
both impactful things like housing or the early challenge

1323
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:22,800
of vengeance?

1324
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:26,800
I'll take a shot at this. So in five years after you finish your residency,

1325
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:30,800
you will only see the most ill patients.

1326
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:34,800
And then at some point, so that most of the other mild

1327
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:38,800
to moderate will hopefully be taken care of by primary care or some other.

1328
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:42,800
You will at some point realize that the treatment that your

1329
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:46,800
armamentarium you have is limited. Then you will go, I heard this talk about

1330
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:50,800
psilocybin. I got to do something for my patients.

1331
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:54,800
This is why I think there's such a great interest because we have a limited

1332
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:58,800
repertoire of what we can offer are very very ill patients.

1333
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,800
And we have a

1334
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:14,800
lot of work to do.
