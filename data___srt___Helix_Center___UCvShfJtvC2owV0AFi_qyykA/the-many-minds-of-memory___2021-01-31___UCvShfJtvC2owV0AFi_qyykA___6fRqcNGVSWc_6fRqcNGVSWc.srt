1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Good day, everyone.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,160
Welcome back to the Hillock Center.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,360
I'm Gerald Hurowitz.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,880
I'm the Associate Director of the Hillocks.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,080
And we're here with a wonderful panel today

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,960
on the many minds of memory.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,320
We're gonna allow Beverly Zabriski

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,760
to give you more detail about our wonderful panel.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,460
Before that, I wanna mention a few,

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,560
make a few comments.

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,440
First of all, I hope everyone is holding on

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,920
and doing well through this pandemic.

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,880
It's been a very long haul.

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,200
Everyone's had to adapt to it,

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,760
including us here at the Hillock Center,

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,560
including these Zoom roundtables.

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,040
But we do what we can, right?

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,120
And we're getting through this.

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,840
I wanna mention that we have a few additional roundtables

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,800
coming up.

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,280
We're anticipating on February 20th,

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,000
we're gonna have a talk on populism.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920
And then sometime in March,

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,160
the date to be determined,

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,240
a talk on placebo, no, SIBO response.

26
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,960
There may be yet a additional one on stress

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,840
later into the spring.

28
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,680
So that's it for now.

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,480
I'll hand it over to Beverly Zabriski.

30
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,280
Welcome.

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,280
I was just saying that this is our second Zoom helix program.

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,040
We're not sitting in a circle with each other.

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,240
We're not bouncing off each other's chemistry

34
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,120
in the same way at all.

35
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,120
But we have a particularly wonderful, lively, creative

36
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,040
and deep group of presenters today

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,480
for whom I'm very grateful that they were able to change

38
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,200
the date from last March 14th,

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,080
which was the cusp of COVID to today.

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,320
So I wanna express my appreciation to all of you.

41
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,320
We have physicians, neurologists, an artist,

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,880
dog cognition researcher, author.

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,200
And if you, after the program,

44
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,240
look at their biographies,

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,040
you will see an extraordinarily varied

46
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,040
and deep list of accomplishments

47
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,680
so that we don't take up the whole program

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,000
talking about them rather than hearing from them.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,400
I've asked each of them to go around and tell us,

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,760
just say what your profession is

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,480
and maybe your title and what you most want

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,360
to be remembered for professionally.

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,960
And then for all the credentials,

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,880
we can each research that on our own.

55
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,320
So can we start with Christina Alberini?

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,720
Sure.

57
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,520
Hi everyone.

58
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,760
First of all, I'd like to thank

59
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,520
everyone at the Helix Center for organizing these E meetings.

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,960
They are very important so that we can keep being connected.

61
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,240
And second, let me tell you what I'm doing.

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,160
I am a professor of neuroscience

63
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,560
at the Center for Neuroscience, New York University.

64
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,280
And I have been studying for now about 30 years,

65
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,720
the biological basis of learning a memory.

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,600
And of course, if we want to get into biology,

67
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,720
we have to use models.

68
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,360
We are not using humans because we need to get into the brains

69
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,160
of models and understand what type of biological mechanisms

70
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,880
change with learning and which one are important

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,760
for making memories.

72
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,360
And of course, memories come in different types.

73
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,280
Well, I'm sure we'll discuss about that.

74
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
So the questions we have in the lab

75
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,800
is mostly about memory formation and storage

76
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,440
and also about how memories are retrieved.

77
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,080
So when we recall memories, what happens to the biology

78
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,880
of the brain and what are the biological mechanisms that

79
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,680
come into play to change those memories?

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,920
Because at every single recall, we

81
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,520
change our memories and the storage of information.

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,600
And what do I want to be remembered for my professional

83
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,320
contribution while I hope there is many more things to come?

84
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,920
So I'm looking into the future.

85
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,160
But ideally, of course, it's not only

86
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,040
to progress significantly in the understanding

87
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,040
of the biology of memory, which is what we do,

88
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,080
but also to find mechanisms through these studies

89
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,160
that are important for memory losses and diseases

90
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,760
of memories.

91
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,600
And those are many.

92
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,320
I can just mention a few.

93
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,160
Of course, Alzheimer's disease and neurodegenerative diseases

94
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,920
that come with memory loss, but also cognitive impairments

95
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,800
in neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as problems

96
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,280
of memories due to traumatic experiences or addiction.

97
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm going to stop there.

98
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,280
Thank you.

99
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
You're on mute, Beverly.

100
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,160
We can't hear you.

101
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Richard, author, distinguished author.

102
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Well, hello, everybody.

103
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,160
And thanks to the Helix organization, I'm not

104
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,160
a dog recognition expert.

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,160
Although the first half of my career, maybe I was in that I

106
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,160
was a publisher and editor and recognizing the dogs and the

107
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,160
successes that I've done.

108
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,160
More recently, although I did not know

109
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,160
that I had continued editing, when I came to the states,

110
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,160
my first freelance job was to edit the autobiography

111
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
by Rudy Giuliani.

112
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,160
But I normally like to keep quiet about that.

113
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,160
I've written four publish books since coming to the states.

114
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,160
I've also contributed to a book more recently,

115
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,160
The Presence of the Past Essays on Memory for the Academic

116
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,160
Press.

117
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,160
In terms of what I'd be most pleased to be remembered for,

118
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,160
I suppose it's a book that I've got coming out in June,

119
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,160
which is called The History Makers, which looks at people who

120
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,160
have influenced our ideas, shaped our ideas of the past,

121
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,160
from Herodotus to the TV age.

122
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,160
So I'm very much here with the hat of a historian.

123
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,160
But with a particular interest in how memory works,

124
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,160
which of course has had a large part to play in the writing

125
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
and history.

126
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Thank you very much, Richard.

127
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,160
And then the neurologist, Guy Atre Gevvy, who is also the author

128
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,160
of Spectrums of Hope, about the aging brain, Guy Atre.

129
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Thanks for having me, Beverly.

130
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
I'm a neurologist.

131
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
I'm Director of Park Avenue Neurology,

132
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,160
and I'm a clinical professor of neurology at Downstate

133
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
Medical Center in Brooklyn.

134
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,160
I've been a cognitive neurologist for 26 years now.

135
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,160
I can't believe it's been that long.

136
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,160
And love my job.

137
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,160
And what I'd like to be remembered for is two things.

138
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,160
One, that Alzheimer's disease is a spectrum disorder,

139
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,160
and it is informed very much by the brain that the person

140
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,160
brings to the illness, your strengths and weaknesses

141
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,160
inform how you develop it, how you manifest it,

142
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
and how you respond to treatment.

143
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,160
So it's very different, for example, from kidney disease,

144
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,160
where you can, the same kidney condition means the same thing

145
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,160
in multiple people, whereas Alzheimer's in one person is a

146
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,160
private Alzheimer's and very different from Alzheimer's

147
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
in another person.

148
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,160
And the same thing with mild cognitive impairment

149
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,160
or memory problems that they vary and are very, very private

150
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
to each person's brain.

151
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,160
And the second thing I'd like to be remembered for is

152
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,160
the systematizing of menopause-related cognitive loss.

153
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Women going through menopause have cognitive loss,

154
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,160
which can mimic that of early Alzheimer's,

155
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,160
and when it's not recognized and treated as such,

156
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,160
and unfortunately, in neurology, we don't actually get a menopausal

157
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:40,160
or a history of anything related to the uterus from women as a role.

158
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,160
That systematization, I'm very proud of.

159
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,160
We just published that in the Journal of the American College

160
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

161
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,160
So thank you very much for having me.

162
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,160
And thank you for being here.

163
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,160
And Andy Lee, who is a neuroscientist at the University of

164
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Toronto, has been working on memory disorders for many years.

165
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
Andy?

166
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,160
Everyone, thank you for the organizers for inviting me.

167
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,160
It's a real privilege to be here and to be part of this panel.

168
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,160
So as Beverly just said, I am based in Toronto at the University

169
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,160
of Toronto at the Scarborough campus, and I'm a cognitive

170
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,160
neuroscientist, so my lab is interested in how a group of

171
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,160
structures in the brain, probably the most familiar one to a lot

172
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,160
of people who is at the campus, how that's involved in memory

173
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,160
processing, so we do a lot of brain imaging, MRI scanning.

174
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,160
We look at patients with amnesia, and our particular

175
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,160
interests are how memory interacts with other things.

176
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,160
So perception being one, decision making, and if there's one

177
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,160
thing maybe I would like to be remembered by, I think,

178
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,160
I think that was Beverly, I asked her certainly not thinking,

179
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
what do I want to remember by?

180
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,160
I wasn't quite sure, but I think maybe I'm not ambitious enough,

181
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,160
but even 10, 20 years, at least one thing that we've discovered

182
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,160
has actually contributed to our understanding of how the brain

183
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,160
actually processes like time in memory or visual eye,

184
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,160
it depends on memory, and gives us a little bit of understanding

185
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
into why patients like Alzheimer's disease patients have

186
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,160
memory problems, I'd be happy.

187
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,160
So that's my answer to that question.

188
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,160
That is quite ambitious, Andy.

189
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,160
And we have an author and a researcher and professor at

190
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Barnard College at the Dog Cognition Lab, and I think

191
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,160
her last book has really marked this particular era as far as I

192
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,160
see from the people that I'm in contact with, which is our

193
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,160
dogs ourselves, a story of a singular bond.

194
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Alexandra, thank you for being here.

195
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Thanks, Beverly, and thank you to the Helix Center.

196
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,160
I'm pleased to be with you all here.

197
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,160
As Beverly said, I'm a teacher at Barnard College, and I'm a

198
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Senior Research Fellow there, and I had the Dog Cognition Lab.

199
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,160
So I'm a cognitive scientist studying non-human animal mind

200
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,160
and the dog is my non-human of interest, and I've written

201
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,160
widely on Dog Mind and the Dog Human Bond.

202
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:31,160
I think I'd like to be remembered for bringing our attention back

203
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,160
to imagining that Oomveldt, the world view, the perspective of

204
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,160
non-human others, I think.

205
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,160
And I don't know if I have fully imagined the world view of

206
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,160
non-human people, or the world view of non-human people,

207
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,160
or the world view of non-human people.

208
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,160
I think I'm a non-humanist, but maybe by the end of my life,

209
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,160
that can be an accomplishment I look back on.

210
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,160
For now, it's just bringing people's attention to the

211
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,160
perspectives of others and remembering that there is a

212
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,160
perspective that is different from the human perspective.

213
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Thank you so much, Alexandra, and it reminds me that at the

214
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,160
end of the day, I was a little bit nervous about the

215
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,160
person who had a dream, a patient who went there and had a dream

216
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,160
of a dog.

217
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,160
It was considered a very positive prognosis.

218
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,160
So I sort of work out of that template myself these days.

219
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:36,160
And then we have a lady that I met, the last Chinese lunar

220
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,160
project, and she's a scientist, a journalist, a broadcaster,

221
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,160
and she will tell you some of the projects that she has

222
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
created.

223
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Thank you, Beverly, and the Helix Center for hosting this

224
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
discussion.

225
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,160
I think this discussion sort of came out of the talk that we

226
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,160
had at that dinner, where we were talking about if history is

227
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,160
a positive memory of a nation, then what happens if you're

228
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,160
consistently missing from that story or you're constantly

229
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,160
vilified in it?

230
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,160
So what happens to your present and how does it affect your

231
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,160
future?

232
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,160
So I used to be at NPR, which deals with the history of the

233
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,160
moment, but I think my husband writes history and looks at

234
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
history at a longer range.

235
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,160
And I think that perspective is important.

236
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,160
And because I'm married to him, I've been given the opportunity

237
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,160
to look at a slice of history through a perspective and a lens

238
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,160
that is often not shared.

239
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,160
And that's the Japanese American or Asian American history.

240
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,160
And if you look at that, America can look very, very different,

241
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
and so can freedom, the idea of freedoms.

242
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,160
So my project that I would like to be remembered for is it's

243
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,160
called Freedom from Fear Yellable Project.

244
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm a conceptual artist, although I use ceramics.

245
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,160
It's really about history and about identity, time, memory.

246
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:23,160
So I took 120 yellow T-balls that I hand-pitched and I took

247
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,160
them to all 10 U.S. concentration camps that was in the

248
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,160
United States in the 1940s, and I photographed them.

249
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,160
And because of that, they sort of been invited to different

250
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
places.

251
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,160
I have to say not many people like this story, and there's been

252
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,160
a pushback on it, but I really thank this panel for giving me

253
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
a platform.

254
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Thank you.

255
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:59,160
I'm so rich.

256
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,160
You agreed to start the discussion itself?

257
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Yes, I drew the short straw because everybody else was

258
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,160
keeping sensibly quiet.

259
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,160
I think I just begin as, you know, I'm not a psychiatrist,

260
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,160
I can't list or any of those disciplines.

261
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,160
With having read recently Paul Licker's book, Memory,

262
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,160
History, Forgetting.

263
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,160
And in that book, he has 79 in his index and contents pages

264
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,160
together, 79 different categories under memory.

265
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
So where on earth does one start?

266
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,160
And I thought that to start the ball rolling, I refer to

267
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,160
Sigmund Freud, who saw memory as constantly transforming,

268
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,160
reorganizing, revising.

269
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,160
And that, even in our introductory comments that people have

270
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
made, was acknowledged.

271
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,160
But I want to start by asking the other members of the panel,

272
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,160
the other point that Freud makes.

273
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,160
And he says that memory is essentially creative.

274
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,160
What do people think he meant by that?

275
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:18,160
And how does that tie in with your own studies?

276
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,160
I think I can start.

277
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Yes, so to get to these questions, let's remind ourselves

278
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,160
and who is listening to us that memory is coming different

279
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
flavors.

280
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,160
And as you mentioned, they give 79 categories of memories.

281
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,160
And of course, there are different ways to categorize them.

282
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,160
One or two major ways that in neuroscience we use to categorize

283
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,160
memories is according to their duration.

284
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Long-term memories, shorter memories.

285
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Shorter memories, they last for a very short time.

286
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Long-term memories, they last for a long time.

287
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,160
And they are very easy to remember.

288
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
And why are they different?

289
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,160
They are different because the mechanisms that the brain used

290
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,160
to make and express these memories are different.

291
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,160
And another way to categorize them is according to what they do.

292
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,160
There are different memory systems and different types of memories.

293
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,160
We have the clarity of explicit memories, or we have,

294
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,160
we have to contrast to this implicit type of memories.

295
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,160
For example, the explicit declarative memories are the memories

296
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
we talk about.

297
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,160
So if we are here today and we talk about what we have learned,

298
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,160
those are declarative memories.

299
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,160
And in the same system, also memories of general knowledge.

300
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:57,160
If I say city, you all know what I mean by that concept.

301
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,160
So those are part of one memory system which is processed by the

302
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,160
media temporal lobe that has been demonstrated by many, many

303
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,160
studies in humans as well as in non-human animals.

304
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:15,160
If part of this memory system is impaired or their activity,

305
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,160
the activity is blocked, those memories do not fall.

306
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Those long-term memories do not fall.

307
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,160
As opposed to other major system of memory, the implicit type of

308
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,160
memories, the memories of how to do things is not, they are not

309
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
spoken, they are performed.

310
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,160
For example, if we go skiing, we have to learn how to ski.

311
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,160
And then we remember those are very, very strong memories.

312
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Memories of how to drive a car, ride a bike, tie your shoes.

313
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,160
And then everything we do that we learn the memories which

314
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,160
become sort of automatic, those are part of the implicit

315
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
memory systems.

316
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,160
And of course not talking about muscle memory.

317
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Muscle memory is performance.

318
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,160
So the performance includes the muscle memories.

319
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,160
And those are part of the implicit memory system because we

320
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,160
perform those memories, we execute them in an implicit way.

321
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
We don't think about.

322
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,160
After we have learned, we don't think about how to turn the wheel

323
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,160
when we drive a car, right?

324
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,160
We just do it automatically.

325
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,160
And in the same implicit memory system we have also emotional

326
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,160
memories, memories that are expressed without a conscious

327
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
awareness.

328
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,160
So the other distinction is conscious awareness versus not.

329
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Implicit types of memories are not conscious in their expression.

330
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
And explicit type are.

331
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,160
So there are many different types of memory.

332
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,160
I don't want to go on and on because it's a long story.

333
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,160
So is it a creative process like Freud suggested?

334
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:59,160
So first of all, I have to say the Freud was brilliant in predicting,

335
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,160
let's say in his writing so many, many aspects and

336
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,160
and processes that we then in neuroscience discovered in the

337
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
memory, in the memory domain.

338
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Is it a creative process?

339
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
I think I, yes, I do agree.

340
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
And why?

341
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Because when we form memories and they are stored, if we need to

342
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,160
retrieve them, because there are recollections, something that

343
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,160
reminds us of whatever happened in our history, in that precise

344
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,160
moment, we are living at different experience at a different time.

345
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,160
So now the new experience in the present is going to be

346
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,160
associated somewhat to whatever is recalled and is going to be

347
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,160
restored in another context.

348
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:56,160
So that is already a processing of the memories, which happens, as

349
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,160
you can imagine, every moment, every day.

350
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,160
But also we re-elaborate memories.

351
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:10,160
So if we think about something and we recall experiences and we

352
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,160
start thinking about something else because of an emotional, for

353
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,160
example, an emotional experience that is so important to us, we

354
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,160
start creating associations, no associations, which will become

355
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
no memories.

356
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,160
And so the creative process is about who we are made of the

357
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,160
multitude of experiences through learning, memorization,

358
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
recollections and re-elaboration.

359
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,160
I hope that gives some topic for discussion.

360
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:48,160
I might compliment that by answering Richard's question in a

361
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
slightly different way.

362
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,160
I mean, I hear when I think of whether memory is a creative

363
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,160
process, to which I also, a sense, I think that my

364
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,160
interpretation is to say that memories are not necessarily

365
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
leaver-idical.

366
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,160
In other words, they're not necessarily representative of the

367
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,160
world that's out there because they are interpreted through the

368
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
subjective self.

369
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,160
And it really puts to the point whether if we could view

370
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,160
everyone's memories, other humans or non-humans, whether we would

371
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
recognize them.

372
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,160
In other words, whether they are even understandable or kind of

373
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,160
interpretable or translatable by others.

374
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Right?

375
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,160
And so to me, that's a very generative way to begin this

376
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,160
conversation and thinking, as Christina said, not only about the

377
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,160
re-encoding and the changing of memory that happens with

378
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:46,160
remembering, but also about the very creativity of memory to

379
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,160
begin with, that it is an interpretation of a moment or a

380
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,160
scene or a fact or an experience and says something is

381
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,160
incorporated with the self, which might be impossibly subjective.

382
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:09,160
I agree with you, Alexandra and Christina as well.

383
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,160
I think all memory is a fabrication of our brain.

384
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,160
Every single memory we have, reality is really truly a

385
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,160
fabrication of our brains.

386
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,160
And it's an individual reality, which is not necessarily

387
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,160
parallel to the reality of someone right next to you because

388
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,160
it's always filtered through your experience, through your

389
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:38,160
neural networks, through your interpretations, and through

390
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,160
your editing of what you see.

391
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,160
So not only are you going to have alteration and distortion of

392
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:54,160
memory as you recall, but you also have a true editing and

393
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,160
distilling of memory as you lay it down.

394
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:02,160
So there's a tremendous amount of editing that goes on in both

395
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,160
the laying down of memory, what you choose to attend to, how you

396
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,160
choose to store it, what you choose to link it to, whether or

397
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
not it's real.

398
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Again, all reality is a fabrication of our individual

399
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,160
brains, and then how you choose to reproduce it, which is always

400
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,160
going to be different from one person to the next.

401
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Even if you agree on the generalities, the details are going to

402
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,160
be different because each of us chooses to remember something

403
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
different.

404
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,160
So Freud was absolutely correct in terms of how he formulated

405
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
memory.

406
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,160
So it's just like, you know, we're going to go to the

407
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
next slide.

408
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
So let's go.

409
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Hello.

410
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Yeah.

411
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Hello.

412
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Yeah.

413
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Yes.

414
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
It's set.

415
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
It's set.

416
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,160
I have to say that I think there's a difference between personal

417
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:03,160
memory and collective, you know, national memory, like history.

418
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,160
And I think one of the battles that we're having in America

419
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,160
is the history of America.

420
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,160
And basically there is a narrative that starts with Columbus

421
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:22,160
and there's George Washington and, you know, Adams and, you know,

422
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,160
Jefferson and then it goes to Lincoln and then FDR and then

423
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,160
we're at today.

424
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:36,160
And in that story, the history of the original people that were

425
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,160
here is missing, for example.

426
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,160
There was a survey about five years ago.

427
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,160
I think they found out that 40% of Americans believe that no

428
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,160
Native Americans are alive today and that they are extinct

429
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
like dinosaurs.

430
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,160
And, you know, if you read our newspapers and our history

431
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:04,160
books, you sort of believe that they're actually very much alive,

432
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,160
a lot of them were put on reservations.

433
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,160
They've moved into cities to survive and they're still there.

434
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:17,160
And the other story that never gets out, it's usually race is a

435
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
big issue today.

436
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:25,160
And the reason why race is often only seen in a white and black

437
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,160
dichotomy is because the whole history of non-white laws is

438
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,160
never talked about in our history books and the not white laws

439
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,160
were all determined in our court of law and they came out after

440
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
the Civil War.

441
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,160
So it was determined in 1870, which was an update of the

442
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,160
original naturalization law of 1790, which said that only white

443
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,160
people can become a citizen, was changed in 1870 to include

444
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,160
Africans and persons of African descent.

445
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:06,160
So after that, there's been law after law after law, which people

446
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,160
who were not African but who were deemed not white had to go to

447
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,160
court because they were excluded from citizenship, from

448
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:21,160
practicing law, from marrying other people, from, you know, they

449
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
couldn't even testify.

450
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,160
Chinese could not testify against white people.

451
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,160
And then all Asian people were banned from the United States

452
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,160
in 1924, which was actually the first year that Native Americans

453
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
were allowed to naturalize.

454
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,160
So there's this whole history that's missing.

455
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,160
So I mean, is that a creative process?

456
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
Maybe it is.

457
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:52,160
It doesn't always mean good, right?

458
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,160
You tend to think creative means good, but it doesn't have to be

459
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,160
creative in an evil way.

460
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
And your thoughts?

461
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,160
To me, it's almost like what Cetsco is saying, it's almost a

462
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,160
destructive process in that we can create memories, but we can

463
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,160
also, I mean, one of the big questions that people ask is,

464
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,160
can we actually remove memories?

465
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,160
So unpleasant memories, can we remove them for our own benefit?

466
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,160
And unfortunately, maybe what you're describing is a sense of

467
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
that there's injustice happening.

468
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
And so people choose not to talk about it.

469
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,160
And so if we don't reinforce that type of information and it's

470
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,160
the same with our own memories, if we don't reinforce and rehearse

471
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,160
some of our memories, then those memories, we can over time and

472
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,160
we forget about them.

473
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,160
And what we tend to, we can often choose what we want to remember.

474
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,160
So there's a lot of work out there where people say, can we

475
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,160
suppress certain memories, can we enhance certain memories?

476
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,160
And so the ones that give us the joy, the ones that we think

477
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,160
other people will enjoy listening to, the ones which are politically

478
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,160
correct, for example, those are the ones that people like to talk

479
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
about a lot.

480
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,160
And so those are the memories that are strengthened and those are

481
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,160
the ones that propagate and unfortunately, memories or events

482
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
that you describe of.

483
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,160
Unfortunately, those are the ones that get destroyed and not

484
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,160
talked about as much.

485
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:18,160
And I think that raises the issue very often of whose memory is

486
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,160
it?

487
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Does one have one's own memory?

488
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Does one have parents' memories, ancestral memories?

489
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Whose memory do we think is what we are recalling and

490
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,160
registering and being imprinted by?

491
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Richard?

492
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Richard?

493
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,160
Of course, one can have one's memory impaired, but I think the

494
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,160
whole question of what is forgetting is another issue.

495
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:56,160
But I'd like also to introduce this idea, which comes to me from

496
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,160
having Ray Jonathan Moore's book, Moon Walking with Einstein,

497
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,160
when he talks about the power of memory.

498
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,160
And in our introductions, we talked about failures of memory or

499
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,160
where the memory faculty has hurt.

500
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,160
But he says, well, not only did the ancient Greeks have a God of

501
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,160
memory because they thought it was so important, but we know

502
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,160
whether it's from chess players or lorry drivers playing chess

503
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:33,160
or even taxi drivers who you probably know in London have to

504
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
take a particular test.

505
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,160
They have to learn all the places and all the streets in the

506
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
city.

507
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,160
And it's been tested or shown that taxi drivers have expanded

508
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,160
brains through having trained their facility in this way.

509
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,160
But when they give up their career as taxi drivers, that

510
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,160
expansion shrinks again.

511
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,160
And it raises the question of, to what extent can we build up

512
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
our powers of memory?

513
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,160
If you've got people like taxi drivers or chess players

514
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,160
improving their memory or conjurers, indeed, what can we do

515
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:20,160
to make the memory faculty of our brains more powerful and be

516
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
able to do more with them?

517
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,160
So Richard, so you actually doesn't take much effort to change

518
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
your brain at a physical level.

519
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,160
You can practice violin for two days and change the amount of

520
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
your brain.

521
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,160
You can physically demonstrate more area of your brain devoted

522
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
to that practice.

523
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,160
One thing I wanted to mention which you brought up and wanted

524
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:53,160
to emphasize is we all tend to prize memory, including the

525
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,160
ancient Greeks, but forgetting is just as important for

526
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
remembering.

527
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:04,160
And to be able to forget and to be able to normally forget is

528
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
important for learning.

529
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,160
I mean, if we didn't forget to crawl, you know, and we're

530
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,160
willing to, then we would have learned to walk.

531
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,160
If we didn't forget our first love, it would be hard to fall in

532
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
love again.

533
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,160
So forgetting is very, if we forgot, if we didn't forget to

534
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,160
babble, you know, it would be harder to learn to.

535
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,160
So it's important to understand, and there's this whole

536
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:31,160
emphasis in modern society of having to remember, you know,

537
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:37,160
and memory being equated with intelligence and kind of to

538
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,160
the detriment of the importance of forgetting.

539
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,160
So I'd like to be a proponent of that forgetting is very good

540
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,160
for us and important for our brain.

541
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:55,160
And this wonderful book by Luria, Russian psychologist called

542
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,160
The Mind of the Monest, and he talks about a patient or a

543
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,160
man who was studied who forgot how to forget.

544
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:09,160
And it significantly interfered with his ability to function in

545
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,160
a daily, in a productive way on a daily basis.

546
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,160
I'd like to teach my dogs to remember commands better

547
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
Alexandra.

548
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,160
I don't know how to do that.

549
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
And not forget.

550
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:26,160
And I think that you also remind me of the Borges story,

551
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Phunas the memorial, where he represents a character who

552
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,160
could not forget and actually how crippling it was and

553
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,160
disabling of being able to act.

554
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,160
And there are a lot of questions that have already come up.

555
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,160
But I mean, to the sort of, how do we remember better?

556
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
How does an on human remember better?

557
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
That's so interesting because I think it has a lot to do with

558
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,160
our directing of their attention, right, and our inability to

559
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:59,160
realize what a salient to them in order to allow for the encoding,

560
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,160
which is easy for them to do.

561
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,160
I think can easily learn commands, learn to remember commands.

562
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:12,160
But we're not always as good at creating an environment which

563
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,160
allows them to pick up on the salient cues.

564
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,160
And I think that's a lot of the things that we've been

565
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
talking about.

566
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,160
But if I can also just add one other thing to this, like,

567
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,160
interestingly, frothy sea of ideas, it was something that

568
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:36,160
sets go in and Andy were hitting on about a cultural memory and

569
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:42,160
how exclusion of people from a cultural history is a kind of

570
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,160
a cultural memory.

571
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,160
And I was thinking about how when studying nonhuman animals,

572
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,160
there's always a question of whether they have memory at all,

573
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
right?

574
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,160
And this is partially because we can't ask animals to do memory

575
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,160
tasks and give us verbal responses as are many of our memory

576
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
tasks, right?

577
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,160
And so even though nonhuman animals are studied for their

578
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,160
own memory, still, what I will be asked about dogs, you know,

579
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,160
can they remember anything, which is ridiculous?

580
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Of course they can.

581
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
I mean, all their behavior evinces it.

582
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,160
But because we can't see into their brains, we kind of assume

583
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
that maybe there's an absence there.

584
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,160
And I'm wondering if the sort of way we disallow nonverbal

585
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,160
others from having memory is similar to the kind of historical

586
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,160
exclusion, memorial exclusion of peoples from our history.

587
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,160
I'm just seeing an interesting analog there.

588
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,160
I like to say something here because I was shaking my head

589
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,160
because there is so much work done on memories in nonhuman

590
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
animals.

591
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
And of course they have memories.

592
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,160
We can say that they are not talking to us, but that's just

593
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,160
one single way to express memories.

594
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,160
And so the way to express memories is how to do things is how

595
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,160
to recognize places is how to navigate spaces.

596
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,160
We have tons and tons of evidence in nonhuman animals that they

597
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
have memories.

598
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,160
And memories are like any other thing evolutionarily

599
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
conserved.

600
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,160
And there is so much studies ongoing to understand the

601
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,160
biological basis of memories that have shown that in different

602
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,160
species, there are a number of conserved biological

603
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
mechanisms.

604
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,160
So certainly they are not declarative memories, but I disagree

605
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,160
to even doubt that nonhuman animals have memories.

606
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,160
And I want to bring to one more point, which I think it was

607
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,160
brought up in terms of memories and the subjectivity, the

608
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,160
individual ways of memorizing and remembering and processing

609
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
of memories.

610
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,160
And I think that's a very important thing to do with

611
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,160
that information.

612
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I'm not sure we choose to do that.

613
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,160
I'm not sure it's a choice because a lot of our

614
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
representations and memories are implicit.

615
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
So we're not conscious of it.

616
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,160
So we don't have choice in that sense is the unconscious part of

617
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,160
brain that guides our decisions.

618
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,160
And those are, of course, based on experiences and

619
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,160
experiences we have over and over or new experiences that we

620
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
have at some point.

621
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,160
We react in certain ways, according to our history.

622
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,160
That's why it's very individualized.

623
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,160
So we are starting now in the lab, something that to me is very

624
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
exciting.

625
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,160
And that is how the memory system establish itself.

626
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
How do they form?

627
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,160
How does it mature?

628
00:37:53,160 --> 00:38:00,160
And so we are looking at the biology of episodic memories in

629
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,160
rats and mice at the age of infancy.

630
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,160
When we know that those memories are formed but rapidly

631
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,160
forgotten.

632
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,160
And this very rapid forgetting is believed to be the reason for

633
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
infantile amnesia.

634
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:26,160
And so the process, I don't know to call it, the

635
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,160
phenomenon by which as adults we do not recall experiences of

636
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,160
the first, let's say, three years of life.

637
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,160
And Freud gave the first explanation of infantile amnesia.

638
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:47,160
We don't think it now is in agreement with what we see in

639
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,160
agreement with what we see.

640
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,160
But now we are studying the biology of these memories

641
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,160
forming the first few days, corresponding to the first few

642
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:02,160
years of life in humans, and found that there is in fact

643
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,160
the very conservative evolutionary concern rapid

644
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
forgetting.

645
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,160
The animals learn and they forget very rapidly compared to

646
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
later ages.

647
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,160
And when we look at the biology, we found that the biology is

648
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,160
very interesting and unique, different than the other ages.

649
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,160
They use mechanism of so-called critical periods.

650
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Those are temporal windows in life in which the brain is

651
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,160
particularly responsive to experience.

652
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,160
And with these responses, it matures the functions.

653
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,160
So let's say the visual system that has been studied a lot in

654
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,160
the critical period.

655
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,160
We are born, we don't see the way we see in adult.

656
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,160
And through seeing, through the function of seeing, so all

657
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,160
the stimulus that go in through the eyes and the brain, those

658
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:01,160
shapes the brain to the point that when it's matured is able

659
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,160
to function like in adult.

660
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:09,160
So we find the same similar mechanisms in our experiments

661
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,160
of episodic learning and memories.

662
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,160
So what this tells us is that during this temporal window, we

663
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,160
better have the best stimuli and experiences to mature our

664
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,160
abilities to learn and remember.

665
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,160
And we tested and found that it is the type of experience that

666
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
matures the function.

667
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,160
In other words, if they are exposed to one type of experience,

668
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,160
they mature the ability to memorize like adults, that type,

669
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,160
that domain of experiences, but not other types that are

670
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
processed by the same system.

671
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,160
So, Christina, could I ask, can one will oneself to forget?

672
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Can one will oneself to forget?

673
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
Decide to forget?

674
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,160
Can one make oneself forget?

675
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Well, I'm sure if you start saying I'm going to change the

676
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,160
attention to change my attention and not pay attention to

677
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:18,160
whatever you want to exclude over time, that will lead to more

678
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,160
forgetting than if you don't do that.

679
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:27,160
But that is one single, you know, it's a small part of the

680
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:32,160
memories compared to all the memories that you're going to

681
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,160
have.

682
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,160
And our brain is molded according to the experiences we have.

683
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,160
And during these critical periods, what we see is key for the

684
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,160
development of the function.

685
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,160
You know, Richard, I just wanted to say something to Richard for a

686
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,160
moment.

687
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,160
And Avid's metamorphosis, the ability to forget is

688
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,160
really described.

689
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,160
You're meant to drink of the river of Lethi.

690
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,160
And that was a major part of the orific, the whole orific

691
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,160
experience of creative transformation.

692
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,160
And so all of those metamorphoses, all those transformations

693
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,160
depended in Avid on that ability to forget.

694
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,160
So I think that that's been part of our sort of more reflective

695
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,160
experience of memory in the brain.

696
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,160
That's a good pick up.

697
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,160
There's an actual book by David Reif called In Praise of

698
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,160
Forgetting.

699
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,160
Yes.

700
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,160
He makes the point that remembering is a barrier to

701
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,160
reconciliation, whether it's between nations, between couples

702
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,160
or whatever, which is why that part of memory is so important.

703
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,160
Yes.

704
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,160
And then you often get that someone cannot forgive and then

705
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,160
they get to an age where they forget.

706
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,160
And then there's reconciliation.

707
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,160
Actually, one of the happiest, you know, one of the keys to

708
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,160
happiness I found in older patients is the ability to forgive,

709
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
to truly forgive and forget.

710
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,160
And the one other point I wanted to make for Richard's question

711
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:23,160
was that forgetting is almost an unconscious, incessant,

712
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
constant process.

713
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,160
As we're listening right now, there are so many things that

714
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,160
we're forgetting.

715
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,160
I'm forgetting the way the light falls in the room.

716
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,160
I forget the number of, you know, the colors on the screen,

717
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,160
etc.

718
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,160
So it's an incessant, constant process.

719
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,160
Unlearning is a little bit more conscious.

720
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,160
So to decide.

721
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:51,160
Can I just, can I just join in about, well, I want to say

722
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,160
the idea of forgetting.

723
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,160
I mean, they say that if you cannot forget the pain of child

724
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,160
words, you would probably never have another child again.

725
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:09,160
And so forgetting is part of the process of living, you know.

726
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:15,160
And as for forgiving, I think part of the problem of memory

727
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:20,160
and forgetting or forgiving is that you can't forgive unless you

728
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,160
are not in the first place.

729
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,160
And what happens if your nation is constantly telling you that

730
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:32,160
whatever you think you remember didn't happen, which happened

731
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,160
to me a lot at NPR, where I was told that, you know, the four

732
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,160
freedoms and injustice didn't, doesn't happen in America

733
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,160
because, you know, we had four freedoms in America.

734
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:51,160
And I just wrote an opinion piece in my local paper,

735
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,160
the Berkshire Eagle.

736
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,160
You might want to take a look at that, but there were a lot of

737
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,160
people who were excluded from those four freedoms.

738
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:02,160
And what we continuously say that that doesn't happen in America.

739
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,160
So what happens if the forgetting is imposed on you from the

740
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:14,160
outside, you know, you haven't chosen to forget forget it or

741
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,160
you know, you're not allowed to, if it's like gas lighting, it

742
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,160
didn't happen.

743
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,160
So you can't forgive because it never happened in the first

744
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,160
place.

745
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,160
So it creates this odd catch 22.

746
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,160
And I've been looking into the Japanese American experience and

747
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,160
it's really, really bizarre.

748
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,160
It's like watching the movie Gaslight, where they keep saying,

749
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,160
you know, this happened and they're being told, no, it didn't.

750
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,160
It doesn't happen here in America.

751
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,160
And, you know, that's happened to Asian people for most of American

752
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,160
history.

753
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:57,160
It's, they're Native American history is, and the laws written

754
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,160
against them is mimics what they use against Asians.

755
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:08,160
We're talking a great deal about time, about memory and time,

756
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
different temporal periods.

757
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,160
And I'm wondering about memory and space.

758
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,160
Andy, could you say something about that?

759
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,160
And maybe Alexandra, how is it that when you're taking your

760
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,160
dog to the vet as soon as you get two blocks away, the dog

761
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,160
begins to shake because there's something about the space of

762
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,160
the approach.

763
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:35,160
And in terms of what it's like to be a person of several

764
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,160
cultures, whether ancestrally or in terms of one's own life and

765
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,160
the effect of space where you are, or you forget something, you

766
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,160
have to go back into the room where you first thought of it

767
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,160
before you could pick up the memory of why you, you move to the

768
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,160
other room.

769
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,160
Andy, could you say a few things about this?

770
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,160
Yeah.

771
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,160
So I guess the way that we, we often conceive of memory.

772
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,160
And I'm talking about episodic memory.

773
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,160
So personally experienced memories or a biographical memory.

774
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,160
People often talk about the what, where and when.

775
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,160
So when did something happen, which is the time, which we've

776
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,160
been talking about, the what actually happened.

777
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,160
And of course, the where, and the where often has really become

778
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,160
a prominent piece historically in memory research, a lot of this

779
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,160
driven by, so cells in the hippocampus, which seem to

780
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,160
indicate the spatial location of an animal in an environment.

781
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,160
And so a lot of research has really been driven by the what,

782
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,160
the where, which is the spatial piece.

783
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,160
And just in terms of what you were talking about, that really

784
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,160
speaks to the fact that we, we learn association.

785
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,160
So a lot of our memories are association between different pieces

786
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,160
of information.

787
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,160
And because space is so pervasive, so we know even where we're

788
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,160
sitting now, as we walk around, we're in a space in a particular

789
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,160
location, often our memories get anchored that way.

790
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,160
So there, we have certain associations, certain locations.

791
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,160
And so therefore, when we either retrieve those memories or we go

792
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,160
into certain locations, those may trigger those associations to

793
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,160
come back.

794
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,160
So in the case of the dog example you were keeping, I mean,

795
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,160
I was actually able to speak more to that than I would, but just

796
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,160
being in a certain location could trigger certain memories

797
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,160
associated with, with approaching a particular target spatial

798
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,160
location.

799
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,160
So, so that's probably what's, what's going on, on there.

800
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,160
And so the way a lot of continuous scientists think about memory

801
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,160
is that we almost like have a memory map in our brains where

802
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,160
it's a combination of this spatial information with this temporal

803
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,160
information, which gets bound together as almost like the

804
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,160
scaffolding of our memories, and lots of other pieces of

805
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,160
information that can attach to it.

806
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,160
So like emotions, whether something's rewarding or not rewarding,

807
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,160
for example, so they all get put together into this big memory

808
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,160
map.

809
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,160
But space is a key component of this map.

810
00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:01,160
And certainly in terms of experiences that are traumatic, I think,

811
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:06,160
space and perception, of course, has a huge effect in that way.

812
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:12,160
And Alexandra, could you help us out with what is it in dog

813
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,160
memory that seems to be spatially related?

814
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,160
Well, I mean, Andy has said it best.

815
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,160
And he's the neuroscientist here.

816
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,160
And of course, what I liked about what he said was this emphasis

817
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,160
on learning through association.

818
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,160
So memory is being triggered by an association, which is

819
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,160
a way that we think of sometimes non-human animals learning more

820
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,160
than ourselves.

821
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,160
But that is, of course, analogous or identical in non-humans and

822
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,160
in humans that we learn through associations.

823
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,160
And so it is not at all surprising that dogs can remember

824
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,160
arriving at a vet or a person who they've met once or being in

825
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:59,160
a place that they've been before and had about experience that

826
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,160
shouldn't surprise us at all.

827
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,160
And I think what I'm interested in in your question, Beverly,

828
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,160
is sort of why would we be surprised by that?

829
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,160
And I think it's because we don't think in some level we're not

830
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,160
thinking about companion animals or non-human animals as having

831
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
kind of personal stories, right,

832
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,160
autobiographical memories that they ruminate on, that they sit

833
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,160
back and reflect on.

834
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,160
And that's only because, well, we're not sure if they do have a

835
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,160
kind of sense of self over time, right, and they don't have a

836
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,160
verbal way to express that.

837
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:41,160
But also because we are familiar with each other's

838
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,160
autobiographical selves through analogy and through our telling

839
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,160
each other about our history and our experiences.

840
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,160
So we just have to look at dog behavior and realize that their

841
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,160
behavior is showing us their memory.

842
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,160
But we often are not as accustomed to that, to seeing

843
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:02,160
other's memories of visible just in their behavior.

844
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,160
We're used to seeing their memories visible in how they respond

845
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,160
and how they articulate their experiences.

846
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,160
We started off and made a very important distinction between

847
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,160
explicit memories and implicit memories.

848
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,160
But you'll notice that as we go along in the conversation,

849
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,160
we tended to default to when we mostly talk about memory,

850
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
we default to sort of explicit memories.

851
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,160
And I wonder when we talked about creative memory and destructive

852
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,160
memory, we'll call it, where we mostly were referring to

853
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,160
explicit memories.

854
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,160
And is that same creativity found in implicit memories on the one

855
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,160
hand and, right, do dogs, for example, have some degree of

856
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,160
explicit memory.

857
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,160
That's sort of what Alexandra's commenting on just now.

858
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,160
I just wondered if we could talk about that creative aspect

859
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,160
of implicit versus explicit.

860
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:58,160
Well, Socrates, when people started to write things down,

861
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,160
was disgusted because he said, if you memorize things, take

862
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,160
things into yourself as a memory, you experience them more

863
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,160
deeply than when you see it on a tablet or whatever.

864
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,160
And I'm wondering what other panelists feel about that,

865
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:20,160
whether in our day-to-day rush of taking in information and not

866
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,160
particularly memorizing it, we're losing in the depth of our

867
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,160
response to it.

868
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,160
Richard, so one of the things that we need to think about is how

869
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:37,160
intricately, in the way the brain has developed, memory is tied to

870
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,160
emotion.

871
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,160
So the amygdala, jolidu, at NYU has done a lot of work on this in

872
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,160
terms of how the amygdala is tied to memory, and it allows

873
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,160
organisms, including dogs.

874
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:57,160
I wouldn't call them lesser animals, greater animals, to evolve

875
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,160
and survive and adapt.

876
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:04,160
So in terms of the feeling of something taking it in with

877
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,160
Socrates, it would have to do with the emotion, how much you

878
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:13,160
imbue this memory with some kind of emotion, how relevant it is to

879
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:18,160
you, as opposed to facts, memories for facts, which are

880
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,160
sometimes devoid of any kind of emotion, unless it means you have

881
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,160
to study to take an exam.

882
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,160
So that is important, I think, in terms of the distinction between

883
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:34,160
how well we remember things and how much emotion plays a role in

884
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,160
remembering.

885
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:41,160
So, Alexandra, I have a question, do you think that dogs have more

886
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,160
of an emotional memory than people do?

887
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,160
Sort of because of their absence of articulating themselves

888
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:53,160
telling the story to themselves, we assume.

889
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,160
I have to be agnostic about that, I think.

890
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,160
I think that what I would imagine is more of the dog's experience

891
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,160
is a kind of fuller-fleshed perceptual memory.

892
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,160
In other words, in modalities that maybe don't always occur to

893
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:13,160
us as part of memory formation, so for instance,

894
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,160
old-faction, right?

895
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,160
Or, of course, old-faction is a big driver of learned

896
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,160
associations, and we all can talk about that

897
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:31,160
that, a moment from childhood, an early memory that is invoked

898
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,160
by a scent that you encounter again, but that's actually fairly

899
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:40,160
rare, we're not daily creating all-factory memory,

900
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,160
all-factory-ly primed memories.

901
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,160
But, of course, if one is an animal who is more living in that

902
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,160
modality, I think that they are.

903
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,160
And so, insofar as old-faction is actually closely tied to

904
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,160
emotions, perhaps so.

905
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:01,160
But, I don't think there would be any reason that they'd be more

906
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,160
emotional per se, right?

907
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,160
Versus analytic, if that's the contrast you're drawing.

908
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,160
It depends who their owners are.

909
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,160
Can I?

910
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,160
Can I?

911
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:19,160
I would like to ask something that was triggered by what

912
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,160
Gayatri said about emotion.

913
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,160
She, at first, said that you, in terms of your first romance,

914
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:31,160
that you forget that in order to be able to have other romances.

915
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,160
Now, what is it you forget?

916
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,160
You still may remember the name of the person.

917
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,160
You may recognize the person in the street.

918
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,160
You may remember something that you're going to be able to

919
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:49,160
have.

920
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,160
You may remember the name of the person.

921
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,160
You may recognize the person in the street.

922
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,160
You may remember some of the places you went out together to.

923
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:02,160
What you don't have is the emotions that you had at the time.

924
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,160
So, what's, and you mentioned emotional memory.

925
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,160
So, how do we understand emotional memory versus what is more

926
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,160
emotional memory?

927
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,160
I'm not sure.

928
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,160
But the other thing I wanted to ask, and this has been on my

929
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,160
mind for a few years, and I haven't found sufficient.

930
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,160
I haven't been able to understand it for myself sufficiently,

931
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,160
is what Christina mentioned about experience.

932
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:35,160
So, that experience with the first love of your life can continue

933
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:39,160
to have an impact on you for a period of time.

934
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,160
Or do you consider that something else?

935
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,160
Those are the two thoughts I wanted to see if there could be some

936
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,160
clarification for me on.

937
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,160
And I don't know if I can offer clarification, but I can

938
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,160
certainly comment a little bit on it.

939
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:01,160
I think we're ultimately all mammals, dogs, humans, and we

940
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:06,160
really have this large overlay of our new cortex, which tries to

941
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,160
bring rationality to our decisions.

942
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,160
Daniel Kahneman has written about this in thinking fast and

943
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,160
thinking slow, that we try to rationalize our very basic

944
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:21,160
instinctual behavior by giving it a narrative that fits in with

945
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,160
our thinking at the moment.

946
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,160
But it's really ultimately quite emotional.

947
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,160
The science of economics is emotional, even though we think

948
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,160
of economics as a very dry subject.

949
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:39,160
So, to answer your question or to try to talk about it a little

950
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:44,160
bit, when you're talking about emotions and how they affect

951
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:50,160
memory, it appeals more to the core brain, more to the primitive

952
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:56,160
brain, and it's harder to erase, which is why PTSD is such an

953
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:00,160
issue, because it's the strong connection with emotion.

954
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,160
And that's why repression, Freud's famous stories of repression

955
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,160
are also an issue, because it's a negative suppression, if you

956
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,160
will, of memory.

957
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,160
So that's my thinking.

958
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,160
I don't know what else.

959
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,160
You wanted to say something?

960
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,160
Yes, me?

961
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,160
Yes.

962
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,160
No, I would go ahead.

963
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,160
Let's go.

964
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,160
You were trying to say something before?

965
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,160
Oh, no, I will.

966
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,160
That's okay.

967
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,160
Sorry.

968
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,160
Go ahead, Christina.

969
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:40,160
Yeah, to add to what was just said, if there is no emotion or

970
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:48,160
valence, emotional valence, there is no long-term memory.

971
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,160
Motivation is based on emotion.

972
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,160
So if there is no motivation, there's not going to be any

973
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,160
long-term memory.

974
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,160
There has been also a lot of experiments done looking at the

975
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,160
level of stress and memory strength.

976
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:08,160
And what they have found is that a little bit of stress or

977
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,160
emotion, negative emotion, in some cases, when they've been

978
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:17,160
measured as aversive memories or positive in other experiments,

979
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,160
is essential to have long-term memories.

980
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:26,160
And increasing the level of stress or emotion to a certain

981
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,160
point is beneficial to have more memories, more detailed

982
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,160
memories, more long-lasting memories.

983
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:37,160
And after a certain level of stress, then there is a decrease

984
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:45,160
of memory strength and storage, or at least they are not expressed

985
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,160
anymore.

986
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,160
So it's like an inverted U effect.

987
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,160
A little bit of stress and emotion is necessary to store

988
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,160
long-term memories.

989
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,160
Too much is bad because then we distort the memories.

990
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:07,160
And the storage is only on certain representations or cues or

991
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:11,160
whatever is that the experience was.

992
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:18,160
And it can be also sort of inhibited, probably for a

993
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,160
defensive mechanism.

994
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,160
And so, let's say a very strong trauma.

995
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,160
If we ask what happened after that traumatic experience, often

996
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,160
they say, I don't remember.

997
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:38,160
No, but I was trying to comment on the very simple thing, which is

998
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,160
there is a guy at this example.

999
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:47,160
You have, so you have your first romance.

1000
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,160
You have a lot of emotions.

1001
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:55,160
How do you, how come you don't have the emotions?

1002
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:59,160
Whatever intense, loving feelings you have, you don't have

1003
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,160
anymore.

1004
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,160
In fact, if you continue to have them, you couldn't move on.

1005
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,160
Well, and I think that's a whole other.

1006
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:16,160
I think that's a whole other.

1007
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,160
I think it's a whole different thing.

1008
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:22,160
But for the sake of the discussion, let's say there is no

1009
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,160
emotional memory.

1010
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,160
Then the question is, do you think that's memory?

1011
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,160
Yes, absolutely.

1012
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:34,160
Everything that memory by definition is whatever is stored

1013
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,160
and maintained over time.

1014
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:41,160
And therefore, maintaining of that information will influence our

1015
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:46,160
behavior in the present moment.

1016
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,160
Can I?

1017
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,160
Yes.

1018
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,160
I remembered what I was thinking about emotion.

1019
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,160
And I think it's that it's not that you forget that the

1020
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,160
emotional feeling.

1021
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,160
You probably just transferred on to someone else.

1022
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:03,160
Because I know, I remember how I felt in my first love.

1023
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:07,160
And I know that maybe I don't feel that way about this other

1024
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:11,160
person because there's a lot of other memories that are piled on

1025
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,160
top of that original love that no longer makes me feel that way.

1026
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,160
But I remember that feeling.

1027
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:21,160
And when I need somebody else and that feeling is there, it's not

1028
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,160
that you lost it.

1029
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,160
It's just that you're now associating it with somebody else.

1030
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,160
And oh, Andy, can I just bring out one more thing?

1031
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,160
The other thing about emotion is what if you're the emotion that's

1032
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:39,160
not associated with you is fear and hatred and which is what I

1033
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,160
often experienced growing up.

1034
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,160
When I was eight years old, I was walking home from school and

1035
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:51,160
somebody wrote in chalk sets goes a jap, jap go home.

1036
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:59,160
This was in, you know, the early 70s and no, it's 60s, late 60s.

1037
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:04,160
And it turns out it was my neighbors who was two girls that

1038
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,160
lived in my neighborhood.

1039
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:11,160
And I'm not sure why they wrote that other than that maybe they

1040
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,160
learned it from their parents.

1041
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:20,160
But, you know, I've even growing up and, you know, going to

1042
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,160
journalism school.

1043
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:26,160
I didn't learn any a lot of this history, anti Asianism that was

1044
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:32,160
legal or most of the history that I learned about Asians was

1045
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,160
negative and fear based.

1046
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,160
And I still get it today.

1047
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,160
I've been to dinner parties in the Berkshires where people said,

1048
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,160
oh, the Japanese, you had to be put away, you know, Pearl Harbor

1049
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:49,160
or the Japanese had, you had to be nuked, you know.

1050
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:53,160
So to me, that's really scary.

1051
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:57,160
And I guess to them, it's perfectly fine because I'm

1052
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:02,160
associated with people and a memory that triggers fear.

1053
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:08,160
So what do you do when that is constantly applied to you?

1054
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,160
Even though I was, I wasn't born then.

1055
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,160
I promise I'm not scary.

1056
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:18,160
And do you want to, you wanted to respond there?

1057
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:23,160
I just wanted to add something really quickly in response to

1058
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,160
basically Ed's question earlier about, you know, moving along

1059
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,160
from a past romance.

1060
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,160
And I think one potential factor which may help us do that as

1061
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,160
well is that often our memories transform over time.

1062
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:40,160
So when we think about our episodic memories, the way, like

1063
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,160
conctor scientists think about that is that you have a re-experiencing

1064
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,160
of the event.

1065
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,160
And then we come back, people talk about jumping back in time,

1066
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,160
we put ourselves back, we experience that relationship

1067
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,160
perhaps, and all those memories flood black.

1068
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,160
But what often happens to those types of memories as well as

1069
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,160
that over time, they begin to transform in the sense that they

1070
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,160
may become more cement-sized.

1071
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,160
So they become more knowledge, not entirely knowledge, but they

1072
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,160
lean more towards that and as opposed to the more personal

1073
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,160
experience end.

1074
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,160
And I guess the extreme of that would be if you see a

1075
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,160
photograph of your childhood and someone asks you about it,

1076
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,160
sometimes you can actually remember experiencing it.

1077
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,160
But sometimes you just remember, oh, yeah, that was my birthday

1078
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,160
party.

1079
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,160
I was five and I got a great present.

1080
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,160
But it's unclear whether you actually experienced that

1081
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,160
yourself or is that someone telling you that that's what

1082
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,160
happened and that became your memory.

1083
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,160
And so there's that distinction between like a factual memory

1084
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,160
versus a personal experience memory.

1085
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,160
And perhaps maybe that's what happens with, you know, some of

1086
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:42,160
the relationships way past is that over time they transform a

1087
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,160
little bit, we detach from them slightly.

1088
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:48,160
Personally, those emotions, depending on how the relationship

1089
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,160
ended, maybe it was an amicable relationship or whether it

1090
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,160
wasn't that may influence things.

1091
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,160
But maybe one factor is that those memories become a little bit

1092
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:59,160
more slightly more cement-sized and those emotions that were

1093
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,160
attached with it, we don't re-experience them again.

1094
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,160
And so that then allows us to, you know, put that relationship

1095
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,160
in the past and move on to a new one.

1096
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,160
I'm sure that's true, one remembers some memory.

1097
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,160
It's like remembering the photocopy rather than the real

1098
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,160
thing.

1099
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,160
I was wondering how much we could say that that fact that you

1100
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,160
just described where memories are sort of fungible, that that's

1101
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,160
a feature of explicit memory as opposed to implicit memory.

1102
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,160
I'm trying to tease that out.

1103
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:35,160
We might open this up now to questions from the audience.

1104
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,160
They probably have some of the same questions that we do.

1105
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:44,160
Jerry, is this the moment to include the audience?

1106
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,160
I think that sounds like a good idea.

1107
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,160
Let's see, I think that here we are.

1108
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,160
I think Alex, but it's a whole more.

1109
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,160
Yeah, yeah, I have the questions collect this.

1110
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,160
I want to thank everyone who is viewing through Zoom and on

1111
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,160
YouTube.

1112
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,160
Thank you for the comments and questions.

1113
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,160
I've recorded them as we've gone through the Zoom.

1114
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:09,160
If you wrote more than one, I'm going to state your first one

1115
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,160
and then go through everyone else's and hopefully if we have

1116
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,160
time, get to the others again.

1117
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,160
There will be some editing on my part just for time's sake.

1118
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,160
Please forgive me there.

1119
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,160
Also, if I mangle any pronunciations of names in advance,

1120
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,160
I apologize.

1121
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,160
Okay, so the first one was from S.

1122
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,160
Mason Dambrought.

1123
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,160
And they asked, are you familiar with research showing

1124
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:36,160
applying metformin to a type one type edict that delays the

1125
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,160
oncoming of Alzheimer's?

1126
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,160
If so, please comment on this process.

1127
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:45,160
So I'll just briefly mention that there's a lot of research

1128
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:51,160
now on insulin resistance and various risk factors for

1129
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:54,160
developing dementia and metformin and drugs like that are

1130
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,160
helpful in this area.

1131
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,160
So there's still a lot of research to be done here.

1132
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,160
Okay, then just a comment to bring some levity to the

1133
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,160
conversation.

1134
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,160
Vicki Madden had wrote early on practically everyone I know

1135
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,160
has gone a pandemic puppy.

1136
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,160
So that's not a question, but I think it's a nice, a nice

1137
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,160
comment to add.

1138
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,160
She asked the question, but unfortunately she's little

1139
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,160
later on.

1140
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,160
Hopefully you get to her question.

1141
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,160
But the next one was from Manon Slome.

1142
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:26,160
Is selective memory not in a pejorative sense, a defense

1143
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,160
mechanism?

1144
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,160
I would say the analysts and our audience are best to take

1145
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,160
this.

1146
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,160
No.

1147
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,160
Well, I think in a way we've already addressed that in

1148
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:40,160
order to keep going, we tend to take in what we think we can

1149
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,160
handle in the moment.

1150
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,160
I think we can handle that.

1151
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,160
I think we can handle that.

1152
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:52,160
And one of the very compelling aspects in this pandemic

1153
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:57,160
period is how many suppressed memories have come forth now.

1154
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,160
I think there's something about the isolation.

1155
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:05,160
There's something about the amount of empathy we feel for

1156
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:10,160
others that is somehow it's enough of a high level of

1157
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:18,160
a hot house experience that what we didn't think about before

1158
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:23,160
because we had to keep going is now emerging and coming up.

1159
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,160
I don't know if others are having that experience as well.

1160
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:31,160
And yes, I was saying to Alexander earlier that I've

1161
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:35,160
never seen a period of time where so many people became so

1162
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:42,160
dependent on the unconditional affection of their pets in

1163
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:48,160
part because it's so difficult for people to be together in such

1164
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:53,160
an intense way that it's almost as if the dogs become some

1165
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:56,160
kind of mediator in this situation.

1166
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,160
Oh, yeah, I think that's exactly right.

1167
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,160
There are a symbol of the people who are in the situation.

1168
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:06,160
And I think that's exactly right.

1169
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:11,160
There are a symbol of a time before and the ease of dealing

1170
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:14,160
with others and they become the others, the social presence,

1171
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,160
who are near and we can touch.

1172
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:21,160
I think it's also interesting to remember that they are also

1173
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:24,160
dogs who are experiencing this time for themselves.

1174
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:27,160
But new puppies are not experiencing a pandemic.

1175
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,160
They don't know it's an unusual time.

1176
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,160
They don't know it's an unusual time for them.

1177
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:35,160
And I think that will be an interesting dissonance.

1178
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:39,160
Unfortunately, if we kind of unquarantine and we assume that

1179
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:44,160
they are adjusted and ready to live life by themselves, for

1180
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,160
instance.

1181
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:51,160
But the question about selective memory goes back to the fact

1182
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:55,160
that one's brain, the memory part of one's brain is

1183
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:59,160
forming and reorganizing and goes back to what one of us was

1184
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:02,160
saying earlier about the experience of childbirth.

1185
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:07,160
I don't think for what I can put together the women forget

1186
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:12,160
childbirth, but they relegate it for the health of their life in

1187
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,160
the present and the future.

1188
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:19,160
So it's not a forgotten memory, but in as much one's brain or

1189
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:24,160
one's memory part of one's brain seems like a complex computer

1190
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:28,160
that is refiling certain experiences so that they're not

1191
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,160
immediately upon us.

1192
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:35,160
I do believe, Richard, that we do actually forget severe pain,

1193
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,160
the physical pain of childbirth.

1194
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:43,160
It's hard to recreate, speaking as someone, it's really, really

1195
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:48,160
hard to recreate the intensity of the pain immediately afterwards.

1196
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:53,160
It can happen, but it's rare from a neurologic perspective.

1197
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:58,160
I would assume that pain essentially stops when it stops.

1198
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,160
Yeah.

1199
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,160
Yeah.

1200
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,160
Yeah.

1201
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:07,160
Yeah, but to add to what Richard was saying, the forgetting that

1202
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:12,160
happens in the first few years of life, this leads to infant

1203
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:17,160
and amnesia, that is actually an apparent forgetting.

1204
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,160
You're right.

1205
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:22,160
We have tested these memories that are apparently gone.

1206
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:25,160
You'll give reminders later on in life to these animals,

1207
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:30,160
the memories come back.

1208
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:36,160
I remember we had a patient who spoke German for, grew up in

1209
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:40,160
Germany, came to the United States when he was 14 or 13,

1210
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:46,160
learned English, really forgot all of us German, or maybe he was

1211
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,160
even younger, maybe he was seven or eight, and then he had a stroke

1212
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:54,160
and the only thing he could speak in was in German.

1213
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:57,160
It was very hard for his family who didn't understand any German,

1214
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:01,160
so to your point, but we really never forget anything.

1215
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:05,160
It's just our ability to retrieve things, including emotion,

1216
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,160
is much harder over time.

1217
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,160
What Jerry had asked earlier about the difference between

1218
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:15,160
explicit and implicit memory and its attachment to emotion,

1219
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:20,160
I think of implicit procedural memory as something that's a

1220
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:25,160
cable, as opposed to explicit memory, which for the most part,

1221
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:30,160
memory for events and facts, is much more like a cobweb.

1222
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:36,160
And cables are often laid down better if they are wrapped in

1223
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,160
an installation of emotion.

1224
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:41,160
That's a great one.

1225
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:46,160
I just want to add to the idea of suppressed memory.

1226
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:50,160
I'm not a memory expert, obviously, but in looking at the history

1227
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:56,160
that I've been examining for the last 10 years, a lot of the

1228
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:59,160
Japanese Americans who were incarcerated by their own

1229
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:05,160
government, just for being Japanese, did suppress that.

1230
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:09,160
They had, they suppressed it on purpose and they didn't teach it

1231
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:14,160
to their children just so that they could survive and move on

1232
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,160
with their lives.

1233
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,160
It was essential.

1234
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:22,160
It was a survival mechanism.

1235
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:26,160
Is there something that actually brought up that I,

1236
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,160
this is a language issue that I've always been interested in as a

1237
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,160
cognitive scientist, which is the sort of two sides of thinking

1238
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:35,160
about selective attention and forgetting.

1239
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:39,160
So you earlier said, we're forgetting, and I agree with this,

1240
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,160
we're forgetting a lot of what's happening right now.

1241
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:46,160
So we're all experiencing in theory something of the same.

1242
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,160
We're in the same moment.

1243
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,160
We can see each other.

1244
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:52,160
There's some overlap in our experience, but we're sort of

1245
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,160
not attending to some.

1246
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:56,160
Do you think it's the same?

1247
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:59,160
It's appropriate to say that what's happened is we're forgetting

1248
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:03,160
that already because in fact it's not encoded, really.

1249
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:07,160
It's not been explicitly encoded, which it hasn't been rehearsed by

1250
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,160
us.

1251
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:12,160
So it's sort of almost that it's just never experienced in a way.

1252
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,160
It's as though it's never experienced at all.

1253
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,160
And that's the type of thing that can't be brought back right later.

1254
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:21,160
But I do feel like there's sort of slippiness of language around

1255
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:24,160
selective attention and selective forgetting that question brought

1256
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:29,160
it up and just attention and how memories encoded to begin with.

1257
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:33,160
Well, also I feel like our experience of the pandemic is

1258
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,160
probably different than, you know, essential workers who has to

1259
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,160
get up every day and, you know, go to a hospital or something like

1260
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,160
that.

1261
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:45,160
I mean, I feel lucky that I just get to stay in my work's your home.

1262
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:50,160
And it's, I don't have those memories that an essential

1263
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,160
worker has because I never experienced it.

1264
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:56,160
I think Alex, we should go to the questions.

1265
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,160
Yeah.

1266
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,160
Yeah.

1267
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,160
So next one was from Esther Dyson.

1268
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,160
I guess this is more of a comment, but I could turn it into a

1269
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,160
question.

1270
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,160
I think it would be interesting given Richard's mention in

1271
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,160
passing about computers.

1272
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,160
They said as they listened to the intros, they thought like the

1273
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:15,160
quote unquote editing sounds was more like attaching things to a

1274
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,160
framework and the recognition of objects as an AI.

1275
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:22,160
So I guess a question would be like, how do you think the

1276
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,160
formation of how humans form memories relates to how an AI

1277
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:29,160
works or I guess like a deep learning network?

1278
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:33,160
I'd say the primary difference would be that there's no emotion

1279
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,160
involved with an AI.

1280
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:40,160
So that and that's a huge difference.

1281
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,160
And, you know, obviously the richness of the parallel

1282
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:47,160
distributed networks that both humans and more advanced AI

1283
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:52,160
system share are obviously AI systems are evolving and they're

1284
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,160
learning fuzzy logic, they're learning to learn.

1285
01:16:56,160 --> 01:17:01,160
But emotion is the big difference between the two systems.

1286
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,160
I don't know, Andy, Chris, the rest of you.

1287
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,160
Andy, what do you think?

1288
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,160
I agree.

1289
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:11,160
And I would say, I mean, just speaking practically, I would say

1290
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:16,160
that the way that as humans, the way we do it, it far exceeds

1291
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:19,160
anything that a deep neural network could do.

1292
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:22,160
I mean, there are studies out there on babies and how they do

1293
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,160
statistical learning, how just repeating stuff and they pick

1294
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:27,160
up patterns that enables babies to learn language, for example,

1295
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:31,160
far exceeds anything that you could throw like an ability of a

1296
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:34,160
deep neural network to recognize objects.

1297
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:38,160
So I think some of the principles are shared, but in the human

1298
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:42,160
brain, it's expanded and more complex in a way that we're only

1299
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:45,160
beginning to scrape the surface off of how some of that learning

1300
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,160
occurs.

1301
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:52,160
Okay, so the next question, sorry if I didn't mention the last

1302
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,160
one was from Esther Dyson.

1303
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,160
This is from Amy Olson.

1304
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,160
Could you please speak to the phenomenon of phantom limbs and

1305
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,160
how the mind remembers the body part?

1306
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:06,160
That is no longer present, but it's perceived as if it were.

1307
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:09,160
So phantom limbs, is that the question?

1308
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,160
Yeah, sorry, phantom limbs.

1309
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:14,160
So, you know, as I mentioned before, our realities are our brains,

1310
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,160
right?

1311
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,160
So our brain things that we have pain, we have pain.

1312
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:23,160
So if the brain things we have a limb, we do have that limb.

1313
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:27,160
So there's a part, so there have been numerous studies which I

1314
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:31,160
want go into, but basically a testing to this that, and the

1315
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:35,160
brain is unable to differentiate, for example, between social

1316
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:39,160
rejection versus actual pain, because the same area of the

1317
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,160
single cortex lights up.

1318
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:44,160
The brain doesn't assign a difference, which I think is

1319
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:49,160
very interesting in terms of pain, in terms of the emotional

1320
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:54,160
circuitry involved between physical pain and emotional pain.

1321
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:58,160
They both coalesce in certain parts of the brain.

1322
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:02,160
So phantom limb just means that that part of your brain still

1323
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:07,160
thinks you have a limb attached, and that's why chronic pain is

1324
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:12,160
such an interesting condition to treat, because even when the

1325
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:17,160
nascent event is no longer, you know, it's gone, the brain can

1326
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:23,160
elaborate on the pain and make it as large or as windowed down as

1327
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:28,160
it chooses to, and it's not a conscious process.

1328
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:31,160
Can you make it conscious?

1329
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,160
That's an interesting question.

1330
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:37,160
You know, all kinds of, you can remember many things by

1331
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:42,160
rehearsing, you know, the idea of changing and explicit

1332
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:46,160
declarative memory, like how do you learn to play the violin to

1333
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:51,160
an implicit cable type memory involved rehearsal?

1334
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,160
So yeah, I would imagine you can.

1335
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:58,160
I mean, you can, one of the things that I work on is in terms

1336
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:03,160
of changing the brain's perception of chronic pain, and one of the

1337
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:08,160
ways we do that is by using brain stimulation to turn down the

1338
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,160
area of the brain that perceives the pain without actually doing

1339
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:16,160
anything about the actual event that's causing the pain,

1340
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:21,160
whether it's a neuropathy or an amputated limb.

1341
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,160
Yeah.

1342
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:27,160
So it's, everything happens in our brain, whether it's real or not,

1343
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:31,160
which sounds kind of silly to have to say, but it's hard for us

1344
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:35,160
to truly grasp, I think, sometimes.

1345
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:37,160
Christina, do you have thoughts?

1346
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:40,160
You'd like to add to this?

1347
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,160
No?

1348
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:41,160
Okay.

1349
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:44,160
No, I think she did a fantastic job.

1350
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,160
Okay.

1351
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,160
Okay.

1352
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,160
Okay.

1353
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,160
Okay.

1354
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,160
Yeah.

1355
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:52,160
So Dave asked, how can one forget or change your negative memory?

1356
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:55,160
I think do you want to answer that?

1357
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:59,160
I think it's been sort of fleshed out through the conversation.

1358
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:03,160
So just to note that I got your question, Dave, there.

1359
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,160
Satya in Prathabhan.

1360
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,160
Sorry if I mispronounced that.

1361
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:10,160
Apart from cues of survival or for survival, excuse me.

1362
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:13,160
Is there a reason we were in bread with memory?

1363
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:16,160
What are we here to remember being on Earth for?

1364
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,160
I'm not sure I understood the question.

1365
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,160
What's the reason to have memories?

1366
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,160
Yeah.

1367
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,160
What's the biological necessity for memory?

1368
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:33,160
The biological reason is to survive.

1369
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:39,160
But in addition, they want to know in addition to survival.

1370
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:43,160
So besides survival, is there any other reason?

1371
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,160
Well, consciousness.

1372
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:50,160
I mean, Gerald Edmund called consciousness the remembered present,

1373
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:55,160
suggesting that we're experiencing, reflecting and remembering all at once.

1374
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:59,160
And that's what consciousness is.

1375
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:06,160
You know, if you ask the question, what's it for?

1376
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:11,160
It looks to me like the only sort of obvious answer would be for survival.

1377
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:15,160
It may do other things other than promote survival.

1378
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:18,160
And I think that's what makes it a lot of fun.

1379
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,160
Obviously, we don't remember.

1380
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,160
We're not fun.

1381
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:26,160
We're not fun.

1382
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:31,160
But I mean, isn't memory like, you know, does a rock have a memory?

1383
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:34,160
So maybe, you know, because we're animals.

1384
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,160
Well, a rock doesn't have to cross the road.

1385
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:41,160
Exactly.

1386
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:48,160
Of course, the one thing that remains all the arguments about where consciousness comes from,

1387
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:56,160
and he'd you have thoughts you'd like to insert here?

1388
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,160
Not in particular.

1389
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:01,160
I would say that the survival is the main piece.

1390
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,160
Yeah.

1391
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,160
Okay.

1392
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:08,160
So next one is from Vicki Madden.

1393
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,160
They were curious about dream remembrance.

1394
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:17,160
So they said, is the reason why they potentially forget memories or the way that they retain memories is that they have to tell to themselves.

1395
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,160
And put it in language right away.

1396
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,160
And if they don't, they'll forget it.

1397
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:25,160
So like, how does one go about remembering a dream?

1398
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:37,160
This is the idea that somehow speaking of it or talking verbalizing a memory does something go some way towards.

1399
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:47,160
instantiating it or creating.

1400
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:58,160
I once did a dream sleepover seminar at the Ruben Museum of Art, where we were right there with people waking up, just as they were waking up, which is very different than seeing patients in your office.

1401
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:11,160
And they would report the dream while they were waking up, and then the next morning, we would have a group and everyone would discuss or say report their dream.

1402
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:15,160
The content in every case was exactly the same.

1403
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:19,160
What changed was the linear time sequence.

1404
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:26,160
So that when the person was waking up, they said this happened, but before that this happened before that this happened.

1405
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:32,160
And then when they told the dream in the morning, it was like a linear narrative.

1406
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,160
That that was very interesting.

1407
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:48,160
So I think, you know, some of what seems so ridiculous in dream memory is actually because we're changing the time, we're looking at it from the waking time sequence.

1408
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:57,160
So I think if you accept that where there's an anomaly, then there's more of a tendency to be open to your dreams and to record them.

1409
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,160
Remember them. Yeah.

1410
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:05,160
If I could just share a story. My husband loves trains. He's a trained fanatic.

1411
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:27,160
And you made us watch this documentary about the bullet train in Japan. And supposedly since it's invention and inception, it has had, I think, only one death on accident, which is pretty remarkable considering Japan has the most earthquakes of any nation in the world.

1412
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:39,160
And they said that one of the things that they do, and I've seen this on on local trains in Japan, where the conductor points at something, and then he says something.

1413
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:53,160
And then it's like point and there's something to with verbalizing and pointing that they do. And we kept looking like, who is he talking to because he didn't have earphones, he didn't have anything.

1414
01:25:53,160 --> 01:26:08,160
And it turns out that it's a memory aid. And now they use it at hospitals with prescriptions. They make you look at the name, you say it out loud, and then you point again.

1415
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:26,160
And it improved the accuracy by, I don't know how many fold. So, reading it, looking at it, and then verbalizing it actually does something to the memory process. Yeah.

1416
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:42,160
So I wanted to just say something really interesting and I never know this, and I don't know if you ever experienced this, but I had a graduate student who is now in medical school, and he grew up in Japan, and he came to the United States when he was in his 20s.

1417
01:26:42,160 --> 01:27:04,160
And he had trouble, he had to unlearn the difference between L and R. He actually had a lot of trouble pronouncing. Well, there is no, well, in Japan, it was just, I thought it was so interesting that no, in Japan, there is no R or an L.

1418
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:19,160
There's only in between, there's a radirud et al. It's not an L, and it's not an R. And what he had is he had trouble hearing the difference. Yes, I couldn't hear the R or the L. So, sometimes he had to put it in the context.

1419
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:23,160
So, right, right, because it's not something you routinely think about.

1420
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:27,160
No, but also, I can run to the next question.

1421
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:47,160
Sorry. So, Elizabeth Manis asked, is there a distinct, well, I think this actually is a good picky back off what guy she was talking about. Is there a distinction between forgetting and unlearning.

1422
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:59,160
Richard, you have a sense of that as a historian. Again, going back to wilfulness or rather the exercise of one's will.

1423
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:16,160
There was a British officer in the early to mid 19th century, who was going through a section of Europe, and he was saying to them, well, can you say to one man, can you remember Napoleon?

1424
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:32,160
And the man said, yes, he was well over six foot tall with long blonde hair. Anyway, what he wanted to remember was a conquering general looking like a Viking God.

1425
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:47,160
So, he unconsciously created this image, which had nothing to do with with fact, except the fact of what he thought a conquering officer should look like.

1426
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:55,160
So, to that extent, one can unconsciously will a memory.

1427
01:28:55,160 --> 01:29:09,160
Interesting. Yeah. And all of a sacks talks about reciting to members of the family various events in their shared past.

1428
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:14,160
And the family's saying, but you weren't there.

1429
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:19,160
And it's the same process. It would like to be.

1430
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:30,160
We also say that forgetting is a larger category and unlearning to the degree it's a separate thing it's a subset of all forgetting.

1431
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:32,160
Does that sound reasonable.

1432
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,160
Yeah.

1433
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,160
Sounds good.

1434
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:44,160
Unlearning means that we have learned something and then we are not forgetting is part of many processes.

1435
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:55,160
One of the things you'll remember the famous line in death of a salesman when the wife says attention must be paid.

1436
01:29:55,160 --> 01:30:03,160
One of the aspects of learning and unlearning is paying attention.

1437
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:13,160
We've all seen on Andy's wall above the television set in the bookcases, a number of telephones.

1438
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:19,160
But did we pay attention to the fact that he has four telephones out of reach in his living room.

1439
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:27,160
No, but I saw the gorilla walk by. I don't know if the rest of you saw that gorilla.

1440
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:33,160
All right. So maybe it's the gorilla in the room, not the elephant in the room.

1441
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:37,160
Well, I think we've come to the end of our time.

1442
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:40,160
Well, can we get one or two more questions or you.

1443
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:48,160
I would like to. Yeah, I think I could pick sort of two topologies to others, but I think there's sort of two that could be interesting.

1444
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:57,160
So one was from Robert Messiati. You wrote a long thing, but I think I understand what he's saying is probably best answered by Christina.

1445
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:02,160
He was sort of curious about the physiological process of explicit memory recall.

1446
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:06,160
And he was what he's referring to. I'm pretty sure is like structural changes with protein.

1447
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:12,160
So I think was, I think what he's alluding to is with LTP, a long term potentiation causing protein full changes.

1448
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:18,160
And I think he was curious whether such protein full changes are what leads to recall, right?

1449
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:28,160
So that the certain position of the protein over time, because what leads to recall, I'm assuming also I've had some experience in neuroscience research myself for my master's.

1450
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:33,160
I've read this before. So I think that's what he's referring to.

1451
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:45,160
Yeah. Yes, I'm going to give a brief answer because it could be a lot of discussion about recall. It could be another topic for another really meeting.

1452
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:52,160
We don't know anything about the mechanism to recall. It's very difficult to study because it's an instantaneous.

1453
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:55,160
It's a moment that happens.

1454
01:31:55,160 --> 01:32:09,160
And studying the biology of that is, is, is going to be the next round here, I'm sure. But it has not been as easy to approach as encoding and new memories and long term memory.

1455
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:16,160
Consolidation and storage information. So recall is a major, major question.

1456
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:31,160
I would not equate this with the first long term potentiation is the equivalent is believe or is suggested to be the equivalent of long term memory long term potentiation.

1457
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:36,160
Or memories formation, let's say, but not record.

1458
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:50,160
There are studies of course that can reactivate the electrophysiological measurements. But again, relating that to recall of memories is a big jump.

1459
01:32:50,160 --> 01:33:01,160
As you can imagine, you know, one electrophysiological measurement is a monodimensional understanding compared to the complexity of the brain.

1460
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:16,160
Oh, no, I apologize. When I was referring to LTP, I was mostly not in terms of recall, but it's, as you talked about, it's what I to me creates the network and the system for which the memories sort of first builds upon through synaptic pruning and what have you and obviously

1461
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:22,160
LTD long term depression in the server and the server problem. But yeah, that's that's a whole other discussion for another day.

1462
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:27,160
And then I get.

1463
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:36,160
Okay, this is a good, this is a good light one, I think, because it's a good one to end it off this person. It was a Judy Levine asked, how is it when you do a cross puzzle.

1464
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:47,160
If you leave it and come back, you'll then remember the words that you couldn't remember before, but it comes like this without thinking about it.

1465
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:56,160
The computer warming up.

1466
01:33:56,160 --> 01:34:06,160
It goes somewhere into the default default network, but it's your brain's processing it even if you're not paying conscious attention.

1467
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:16,160
It's like coming up with an answer to a problem that you had at night you wake up and you know the answer in the morning and I think it's the same sort of thing.

1468
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:32,160
And not so much a memory issue I would think but it relates also to getting offline, not having your brain occupied with something else, so that it has an opportunity to sort of reconfigure itself and perhaps come out with an answer of course doesn't always

1469
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:42,160
work. But there is this idea that either sleeping on it or taking a break doing something else can improve performance.

1470
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:53,160
Well, I'd like to thank everyone so much for your wonderful contributions. There's so much that hasn't been said, but I think we've all learned.

1471
01:34:53,160 --> 01:35:06,160
We've all I hope recorded, and I hope many of us will remember much of what was said, but it was all terribly important and I think you so much participating.

1472
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:16,160
And thank you Beverly for organizing it and moderating. Yes, and I wish you all very well very well as we proceed to manage.

1473
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,160
Next year, thank you.

1474
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:23,160
Goodbye everyone who's coming. Thank you for being with us. Thank you everyone.

1475
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:24,160
Thank you.

1476
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:37,160
Bye bye.

1477
01:35:54,160 --> 01:36:19,160
Thank you.
