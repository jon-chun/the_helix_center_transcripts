1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Whether it meets your expectations or exceeds them or doesn't meet them at all, we really

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,360
want to know about it.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:14,520
So I'll be coming around.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,680
I'm Rob Penzer.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,800
I'm the Associate Director of the Hillards Center.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,600
Before I get to the introductions today, I just have a few announcements of upcoming round

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,480
tables.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,400
Next Saturday, April 25, another John Templeton found the round table, the changing nature

9

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,760
Her research on autobiographical memory and its development, and in particular the phenomenon

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,200
of infantile or childhood amnesia, is the subject of her book, Remembering the Time

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,080

36
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,040
ward from the American Psychological Association and the Book Award of the Cognitive Development

37
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,440
Society, describes his current studies of how children learn about history, science

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,400
and religion on the basis of what trusted informants tell them.

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,000
Regina Pally is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice with a special interest

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,840
in parents and couples.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,040
She has studied and written about neuroscience for mental health professionals and the lay

42
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
public.

43
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,240
In 2008, she founded the Center for Reflective Parenting, whose mission is to promote healthy

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,800
child development by strengthening the bonds that children have with all those who care

45
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,360
for them through an emphasis on reflective thinking.

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,360
The current focus of her writing is reflective parenting in relationship to child development,

47
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,800
brain development and the parent-child relationship.

48
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Colin Phillips is professor and distinguished scholar, teacher in the Department of Linguistics

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,520
at the University of Maryland, where he directs the Language Science Center and is a scholar

50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,400
of the Neuroscience and Cognitive Science program.

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,560
He investigates the mental and neurocoding of language, children's effortless acquisition

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,400
of language and linguistic illusions.

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,720
His research has investigated 15 languages and he directs Langscape, an online portal

54
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,560
for language diversity that combines interactive mapping with diverse resources for 6,400

55
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
languages.

56
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,240
He's also an advantage of science, a broadly interdisciplinary field that connects fundamental

57
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,200
science with applications in education, technology and health.

58
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,760

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,680
Dimensions of Object Relations, the Object Relations Inventory.

64
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,440
He participated for 20 years in a multidisciplinary study group on learning disabilities.

65
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,160
In 2008, the New York Psychoanalytic presented him with the Charles Brenner Teaching Award

66
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
for Outstanding Contributions to Psychoanalytic Education.

67
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,040
Paul Zilinski is a children's book illustrator and writer, a winner of numerous awards, including

68
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,720
the Caldicott Medal for his Retelling of Rapunzel and three Caldicott Honors for Hanselungrettle,

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,560
for Rumpelstilskyn and for Swamp Angel.

70
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,520
His styles range from Renaissance-inspired oil paintings for his fairy tales to more

71
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,920
cartoonish drawings of the reason Z is for moose.

72
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,160
Certain of his books, particularly The Wheels on the Bus, one of my sons, all-time favorites,

73
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,760
by the way, communicates strikingly well with learning disabled or autistic children.

74
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,000
He holds an MFA in painting from the Tyler School of Art and a BA from Yale College, where

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,440
he was the first class that Murray Sendak ever taught.

76
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,680
He sits on the board of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, co-chairs the

77
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,760
Children's and Young Adult Committee of Penn American Center, and volunteers with other

78
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,720
organizations that promote books and literacy for children.

79
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,240
And now on to our panel.

80
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:02,880
Well, I'm particularly glad to be here today on my own turf.

81
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,120
I guess I'm the only one who's used to this building and this organization.

82
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,320
But many years ago, Paul and I met, we were classmates in college, although we didn't

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,000
know each other in college, but I knew his name because my children grew up on the wheels

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,760
of the bus and Rumpelstilskyn.

85
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,040
And they came to the reunion, and after Paul and I started talking in the Peabody Museum

86
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,760
where all the dinosaurs were, I asked my kids if they would like to meet him because I figured

87
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,320
they'd be so excited about the books and actually meeting the man who had done the illustration.

88
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,000
And my daughter was in fact very excited because she said she had never met a living

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,320
author before.

90
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:54,080
That might be one illustration of the difference between children and adults' lines.

91
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,480
I didn't grow up wanting to be a children's book maker because I had the same point of

92
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
you.

93
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
I didn't really know that living people did them.

94
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,920
And I had books that were very important to me, but I kind of assumed they were made

95
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,440
by dead people.

96
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,920
It's largely true, I guess.

97
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:22,320
Well, I don't know if we should just join in, but I'm stimulated to think about, in,

98
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,640
I've always been fascinated with why children are so fixated on stories.

99
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,640
I used to tell my kids stories and I could do, I could take nine-hour card trips with

100
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,040
them as long as I kept up the story.

101
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,240
And so fast forward, now that I'm studying about the neuroscience of the brain, I'm writing

102
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,440
a book on reflective parenting.

103
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,080
My research, I came up, there's a lot of research on the importance of storytelling, stories,

104
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,880
telling stories, reading stories, talking about stories, discussing stories, in terms

105
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,200
of the development of reflective thinking in the mind, and that children learn a lot

106
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,360
from their encounter with stories.

107
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,720
And even part of their imaginative play is involved in making sense of how the mind works

108
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,480
and other people, particularly other people's minds.

109
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,280
We all have privy to our own minds, but it's other people's minds that are troublesome.

110
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,720
And telling stories seems to be a really important component of child development.

111
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,160
Is that different from the patterns, the importance of stories?

112
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,480
Stories seem to be the way advertising agencies glom on to people's wish to buy things.

113
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
Everything gets better when it's attached to it.

114
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,200
It is, I think we're all drawn to stories because we can personally relate, but theoretically

115
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,440
a person, an adult's mind should be developed by now.

116
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,120
And the child's mind is actually developing in relationship and how they will discuss

117
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,120
stories and what the points are that they're able to comprehend will be different.

118
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
It's just a developing process.

119
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,320
But there was a neat study published a couple of years ago, I think, it was done here in

120
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,720
New York, and they got the adult subjects to read fiction.

121
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,680
And after this brief dose of fiction, they tested them on various psychological insights.

122
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:27,440
And the people who'd read fiction, I mean George Elliot, as opposed to John Grisham say,

123
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,440
did better on these psychological insights.

124
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,320
So even adults have room to grow under these circumstances.

125
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,200
And certainly one of the most important functions of stories are stories about ourselves and

126
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,840
about our families and about the people in our families.

127
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,040
And it's through those stories largely that children come to establish that sense of self,

128
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,040
that sense of self as separate from, but related to others in the family.

129
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,600
And those stories form the core of our autobiographical or personal memories that obviously are very

130
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,360
important to us and that we hold most dear.

131
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,800
So Patricia, can I ask you a bit more about that because you've done so much research

132
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,480
on infantile amnesia and the sort of recovery from it, so to speak?

133
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,200
Recovery from it, actually, I refer to, thank you, I refer to it as the onset of childhood

134
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
amnesia.

135
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,760
We often think about childhood amnesia that as adults we have difficulty remembering the

136
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,000
early years of our lives.

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,880
And often that's talked about as when we start to have autobiographical memories as the offset

138
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,120
of childhood amnesia.

139
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:45,280
I actually think conceptualized the other way, that it's the offset when we begin to retain

140
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
those stories.

141
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,560
We're always, those stories, those events, those memories.

142
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,840
We're always forming them, even infants.

143
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:58,040
We were talking about your 10-month-old grandchild, your 10-month-old grandchild is forming memories

144
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,240
and retaining them for short periods of time.

145
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,880
And it's as we become able to retain those memories over longer periods of time that

146
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,720
we see the offset of that childhood amnesia.

147
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,120
And that's one of the centers of study in autobiographical memories.

148
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,280
Why is it that even though children are forming memories that we as adults have difficulty

149
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
retaining them?

150
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,640
It's one of the great mysteries of in the memory research literature.

151
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,920
So can we probe the mystery of the research?

152
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,160
I suppose if we look back at the last 20 years of research on infants, there's been dramatic

153
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,160
evidence of how smart toddlers are.

154
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,600
I mean, 9-month-olds, 12-month-olds.

155
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,400
You give them a social scene.

156
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,920
They can work in kind to whom, who's been nasty to whom, and they prefer the person who's

157
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
kind and so forth.

158
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,040
So in some sense, they have all the intellectual or cognitive equipment to lay down a little

159
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,120
narrative in their growing brain.

160
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,360
So that makes it all the more mysterious that in fact virtually none of us have memories

161
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,200
from our first year of life or even our second year of life.

162
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:26,080
There's growing evidence that what we, what accounts the, the, the, this amnesia is accelerated

163
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
for death.

164
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:33,640
So as you say, their, their forming memories, they're able to create a representational

165
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
trace.

166
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,080
They're able to use the same brain structures that we as adults use to form those memories.

167
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:48,280
But the immediate experience, cognitive work has to be done to turn an immediate experience

168
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,920
into an enduring memory trace.

169
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,640
And the neural structures that are responsible for that transformation are very slow to

170
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
develop.

171
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:04,560
And I talk about this as kind of a leaky sieve that as infants, certainly they're forming

172
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,640
memories, but a lot of the information that makes up a memory representation kind of leaks

173
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,560
out and it leaks out more rapidly than it does for adults.

174
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,320
And there's actually the, there's a growing body of literature demonstrating that it

175
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,560
could be forgetting that we think is therefore accounting for the loss of those memories

176
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:37,200
that are formed and are held on and retained for some period of time, but then ultimately

177
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,680
become the victim of a fall victim to the.

178
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:48,200
So what is it that ultimately clogs that sieve and makes sure that that the holes get

179
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:55,520
about this is the colander memory that if you have lasagna noodles and you have a colander

180
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,120
with big holes in it and you dump your lasagna noodles in, the water rushes out, but the lasagna

181
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,920
noodles stay in.

182
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,800
But memories aren't like lasagna noodles.

183
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,040
They're like orzo, those little tiny bits of pasta.

184
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,840
And if you're going to make orzo and successfully hold on to it, you can't pour it into a colander

185
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,200
with big holes, you have to pour it into one of those fine mesh nets.

186
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,760
And what happens over the course of the development is that with neural, neural changes, we trade

187
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,120
in essentially our holy colanders for nets.

188
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,640
Hold the grid.

189
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:40,040
So the way you're saying it there, it's suggesting that it's the container that is changing over

190
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
time.

191
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,080
So is it the orzo is changing over time?

192
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,640
The way I cook it, it gets more sticky and it doesn't go through.

193
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
There you go.

194
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,400
I actually think we're developing cheese sauce or something of that nature.

195
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:57,200
So the elements of orzo, we infants are encoding the same bits and pieces of information,

196
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
maybe not as many as elaborated.

197
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,680
And they don't have as much of the sticky stuff to hold it together.

198
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,880
I wonder if this goes back to the point about the stories.

199
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,440
Yes, indeed.

200
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,960
As adults, we're good at making a story out of our experiences.

201
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,000
We can connect all of the different things going on.

202
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,080
Life isn't as inherently structured as it gives you is something which has the narrative

203
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
made more explicitly.

204
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,320
And it has all those connections built in.

205
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,440
Is it the earliest stage?

206
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,040
Is it the case that the pieces of the memories are there?

207
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,120
But because it lacks the connections between them, because it lacks the narrative, that

208
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,760
means that the individual pieces are more fragile.

209
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,520
And I think that we have beautiful data to speak to exactly that.

210
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:49,120
That the more coherent that story is, the longer that memory tends to live on, and less

211
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,960
coherent memories that aren't very well connected to each other.

212
00:15:53,960 --> 00:16:00,800
Those are the ones that fall prey to forgetting particularly rapidly and particularly vulnerable

213
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,360
to that kind of forgetting.

214
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,160
So the story is the cheese sauce, the story is the starch in the pasta grains, and that

215
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,920
really does play a very critical role in maintenance of those events and stories.

216
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,920
So, the role of language, though, so by the time the chart is two, two and a half, they're

217
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,200
starting to tell these little stories, which is the kind of rehearsal, which is the kind

218
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,000
of strengthening, right?

219
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yes, yes.

220
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes.

221
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,840
And I certainly speak to that in terms of development, yes, the children have, you know,

222
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,160
they can tell you who did what to whom.

223
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,600
But that kind of reflection on the significance or the importance of that experience.

224
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,920
So the fact that, you know, this actor A did something to actor B, can be encoded in a

225
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,080
very elemental way, or it can be encoded with respect to how that impacted you as an individual

226
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,760
and the impact it had on the actors and the meaning that that has for the child's life.

227
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,440
And I think that that's what's critically missing in many respects in very young children.

228
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Right.

229
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,320
So children are quite prepared in the development of the form of language.

230
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,720
But in understanding the uses that we put it to, that tends to be much more delayed.

231
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,040
So they will say things that we can do a little bit more than they may do themselves.

232
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,440
You know, I think also there's a big part of this that has to do with learning or memory

233
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,760
for what?

234
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,440
What's the purpose?

235
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,880
And the purpose of the infant, if I could put it that way, is to learn how to attach to

236
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,720
that person who's going to be the reliable source of safety, comfort, soothing, not just

237
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,760
food, but the whole emotional, social interaction.

238
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,200
It's the very first purpose, I say, of what's going on.

239
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,400
It comes into the world really skilled at knowing how to do that, as long as there's

240
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,400
an environment that engages the child in that way.

241
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,160
So what you need to know and keep in memory is really ultimately what's relevant to your

242
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,800
life.

243
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,400
And what isn't so relevant should be forgotten.

244
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,760
I call it forgettery.

245
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,080
There's memory and forgettery.

246
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,520
And you need to forget.

247
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,800
It's a good thing to forget what's not relevant.

248
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,760
And because the brain, while it can hold on to millions of pieces of information, billions

249
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,760
of pieces of information, it's still a limited place.

250
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,280
And particularly conscious memory.

251
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
How do we know?

252
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,800
How do we know that though, at the moment?

253
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:42,040
It's only sometimes in reflection, in thinking back that you see the relevance of it.

254
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Well, that actually was good.

255
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,600
Yes, exactly, that's a really good point.

256
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,640
We don't know in the beginning what's relevant, which is children are much, at least my understanding

257
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:57,360
of it, is children are much more good at learning kind of generalities.

258
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,840
And later on, they learn more specifics.

259
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:10,800
And so they need to hold on to those generalities to see what's going on in a specific situation.

260
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,160
And you don't know, you have to be open-ended for the many potentials.

261
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,200
With a good specific, fairly quickly, after all, by the time they're 10 or 11 months,

262
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
they're attached to a particular person.

263
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,040
At 10 or 11 months.

264
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
You're talking about it.

265
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,120
So you're talking about it up until that point, they're more into generalities.

266
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,080
Yes, and I think in general, it takes a long time for a child to learn.

267
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,080
You know, there's the furry animal.

268
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,680
But first, they learn furry animal before they learn kitty, sheep, bunny.

269
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
That's what I mean.

270
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:49,080
And that there are categories of experience that apply in a very general way.

271
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,560
Which I think one of the things children are kind of learning and playing with.

272
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,520
So they can say open-ended, yeah.

273
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,080
But one thing we know is that memories are not necessarily accurate.

274
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,200
And that memories change as they're needed or not needed.

275
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,120
So clinically, if we can get one story from a child, that that is.

276
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:16,920
And we've told with great detail and specificity about an event.

277
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,480
When we talk to the parents, they say it actually didn't happen that way.

278
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,840
And one of Freud's most moving, and I think important papers, was on screen memories.

279
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:32,240
I don't know if you're familiar with that, which is the ability of a childhood event.

280
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,800
Which has a very specific quality of being very, very clear.

281
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,760
And often the person who's remembering this doesn't remember seeing it through his own

282
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:48,240
eyes, but remembers observing it as though he were watching something else happen.

283
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,680
And what makes the paper so moving is he talks about his own memory of an important event

284
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,120
in childhood.

285
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,440
And what it means for his adult experience.

286
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,240
But I think clinically we see this all the time with kids.

287
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:09,000
I think part of what they remember is what's useful in explaining something right now.

288
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,080
I made a mistake.

289
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,040
I was mistreated.

290
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,560
I didn't get something that other kids got.

291
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,840
And might not have happened.

292
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,200
But it's remembered with absolute clarity.

293
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,520
I think that one of the things that we find challenging is finding the expert who actually

294
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,680
does really remember the event.

295
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:34,080
And in our longitudinal studies with children, we also involve typically their mothers.

296
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,140
Because their mothers are bringing them into the laboratory each time and are willing

297
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,720
to participate as a longitudinal participant.

298
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,200
And one of the things that's very striking is the fragility of adults' memories as well.

299
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,560
So sometimes I think we overestimate the extent to which the adult has the right answer or

300
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,320
the right perspective on the event.

301
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,480
And sometimes it's the child whose memory may be more of a radical.

302
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:24,360
What is it you really mean by memory?

303
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:31,360
I think your microphone is not on my answer.

304
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
You'll understand the point I'm from.

305
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Well, that's a beautiful question.

306
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
What do we mean by a memory?

307
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,360
And what do we mean by an event?

308
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:53,360
An event my weekend trip to New York to participate in this wonderful discussion is the event picking up this bottle and taking a drink out of it, right?

309
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:02,360
To what extent where we parse the events is also something that is, we know very little actually about how we parse events.

310
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
And what's the beginning, the middle of an end of an event?

311
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:10,360
And again, as you sometimes reflect back, it's the beginning of that relationship.

312
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,360
You know, here I'm passing counter on the subway or something.

313
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,360
But it turns out that that was the beginning of an event.

314
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
And we don't always know.

315
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Well, with children, that is a key part of what develops their mind.

316
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:34,360
Those experiences, those events are what is helping develop the mind of that particular child.

317
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Absolutely.

318
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,360
It can't be just limited entities that we can bring out of them.

319
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:56,360
Well, I think the thing that is important is we know, I mean even adults talk about memory of an event as if an event happened or there was a specific event or that everybody would see the event in the same way.

320
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:05,360
And one of the signs of maturity, and we're going to talk about children, I mean one of the, I like to think about this, one of the purposes of childhood is to learn how to become an adult.

321
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:16,360
And so as an adult, probably the greatest sign of maturity of the adult mind is the capacity to realize everything is perspectival.

322
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:22,360
I like to say beauty is in the eye of the beholder and so is everything else.

323
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,360
That everything is perspective.

324
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:31,360
And the capacity to realize that your perspective is really only one perspective and there's always somebody else's perspective.

325
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:41,360
I mean in this panel we could take the same water bottle, I'm sure, and have whatever number of people there are here, different perspective or even the whole.

326
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,360
This is one of the things we're really teaching children, aren't we?

327
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
About a theory of mind, thank you.

328
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:39,360
I just feel like telling us the thing about a memory that I had myself that was sort of like Freud's screen memory, I guess, that I was reading a Babar book to my

329
00:24:39,360 --> 00:25:06,360
then very young daughter and came to a page, it was a page with monkey vision and I think it was a very important thing to say.

330
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:14,360
It was a page with monkey ville where all the monkeys were climbing, wrote ladders and living in the houses in the trees.

331
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:21,360
And I suddenly remembered this same page from when I was very young.

332
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,360
It's not a memory that I remember going over and over again, it wasn't part of my life, it wasn't really an important thing.

333
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:32,360
But I suddenly was seeing this thing that I had seen as a kid and it was a point, was it different?

334
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:41,360
I was seeing almost the double exposure of two different pictures on the same page, I was really very disappointed with the current one.

335
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:48,360
There was so much detail and imagery in the other one.

336
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,360
So the memory of an image, it's a creative act.

337
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,360
It must have been important to you in some way you didn't realize.

338
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:08,360
And then the real thing wasn't so great. But to just take an ordinary example that everyone has been through, a kid will say he was screamed at by a teacher.

339
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,360
And he still hears the reverberating screaming.

340
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,360
If you actually hang around the school, I mean the teacher won't tell the truth, obviously, so you can't ask.

341
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:26,360
But if there's somebody else who happened to have been in the room, they can say the teacher was angry, but wasn't screaming.

342
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,360
Or when it happens in your own house, we all know as parents we never scream.

343
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:38,360
But what kids remember is screaming, they remember horrible violence, where there was none.

344
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,360
And I think this has to do with their conscience.

345
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,360
It's not necessarily about cognitive structure.

346
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:53,360
It's that in what we call early latency from say seven to ten years old, kids have a very primitive conscience.

347
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,360
They're very afraid of doing something wrong and getting hurt and being in trouble.

348
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:05,360
And they perceive the world so that every time they do something wrong, you know, mom is going to kill me now.

349
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,360
And on some level they actually mean kill.

350
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,360
And they might remember it that way. And remember that for the rest of their lives.

351
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,360
So we have to be very suspicious of reports that we get.

352
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,360
Of course this is true with adults as well.

353
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,360
But it's more true in different ways, in different phases of child development,

354
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:33,360
that would preoccupy as a kid at a certain stage of life is going to influence what he or she actually experiences.

355
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,360
We all know that if we're in a terrible mood, if something horrible just happened to us,

356
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,360
you can't see what someone else said.

357
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,360
But it's much more true in kids because they have so much less structure.

358
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,360
What about the reverse? I have a lot of people who have the opposite happen

359
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,360
where they're very upset about what happened to the kid in school.

360
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,360
You know, it wasn't fair what the teacher did.

361
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,360
And you and you the kid's vantage point, they don't care about it so much.

362
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,360
It wasn't so bad. I assume you have that where the parent is more anxious in a sense than even the child is.

363
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,360
Is that...

364
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,360
You could also argue though that as we get older we gain these structures.

365
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:32,360
And if anything, those structures render us adults to distorting incoming information.

366
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:40,360
Or at the very least, I don't think we're in some sense moving toward a steady state of objectivity.

367
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,360
So you could imagine, for example, the same people listening to the same speech,

368
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,360
but they have different political perspectives.

369
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,360
I'm pretty sure they will have different memories of the speech,

370
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,360
whereas if we took younger children who were less politically biased,

371
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,360
they would probably be more uniform.

372
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,360
So I don't think it's... you disagree. Go ahead.

373
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,360
I think you never get to a stage of objectivity. There's no such thing.

374
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,360
But I think kids are more limited because they have more limited minds.

375
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,360
Well, I'm saying the richness of our intellectual abilities can be seen as an advantage,

376
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:29,360
but it can also be a handicap because it leads us to assimilate, distort, and reconstruct in ways that a child will be incapable of.

377
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:39,360
So to that extent, I wouldn't celebrate adulthood for greater objectivity far from it.

378
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,360
Give me a child any time in terms of objectivity.

379
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,360
You probably know more about this than I do, about language,

380
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:55,360
but one... I had been in this very large interdisciplinary group that met every week in my office for about 20 years,

381
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,360
a group of people like this group talked about stuff like this, and there was a linguist there.

382
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:09,360
What they were telling me was that one of the reasons that children can learn language so much better than adults

383
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
is because their minds are different.

384
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,360
And kids are really into what's... where's Waldo, basically?

385
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Children are tuned into what doesn't fit, what's different,

386
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,360
brains are constantly preoccupied with regularities.

387
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,360
That's why they like to repeat things over and over and over again.

388
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,360
They're very tuned in to what's different, and they're more likely to be able to walk into a room

389
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:43,360
and notice that something's different, and I think that may have something to do with why they may be more accurate.

390
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,360
We've had so many experiences that our brains fill in things, that they haven't had those experiences,

391
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,360
so we're less accurate often, because our minds just fill in.

392
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,360
We scan the room and we don't pay that much attention, and if you know,

393
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,360
we might not see that your wife had a new haircut or whatever,

394
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,360
whereas a child will hone in on it because...

395
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,360
That's what Temple Grandon talks about autistic people and animals having their own.

396
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

397
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:23,360
I think that that's something to keep in mind as it's probably as much an individual difference as it is a developmental one.

398
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:30,360
There's actually a reasonably large body of literature on children's memory for the atypical action

399
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,360
or for something that's not long in a room or how to order as usual,

400
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:43,360
and they are quite able to detect those aberrant or those

401
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,360
those discrepant events and experiences.

402
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:52,360
So it may be that bringing up Temple is a very good example,

403
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:58,360
but it is probably as much an individual difference as it is a developmental one.

404
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:05,360
We might also be talking about discrepancies between cognitive protections and the interpretations

405
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,360
that I believe a daughter child needs at this time.

406
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,360
So can you repeat that?

407
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:21,360
I was just saying that perhaps we're talking about the difference between cognitive dimensions

408
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,360
and the emotional ones in terms of the child's perceptual abilities,

409
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,360
but what interpretations of the child bring to that base on their own?

410
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,360
So it's back to the story. Back to the story.

411
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,360
Yes, I did.

412
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:44,360
I think the problem is saying, just to your point where you say you preferred the child's interpretation

413
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,360
at the age of two of something.

414
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:57,360
The child's interpretation of something may have no relationship to the actual occurrence.

415
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,360
So when you say you will trust that more, I'm not sure.

416
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,360
I'm not sure.

417
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Of course I'm being slightly provocative, but just slightly.

418
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,360
But it does seem to me, I would still like to defend the point that we shouldn't assume

419
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:26,360
that there's a steady progress toward objectivity, even if we never meet it or get there.

420
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:35,360
I would say there may be a steady progress away from objectivity as we gradually erect these elaborate ideologies

421
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,360
and which through which we filter what people are telling us.

422
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,360
I think we see this.

423
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,360
When we're looking at those cultures, so as adults, when we're encountering situations

424
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,360
and from another culture, it's very hard for us to interpret it in the way that people

425
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
steeped in that culture will interpret it.

426
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,360
That's something we see all the same.

427
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,360
Even within slightly different cultures that speak nominally the same language,

428
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,360
you'll have the same expression will be undertaken to mean different things.

429
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,360
It's very hard to overcome that.

430
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,360
And so, consistent with what Paul's saying, children are less bound by that,

431
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:21,360
but they may not be able to make, they're probably missing an awful lot that adults are putting in different ways.

432
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,360
The reason they're missing an awful lot is they don't understand a lot.

433
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:31,360
Anyone who's studied cognitive development in children comes up with the same findings

434
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:37,360
that there's a steady change from a fantasy understanding of the world

435
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,360
where there's no cause and effect, there's no sense of time,

436
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,360
and the world revolves around me to beginning to understand that there's a difference between

437
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:53,360
wishing something is going to happen and having it happen, having a thought versus acting,

438
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
and fantasy.

439
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,360
No, I think what you see in cognitive development these days is

440
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,360
when you're looking at all the different individual pieces,

441
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,360
the evidence that all of those pieces are there, you can see that very, very early,

442
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:13,360
and children are quite precocious, but the hard thing is pulling them together into this narrative

443
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,360
from a much more complex situation, what are the different motives going on,

444
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,360
what are the different agents doing.

445
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,360
The different pieces are all there very early, that's my read of how funny.

446
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:29,360
What about the phenomenon that children will insist that something is true because they want it to be true,

447
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,360
and it can't be?

448
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,360
We don't consider kids who say that to be liars.

449
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:41,360
You can only lie if you know the difference between what's true and what isn't.

450
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,360
At that point, we say the child said something that isn't true,

451
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,360
or the child took something that didn't belong to him,

452
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,360
they have to be older before we can say the kid is a liar and a thief.

453
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:59,360
I don't quite know how to conceptualize this,

454
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,360
and I don't know how to sum up the results, but as Colin is saying,

455
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:09,360
all of the laboratory research, the empirical literature on infant development

456
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:15,360
is really quite of one voice that children have what will be referred to as,

457
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:21,360
or infants have what will be referred to as a very sophisticated understanding of causality.

458
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,360
In order for this to cause this to move,

459
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:31,360
they have to actually make contact with one another, and if this just comes and stops

460
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,360
and then this starts on its own, that's not a cause.

461
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:41,360
They have these understandings, Paul referred earlier to the perception of the helper

462
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:51,360
versus the hinderer in these elemental visual events that are staged for infants.

463
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,360
So there's something between that infant perception

464
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:03,360
and the child's declaration of how they're using those bits and pieces of information,

465
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,360
but the basic cognitive elements, the basic raw materials

466
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,360
are evident very early in infancy,

467
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,360
and whether it's the same together or the contextualization of them

468
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,360
in the real world complicated interactions that people have,

469
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,360
but I think it's based on the empirical literature,

470
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,360
I don't think it's the best characterization to say that it's lacking.

471
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,360
It's there in some form.

472
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,360
But what's your understanding about why it can't be used?

473
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,360
Until later.

474
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Colin?

475
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,360
That's the really hard thing.

476
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:48,360
There's a very clear contrast, so take famous findings

477
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,360
about children's difficulties in reasoning about false beliefs, for example.

478
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,360
It's very robust and very clear that even through age four,

479
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,360
you're going to have trouble with that.

480
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,360
And that's as true as it ever was.

481
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,360
What makes it all the more interesting is that now you can demonstrate that,

482
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,360
was it eight month old or twelve months?

483
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
It's all in the first year.

484
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,360
Late in the first year of life, you can show that there are key elements of that place

485
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,360
that doesn't change the fact that the four year olds are still as hapless as they ever were.

486
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,360
And so it's something about putting that into use, which, in more complex situations,

487
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,360
which is the real challenge.

488
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Well, I think that's true throughout development, it's not just in infancy.

489
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,360
I mean, you see teenagers, you can measure children's teenagers' reflective function,

490
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,360
and it's as high as adults.

491
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,360
They can't use it.

492
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Or they choose not to.

493
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:46,360
They choose not to, but they're, but, and it's considered to be somewhat related to brain connectivity,

494
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,360
because the brain doesn't mature until we're in our mid-twenties.

495
00:38:51,360 --> 00:39:00,360
And so having a capacity and being able to use it in the appropriate context is different.

496
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,360
And I think maybe that's a little bit like what you're talking about.

497
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
Absolutely.

498
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,360
And that's why kids need so much scaffolding, because the parent provides help with the context

499
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,360
of how and when to use whatever those skills are that they...

500
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:23,360
And being able to record that this is a situation where rule one applies, and then being able to execute rule one.

501
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,360
Both of those are important steps that kids aren't always taking.

502
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,360
In children's books, as long as there's been kind of an industry of children's books,

503
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,360
there's been a controversy with one side saying children should be exposed to the real world

504
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:42,360
and things that are like their life, and other side saying there should be fantasy and beautiful, wonderful things.

505
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:53,360
And there are these two arguments that don't ever have a meeting point, but I saw a quote that E.B. White,

506
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:59,360
who wrote, it was, I think, about when he wrote Stuart Little about Little Mouse,

507
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,360
who was born to human parents on 14th Street.

508
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:10,360
And he said something like little children jump over the fence that separates reality

509
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,360
from make-believe like little spring box.

510
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,360
He said the fence that will throw a librarian has nothing to jump over.

511
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,360
That's a great...

512
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,360
That's a great...

513
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:28,360
Well, I'm sympathetic with Stephen, though, because this in reality is what you see in kids.

514
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:33,360
And whatever the discrepancy is between the research and the actuality,

515
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,360
because this is really so much a part of what...

516
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Well, certainly analysts are teaching kids who have real troubles with this,

517
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:46,360
but obviously this is also the role of a parent is to help the child make those distinctions.

518
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:53,360
One of the things we talk about is the difference between hot cognition and cold cognition.

519
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:58,360
So hot cognition is in the moment when your sibling is stealing your toy

520
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,360
or you got caught with your hand in the cookie jar, you got caught lying, right?

521
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:10,360
And that we may be... we may reason differently in that kind of a hot situation

522
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,360
than we do in the laboratory, where everything else,

523
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,360
every other possible source of variance is taken out.

524
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,360
The room is draped in a black cloth so that the infant won't be turning her...

525
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,360
...over here looking at the stimulus, right?

526
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,360
The sound is controlled, everything is controlled.

527
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,360
So part of it is that embeddedness in this rich world in which we live

528
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,360
and the complications that arise when you're not the only actor,

529
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,360
when there are other actors and each one of them is contributing something.

530
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:49,360
And I think it makes it... that alone makes it more challenging to bring out those pure rules

531
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
or that reasoning.

532
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Right, so that in that way those types of experiments, they're like stories.

533
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,360
So stories strip away a lot of the irrelevant stuff.

534
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:07,360
What makes mystery movies hard is that they deliberately throw in lots of irrelevant stuff to throw you off.

535
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,360
And life is more like that.

536
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:19,360
And an experiment with a very young child, like a story is something that pulls out all the distracting stuff.

537
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,360
Can I ask a broader question?

538
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,360
The two psychiatrists, psychoanalysts.

539
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:32,360
So, I mean, if I look back over the last 20 or 30 years in developmental psychology

540
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,360
and to some extent developmental psycholinguistics,

541
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,360
you see an increasing acknowledgement, as we've been saying,

542
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:45,360
of the really competent... the competence of the infant,

543
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:50,360
whether it's with respect to the understanding of cause and effect or social relationships

544
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,360
or even good and evil.

545
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:59,360
And so the sort of classic picture of the child being ego-centric,

546
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,360
confused about fantasy and reality,

547
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:10,360
and only in the course of the preschool years, conquering that naivety.

548
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,360
I mean, I think we've moved away from that somewhat negative portrait.

549
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,360
Now, I think that there are all these complications about

550
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,360
how to reconcile child's behavior under these circumstances

551
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,360
with the child's behavior under these other circumstances.

552
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,360
But, okay, but nevertheless, there's been a pretty big revolution,

553
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:37,360
and we're much more dazzled by what young infants and preschoolers can do.

554
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,360
Are you saying to me that in psychoanalysts or in psychiatric theory,

555
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,360
nothing much has changed?

556
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,360
You still assume that there are these deep irrationalities,

557
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:55,360
these deep naiveties, these deep tendencies to deny reality.

558
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,360
Well, I would say this is back to the question of

559
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,360
why is there such a difference between what's found in basic research

560
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,360
and what we experience in real life.

561
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,360
And in clinical work, we deal with the kids the way they present themselves.

562
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,360
We don't have the opportunity to study their capacities.

563
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,360
So, for example, if there's a study that shows that teenagers have the same

564
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:21,360
reason as adults do, nobody would want to live in a world run by teenagers, right?

565
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,360
Because something else gets in the way.

566
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,360
I don't know if you're wrong by adults.

567
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,360
That's hard enough.

568
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:36,360
And it's an idealized version of adults because most adults don't function on that level either.

569
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,360
But there are other issues that gradually change, right?

570
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:49,360
The kind of self-centered falsiveness and fear of ones that characterize teenagers

571
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,360
softens and changes.

572
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:57,360
It might not change 100%, but it gets a little better as people get older and more tired, right?

573
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:04,360
So we also see in adolescents people committing themselves to all sorts of ideologies,

574
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,360
extreme political movements.

575
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,360
We don't see young children doing that.

576
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:14,360
Well, actually, I think psychoanalysis fortunately has embraced all of this science.

577
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:21,360
In fact, psychoanalysis, I mean, you know, the adenocesion is the best, one of the best examples of this.

578
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:29,360
And that psychoanalysis are embracing neuroscience, child development, all these factors.

579
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:42,360
In the environment of real parents, helping real kids, you discover that children have these

580
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:46,360
just really different ways of thinking about the world, and they need help with it.

581
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,360
They need support.

582
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,360
You know, when a child thinks, you know, the teacher hates them and that the teacher actually

583
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,360
really does hate them, if that's the child's experience.

584
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:00,360
That child actually really needs a supportive environment to help them see it differently.

585
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:05,360
Does it change the way in which you react to the children's needs?

586
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:11,360
So if there's a difference between the capacity not being there and the capacity needing some help

587
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:17,360
to make its way through all the other obstacles, does that have any impact on what you do to help the children?

588
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,360
Or does it in the end not make a difference?

589
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,360
That's a good question.

590
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,360
I haven't had their questions before, but I would hope it would.

591
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,360
I would hope it would.

592
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:33,360
I mean, you know, we now know that children are having this incredible capacity for empathy, even.

593
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:41,360
You know, we've something we didn't think about before, and so I do think it has influenced how we raise children.

594
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:49,360
If I understand that what the discussion is going in the direction of that, in a way we've been

595
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:57,360
underestimating how much kids, children, little children, infants, I don't know if the word is

596
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:07,360
understand or are capable of, or, but how much is different?

597
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,360
In other words, what's the other side of that?

598
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:16,360
Because obviously children are not the same, are not thinking the same at the age of two as they will at the age of 12.

599
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,360
So what is different?

600
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:25,360
What changes are the direction of towards adulthood?

601
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:33,360
We could all retire if we knew the answer to that, I think.

602
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:39,360
Certainly one of the things that's changing, and this is not to say that this is the only thing that's changing, right?

603
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,360
But one of the things that's changing is that children, with development, we become experts in more and more areas.

604
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,360
We learn more content.

605
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:55,360
And things that we can't underestimate, the extent to which children have, in some cases,

606
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:06,360
some very sophisticated looking reasoning abilities, but they have much less content over which to use and apply those reasoning abilities.

607
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,360
They have many fewer experiences.

608
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:14,360
They don't have the political indoctrination, and therefore they don't know the way the political beliefs hold together.

609
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:24,360
Politics maybe is way too old, but even the politics of the school yard, they have less understanding of relationships.

610
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:32,360
They have less content over which to apply some of these fundamental cognitive operations.

611
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:38,360
And as I said, that's certainly not the only thing that's changing, but it is one of the things that's changing.

612
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:49,360
And we do see that when children are experts in a domain, their reasoning looks more adult-like than when they are the novice in the domain.

613
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:58,360
And that's even when the adult may be the novice and the child is the expert, and what you'll see is in that particular domain,

614
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,360
that children actually can outperform the adults.

615
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,360
You take them out of that and they look just like a kid again.

616
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:14,360
Within that expertise, they're able to use some of these higher level, higher order cognitive processes.

617
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,360
The other thing is executive function.

618
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:27,360
I would imagine, would have to play some role in us, that you can have an ability, but if you can't control your impulses enough to be able to display that ability,

619
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:33,360
then I would assume that has some...

620
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:37,360
So I think maybe you're correcting a misconception of mine.

621
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:44,360
I took my grandson a number of years ago when he was around four years old on the subway.

622
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:49,360
And so we went to the subway and I said we are going to take...

623
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:55,360
And he couldn't figure out what's the difference between the subway and the express.

624
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:05,360
So if I understand you correctly, if I had prior to taking him there, explained to him that the subway is a train and it has one level, it's local,

625
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:13,360
and then you go down and it's an expresser, that if I had been assigned to him, he would have understood and would not have asked that question.

626
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:22,360
Whereas I thought he didn't yet have the ability to conceptualize the notion that a subway can be expressed or local.

627
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:26,360
I think that's a very good example.

628
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,360
And we could actually do that experiment.

629
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,360
That would be a easy experiment to do, but I think that's exactly right.

630
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:42,360
That we make a lot of assumptions about what other people in our world know, and most of the time we're pretty accurate about that.

631
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:49,360
And it's when we misunderstand what someone knows that communication becomes very challenging.

632
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:58,360
I find actually when I do things for little kids, and I also go to schools and I talk to them sometimes.

633
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:05,360
And my wife was a retired teacher, I mean she was a long time, not a retired teacher, but a teacher.

634
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:14,360
And she would help me out a lot of times if I was going to say this or have done something in a book or with kids.

635
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:19,360
And she'd say, well, you said this, but they thought that.

636
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,360
And it was the most difficult and interesting thing for me to learn what I wasn't thinking through,

637
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:31,360
what I was assuming that kids just didn't have the content knowledge to know about.

638
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:37,360
And that's sort of one of the most difficult things about, or specialized maybe things about being an adult dealing with children,

639
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:46,360
and just realizing what it is that you should know if they don't know, how they're going to misinterpret obvious things that you say in some creative way.

640
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,360
This sort of thing happens all the time.

641
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,360
So I can give just one example, this is something that happened at home yesterday.

642
00:51:53,360 --> 00:52:03,360
So when there are lots of verbs that talk about different things we do, and you know, you can hit the table,

643
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:08,360
or you can read a book, and you know, eat is also a transitive verb.

644
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,360
You can say, I ate, right?

645
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,360
But when you say I ate, it doesn't just mean you ate something, right?

646
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:20,360
It means you ate something appropriate to a mealtime, right?

647
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:28,360
So yesterday, my daughter who's 13 came home from playing with her friends, and my wife said, did you eat yet?

648
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,360
And she said, pretzels.

649
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:42,360
And I was very impressed with that, because what that showed is the understanding that to say yes to that would imply the declaration that she had eaten an appropriate to a meal,

650
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,360
and she recognized that pretzels wasn't.

651
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:50,360
And in that dialogue, you know, that showed the kind of sophistication that we normally take for granted,

652
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,360
but things like that are buried in everything we do.

653
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,360
That's a great example.

654
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,360
Did you ask her if she took a shower?

655
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:02,360
Two weeks ago.

656
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:15,360
And it also shows a sophisticated level of reflective thinking, because it implies that your wife understood what she meant by pretzel.

657
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,360
And that she knew her mother would understand.

658
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:27,360
So in that brief communication, they had an amazing amount of understanding of how the other person would perceive what they're doing.

659
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,360
And that's what makes things so hard for younger children.

660
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:35,360
So understanding literally what was expressed there wouldn't get you anywhere.

661
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:45,360
And a lot of the problem that you have with young children is they can, in some ways, they're very sophisticated in terms of what they know about what are possible things to say.

662
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:50,360
But all of the additional things that go into understanding the motives of what is said and what is not said,

663
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,360
that's the sort of thing where kids seem not to be that precocious.

664
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,360
And it's because of...

665
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,360
I think that helps some of this discrepancy.

666
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,360
They don't understand the motives.

667
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,360
There are a lot more literal or concrete.

668
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,360
That comes step by step.

669
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,360
There are different parts of it.

670
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:11,360
Again, you can show that some of those abilities are there if you put people in the kids in the appropriate setting.

671
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:16,360
But we do this all the time very quickly without even realizing what we're doing.

672
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,360
And that's where there's huge opportunities of misunderstanding.

673
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:30,360
So a related example of this, which is that from time to time when my children's friends have come over,

674
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,360
I've indulged chronic remarks.

675
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,360
Since you and I are English, we know we are tempted to do this from time to time.

676
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:45,360
And my younger sons turned to their friends and said,

677
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,360
don't worry, he's trying to be funny.

678
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,360
He's just trying to be ironic.

679
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,360
So, yes.

680
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,360
But the feeling is mutual.

681
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:57,360
I didn't know what the structure of this roundtable was going to be.

682
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,360
So I've been collecting children's jokes for the last few weeks in a very scientific way,

683
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,360
interrupting sessions and making it seem like it was part of the session to say,

684
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,360
what's your favorite joke?

685
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,360
And I made a long list of these.

686
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,360
Children at different ages.

687
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,360
And they're very different and they're very predictable at which ages certain things are very funny.

688
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,360
And they change over time.

689
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,360
I'm not going to tell any of them because none of them are funny to an adult.

690
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,360
But these kids...

691
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,360
Some of them are more youthful than I ask me.

692
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:31,360
Well, the idea that there could be a premise, that there's somebody named Ha-ha-ha,

693
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,360
standing next to his friend whose name is Oh, Shut Up.

694
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:40,360
And another friend saying, who cares, and the policeman just happens to interview them,

695
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,360
is not something that I would ever tell at a cocktail.

696
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,360
It's funny.

697
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:51,360
Yeah.

698
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,360
What about language?

699
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,360
Language.

700
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,360
What about it? It's very rich.

701
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,360
A lot of things happen very quickly.

702
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,360
Children have figured out, by the time they're 12 months of age,

703
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,360
they've figured out the sound system of their language.

704
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,360
They're very good at distinguishing languages.

705
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,360
They're acquiring a vocabulary.

706
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:21,360
By the time they're age three, they've figured out most of the world order properties of the language.

707
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,360
They have a vocabulary in the hundreds.

708
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:30,360
When they're age five, they're out performing technologies that Google and Apple have spent billions on.

709
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:39,360
And yet, putting that to use in complex, interactive situations, that's the thing that's hard.

710
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:53,360
So what we find, it's interesting quite often when you look at kids who are delayed,

711
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,360
the children's language development seems to be ahead of much of the rest of their cognitive development

712
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:05,360
in the sense that a lot of the things that count as cognitively sophisticated

713
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:10,360
develop later than things that count as linguistically sophisticated.

714
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:18,360
So you can look at some populations so rare, but very interesting cases,

715
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,360
the syndrome known as William's syndrome, right?

716
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:29,360
Which, for a long time, they were thought to be severely cognitively impaired and precocious.

717
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,360
It turns out that's not really true on closer inspection.

718
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:41,360
Really, their language is more or less consistent with the rest of their cognitive development in most respects.

719
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:50,360
It's just that language development is so accelerated that if you put it in the context of cognitive delay,

720
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,360
you still look linguistically quite good.

721
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:58,360
Although, going back to what you were saying earlier,

722
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:04,360
is it fair to say that even if the grammar and the semantics is rich and complicated,

723
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,360
the pragmatics takes a lot longer to be mastered?

724
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:14,360
I think that's the clear consensus on what things are right now.

725
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:20,360
The things which involve relatively formal routines, children have got that quite very well,

726
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:25,360
things involved in building a large vocabulary, things involved in building literal interpretations.

727
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:31,360
They're great, but the pragmatics which plays such a role in what we do most of the time,

728
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:37,360
that takes a long while because in order to learn the pragmatics, you need an awful lot of other things.

729
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:42,360
You can learn a lot about language without being that cognitively developed, but to get the rest of it,

730
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,360
you need the rest of the structure to be in place.

731
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:54,360
So, back to young babies again, I've been recently really impressed by some work,

732
00:58:54,360 --> 00:59:03,360
a lot of it going on again in New York, where there's an infant watching two adults,

733
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:08,360
or it could be two cartoon figures, but it iterates.

734
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:21,360
The infant sees this person, for example, showing a particular object in front of her,

735
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:32,360
and it might be out of reach, and this person then vocalizes,

736
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:40,360
and the child watches as the other person either responds appropriately by handing her the object she prefers,

737
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:45,360
or responds inappropriately by handing her, as it were, the wrong object.

738
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:54,360
But what's amazing about these studies is that these ten, eleven month old infants seem to grasp

739
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,360
how communication works, even at that age.

740
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:02,360
So, they don't necessarily have any words themselves.

741
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:07,360
It can be indeed a nonsense word that this speaker utters.

742
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:13,360
So, I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about the extent to which, so I guess my, but it this way,

743
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:21,360
in my working assumption for a long time, children gradually work out what communication is for,

744
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:27,360
insofar as they engage in it, they discover what a handy tool it is, so to speak.

745
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:33,360
But here we see these infants sitting back, being a spectator, a third party,

746
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:41,360
and yet grasping the cognitive consequences of the information the audience has received,

747
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,360
is it the language the local audience has received?

748
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:54,360
Right, yeah. So, I think this is another situation where we're seeing that when strips down to the bare minimum,

749
01:00:54,360 --> 01:01:01,360
there's a capacity that's there, so maybe it's even at the pragmatic level where kids are most delayed,

750
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,360
the ingredients of that are in place.

751
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:09,360
I think we need to be a little bit cautious about how we interpret some of these findings about the young babies

752
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:16,360
at age, because what is generally shown there is there is some degree of sensitivity in this carefully designed task,

753
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,360
so they're not behaving randomly, so there's something there.

754
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:26,360
The way that then gets presented is, kids can do this, and that's a little bit of an extension,

755
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:31,360
and then as we know from people who are dealing with kids in real situations, now kids really can't do it,

756
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:38,360
and they can't do it for much longer, so the main, even there, some of the things that they need are already in place,

757
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:44,360
but making effective use of those tools is such a knowledge-intensive task

758
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:49,360
that it's going to be very hard to do that in practical situations for a long while after.

759
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:59,360
And I think what we haven't got to in the science is so much working on how do we take those basic skills,

760
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:03,360
and then work towards scaling them up to other things.

761
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:10,360
A lot of the action has been in showing why our kids can do these amazing things, a lot of people have built careers on showing kids are geniuses,

762
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:17,360
and that there was a nice piece in the onion five or six years ago which headlined Newsflash Babies.

763
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:26,360
And it's very informative because, yes, we know that babies are limited, but there's, you're not going to get...

764
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:35,360
By the way, babies aren't very smart, but how do we go from these pieces of genius that they have

765
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:42,360
to putting that to use in practical situations, which is where we are now, and that's going to be a long-out job.

766
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:48,360
And one of the problems that we have is that we tend to be, at least in the scientific literature,

767
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:58,360
there are people who study infants, and there are people who study children, and that transition, you know, as the infant becomes a language user,

768
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:07,360
as the infant becomes able to direct her own action and to be to locomote independently, and all of those accomplishments,

769
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:13,360
we have a dearth of information on what happens in the second and third year of life, basically.

770
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:18,360
You have the infant studies where the baby will sit and watch, right?

771
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:25,360
And then you have the verbal studies where the child can actually be countered upon to listen to an instruction

772
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:31,360
and respond appropriately or not, right? But at least they can listen to the instruction and make a verbal response.

773
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:40,360
And there's that territory in between that is really still not well researched, and therein is going to lie some of the answer to this,

774
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:48,360
these paradoxes of this early competence and later lack of performance, essentially.

775
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,360
Can you ask about the nonverbal?

776
01:03:52,360 --> 01:04:03,360
I mean, the baby is mostly nonverbal, and so what influences do you think that plays on the development,

777
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:09,360
or how the infant is experiencing the world? Because I'm thinking about your example, and I'm thinking of, you know,

778
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:18,360
like all the nonverbal cues that would cue into what's going on in that situation.

779
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:25,360
The baby only has the nonverbal, but we go pretty far in our communication with people with nonverbal.

780
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:33,360
So I'm just wondering how much information can be gleaned in that kind of a situation from nonverbal versus verbal.

781
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:42,360
And one of the ways that people have come about that, attacking that very question is through comparative research,

782
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:50,360
where you ask whether Kapuchin monkey or whether a Reese's monkey or a chimpanzee or a dog.

783
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:57,360
Increasingly we're seeing the literature on dogs as comparative subjects,

784
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:06,360
and that's one of the favored ways that we go about addressing those questions, because there you don't have even that latent capacity

785
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:14,360
for language that you're considering. And some of these abilities, I don't actually don't know if the helper

786
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:18,360
hinderer has been done with a nonhuman primate. Do you know why?

787
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:30,360
I don't know if it's been done, but my guess is that people's family pets in some cases might be able to solve some of these problems

788
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:39,360
based on exactly some of that sensitivity to where people are looking. Dogs do joint reference,

789
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:50,360
where if I look at this and then look at you sharing that reference in people's pets, dogs, we'll solve that task.

790
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:59,360
And that's obviously critical for understanding these kinds of interpersonal situations of what the person wants or is trying to accomplish.

791
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:07,360
If you don't have that component ability of being able to understand that this is the object for both of us,

792
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:13,360
you're not going to be able to solve that problem. So I actually don't know what the comparative literature says,

793
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:20,360
but that's one way that we try to ask those questions.

794
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,360
Yeah.

795
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:28,360
So pursuing that theme then, the comparative evidence I think is certainly setting aside dogs,

796
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:36,360
since there are somewhat special cases, they've lived in human society and been selected within human society for

797
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:43,360
a long time. So if we take chimpanzees, I mean, one of the differences, I think, important differences between chimpanzees and human beings,

798
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,360
is that chimpanzees don't really...

799
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,360
Yeah.

800
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,360
Yeah.

801
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:59,360
And point, I mean, some sense you could argue that pointing is the very first stepping stone to some ordinary communication among human beings,

802
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:08,360
because, yeah, you can, as you were saying, use pointing to converge on the same object or to call some of his attention to something,

803
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:16,360
or even sometimes to ask a kind of question. I mean, you can point to something in an interrogative fashion.

804
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:21,360
I think it's the beginning of at least whether the baby has the capacity before pointing or not,

805
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:27,360
but at least the first demonstration that the baby shows us, that they have some...

806
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,360
Why?

807
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,360
Sorry, just the baby points.

808
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:36,360
The baby points, the mother points, but that they are each pointing about something that's in their mind.

809
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:43,360
They have an intention, they've seen something, and then they have an intention to share what they've seen.

810
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,360
I mean, that's my understanding.

811
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,360
This is the simplest story.

812
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,360
It's the simplest story.

813
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,360
Okay.

814
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,360
Yes.

815
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:52,360
It's organizing the experience that's around you and saying, okay, it's about this.

816
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,360
Yes, it's about this.

817
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,360
Right.

818
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:59,360
But I want you to pay attention to what the aboutness is for me.

819
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,360
I mean, I think that's the joint part.

820
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:09,360
So there's some fascinating work published recently on cross-cultural variation in pointing.

821
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:17,360
So they did a study in China, the Netherlands, and the Mayan community in South America.

822
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:29,360
All they did was to ask the adult to carry the toddler into a room with various interesting things, hanging to look at, so to speak.

823
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:38,360
And they looked at the frequency with which the infant pointed to these items, or indeed the caregiver, pointed to these items.

824
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:49,360
And the most active pointers were the Chinese caregivers, followed by the Dutch, followed by the Mayans.

825
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:58,360
So I don't know whether these were dedicated grandparents with one particular grandchild to focus on their attention on.

826
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:06,360
But at any rate, they were up and running, so to speak, earlier than the Dutch had done the Mayan group.

827
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:11,360
Does it correspond to any observable difference in how the children develop?

828
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:17,360
Well, it does. So there's good evidence that early pointers build their vocabulary more rapidly.

829
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,360
So there's a headline there.

830
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,360
Excuse me?

831
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,360
There's a headline there.

832
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,360
Yeah.

833
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,360
Point to your infant.

834
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,360
Oh, God.

835
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:29,360
The only vocabulary developer is up at a pointer.

836
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,360
Or that early vocabulary is a better pointer.

837
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:43,360
Although, so we'll know soon because a colleague of ours is carrying out an intervention study where she's encouraging mothers to point more on.

838
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:49,360
And so we'll see whether that has a knock-on effect with respect to later language development.

839
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,360
So, yeah.

840
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:56,360
So little books for very, very young children are often...

841
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:03,360
Wordless books are supposed to be for the youngest children, which just seems to be appropriate to this discussion.

842
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,360
You don't get wordless books for older people very much.

843
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,360
And yet, I mean, there is language in the stories they tell.

844
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:16,360
I mean, maybe these books are designed so that people will use language to read the books to children,

845
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,360
but they do go through them and find thing, thing, thing.

846
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:30,360
And also the very youngest board books that are made for children, they tend to discourage there being too much story in them.

847
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,360
And often they're just this thing, then this thing, then this thing.

848
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:44,360
Maybe the final thing has some ironic relation to the rest of them, probably so that the parent can have some relief for the end of this of these seven, eight things.

849
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:49,360
But I just thought maybe that's something to throw in there.

850
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,360
Yeah.

851
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,360
I can't children.

852
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,360
Do they tell the stories without the picture?

853
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,360
I mean, without words.

854
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,360
Without words, yeah.

855
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,360
That's what it's worth.

856
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:13,360
Although, if this research on spotting helpers and hinders is correct, the idea is that you could have a little figure pushing somebody up the mountain on one page and having a smart...

857
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:27,360
You know, a smile of the next page, and in some sense, the implication is the infant would be understanding it, and then you could have a villain who comes along and pushes them both back down again.

858
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:37,360
So anyway, it's possible that these publishers are underestimating the story comprehending capacities of one year olds.

859
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,360
I don't know.

860
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:43,360
We all understand facial expressions from very early, don't we?

861
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,360
Yes.

862
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:49,360
What we know is that babies differentiate facial expressions.

863
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:55,360
It's actually been very difficult to get evidence that they actually understand them.

864
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:05,360
So from a very young age, babies will look preferentially at a happy face, as opposed to a frowning face or an angry face.

865
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:13,360
But it's really not necessarily clear that they understand the implication behind that.

866
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:20,360
You're saying that it may be that it's likely that they don't or that we just can't figure out a way to talk to them so that they can explain it out of her.

867
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:27,360
We've been very clever about asking the questions, and I think we still don't know that they really understand the implications of those emotions.

868
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:37,360
Until they are about nine months of age, they're very, very clear that they're understanding a wary look on an adult's face or a happy smiling face.

869
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,360
They'll approach things, you know, a novel object.

870
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,360
If I smile at the baby, the baby will come and approach that.

871
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:54,360
If I do this and look very afraid, the baby will approach the object or across the room or this can also be done with other people.

872
01:12:54,360 --> 01:13:02,360
So if I make an angry face at you or something and there's a baby, then she will not befriend you.

873
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,360
But at nine months, it's very clear.

874
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,360
Earlier than that, it's much less clear.

875
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,360
But even this evidence is sort of black and white.

876
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:19,360
I mean, black and white in the sense that the baby thinks this is an approachable person or an approachable object, or let me stay away.

877
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:24,360
So it's not very differentiated, this emotional lexicon.

878
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,360
That's true, right.

879
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,360
Of course, there are some people who never learned to do that.

880
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,360
Well, that's true.

881
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,360
Right.

882
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:36,360
And that's, they're a clinical clinician and they don't recognize facial expressions, or they don't know how to interpret them.

883
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:40,360
And they don't know how to interpret them verbally how to figure it out.

884
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:48,360
So that raises an interesting question because if you look at a lot of emotion research in psychology,

885
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:52,360
it's been hung up on facial expressions, in my opinion, rather too narrowly.

886
01:13:52,360 --> 01:14:10,360
So I could imagine a person who did have that facial problem, so to speak, but nevertheless, setting the state had a pretty good conceptual understanding of what particular emotions were like, their consequences, and so on and so forth.

887
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,360
Or is that not the case?

888
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:19,360
That you have to have that decoding ability in order to build up the conceptual understanding, but it can't be used in real life.

889
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:28,360
And they have to be taught how to use it, which is something that you're going back to over and over again in this discussion that the capacities can be identified.

890
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:32,360
But then the question is, why aren't they put to use more naturally?

891
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,360
There are kids and adults who always get it wrong.

892
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,360
And it's a very dangerous thing.

893
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,360
If you don't know whether someone's angry at you or whether someone's cheating you.

894
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,360
Right.

895
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,360
Can they pick it up through other cues?

896
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,360
They have to be taught.

897
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,360
It doesn't come naturally.

898
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:53,360
But can they be taught to get it through faces?

899
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,360
People try to do it.

900
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,360
I don't know how successful it is.

901
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,360
Didn't these expressions appear on their faces?

902
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,360
They have facial expressions.

903
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,360
Yeah, so.

904
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,360
But they can't remember the association even on their own face.

905
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,360
No, it's a disability.

906
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,360
It's true of many autistic children.

907
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:17,360
Well, this is where the whole mirror neuron system kind of becomes relevant that we have the system matching.

908
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:23,360
We match the particularly facial expressions, but we match behaviors.

909
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:34,360
And the matching system happens right from birth pretty much where, you know, when the mother makes a kind of person of her lips,

910
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,360
the baby will match that.

911
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,360
And this expands and, you know, to facial expressions.

912
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,360
But what happens is our own body is connected to our whole body physiology.

913
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:55,360
So my facial expression is just the outward manifestation of some emotion I'm feeling unless I'm deceiving you.

914
01:15:55,360 --> 01:16:00,360
And so that body physiology is connected to that facial expression.

915
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:06,360
And the brain seems to be wired to match those facial expressions in others.

916
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:12,360
So theoretically, at least, you're having some physiologic inner experience when you have that facial expression.

917
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:21,360
And when my body matches that in you, it starts to activate my body physiology, and that's how you transmit to me in some way.

918
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:29,360
That you're having that feeling, and I know you're having that feeling, and it's the beginning of learning about the connection between the face and the body

919
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,360
and the emotion and the feeling.

920
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:38,360
And people with autism have some kind of impairments in their mirror neurons.

921
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,360
We lack some of that linkage.

922
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,360
And other disabilities.

923
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,360
And other disabilities.

924
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:48,360
It's not just autism, it's the clearest example of things.

925
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:55,360
When my first son was born being a developmental psychologist, he was in two minutes.

926
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,360
I tried a little experiment, which was to stick out my tongue.

927
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,360
And he thought about it.

928
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:08,360
But then he did stick out his tongue, but then I panicked because he wouldn't put his tongue back in again.

929
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:12,360
You've broken him.

930
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,360
Psychoanalysis would cure it eventually.

931
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,360
He eventually did, I may say.

932
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:24,360
But going back to your point, I'm not sure.

933
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:34,360
I would hesitate to say that we've always figured out the meaning of somebody's facial expression by resonating in some sense to it.

934
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:45,360
It seems to me we could also have, I mean, I would be tempted to say we would want to understand that somebody was angry without

935
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:53,360
not feeling some minimal anger ourselves or our selves or ditto for sadness or fears.

936
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,360
So here's actually here's some good evidence.

937
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,360
So we were talking about empathy a moment ago.

938
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:07,360
And you do see in the second year of life toddlers being quite empathic.

939
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:14,360
So if even a parent or a sibling is in distress, they will sometimes go over and pat and hug.

940
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:19,360
But you don't necessarily see them showing distress themselves.

941
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:28,360
It's as if they recognize what the distress is, but it doesn't require some kind of mirroring of the distress in order for them to behave appropriately.

942
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:43,360
I think the excitement about this notion of mirror neurons has in some ways been an impediment because I think one thing that is important is understanding connections between things you're seeing out in the world.

943
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,360
How that relates to things that you do.

944
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,360
That's obviously very, very important.

945
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:54,360
People went crazy with the idea that there were these little cells that solved the problem.

946
01:18:54,360 --> 01:19:02,360
And the message that I think we've got through all of this discussion is making all these connections much more complicated.

947
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:11,360
And putting the blame on just that there's some little tiny piece that suddenly solves that trivializes the problem, I think.

948
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:20,360
And probably stands in the way of figuring out all the complicated things you actually have to do to do this successfully.

949
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,360
It's the harder part.

950
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:28,360
I mean, the notion that you have things that are shared between speaking and understanding.

951
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,360
We've known about that for thousands of years.

952
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,360
That's called words.

953
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:36,360
A word is something which is the link between things you say and things you understand.

954
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:44,360
And what we're talking about in all these other domains is you need to understand the connection between things you experience and things you do.

955
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,360
And it's kind of hard.

956
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:49,360
And there's not a single piece solution.

957
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:55,360
If it's okay with you, I'll ask the audience for questions.

958
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:59,360
You have to get it.

959
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,360
I think I was allowed to.

960
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:06,360
No, it's not for the recording.

961
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:10,360
What we're recording.

962
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:19,360
It's going to turn out not to be worthy of having come up here to use the microphone.

963
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:25,360
So I'd better think of something really significant to say now that I'm standing here.

964
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:33,360
I've been a teacher for 52 years in the same school, so students have memories of me that go back more than half a century.

965
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:38,360
And I'm often stopped in the deli or on the subway by a student who will say to me,

966
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,360
I'll never forget the day that you.

967
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,360
And I stop them.

968
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:47,360
And I say, before you recall this memory to me, was I crazy that day?

969
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,360
Or did I say something significant?

970
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:54,360
Only once did the student say, I'll never forget the day that you stood me up in front of the class and embarrassed me.

971
01:20:54,360 --> 01:21:02,360
And that was a student of 52 years ago, and she'd been waiting 52 years to sit in the building.

972
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:06,360
Most of the other times, I've come out pretty good.

973
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:14,360
But I have occasion to speak to teachers, especially graduate students in schools of education, and I tell them,

974
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:20,360
you get a group of students in your room, they close the door, they let you along with them for 40 minutes,

975
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:24,360
and you are creating memories that can live a lifetime.

976
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:32,360
And you will forget those experiences, but you'll be amazed at how many times you will be reminded of something you said

977
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:37,360
or did that you've forgotten decades ago, but have lived on in the memory of somebody else.

978
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,360
Scary.

979
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:43,360
The other thing I want to say about the kid who goes home and says,

980
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,360
the teacher yelled at me and threw me out of the room.

981
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:51,360
When the teacher reprimanded that student in a mild voice and then just opened the door and said,

982
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,360
I think you'd better go out because you're disturbing the class.

983
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,360
Isn't it to the students, the child's advantage?

984
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:03,360
Not so much to remember the experience that way, but to relate it with that exaggeration, because it then

985
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:10,360
paints the picture of the student as an innocent victim of a crazy monster of a teacher

986
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:14,360
and takes the emphasis off what the kid did to,

987
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:18,360
I'm the victim of this brutal monster.

988
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:22,360
And since I have the microphone, there's one more thing I want to say.

989
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:28,360
You talk so much about amnesia, and I wonder if we're living through a different age now,

990
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:35,360
because every parent and grandparent has a cell phone, which is a high-quality video camera,

991
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:40,360
and is constantly recording every second of a child's.

992
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:45,360
In my day, I'm sure that there are so many people in this room of a certain age

993
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:51,360
who have very few snapshots of themselves as children, let alone videos,

994
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,360
and if the videos were on eight millimeter film, they were black and white and silent,

995
01:22:54,360 --> 01:23:02,360
but now everything is being recorded constantly, so more than at any time in the history of humanity.

996
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:06,360
So does that take the place of the need for memory?

997
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:15,360
Do you really have to remember anything if everything is recorded and instantly play backable?

998
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:21,360
And then when you see it years later, it's not so much that you remember being there and doing that

999
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:26,360
and saying that, as that you have concrete proof that it happened

1000
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:31,360
because you're watching the recording of it, so that's what I have to say.

1001
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:37,360
I actually thank you so much for that. I actually think that we are creating a society,

1002
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:43,360
probably a world of people who are going to have fewer memories for exactly this reason.

1003
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,360
It's going to be more and more difficult to be able to separate what is your memory,

1004
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:53,360
what is your internal recollection and your internal representation of that event,

1005
01:23:53,360 --> 01:24:00,360
relative to the thing that you saw in this disembodied, this little rectangle that you carry around.

1006
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:06,360
I actually think it's going to have, I think we're destroying our culture frankly with all this,

1007
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:10,360
but I think it's going to be more and more difficult to separate what is my memory

1008
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:14,360
from what is an external representation of that event.

1009
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:22,360
But when people started writing letters, couldn't there be a similar form of anxiety about the extent to which,

1010
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:32,360
you know, narrating some experience to your family members interfered with the pristine memory you had had before you started writing the letter?

1011
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,360
I think possibly the difference there is that that's your output.

1012
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:40,360
So when I'm writing a letter, I'm writing about my own internal representation

1013
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:45,360
as opposed to looking at something that is physically separate from me

1014
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,360
and then there are these actors in it and one of those actors is me.

1015
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:55,360
I think it's a different representation and therefore I think it will have different implications,

1016
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,360
but it's a great question.

1017
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:04,360
The opportunities to rewrite what happened are so great when you can photoshop.

1018
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:11,360
I don't remember exactly, but I remember hearing or reading about that anxiety when writing came into existence,

1019
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:17,360
that it would destroy, you know, you would memorize the entire odyssey

1020
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:23,360
and now you don't have to anymore and culture will crumble and maybe it did.

1021
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,360
But I do think that that was brought up.

1022
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:31,360
But I think memory has an important emotional function.

1023
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:35,360
You know, almost every parent who comes to me with a child who's having trouble

1024
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:39,360
says I never ever spoke that way to my parents.

1025
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,360
I'm not so sure they did.

1026
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:49,360
And I had occasion a few years ago to see some old home movies of my early childhood with my sisters,

1027
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:55,360
and I think the three of us would say that things that we saw in that film could never have happened.

1028
01:25:55,360 --> 01:26:01,360
I certainly never treated my sisters the way these fake movies show itself.

1029
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,360
Fantastic.

1030
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,360
That's great.

1031
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,360
Thank you very much.

1032
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:17,360
I'm getting back to early childhood education myself at a time where people my age would be retiring.

1033
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:24,360
So I've been struggling to try to figure out, you know, how an adult functions, you know, for a lifetime.

1034
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:28,360
Because I was taught to be infantilized, you know, that's the secret to success.

1035
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:35,360
But anyway, I'd just like to share first of all, I have a little video on YouTube called No Adults Left Behind.

1036
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:41,360
We're going to have five-year-olds who live on two hundred feet who talk about life with more understanding than adults.

1037
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,360
What makes you happy, say, why do people lie, cheat and fight?

1038
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:48,360
But the five-year-olds answered, you know, and I asked them, if you, what would your gift to the world be?

1039
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:52,360
Five-year-olds were able to say, my gift to the world, everybody should share.

1040
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:54,360
People should help each other, be friends, get along together.

1041
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:58,360
A little girl looked very sad. Everybody should stop fighting.

1042
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,360
So five-year-olds can manage to put it together as the emperor's new clothes.

1043
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:05,360
A child is the father of the man, things like that.

1044
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:09,360
Also creating my educational launch, it's called I-Openers and Mind-Openers

1045
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:14,360
to help kids with attention learning disabilities build their ability to focus and pay attention naturally

1046
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:17,360
by doing vision-based eye exercises.

1047
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:25,360
So this other thing, the developing brain, which is still new to, you know, the fathers of compulsory education and all of that.

1048
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:30,360
Like, for instance, Oliver Sacks, you know, in his book, Seeing Voices.

1049
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:34,360
It's all about children who are brought up. A lot of deaf parents have normal hearing children.

1050
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:41,360
But they learned sign language first, which is a more natural way, or ancestors learned sign language before we learned to talk.

1051
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:47,360
So when children have been developed, trained that way, he says, it's also laying down the neural pathways with which language

1052
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:55,360
it's syntax is based in your head, and four-year-olds are outperforming high school students in spatial relationship tests.

1053
01:27:55,360 --> 01:28:02,360
So it's the natural way the brain is put together, and then somebody, you know, like you know who Alice Miller is, right?

1054
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:09,360
She said, emotion attaches meaning to experience the drama of the gifted child. Without an emotion, nothing means anything.

1055
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:19,360
So hardly anything was saying that you cannot literally create any meaning or sense without adding emotion to the situation.

1056
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:26,360
And with the vision-based work that I'm doing, believe it or not, in a state of nature, how it brings evolve,

1057
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:34,360
you can't see without moving your eyes. A human brain is capable of being aware of seven streams of awareness simultaneously.

1058
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:40,360
Because ironically, when we read and write all the lives, we lock up our eyes on static letters, don't move our eyes,

1059
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:46,360
and we, like, dumb down our awareness by almost six to seven hundred percent.

1060
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:55,360
So seven, when you hear some of these things that we're talking about a seven-point awareness and that this focus on reading and running,

1061
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:01,360
because our end, you know, had no idea what the brain was capable of doing.

1062
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:07,360
I mean, they thought the brain was a place in your head where a sperm was stored.

1063
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,360
I mean, that's the father of enlightenment, how?

1064
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:18,360
But anyway, when you hear some of these things about human potentiality, this four-year-old's outperforming high school students,

1065
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:28,360
seven-point awareness, and maybe a responsibility that people like you, who know understanding,

1066
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:34,360
might have a certain responsibility to bring some of these ideas into compulsory, everyday education,

1067
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:38,360
besides STEM and STEAM and CORE, you know.

1068
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:44,360
Okay, but I'm just, when you hear these things about human potentiality, these greater awarenesses,

1069
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:50,360
I'm just curious, how do you respond, where the child is developing it and has it naturally,

1070
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:59,360
and so much of education is about how to eliminate it, because we're following, you know, a two hundred-year-old model of, okay, thank you.

1071
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:07,360
Well, I actually think we, I work with schools a lot, and I have to say, I think some of these ideas are really getting incorporated,

1072
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:13,360
into schools. Maybe not some of the struggling public schools so much, but there's a lot of private schools.

1073
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:24,360
Charter schools are popping up all over in Los Angeles, anyhow, and are incorporating that children have an enormous capacity for learning.

1074
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:32,360
If you let, if you follow their lead, if you let them learn what interests them, and the other thing that really seems to enhance learning

1075
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:40,360
is being able to actively participate in the learning process, so instead of just, I think some of this is even happening in the public schools in Los Angeles,

1076
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:49,360
instead of just teaching chemistry, the kids are really engaging in active learning, and so I think a lot of the ideas about what is enhancing learning for kids

1077
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:55,360
is actually being incorporated. I don't think we're as stuck as you are presenting it.

1078
01:30:55,360 --> 01:31:03,360
I think financial limitations are where keeping people stuck rather than any kind of philosophical or educational bias.

1079
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:11,360
There's maybe more than financial limitations which is, old farts are getting in the way as well because you can have children learn those things successfully

1080
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:19,360
and learn how to be effective learners, but then when people come along and say, well, tell me what, tell me which things you know,

1081
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:31,360
and finding that children who are effective learners, they're equipped to acquire new information effectively to discover new things throughout life.

1082
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:40,360
If they don't meet certain expectations that were established, like tests, like facts, right? Like things you can Google.

1083
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:43,360
Then they deem to be failing.

1084
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:49,360
Yeah.

1085
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:59,360
Hi. I'm making a movie about what parents ought to be doing for their kids right now to have them ready to respond to the world of tomorrow,

1086
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:06,360
particularly vis-a-vis climate change. And we sort of have taken as our premise that the world's going to be changing fast

1087
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:16,360
and that kids have to adapt to things that they can't necessarily see or observe in very sort of altruistic and synthetic and complicated ways

1088
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:25,360
involving working with other human beings. So my question to you guys would be, what do you think parents and grandparents are to be doing with their kids right now

1089
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:31,360
to help them develop those kinds of skills?

1090
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:37,360
What do you do with your kids to help them ready to get ready for the world of tomorrow, basically?

1091
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:52,360
If you could really know, depend on your ability to inculcate values and ideas that will last past data lessons and past the point where politics enters into them

1092
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:57,360
and everybody changes and becomes horrible as adults, that would be great maybe.

1093
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:10,360
I'm afraid of too much terrifying children with the destruction of the world to come and the fact that the idea that they would have any responsibility for it

1094
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:17,360
and that the idea that you should do something to fix it may be very nice, but part of that is the idea that if you don't do it,

1095
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:25,360
it won't get fixed and you're responsible for it. That's the element of this whole bringing.

1096
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:35,360
We must fix climate change to children. I think it's so much an issue for the adults who are in control of the world to fix,

1097
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:40,360
and that it's outside of the power of children to actually do something about it.

1098
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:49,360
And when you have them do small things that make them feel like they're doing something about it, that might be nice, but to me that doesn't really answer it.

1099
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:59,360
It's a really good question because I think the parent cares about whether it be what religion I'd like my child to have,

1100
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:05,360
or for me it was wanting my children to read, be good readers, and this is a value.

1101
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:09,360
I think the best thing for parents to do is be that way themselves.

1102
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:12,360
I don't think we can teach someone else what to believe.

1103
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:31,360
If you teach someone too much, what to believe. If you portray the belief yourself as an adult and show the values you have as a person in your actions and how you interact with the world,

1104
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:43,360
children are, they absorb and internalize a lot of these things. I think that's the best way rather than try to inculcate, be it yourself, be authentically that way yourself.

1105
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:46,360
I think they would do the most successful way.

1106
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:50,360
If there were adults to do these things that adults can do, it's not the best way.

1107
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:54,360
And the children are participating in that family.

1108
01:34:54,360 --> 01:35:04,360
If I could just ask you to bear with me one more second. You talked about hot cognition and cold cognition. Let's say you've inculcated these values, moral courage, standing up for things you believe in, working with other people, etc.

1109
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:12,360
Are there particular things that help people in moments of hot cognition keep their heads, particular psychological skills?

1110
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:20,360
Interesting. One of the ones that was, it's a great question, and one of the things that was alluded to earlier was executive function,

1111
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:28,360
which is this ability to stop and think, inhibit an action that you were maybe just going to reach out, right?

1112
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:33,360
And stopping and thinking about the consequences of your action and reflecting on that action.

1113
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:43,360
And although famously, adolescence is the period of time during which we quote, develop executive function, those skills are developing beginning in infancy,

1114
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:52,360
deferring gratification, right? Being able to wait a minute to get a bigger treat as opposed to taking a small treat immediately.

1115
01:35:52,360 --> 01:36:06,360
That's developing very early on, and that's a very powerful cognitive skill that applies in social situations, in cognitive situations, in school settings, in all kinds of interpersonal situations.

1116
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:14,360
And that ability is something that we can help children develop and appreciate, and to be more reflective.

1117
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:23,360
And that may be something that works even in these hot cognition domains, absolutely.

1118
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:32,360
Just going back to your comment, I think this is an area where I would like to stop and think.

1119
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:49,360
I say, part of me wants to say yes, you're right, that childhood is a kind of protected space, and the adults may have created for future generations shouldn't weigh too heavily upon them.

1120
01:36:49,360 --> 01:37:00,360
But part of me also wants to say that, you know, maybe we could sometimes underestimate children that way.

1121
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:06,360
You can educate their thinking about the long-term future, and indeed the deep past.

1122
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:14,360
We don't need to assume that they live, so to speak, in the here and now, all the time.

1123
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:17,360
I think we would underestimate them.

1124
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:23,360
But I'm torn, because I can see that it could be burdensome.

1125
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:33,360
But in some ways it could also be liberating if one were to give children the sense that, you know, we're part of a species.

1126
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,360
We put it this way.

1127
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:45,360
Children growing up in the United States will be exposed to a considerable amount of American history.

1128
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:49,360
And it's not a very comprehensive history at that.

1129
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:52,360
It's mostly a history of heroism.

1130
01:37:52,360 --> 01:38:04,360
Well, you could argue that a broader picture, both looking backwards and looking forwards, would actually be more valuable than that particular curriculum.

1131
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:15,360
So, anyway, all that to say, I have some sympathy with the idea that we might think about just how much we could expand the child's horizon temporally.

1132
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:18,360
I think a lot of that's already being done.

1133
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:29,360
I mean, if you, I don't think that American history now is just about heroism and about how we are always saving the world and better than everyone else.

1134
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,360
In the schools my kids have gone to.

1135
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:38,360
They're taught that when Columbus discovered America, it wasn't such a good thing for the people here.

1136
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,360
And there's a lot of discussion about that.

1137
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,360
And I think it's the same thing with climate change.

1138
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:46,360
You know, my father in the United States, the world wasn't a kid.

1139
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:49,360
He grew up in the 1930s, right?

1140
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,360
There have always been terrible problems.

1141
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:56,360
And we try to teach kids what they're ready to absorb.

1142
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:59,360
It has to be different at every stage of development.

1143
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:05,360
So I think the easiest thing is to live what you believe in and kids will pick up what they can.

1144
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:09,360
But every child is going to have to deal with sex sooner or later.

1145
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:13,360
And we don't teach them, we don't give sex education in kindergarten.

1146
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,360
And we don't wait until they're in high school.

1147
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:20,360
And they're taught at their own capacity to take in what they can take in.

1148
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:29,360
And I think it's whether it's sex or racism or the nuclear threat or how to do this.

1149
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,360
You know, kids have to learn at a certain age.

1150
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:38,360
The reason I say how to pay your taxes is because I had a kid come in and his chief complaint was he was something like seven or eight years old.

1151
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:41,360
And he didn't know how to drive a car or pay his taxes yet.

1152
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:48,360
And the idea that that can come later, that he shouldn't worry that he doesn't know how to do it now, was foreign to him.

1153
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:54,360
So I don't think we should be scaring kids with things that they are not ready to absorb.

1154
01:39:54,360 --> 01:40:00,360
But that doesn't mean we can't adjust what we talk about to where they are cognitively and emotional.

1155
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:10,360
I think the circle is back to the origins of our discussion about storytelling because it's in the storytelling of the childhood stories.

1156
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:18,360
That children gain a capacity for trial action and understanding the world.

1157
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:37,360
When you were talking about Stuart Little, I was thinking back to my encounter with it and how much it meant to me when I was a little boy that he was this little mouse who couldn't be like a big adult and yet was able eventually to go out into the world in his toy car.

1158
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:46,360
And this is what stories for children help them come to a future.

1159
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:56,360
So I don't know that we necessarily have to be doctrinaire about the kinds of stories, but if we tell enough stories, it covers a lot of ground in anticipation of the stories.

1160
01:40:56,360 --> 01:41:13,360
Whether you try to tell them or not, they will form, everything can become a story.

1161
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:29,360
When you were talking about stories without words, the cartoons without words, I think probably most of you know this very beautiful wordless video for very young children called the snowman that a child of one and a half can already fully appreciate.

1162
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:46,360
And the other thing is the historical thing about reading and writing and worries about memory. Of course, people were worried about it and rightfully worried. I mean, I think it's been shown, or at least I've read, that in non-literate cultures, people do have much better memories.

1163
01:41:46,360 --> 01:42:00,360
Anyway, my question is really to you about amnesia. Some of you talked about amnesia in the first two years of life and it could be even longer. But is it full amnesia?

1164
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:06,360
Are you talking about event memory or representational memory or are you talking about emotional memory?

1165
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:20,360
Well, that's a very interesting question because we don't have amnesia for everything in the first years of our lives. We learn to talk, we learn to walk, we learn to recognize our caregivers.

1166
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:37,360
We remember a great deal from the early years of life. What characterizes the prototypical case of childhood amnesia or infantile amnesia is that we do not have any memories of ourselves of personally relevant or significant events.

1167
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:54,360
And the way it's been defined in the literature is unfortunate in many respects because the question will be an event that happened at one time in one place that you can absolutely identify the age at which that event occurred.

1168
01:42:54,360 --> 01:43:10,360
And of course, for most of us, our lives are repetitive. We don't have singular events, unique events every day. And in fact, a lot of us, if we reflect on our autobiographies, who we are, what made us, who we are.

1169
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:32,360
It's those Sunday dinner at grandmas, right? Every summer, my family took a vacation. It's not the one-time event. It's the fabric of our lives are these repeated events with the same people over and over.

1170
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:45,360
I actually think autobiographical memories of this kind of odd man out, but yet that's where a lot of the literature has focused. And when we talk about childhood amnesia, that's really what people are talking about.

1171
01:43:45,360 --> 01:44:04,360
One thing that comes to mind is I witnessed this once a child who was separated from a nanny at the age of one after a very long lapse of time when the nanny returned, not only recognized the nanny, but pushed his mother away to be with a nanny.

1172
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:15,360
So that's a very strong emotional memory, and that was formed by the age of one. Right? It's interesting that this childhood amnesia is very, very well documented phenomenon.

1173
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:24,360
In an audience of this size, we absolutely would replicate the finding that the average age of earliest memory is between three and four.

1174
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:38,360
What we would also replicate is that at least one person would have an event from at least the second year of life, and at least one person would say, my ear is not until I'm eight or nine years old.

1175
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:48,360
So we have this enormous individual difference, and I think it's one of the few areas in which we have such a pronounced individual difference.

1176
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:54,360
Is it related to the age at which language, you know, which language develops?

1177
01:44:54,360 --> 01:45:06,360
You know, thus far not proven to be the case, and I think that's because language always, if you're typically developing child language develops between one and three years of age.

1178
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:12,360
So there's not enough variability. It is related to a lot of interesting things. It's related to birth status.

1179
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:21,360
Individuals who were first born tend to have earliest memories. Women tend to have memories from earlier in life than men is another.

1180
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:27,360
Cultural differences. Western cultures, we tend to have memories from earlier in life than Eastern cultures.

1181
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:32,360
So they're all kinds of really interesting individual differences.

1182
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:38,360
I have a daughter who, my daughter was started speaking with a little bit of an impediment, and you couldn't understand anything she says.

1183
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:42,360
She says she remembers this, trying to communicate.

1184
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:47,360
It's so interesting. It was obviously something that happened more than once, right?

1185
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:52,360
You know, that was an ongoing event, ongoing struggle for her.

1186
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:54,360
Yeah, that's really interesting.

1187
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,360
It wasn't, it was language, but it wasn't our language.

1188
01:45:56,360 --> 01:46:00,360
But it's not your language. Yeah, that's really interesting.

1189
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:09,360
You've given me a lot of ideas, a lot of questions, including what is memory, which you asked, and then you left, it's like, what is memory?

1190
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:14,360
Thank you for mentioning this, the alumni research.

1191
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:20,360
My mom got a birthday card. It was eight panels. There's a little baby girl on a birthday hat.

1192
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:23,360
The next one, she's a little girl in a birthday hat.

1193
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:29,360
Then she's a teenager in a birthday hat. She's a young adult in a birthday hat, and an adult in a birthday hat.

1194
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:33,360
She's a woman in a birthday hat. She's a senior. Then she's old.

1195
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:37,360
And the last panel says, well, that sucked.

1196
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:46,360
You made me think that there might be a reason to make wordless stories for adults.

1197
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:52,360
Thank you. And just, this panel, it just reminded me of a lot of things.

1198
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:55,360
I can't say that I remember anything you said.

1199
01:46:55,360 --> 01:47:01,360
I'm thinking about my own memory. If I call home and somebody else, I'll say, well, this one had rosy cheeks.

1200
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:06,360
He talked about Stuart Little. This guy didn't tell us the joke. He didn't tell us the other jokes.

1201
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:10,360
She had a scarf. He had a warm voice. He's the illustrator.

1202
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:12,360
It's all being videoed. You'll be fine.

1203
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:15,360
You don't have to remember it.

1204
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,360
I'm just talking about the limits of my own memory.

1205
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:24,360
I'm staring at this orange chair. I'm going to close my eyes. I don't have any orange chair in my mind.

1206
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:29,360
And maybe you do. You're an illustrator. It just makes me wonder what memories are.

1207
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:35,360
When you talk about the stories that people tell, I think that they do preserve our lives.

1208
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:39,360
But I also think they pick our lives. People tell the stories in the same way.

1209
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:44,360
And maybe it happened differently, or there's some other part of it that you didn't see.

1210
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:48,360
And then you keep hearing the story the same way.

1211
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:53,360
And I think it might obliterate some of the truth of what happened.

1212
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:58,360
And so when kids are telling, when kids are closing their eyes,

1213
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:02,360
or when kids are remembering things, or when kids are thinking things,

1214
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:06,360
that's tremendously exciting. And I don't spend a lot of time around kids.

1215
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:12,360
But what I know about kids is that their minds are near adult minds a lot.

1216
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:15,360
It's not that the kids just have their life.

1217
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:22,360
And I wish that as a kid, other people, I think you said,

1218
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:26,360
to take advantage of the way a kid thinks, and the way a kid's mind works,

1219
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:32,360
rather than trying to make it work a different way to be in school.

1220
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:36,360
I would have said, if I had been in school and anybody had been trying to teach me something,

1221
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:39,360
and I've been able to sit on a bouncy ball and learn it,

1222
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:43,360
that I could have learned it better because I am.

1223
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:51,360
Or with music, or with dancing, or with play acting, or improvisation.

1224
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:57,360
And I just hope that there are opportunities for, you know,

1225
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:07,360
we're not just studying kids' minds, but they were open to the magnificence of what's possible,

1226
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:16,360
and not just trying to train it up to be something smaller and more uniform.

1227
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:18,360
Thank you.

1228
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:23,360
Thank you. I love the little description that stories can pickle people's lives.

1229
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:24,360
Yes.

1230
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:25,360
It's great.

1231
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,360
Hi.

1232
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:30,360
So I have to, what I hope to be, concise questions for you.

1233
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:37,360
The first question is in terms of amnesia of autobiographical memory,

1234
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:41,360
is there any evidence that that manifests in dreams?

1235
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:42,360
In dreams.

1236
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:49,360
I personally just find that sometimes I have dreams of, you know, sort of, you know,

1237
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:59,360
what I could see very conceivably, you know, being in the body of an infant,

1238
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:03,360
and, you know, and sort of operating paradigm.

1239
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:06,360
And so that's question number one.

1240
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:11,360
And question number two is in terms of, you were talking about the internal

1241
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,360
expression, you were talking about the interpretation of facial expression,

1242
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:17,360
and I wonder about the other side of that.

1243
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:24,360
Is there any research in, you know, it essentially does a deficiency in the ability

1244
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:31,360
to make facial expression exist, and if not, if that's considered to be sort of an innately

1245
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:36,360
human thing, then what are the implications for that, for communication,

1246
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:38,360
for the development of communication?

1247
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:39,360
Yeah.

1248
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,360
I don't know.

1249
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:45,360
I don't know if our experts are here.

1250
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:54,360
Well, in terms of amnesia, I mean, I'm thinking that, you know, what Pat already,

1251
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:59,360
Patricia already said was that we do retain certain aspects of memory.

1252
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:07,360
It may not be specific events in time, but it could be things like just your sense

1253
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:08,360
of your body.

1254
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:13,360
And I could imagine something like that, that you could retain something like that.

1255
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:20,360
So I think, and if they're in the dreams, how are we?

1256
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:25,360
You know, that's, that's my, you know, the, I think dreams are very, very significant,

1257
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:30,360
but I think of them more in terms of being what it means to you about the dream

1258
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:37,360
rather than it being a representation or replica of something that literally happened.

1259
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:43,360
So my question is sort of the distinction between being able to sort of call upon

1260
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:50,360
at will narrative of something that's happened as opposed to having that be embedded sort

1261
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:56,360
of implicitly in the subconscious in a way that would manifest in a dream, but not in real life.

1262
01:51:56,360 --> 01:52:02,360
I actually think that is what this, what Patricia was trying to distinguish between this

1263
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:08,360
exotic, explicit kind of memory versus more implicit forms of memory that have more to do

1264
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:12,360
with emotion and behavior and nonverbal experience.

1265
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:16,360
I'd also say a dream is, is just a thought you have when you're asleep.

1266
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:22,360
And it's, it's not, you know, people throughout history, starting certainly with the Bible

1267
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:29,360
and Joseph, have liked to believe that, that dreams are special communications.

1268
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:34,360
And what makes dreams different from ordinary daydreams or thoughts that you have or fantasies

1269
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:37,360
that you have is that you're asleep when you have them.

1270
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:41,360
So the kind of thinking that you do when you're asleep is different from the kind of thinking

1271
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:46,360
you do when you're awake. It's more visual. Things don't always make sense.

1272
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:52,360
Things happen that aren't real. And all of those things can happen in a daydream too,

1273
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:55,360
but you're pretty clear that that's going on while you're doing it.

1274
01:52:55,360 --> 01:53:00,360
So I think we have no way of knowing if you dream something in which you're imagining

1275
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:05,360
yourself as a child, whether that's because that's a real memory of when you were a child,

1276
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:13,360
or whether you're having a fantasy of what I wish my childhood had been like or,

1277
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:17,360
thank God my childhood wasn't like what I'm just thinking about right now.

1278
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:23,360
I mean, dreams have motives to them, but I don't think we should ever assume that we know in advance

1279
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:28,360
what the mechanism is. Any more than we would, you know, if you're just sitting by yourself

1280
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:35,360
bored and having a daydream, it doesn't necessarily, you don't know where it comes from, just by that.

1281
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:38,360
Did that answer both of your questions?

1282
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:45,360
My second question was about does a deficiency in the formation of facial expressions exist

1283
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:48,360
and if it doesn't, it does.

1284
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:52,360
I think so. There's a condition, a condition.

1285
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:56,360
I mean, everything's on a spectrum. Like Patricia was saying, everything's on a bell-shaped curve.

1286
01:53:56,360 --> 01:54:04,360
Normal is, you know, a wide range. But yes, I think there are people who are not as much in tune

1287
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:12,360
with their emotional life, and I think it's reflected in they have less affective expression

1288
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:18,360
in their faces, yes. I think there are people like that. I think I've seen them.

1289
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:26,360
And just that then manifest and also sort of mirror-neuron problems, like, you know, they cannot manifest

1290
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:31,360
expressions to mirror other people, therefore they have, you know, less of a conception of what others are.

1291
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:36,360
I don't think anyone has actually studied that, but one of the, you know,

1292
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:43,360
we're, a lot of what we have to understand about ourselves as people is the impact we have on other people.

1293
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:49,360
So if someone is not expressing very much, they're going to have a different impact on someone else

1294
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:56,360
than if they're very expressive. And unless they know that, life will be very confusing.

1295
01:54:56,360 --> 01:55:02,360
And so, whereas someone who's very expressive, like me, you know, has a different impact,

1296
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:07,360
and sometimes it's a little too much for people, and I have to, you know, contain myself.

1297
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:13,360
And so I have to know about that impact. And so it's just the range, and I think it's...

1298
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:23,360
But I'm nervous about assuming that somebody who is not so expressive lacks some inner emotional life.

1299
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:26,360
I mean, the British are worried about that.

1300
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:27,360
Yeah.

1301
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,360
There you go.

1302
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:36,360
I say that. I say that. I see people who are not in touch, are maybe less expressive on their face.

1303
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:39,360
I think they demonstrate, not always. I mean, they have different...

1304
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:40,360
No, but I'm entertaining.

1305
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:43,360
She asked if there's a category of people, and I think there is a category.

1306
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:45,360
I mean, that is a broad generalization.

1307
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:51,360
Yeah, but I'm just entertaining the thought that there could be a certain type of person who's deeply in touch

1308
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:56,360
with their emotional life, but for whatever reason, masks it.

1309
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:57,360
They've been... Yes.

1310
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,360
So much irony.

1311
01:55:58,360 --> 01:55:59,360
Well...

1312
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,360
Yes.

1313
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:04,360
Well, I think, you know, one of the things that I understand about children is,

1314
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:09,360
and that is unique to the human species unlike other animals, is we are raised to...

1315
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:16,360
...with the social, cultural norms of the society we're raised in,

1316
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:22,360
which means you can take a child born in Russia, you know, carry them to...

1317
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:31,360
You know, Patagonia, and they're going to do just fine, because the way of life is something you learn from the adults around you.

1318
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:39,360
And so, if you grew up in Britain, you're perfectly well socialized to behave in a particular way

1319
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:44,360
that to a New Yorker would seem, you know, cold.

1320
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:46,360
Right, but it isn't. You said it.

1321
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:54,360
My husband's from Iowa, and I'm from New York, and I live in Los Angeles,

1322
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:57,360
and when he first came to New York, he said,

1323
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:01,360
Oh, now I get it. Everyone yells at each other.

1324
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:04,360
He thought it was just me.

1325
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:08,360
But there's something of an emotional two-way street, isn't there?

1326
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:14,360
If you spend your day smiling, just the fact that your smile muscles are turned on does have...

1327
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:18,360
...I mean, from what I've read, not that I do it, but, you know...

1328
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:24,360
So I presume that if your muscles don't work and your face won't express,

1329
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:30,360
maybe you would have a harder time emotionally feeling the things that you would otherwise.

1330
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:31,360
But...

1331
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:32,360
Okay.

1332
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:38,360
Two observations from the talk that I wonder if you guys would comment on.

1333
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:44,360
The first is essentially, I guess you've been talking about declarative memory,

1334
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:49,360
and have not really been that explicit about that during the discussion.

1335
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:50,360
Okay, okay.

1336
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:54,360
And declarative memory is about conscious recollection,

1337
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:58,360
as opposed to all the other kinds of memory which have been kind of mixed in,

1338
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:03,360
having to do with skill, acquisition, stuff like that, which is not necessarily conscious.

1339
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:11,360
And consciousness is very selective, you know, so for the most part, consciousness serves...

1340
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:19,360
...in terms of expectation, and when we see situations which are beyond our expectation,

1341
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:24,360
we switch from our habit system to a more conscious system,

1342
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:31,360
because we're attempting to adjust our model to these surprising circumstances

1343
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:36,360
and update our model and integrate this new experience.

1344
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:39,360
So I wonder if maybe you guys could comment on that.

1345
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:46,360
The other issue was the thing about hot and cold cognition.

1346
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:54,360
And so there were some interesting discussions about how adolescents don't switch that on.

1347
01:58:54,360 --> 01:59:01,360
And so, you know, I always recall this 12-year-old that sat next to me in a bus,

1348
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:04,360
and she said, excuse me sir, this seat is not taken.

1349
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:08,360
And she spoke to me like an adult.

1350
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:11,360
And I just had to ask her a whole bunch of questions.

1351
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:17,360
And she lived in a cattle ranch in Northern California, where she had learned to ride when she was seven,

1352
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:22,360
and she had her own horses. Her father took her out hunting.

1353
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:26,360
She learned how to shoot a gun by the age of nine. She was a sharpshooter.

1354
01:59:26,360 --> 01:59:30,360
And she told me about one time when she had to stay in the woods,

1355
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:34,360
because a cougar was circling around, and she climbed a tree and fell asleep.

1356
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:40,360
And what I'm trying to say is that, you know, there hasn't been much of a discussion of other cultures.

1357
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:45,360
And other cultures have a lot of demands.

1358
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:52,360
And when we were, you know, a couple hundred years ago, you know, by the time you were 12 or 14,

1359
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:55,360
you had a lot of expectations put on you.

1360
01:59:55,360 --> 02:00:00,360
And your brain had done that flip from being mostly, you know,

1361
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:08,360
reflexive and imitative to starting to be more prefrontal and being able to, you know,

1362
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:12,360
adjust to those expectations and demands.

1363
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:20,360
So cultural issues as well as biological issues work together in turning those systems on.

1364
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:23,360
And I wonder if you might comment on those things.

1365
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:28,360
That's a great observation, of course. You know, those of us who study brain development,

1366
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:32,360
we often, we do it from a brain-centric perspective, right?

1367
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:36,360
We talk about the impact of brain development on behavior.

1368
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:42,360
But of course, the environment and behavior impact brain development.

1369
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:46,360
So your observation about, you know, over evolutionary time,

1370
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:55,360
it's entirely likely that we have somewhat slowed down the development of the maturation and the development of the prefrontal cortex,

1371
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:58,360
because we aren't making those demands on our adolescence.

1372
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:01,360
We have this extended period of adolescence.

1373
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:04,360
So it's not a, you know, it's not a coincidence.

1374
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:08,360
But it does work both ways, and you're absolutely right to point that out.

1375
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:12,360
That we can't just talk about brain development and its impact on behavior.

1376
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:18,360
We also have to think about the demands and the situations in which the individual and the culture, right,

1377
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:24,360
places the individuals, and that does impact the extent to which, or the speed at which,

1378
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:28,360
and the extent to which we are seeing development.

1379
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:31,360
So that's an excellent observation.

1380
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:36,360
The issue of declarative, or the explicit conscious memory,

1381
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:38,360
that's what we can bring into the laboratory.

1382
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:46,360
That's what we can bring into the session, except through other probing techniques that you can study.

1383
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:52,360
But certainly from the standpoint of laboratory science, that's the focus.

1384
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:55,360
And when we think about autobiographical or personal memories,

1385
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:59,360
we find in terms of these consciously accessible memories.

1386
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:07,360
So the category is limited to that 5% of our lives that we spent being consciously aware.

1387
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:11,360
Most of our behavior is determined outside of our awareness.

1388
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:14,360
So they're both very good observations.

1389
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:19,360
Though for people in my world, almost everything we're studying is things that people are not consciously aware of.

1390
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:22,360
So you use language all the time, you're not conscious how you're doing it.

1391
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:27,360
And it's almost, declarative is the last thing we deal with.

1392
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:32,360
Okay, well, one more.

1393
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:37,360
On two things that I recall reading somewhere.

1394
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:44,360
One was something in one of the Malcolm Gladwell books about, I think a fellow by the name of Erickson,

1395
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:53,360
who had categorized all the muscles in the face to talk about their, what they were thinking emotionally.

1396
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:59,360
And in fact, I remember one thing that he said in there was when I think Erickson,

1397
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:05,360
or whoever it was, was watching the Democratic Convention and he saw Clinton and he said,

1398
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:09,360
PEC's bad boy, just from the muscular expressions.

1399
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:11,360
So I wonder if you could comment about that.

1400
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:15,360
And secondly, something I remember reading a long time ago,

1401
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:22,360
sometimes where we can't articulate a feeling, it might be something that we absorbed as an infant

1402
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:28,360
where we couldn't speak, but yet we still had that feeling.

1403
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:30,360
So either I'd like to hear.

1404
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:36,360
Eckert is the, is the, Eckman, thank you, Eckman, Paul Eckman.

1405
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:41,360
There we go, that's right, locally stupid units, right?

1406
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:51,360
We managed, Paul Eckman, it is an exquisite categorization scheme that is 277 points, I think, on the face.

1407
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:57,360
I don't know the scheme, so I've never labored to learn it, but absolutely where you can characterize

1408
02:03:57,360 --> 02:04:02,360
every muscle in the face and those that are associated with positive expressions,

1409
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:05,360
negative expressions, and the like.

1410
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:08,360
So, and I won't comment about Clinton.

1411
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:13,360
He does, I mean, just a cautious word about Eckman.

1412
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:20,360
He's, in part, sold this research as a way of analyzing the extent to which people are misleading you.

1413
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:27,360
And so the security agencies in the United States, for example, have funded quite a lot of his research

1414
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:33,360
on the grounds that it will help them figure out who is telling the truth and who is lying.

1415
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:42,360
And I think a psychologist, experimental psychologist, would be much more nervous about the claim that he tends to make,

1416
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:46,360
which is that he can distinguish truth tellers from liars.

1417
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:55,360
It turns out to be very difficult, he claims a certain success, but anyway, I just want to insert a question mark there.

1418
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:57,360
Into that, yeah, absolutely.

1419
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:58,360
Our last question.

1420
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:05,360
My question is about like the stories that children are told, like, and especially like fairy tales.

1421
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:13,360
I mean, it seems to me that like, you know, the Walt Disney version of say Snow White or Cinderella

1422
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:23,360
is very different from like the Grimm's fairy tales, you know, and how that kind of affects.

1423
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:31,360
Even like in the story of like Cinderella, well now you have like a more feminist kind of perspective

1424
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:39,360
on what like, you know, sits in the well or Snow White is, so how kind of cultural evolves.

1425
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:44,360
I guess I should respond to this.

1426
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:54,360
Well, for one thing, a very pragmatic thing is the Walt Disney movies take what, forty-five minutes or an hour and a half or something,

1427
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:58,360
and a fairy tale you read in five minutes.

1428
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:07,360
So they add a lot of things, but clearly there's a lot of values being looked at and thought about and taught

1429
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:13,360
and commercial values, especially I think in the case of Hollywood studios.

1430
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:24,360
So the fairy tales are not necessarily really the ways to plumb the depths of the social mind

1431
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:31,360
that the Grimm's brothers and the other claimed because there's a lot of actual literary content to those

1432
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:38,360
by, you know, by artists, writers who are writing things, but it's a matter of different values basically.

1433
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:45,360
I prefer the Grimm's and a lot of people prefer.

1434
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:52,360
I was under the impression that those fairy tales were not necessarily specifically for children when they were originally.

1435
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:54,360
No, they were collect.

1436
02:06:54,360 --> 02:07:05,360
And I sort of believe it is that the Grimm brothers were involved in the program to collect stories that would define the German nationality

1437
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:12,360
and create a German culture that didn't really exist as one thing, and that was what they were also linguists

1438
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:15,360
creating a German addiction area of etymology.

1439
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:20,360
So this was kind of the same thing in terms of stories, and that was what they were doing.

1440
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:28,360
But as soon as it came out in 1815, they published their first collection, and people all over the place bought it and gave it to their children.

1441
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:33,360
And they had to go back and sort of rewrite their preface.

1442
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:39,360
Things changed. They started changing the way they told the stories, and even they as they went on through the years

1443
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:46,360
reviewing and making different editions, they changed the stories to make them, in their case, they made them more appropriate for children

1444
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:53,360
as they saw it because they got more vicious, and the punishments were worse, and simpler in the morality that they were telling.

1445
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:59,360
Because there were a lot of things in the first edition that were very morally weird and funny and great in a ways,

1446
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:05,360
because they got them in some cases straight from the storytellers who were having a good time.

1447
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:18,360
So, okay, well, please join me in thanking our participants for providing such a fascinating discussion today.

1448
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:39,360
It was a great note.

1449
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:52,360
You hear a low noise or a white?

1450
02:08:52,360 --> 02:09:09,360
No.

1451
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:28,360
No.
