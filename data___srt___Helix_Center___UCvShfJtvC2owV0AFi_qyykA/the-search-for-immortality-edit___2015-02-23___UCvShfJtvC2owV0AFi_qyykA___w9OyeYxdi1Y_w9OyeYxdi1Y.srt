1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They seem quite eager.

2
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But the advent of the mean of the very eager,

3
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the planet could be made for.

4
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And we'd have to really do that and look at the mean of it.

5
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Look, I'm going to make a new image,

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I need going to change.

7
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay.

8
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hi.

dialogue between two meditative and contemplative practices,

71

Vermont and now without further ado.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I can't move.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Can you turn the recognition off?

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll start and provoke by saying, my opinion, immortality is both

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
impossible and a bad idea.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But not to be Debbie Downer out of the gate.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let me just throw out the idea that the container for immortality

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
is a universe as we understand it, all space and time.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And we've learned some solidly uncomfortable truths about

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
the universe in the last 50 years, among which is the eventual

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
fate of the universe being a sort of entropic, cold death as the

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
universe fins out, gets sparser, matter decays, galaxies evaporate,

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
black holes even evaporate and so on.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So however we conceive of a continuing conscious entity or

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
entities, it's within a larger context where you're swimming

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
against a pretty fierce current whose name is the second law of

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
thermodynamics.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And the last point I'll make on that is that Sir Arthur Eddington,

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
probably the greatest theoretical astrophysicist of the 20th

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
century, wrote a popular book on thermodynamics and he said,

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
you know, if your pet theory disagrees with observation,

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
well, these observationless bongles sometimes.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But if your theory disagrees with the second law of thermodynamics,

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I get to give you no hope.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You should kneel an abject humiliation.

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Just a little up on that.

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I just wanted to sort of put a distinction on the table.

101
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I think that when we talk about immortality,

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
we tend to talk about two very different things.

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
On the one hand, I would say a lot of things that are classified

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
on that root big would be forms of what I would call living on.

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'd just say ways in which we search to prolong our lives,

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
so the lives of those we love were in these days of climate change

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
for prolonging the life of the planet itself.

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But that form of a desire to live on doesn't seem to be a search

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
for immortality at all.

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That is to say, it's a prolongation of a life that is subject to death

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and also and it's actually partly animated by that.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That is part of the reason that I want to prolong my own life

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and the life of someone I care about is precisely because I say that it can be lost.

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That dynamic of searching to live on or to find ways for us to prolong

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and enhance our lives is very happening to us.

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But the other thing we talk about, I think when we talk about search for immortality

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
is to search for eternity, which would not be life living on in time,

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
but it would be a timeless state of being.

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And if you're aiming for eternity, you're not aiming to prolong your life,

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
you're aiming to escape it to a totally different state of being.

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And that doesn't seem to me not only, as you said, impossible, but also undesirable.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's say if I were no longer subject to the strictures of time,

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I would no longer be myself, so it wouldn't be form of survival for me at all.

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And it doesn't even seem to me to be a consolation.

125
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So I think that we'll see where we can go.

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But that distinction, for my thinking on these issues,

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
that's a very important primary distinction between like,

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
when you're talking about immortality, or you're talking about

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the site to live on or the site to be eternal.

130
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So, something to go up there.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Were you saying you were opposed to both of them?

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No, no, no. Just the second one.

133
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't think if I was opposed to the first one,

134
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I probably would be breathing right now.

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So I'm very engaged in the first one.

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I think that's a constitutive engagement.

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But the idea that it would be desirable to leave behind that condition altogether,

138
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
the condition of mortality altogether, in favor of timelessness of eternity.

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That seems to me something that should not just be held to be impossible,

140
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
but should also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
not even desirable.

142
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But the fact that I affirm mortality doesn't mean that I want to die.

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It means I want to keep on being mortal.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I want to prolong my life in various ways.

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The Greeks seem to characterize us as mortals, right?

146
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Right, but it's very interesting.

147
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's very interesting shift that happens, though,

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
because you have in, say, Homeric Greek religion.

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You don't have any sense of a salvation through eternity of timelessness.

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
On the contrary, the emphasis on the goods of this life, right?

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But this is precisely what Plato will criticize with Homer,

152
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
saying that, like, well, if that's what you're attaching yourself to,

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
you're also attaching yourself to all these forms of suffering,

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and the aim should actually be to exit from that.

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And you have something similar happening with the emergence of Hinduism and Buddhism

156
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
in the East, that is, say, in early Vedic religion, immortality in Sanskrit,

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Amatam, just means living for a really long time,

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
or not like 100 years, say, to live on, in that sense.

159
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Whereas, but then when you start having sort of salvation,

160
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
religion is emerging, what would eventually become like the Buddhist notion of Nirvana,

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
is precisely saying, no, the wisdom would be to try to exit from that struggle

162
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
to live on in that sense, and instead enter sort of timeless bliss or eternity.

163
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So, I think the distinction comes up.

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I would argue a bit about the notion of Nirvana,

165
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
because in later forms of Buddhism, Nirvana is also subject to impermanence,

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
both Samsara and Nirvana, but just not to enter into casually.

167
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I was just so agreeing with what Chris said,

168
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and that immortality, whether it's an individual immortality for one's own consciousness,

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
or immortality on some other scale,

170
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
seems to me to be both impossible and undesirable.

171
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And I know for myself personally, I wouldn't have any investment in being

172
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
poly young eyes and breath forever.

173
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I mean, it seems bad enough to be engaged with it, you know,

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
on an ongoing day-to-day basis, and to have and to see the nature of one's limitations

175
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and difficulties, and to think that those would be going on, you know,

176
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
add infinite about what it seemed to me to be not a very good proposition.

177
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So, yeah, I was kind of curious about why the subject came up at all,

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
you know, the subject of immortality, because, you know,

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't know if there are people who are here who are in favor of it.

180
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know how the subject came up, but it came up.

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
In your first classification, the first group of immortality.

182
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But I would just be clear, but, Paul, I'm not saying living on forever.

183
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I mean, part of the difficulty of that is that, of course, if it would go too long,

184
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
it can become unbearable, et cetera.

185
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And, like, so the first, I'm just saying a lot of things that are often classified

186
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
as testifying to the sci-fi immortality, already in the OTMA speech symposium,

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
like, to decide to have children, to procreate, all these things are supposedly testified

188
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
to our innate decipher immortality.

189
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I think I better understood as a desire to prolong a life in time, not to become eternal,

190
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and not even to live forever in time, which I think would cancel itself out and become impossible.

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So, but, so I just want to draw that distinction.

192
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm not clear when it stops.

193
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Where it stops?

194
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The first distinction you make at which point does it stop and you say,

195
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
well, I had this much now, I don't want to go any more time for a few more years.

196
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Part of the difficulty, I think, is that there's no fixed measure for that.

197
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's part of the difficulty of living in time.

198
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You know, you can die too soon, but you can also die too late.

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And what is too soon or too late, there's no external measure for that.

200
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's part of an internal dynamic.

201
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And it can be this wonderfully smooth sliding scale.

202
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There's a brilliant press of paper by Freeman Dyson,

203
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
his studio of advanced studies in the late 1970s.

204
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It was life in an eternal universe, and he made the point,

205
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
alluding again to thermodynamics, that even in an ancient, you know,

206
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
an ancient old cold universe, future civilization or life forms could

207
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
continue almost indefinitely by drawing down,

208
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
by essentially just pacing themselves, you know, diminishing returns

209
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
into the almost infinite future, and asymptote, as you draw down on the

210
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
energy of the microwave background radiation, which is free and out there,

211
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
but diminishing in strength.

212
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So, I mean, that's a continuous, there's no place to put a demarcation and say,

213
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
this is enough or this is super long and this is immortal.

214
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And that actually, he was almost making a plausible scenario for how

215
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
some civilization, not ours, might actually endure for,

216
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
what would seem like a very long time, trillions of years.

217
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But I would, pertinent to that distinction that you're making,

218
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
is would be the idea of indefinite prolongation, that if we were to know,

219
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and we believe we know that the universe will end at a certain,

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
in a certain inconceivably distant time, although I would ask,

221
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
we've known things with equal certainty in the past that turned out not to be true.

222
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So, it's possible that we will know something different in 500 years or 1000 years.

223
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But if we were to be able to say, on such and such a date,

224
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
this will be the end of the human race.

225
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What would that do to all human endeavor?

226
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
There's a wonderful book and movie called Children of Men,

227
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
whose premise is, at a certain time, human beings stop being able to reproduce.

228
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And so the people who are alive in the near future know that they're going to be the last human beings.

229
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And what that does to society and individual psychology,

230
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
it would be, I think, a complete disaster.

231
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
There would be no point in doing anything.

232
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
There would be no higher ambitions, no art, no culture.

233
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There would be no science.

234
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
There would be no need for any of those things because,

235
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
sort of, built into the basic structure of our experience of the world is that it goes on.

236
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And in a certain sense, we can't truly understand the idea of a mortal world, I think.

237
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We can't truly accept the idea of a world that's going to end.

238
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
We can accept, to a certain extent, although maybe we can't truly know what it means to accept the fact that we

239
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
individually, each one of us is going to end.

240
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But the idea that the entire thing is going to end, all humanity,

241
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I think, is as close to unthinkable as we can get.

242
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Well, that's a very important other distinction in the discussion.

243
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You know, we talk about immortality in the sense of the self,

244
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and we're totally attached to the self as a notion and as our actuality that we live with.

245
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But that example is where the collective enduring is what matters.

246
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And if the collective enduring has no meaning or will be seen to have no meaning,

247
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
then the personal enduring becomes equally meaningless.

248
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I wonder if there might be something also about the distinction between immortality and eternity

249
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
that has to do with, on the one hand, the human experience of the unbearability of change,

250
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and what might happen in the unbearability of the absence of change.

251
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah, I mean, that's part of the dynamic that is captured by what is involved in the horizon of a living on,

252
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
which ties into what Adam was saying.

253
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I would just add one thing, but I think that it's true on the one hand that you need to have the sense,

254
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
you need to have a sort of futuro-horizon for our actions to make sense.

255
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And in that sense, that has to be somehow indefinite.

256
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And that is to say, along with dynamics, but on the other hand, I also think you need to have the sense that it can end.

257
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And also certainty when exactly it will end.

258
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So the flip side of what you're describing is that also, yeah, if I had the sense that whatever I care about,

259
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I invested in real just endure by itself, the intensity of my commitment to it would also be lessened.

260
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So why it might be true that contemplating the complete extinction of that temporal horizon is something.

261
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You also, part of that dynamic representation is also the sense that it can be lost, and hence has to be sustained.

262
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And that would go both for individual actions, and I think for a more collective horizon,

263
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
that part of even when we devote ourselves to a project that extends beyond our conceivable lifetime,

264
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
part of the reason why we are devoted to it is the sense that, because we have the sense that it will not exist just by itself.

265
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It has to be sustained by effort in the visual or collective.

266
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So you need your horizon of possible prolongation, but also possible end for the sort of motivational dynamics to be at work, I think.

267
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I also think there's an assumption about life becoming meaningless in the face of impermanence,

268
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and the end of our existence or our world, and that both in Chinese and Japanese Zen,

269
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
there are forms of practice that would specifically go against any sort of forward thinking.

270
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And to practice with the immediate arising and the impermanent nature of our experience and our perceptions

271
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
gives a very different feel to life, a very much less future oriented.

272
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:24,000
In the geography of thought, Richard Nesbitt talks about the real contrast between the Chinese worldview and the Greek worldview,

273
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and how the Chinese were never striving for the eternal or the stable or the permanent as the Greeks were.

274
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And we've been very much more influenced in Western culture by the Greeks,

275
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and we don't have in many ways a frame of reference for, say, the fourth and fifth century Chinese poets,

276
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
some of whom lived in the mountains by themselves and created art that would fade overnight

277
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
because they were interested in that experience and not some other enduring experience.

278
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So I think you can become interested in and sensitive to a deep impermanence

279
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
that doesn't leave you without meaning if you knew that everything would go away tomorrow.

280
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And yet some people might think that the culture we're embedded in right now is, you know,

281
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
it's the height of impermanence and evanescence. The clock of the long now, the Stuart Brand project is notable

282
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
because it's one of the very few endeavors designed to create something that will last hundreds of generations.

283
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And then in our culture where we have almost impermeable, and durable technologies and materials, we do almost none of that.

284
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I mean, I don't know, it's somewhat paradoxical, the whole issue of permanence and impermanence.

285
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I mean, within any larger framework, everything is impermanent.

286
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But within a moment-to-moment engagement, it does matter whether you take one position or another

287
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:09,000
favoring something like a limitless future versus a very, very short moment that arises and passes away.

288
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And, you know, so in many of the Buddhist forms, and again, particularly the earlier Chinese,

289
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
there are practices to, you know, focus you on this kind of deep impermanence,

290
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and that that is the value of becoming aware of that, which, you know, if there were some greater understanding of it in our society,

291
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:48,000
perhaps there would be less fear of one's own death, and less engagement in exhaustive health interventions right at the end of life,

292
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
which is something that I thought you were kind of going after in something that you said earlier,

293
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:05,000
that there are pragmatic reasons to maybe revision what it means to die, you know, at this period of time.

294
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Because so many people invest in extending their lives by a very short period of time right at what they take to be their dying time.

295
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:30,000
They want to go for a month more or two weeks more or whatever, and it's very, very expensive and often also very costly in terms of pain and suffering.

296
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah. Just to put a little bit of pressure on what you were saying first. I mean, because there's a version I think where the embrace of impermanence,

297
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:49,000
the supposed embrace of impermanence is actually a very established way of trying to gain eternity in the sense of like becoming

298
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
immune or invulnerable to the experience of loss, starting to say like, so a lot of these strategies, we have them in Western stoicism for example,

299
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
where like the reason you're told that it would be wise to stop being future-oriented is because when you're future-oriented,

300
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
you're giving hostages to the future to something that's unpredictable, and you're attached to something that can be taken away from you.

301
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And I would say that's the real experience of mortality. And the aspiration to be more talented aternities is to try to get a state where you would be invulnerable to that type of loss.

302
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So the sort of Buddhist practice you're talking to me, for me, like for example, trying to gain eternity in the sense of not living forever,

303
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
but of being immune to the experience of loss. Because if I don't invest in the future, I can't lose anything. I'm just in the moment.

304
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But I think, for me that's not really embracing impermanence because that's actually for you to experience something as impermanence

305
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and to have like sort of a pain and a force to it. You have to be projecting towards at least the temporary permanence.

306
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And I think that this attempt to be in the moment is another attempt to be exempt from time or exempt from the sort of pain of mortality.

307
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Maybe in early Buddhist practices it was initially, but as Buddhism evolved over time, especially in the Chinese forums,

308
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:20,000
that shifted somewhat. I think in the early Taravadun forums there was a desire to get off the wheel of Samsara

309
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and not to actually continue. And as you get into the Mahayana forums, they really are more about staying in experience,

310
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:37,000
but recognizing its impermanence and staying with that impermanence. So it does change over the history.

311
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I mean, I would agree with you about early Buddhism that it was.

312
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I think it's true of my own. It's the thing, I think it's still in that end, but we can have that discussion.

313
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I was going to ask from, if you could take a cultural perspective on, you know, it doesn't have to be purely Western culture,

314
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
but the dominant culture and economic force of the planet where a femmer are all around us.

315
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And yet we sort of act as if we have infinite resources, etc. What is your take on that?

316
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Well, I mean, one way to think about it is that we've moved from a long period, maybe all of human history,

317
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
until the last two or three hundred years, in which people were confident of some kind of personal immortality,

318
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:34,000
even if the, let's say from Christianity, we have the West, very invested in the idea of personal immortality to the extent that

319
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
it becomes impossible to think outside the idea of immortality.

320
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So I think of someone like Maimonides, for example, Maimonides develops a highly intellectualized idea of what it means to be eternal,

321
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
that you're eternal if you think about God that you participate in his eternity,

322
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and that it's sort of an intellectual eternity, and that's something that Spinoza picks up on later.

323
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But even in that sense, there has to be some accommodation to the idea of eternity.

324
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:09,000
To a materialist view of the world in which eternity is the one thing that we are not allowed to imagine or envision for ourselves.

325
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And I think that the idea that you would want to prolong your life, for example, even for a week or a month,

326
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
doesn't that make perfect sense if life is the only value?

327
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I mean, outside of life there's no value.

328
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So if there's no eternity, if values are something that we create and posit for ourselves in the course of our lives,

329
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
then not to be alive is to lose the chance to participate in that process completely.

330
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It makes perfect sense that you would want to stay alive as long as you possibly could, even under adverse circumstances,

331
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
even from a sort of prudential point of view, then from a metaphysical point of view, it makes sense.

332
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And that goes hand in hand with the decline, I think, of the idea of immortality as a form of glory.

333
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
In other words, the idea that you would create an artwork that would outlast time,

334
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
that you would have permanent glory from something that you had made or done, that your name would live on,

335
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I think is an ambition that very few artists today share.

336
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
When you're talking about self-destructing artwork, so there's a thing of tangoly and the idea that you would make something that's designed to decay.

337
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Again, something that would have been quite foreign, at least in Western tradition, up until the last hundred years,

338
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
but now we're sort of forced to confront it, it's a major change.

339
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's a change that goes so deep that it's, I think, even hard to conceptualize.

340
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And in a way, alienates us from a lot of our own cultural heritage, because it depends on assumptions that we can no longer truly share.

341
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
This is a little random, but I think physicists of my acquaintance, and that was my original training,

342
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
they sort of reached for immortality through mathematics, because they believe it to be, in a platonic sense,

343
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
an ideal that holds not just in this part of space-time, but elsewhere, could be discovered by other sentient creatures

344
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and creates in the practitioner at some level, transcendental experience, and so on.

345
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's an interesting thing. I haven't reached that level, but I've got close to people who haven't explained it well.

346
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So you don't? I mean, I was listening to Brian Green and one of these things talking at the Rubin Museum,

347
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and he was advocating that position, but it always seems to me peculiar, because my background is as a developmental psychologist,

348
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Piageti, and that kind of thing.

349
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And so I don't understand how mathematics, then, as a practice, falls outside of subjectivity.

350
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
How could it, because human beings have practiced it and invented it?

351
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So how could it be the language of God, for example?

352
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:59,000
No, you're right. There's overreach there, and I think Max Tegmark, who's a colleague, I like him and know him well,

353
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:08,000
he espouses the layers of reality and awareness and the fundamental, you know, Pythagorean idea of a mathematical universe,

354
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
and it's an aesthetic. I mean, it's a pure aesthetic, and as an aesthetic, I agree.

355
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's locus, is it an arcychean and an arcycology?

356
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah, I don't, I think that's a conceit to imagine that it's universal in the way that that's sometimes presented.

357
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That's really...

358
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Just a full of what Adam was saying. I mean, I agree with a lot of the sort of canvas that you painted for us,

359
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
but again, I think once one distinguishes between aspirations to live on with specializations to eternity,

360
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I think some of the discontinuities that you outline are less forceful.

361
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So as distinct from, say, Christian aspiration to eternity, the ambition for the artwork to live on,

362
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
you know, I mean, if you think about the poetic expressions of this in Shakespeare, or Keats, et cetera,

363
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
there's an intense awareness, both of the possibility to live on, say, through the breadth of the speaker

364
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
who will reanimate the poem, but there's also an intense sense of like, this is not a given,

365
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,000
it can just be left to die, not reanimated by the reader, and even if it is reanimated, that's not about eternity.

366
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's precisely about prolonging its capacity to speak across the ages, you know, and so that's an investment.

367
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
What we call poetic immortality, I think, is actually an investment in a certain form of living on,

368
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
and I think we can, and which is, you know, another version of that is what you yourself recognize as relevant in contemporary world,

369
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
that I want to live for another week or another two weeks.

370
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So that dimension of our aspiration to live on, I think we can recognize across the ages much more,

371
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and I think that maybe we can have it more explicit now because we don't have to be the same extent

372
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:02,000
of investment in an opposing concept of eternity, but I do think that, I mean, I'm someone who works professional literature,

373
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:12,000
and I, as you do too, and I certainly don't feel alienated from the pathos of key, so Shakespeare, in their investment in poetry's capacity to live on.

374
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I just don't think that has anything to do with a commitment to eternity or a norm, in very many ways,

375
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
a materialist conception because it depends on the material of the poems, surviving, reanimated, etc.

376
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah, well, maybe it's because in the classical or Christian world you had a confidence in the perpetuity of human civilization.

377
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
In other words, you didn't envision a catastrophic end to your civilization,

378
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
whereas we live with that possibility all the time and basically take it for granted in a certain way.

379
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I think if you asked most people today what they believe will there be civilization in a thousand years,

380
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I don't know what the answer would be, but I assume that many or if not most people would probably say no.

381
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And then the question is, what are we, what are you doing it for?

382
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I mean, the Romans, for example, so Horace says,

383
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Horace says, non-omnus moriara will not, not all of me will die.

384
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
The part of me that lives on is the poem, but if you know that the poem is going to die,

385
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
then in fact all of you does die.

386
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And that's the situation that I think artists today are faced with.

387
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So there has to be a much more, I mean, that's a sort of postmodern aesthetic,

388
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
the idea that what you're doing is not for the ages, it's not for eternity,

389
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,000
it's not meant to synthesize all of human experience, but it's an intervention, it's playful, it's rearrangement,

390
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
something like that, which can look sort of like you're playing in the ruins of a culture that we no longer

391
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
really sustain.

392
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I guess it's still different from me between the ages and for eternity, I would say, like,

393
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I guess I don't, especially in Shakespeare and Keith's,

394
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
great examples of this sort of aesthetic.

395
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I don't see their investment in say, poetry's capacity to live on,

396
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
to be dependent on a notion that they will always be someone to read.

397
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It's just the horizon that someone can read it and reanimate it.

398
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So, so...

399
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
But there always has to be at least someone, right?

400
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Right, but there could also be no one.

401
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I mean, I think that's a part of the pathos of these, there's a sense in both Keats and Ticks,

402
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
but it's also possible that like, that me having written this does not guarantee

403
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
that it will be reanimated, there's a chance.

404
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But there's also the possibility that no one would read it, and that would be left to its own

405
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
or even destroyed in its material support.

406
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And I don't think that prospect would have dissuaded them from their investment in poetry.

407
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
If you think about the sonnets, I'm going to take some intense,

408
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
an intense sense of absolute mortality there is in the sonnets, you know?

409
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And just as the father of the second author, it generates a counter response.

410
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But that counter response is partly animated by the sense that that threat is very real and irreducible.

411
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So...

412
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Was that why they were doing it? Was that important part of the rationale on the motivation?

413
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Absolutely.

414
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And just as I think that like, whatever we do is informed by a sense that if we don't do it,

415
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
it will not be, and even if we do it, it might not last.

416
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And that's both an inspiration and inspiration to fear.

417
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,000
As opposed to just being able to express in the moment a truth of a culture or a human truth

418
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and convey it to others, that's not sufficient.

419
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I think we never live in just a moment.

420
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
We all live in a sort of future horizon.

421
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I wonder if there has been a change though in our aesthetic as well as what might take to be sort of an

422
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:56,000
assumptive framework since our understanding of entropy and uncertainty, principle and

423
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:04,000
relativity, all of these things that have come about through the natural sciences and have

424
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:15,000
essentially given a kind of an umbrella to our culture for understanding its devolution or whatever.

425
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:23,000
If that's sort of permanently changed our perspective in a way that then we could read back into the

426
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:36,000
semantics even more of this sort of engagement with something that would be like the conflict

427
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
between permanence and impermanence.

428
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I feel like we've changed a great deal in this recent period of time since modernity basically,

429
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,000
and that we're still reacting to those changes as a culture.

430
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I wonder if they could lead to a place where there would be, and maybe this is making a big leap,

431
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
but a greater acceptance of individual death.

432
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
That it is not something to be fought so strongly.

433
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I saw the movie Interstellar recently, and I was really kind of unhappy with the second half of it.

434
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I thought it was kind of a mess even though it had a lot of consulting from physicists and so on.

435
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But there was the Dylan Thomas poem weaving its way through there about not going gently into the night.

436
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I was thinking, gosh, that seems out of line with the movie somehow.

437
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I don't know.

438
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It seems to me there are sensibilities that are arising, and not just in academic frameworks,

439
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:02,000
but in the popular realm as well, that would say it might be possible to accept endings,

440
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:13,000
accept one's own death, accept the deep uncertainty of our existence, that that might be kind of cool.

441
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
That seems to be a change.

442
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And yet it exists in parallel with a quite well-funded research agenda to reproduce us in Silicon,

443
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,000
as well as that can be done, or computationally in some generic sense that we don't quite understand, but it's motivated.

444
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Who funds that?

445
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It happens a lot in California, the military industrial complex funds part of it, the NSF funds some of it.

446
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It's funded all over the place.

447
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Up the road from where I live in Phoenix, Alcor has 250 frosties on liquid nitrogen lasting first out.

448
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
You just hope the technology gets better.

449
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I mean, this may be just, again, a sort of stupid sideline, but are those just very wealthy individuals?

450
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Who want to be, who get a chance to leap in?

451
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I met a very wealthy Chinese man at a conference that I did in Switzerland this summer, and he said,

452
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:21,000
oh, there's no question that we'll be able to extend human life to at least 300 years, and there are a lot of people signing up for it.

453
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And there are a few of those, but they're mostly sort of tech-age programmers, visionaries, slash nerd, whatever.

454
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And there are a few, although this is illegal and not subdue to see that it sort of knew that they didn't want to go out old,

455
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
so they euthanized quite young.

456
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So there are some that are frozen who are in their twenties.

457
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's a true romantic sense.

458
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But isn't it, I mean, there is much less anxiety about being immortal than there is about being mortal.

459
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Less anxiety, did you say?

460
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But being immortal, I don't see people being afraid that, oh, you know, I'm panicked because I'm going to be immortal,

461
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
but people are scared about that.

462
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
They don't want to look at dying, they don't want to look at mortality.

463
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
It's avoided constantly, except in an intellectual way.

464
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So even though you say, the eternity and so on is not something that is sought after, but people want to live forever.

465
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And I'm not so sure at which point somebody, if you could take a pill that you took it once a day and after the age of 25, 26, 30, you didn't age,

466
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
you stayed the same and you kept going.

467
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
At which point would you start taking the pill?

468
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Thank you because that ties into something.

469
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So part of the point of the distinction from me is it's very important just because I don't want to be eternal doesn't mean that I want to die.

470
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:59,000
In fact, the reason I don't want to be eternal is that that would be the death of me, that there would be no life left for me to live in eternity.

471
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So personally, I don't think, I want to distinguish very sharply, and maybe this is a different point, between the rejection of eternity and the so-called acceptance of mortality.

472
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm not sure that we know what we mean by accepting uncertainty or accepting death, because if that means being able to embrace it fully, then I would say, if I accept uncertainty in that sense, there is no longer uncertainty.

473
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Part of the difficulty of uncertainty is that I can't embrace it because I don't know what it's going to be.

474
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's not something I can accept in advance.

475
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And similarly, if I can accept death in the sense of I'm fine with that I die or that my beloved dies, I no longer have a relation to death as death.

476
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So I think that it's not a matter of accepting death, but accepting that I will never accept it.

477
00:41:46,000 --> 00:42:03,000
That is to say, and that you can't settle that limit in advance, that again, I could live too long, I could live too short, but there's no way in which I can adjust my status in such a way that I'm prepared in advance to the difficulty in pain or uncertainty in death.

478
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I think that the idea that we could master that relation to uncertainty and death through some sort of acceptance, I think I'm very very about that way of thinking.

479
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I mean, though you seem to make this contrast between uncertainty and living.

480
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Like living seems to have a lot of uncertainty and not just death.

481
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So living actually means facing uncertainty. So the degree to which one faces that uncertainty is actually perhaps related to something of one's engagement with life itself, rather than with the rigidities of self protection.

482
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Absolutely.

483
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And so it doesn't seem to me to be the case that uncertainty is necessarily connected to death.

484
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:04,000
No, absolutely not. I mean, but uncertainty is a lot of talking about, but my point is precisely it's because I'm engaged in living that uncertainty is difficult.

485
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
You know, I mean, it's part of course what Mike's life worth living.

486
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It's absolutely certain nothing could happen.

487
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But it also means that there is no way in which I can just accept that uncertainty.

488
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,000
If I could accept that uncertainty, I would be ready for anything come with me, you know, and I wouldn't be particularly engaged in something.

489
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So I don't think that part of, to use the word, accepting the necessity of being engaged in life is also accepting that that exposes me to an uncertainty that I cannot master in advance.

490
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:51,000
And I'm worried about them saying like, well, that very thing itself would allow me to master it by saying I won't try to master it.

491
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I don't think that works.

492
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
No, well, it depends on what you mean by mastery.

493
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But, you know, this is another movie reference and I didn't actually see this movie, but just had a conversation about it today, which is only lovers left alive.

494
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Is that the right title? About the vampires? And so these are people, these are beings, vampires, and they often seem to me cast in this way who can go on living from life time.

495
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:29,000
They're taking the pill every day so that they can remain, you know, they age slowly, I guess, but they remain alive for a very long time.

496
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And as I understand the movie, the main protagonist, a couple, they're rather bored with it.

497
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I mean, they've seen everything, they've done everything, they've been around for centuries, they've engaged all the great thinkers and all the great art, and they're kind of like, yeah, okay, you know, because there's no novelty anymore.

498
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And novelty is so motivating for all of us, and when it wears thin, well, you know, life doesn't seem so wonderful.

499
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I don't know why they would assume that there is no novelty, since there is novelty constantly.

500
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Since I didn't see the movie, I can't.

501
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Right, and so I'm not that argument about getting bored, unless one experiences it, I don't see how it would be the case.

502
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
There will be new things constantly just in the last 20 years.

503
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:44,000
In fact, when I think about the only times I think about dying with any kind of negative feeling is when I think, gee, look how far we came in technology the last 20 years, I'm going to miss what's going to happen in 25 years.

504
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I won't know what great thing is going to happen next.

505
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Just to be clear, I have nothing against the pill. I think it sounds great.

506
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I mean, that is to say, like, because that pill is, I don't have it on foot.

507
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
No, I have it to you.

508
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:17,000
But, I mean, that pill is a means towards the end of living on, and look, and it has more talent to build into it, because it's very important that you have the capacity to not take the pill, if you come to a certain point where you no longer have that desire, but I don't see, I'm not making an argument against the desire to live on again.

509
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And I think we could live for a really long time without it becoming unbearable.

510
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
That would depend on a lot of factors.

511
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But living a long time has nothing to do with being eternal.

512
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Being eternal is not living a long time at all. It's being outside of time.

513
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And to the side of that, that I'm calling into question.

514
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So I think, you know, I don't have any principle objections to all sorts of medical attempts to prolong our lives.

515
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
But I don't think that.

516
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:47,000
You don't think ideas, especially religious ideas about eternity have to do with living a long time?

517
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Absolutely not.

518
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And all religious authorities are extremely clear on this.

519
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:01,000
At least all so-called post-axial religions, which we're calling, were very clear distinctions between analogous to what I'm saying, living on an eternity, that it's not a matter of prolonging this life.

520
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It's a matter of, like, sighted being that life to an end, of, like, resting in peace.

521
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
This is what Augustine says about being god.

522
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
But there are religions where they say, when you die, you then meet your family.

523
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
No, that's not a promise. That's not a promise that any religion makes, actually.

524
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Mormons do that.

525
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I mean, like, in the sense, like, Mormons make that it's very much part of the Mormon religion.

526
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I see what you mean by that, but I think you have to distinguish, first of all, between the most advanced philosophical statement of religion and the way it's commonly lived and perceived by people.

527
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And so, for instance, the other day, the Pope ostensibly said that pets would go to heaven.

528
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Although, then, today, there was a story saying, in fact, that's not what he said.

529
00:47:44,000 --> 00:48:00,000
But the idea that your pet would go to heaven, or what we sometimes hear about Islam, that you would get sex slaves in heaven, we think of that with disdain, because we think of that as a category mistake, exactly the category mistake that you're talking about, the difference between living on an eternity.

530
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:08,000
But there's also the idea of a last judgment that you resume your body, that your soul will find its body in Judaism.

531
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:16,000
You're not supposed to cremate or sever someone's body, because it has to be whole for the resurrection.

532
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So, I think that there's a tension there.

533
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It's not strictly true that religion doesn't teach that.

534
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Although, if you were to talk to, again, a maimonities or an Aquinas or something like that, they would have a much more sophisticated idea, but I don't think that that's probably what 95 percent of religion is.

535
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
That's just what the Alcor people are hoping for.

536
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And it's a cut price. It's only 80,000 for the head.

537
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Why would you pay 150,000 for the body? You'll get a much better body anyway.

538
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
There's a big difference, though, because it's the incorruptible body.

539
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It's very key to saying, it's not the same.

540
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So, if what I want is my corruptible central body.

541
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
But there's an identity as the key thing.

542
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Exactly how that identity should be fought is a very difficult issue.

543
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:10,000
When it comes to the idea of this existential consolation, anyone who takes their religious belief in turn seriously will run up against that problem.

544
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Because even then, the one who stress the compatibility of, say, love of God as we have Christian strength with the love of your neighbor, you'll love it.

545
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
The means and distinctions are very important. You say, you don't love your beloved or someone else.

546
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
You only love them as a means towards the end of loving God. You should not love them as an end in themselves.

547
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Because if you do, you're bound to experience irrevocable laws.

548
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Because them as an end in itself will be lost.

549
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You can love them as a means towards the end of God.

550
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:45,000
So, I think that the reason, of course, in popular ways, because people tend to be invested in this living on rather than eternity.

551
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
What I'm saying is that that's not something that a religious notion of eternity actually promises you.

552
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And I have nothing against the pathos of wanting to see your beloved again.

553
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I sympathize with that. But I think that's very distinct from the desire to be eternal.

554
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Sounds like a good light, though.

555
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Say what you think.

556
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:13,000
No, this is all very earedite. All I would say is just from as a psychologist and an egghead researcher,

557
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:22,000
you most, quote, average people don't really make subtle distinctions.

558
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I would argue that the essence of humanity is a disinclination to die.

559
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And that, since minute one, a central dynamic that has motivated just about everything that people do,

560
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
whether they're aware of it or not. And I would argue on empirical as well as theoretical grounds,

561
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:50,000
as we're in Freud's house, that unconscious death anxiety is what underlies the urge to immortality

562
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
in the sense that Martin refers to it, not prolongation, but eternity.

563
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,000
And I agree with what everyone has been saying that this was not a great idea.

564
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Moreover, I would argue that one way to think about conditions in modernity is that

565
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:18,000
ways of managing death anxiety in the form of different kinds of what Otto Ron called immortality ideologies

566
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:29,000
that have served us well, no longer do so. And we now see the urge for immortality manifested in a variety of

567
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:38,000
distinctly negative ways, you know, including degrading the environment, just a persistent pursuit

568
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:47,000
of money and stuff, you know, protracted ethnic hatred and violence, not to say that the urge to immortality

569
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
is the sole explanation of any of those difficulties. But I don't think we can understand any of those

570
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:01,000
without considering the malignant effects of the urge to immortality gone awry.

571
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It's interesting to consider the distinction between the fear of the loss of the corporeal being and the loss of the self

572
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
and just as a hypothetical because it's, you know, people write and talk about it.

573
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You know, suppose that the mind uploading concept, you know, has some traction.

574
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Just imagine people start trying to play that out. We could disbelieve it completely, that's fine.

575
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It's just a rhetorical device. And then is that what, is that going to satisfy that fear, appease it?

576
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:42,000
What if the same capability to disconnect ourself from our physical body goes along with a completely plausible

577
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:50,000
technology to pool the consciousness? What if we gain an ability to not be solotons in our bodies through that

578
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:58,000
reality? That would recast some of these debates in an interesting way. I mean, I would almost, I don't, as a, the humanist

579
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:09,000
in me, of course, has some significant abhorrence, but the, you know, the curious, curiosity driven scientist wants to see what happens, you know.

580
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Well, I think that for these anxieties disappear or they're the best therapy for them is a belief in the transcendental.

581
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But it doesn't have to be personally mortality. If you were to be convinced that, as people speculate now, say that our reality is a

582
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:32,000
simulation and that there's a higher order of reality for which our reality is a simulation. That, in and of itself, would

583
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:40,000
alleviate a lot of death anxiety because then you would be positing a higher order of reality that our existence serves in some way.

584
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:47,000
And that's only a contemporary, you know, 21st century metaphor for the thing that religion is always offered, which is the sense that there's a point to

585
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:55,000
it. And it's, in a sense, it's the pointlessness or the meaninglessness that is really intolerable rather than finitude.

586
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Because as you could say, we're born towards death. We have our being towards death always. It's impossible to imagine a form of life that isn't about death

587
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:12,000
and dying. It's impossible to imagine that. And that's why the idea of freezing your head seems so childish and so sort of stupid is because

588
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:19,000
it's like you're making a mistake. You don't understand what it is you're really afraid of. If we could believe that the death has a

589
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:29,000
purpose that it serves a higher purpose, that would take much of the sting out of it. But that's the faith that I think we've lost for the last couple hundred years.

590
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:37,000
The most important thing on that is the moral philosophers have weighed in on the simulation hypothesis. And there is a completely

591
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
reasonable philosophical argument for a golden rule and the fact that you would not be an e-list even if you thought you lived in a simulation.

592
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So that always makes me feel a little bit better about living in a simulation.

593
00:54:48,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I agree with you completely on all of that. And that really the deeper anxiety that's called death anxiety is about meaninglessness.

594
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And also, in talking about how, I think it's wrong to generalize also about people in their attitudes towards their own death or dying.

595
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And certainly, because ideal, I supervise a number of psychologists and have recently supervised a case where there was a suicide of a young person.

596
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And it was one of these situations where everything seemed ideal. And it was really difficult to imagine. And it seemed ultimately that maybe there was

597
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:51,000
really an insult to this woman's ideals. And that was the reason why she killed herself. And so people can kill themselves over what looks like from another person's point of view as a pretty trivial offense.

598
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Now, of course, there can be other things like the Robin Williams suicide where there maybe are multiple factors and things that anyone could fairly well identify with.

599
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:25,000
But the issue of some sort of transcendental meaning or something that gives meaning that would go beyond death seems to be a very important issue that perhaps needs to be looked at from the more pragmatic point of view again of the situation that we're in as a society,

600
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:42,000
having so many people who are going to be going through the dying and death process. And the tremendous overload that can make on our system if everyone is terrified and wants to live that extra one week or a month or whatever,

601
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:59,000
is really because they have no means of seeing death as an interesting adventure, as a developmental point, as a process that is meaningful in itself. And it seems like we have tended as a culture to,

602
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:18,000
again, I don't want to overdo this because when I'm saying we here, I'm talking about educated, fairly elite people have tended to see death as kind of the end, like not very interesting, not really the next adventure, just the finishing point.

603
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I mean, I think there's still plenty of people in our culture who don't see it that way, but as a certain kind of living in a certain sort of more educated intellectual environment, one can see that there's been this turn towards the meaninglessness of death, rather than it being meaningful.

604
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:50,000
People who want to do it on their own terms, over 20,000 people signed up with Mars one for a one way trip to Mars, mostly young people, equally male, female.

605
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And that's a perfect example of everyone who's going to die if there's a meaning.

606
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yeah, that was a meaning.

607
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:08,000
So, magnetically and philosophically though, I want to question the idea that we should try to overcome the anxiety of death. I mean, I attenuate in various ways, sure, but I think that it's,

608
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:19,000
yeah, yeah, yeah, because I mean, if you take that idea seriously, that one would see death as not as the end of a person's life, but as an interesting adventure, the next step.

609
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I mean, it seems to me like the most irresponsible view possible, that is to say, like, I mean, part of the reason why I have responsibility for someone else's life or for my own life is that it can irrevocably end.

610
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:40,000
That really is destructible. And I think, and that should, and if there was no level of anxiety before that, there would also be no level of care for that life.

611
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So I don't think that, this is, I don't think that we should.

612
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
This is really overstating it. I mean, I'm a psychoanalyst. There's anxiety in everything.

613
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I mean, you can't escape anxiety. There's no ending of anxiety. There's just a working with it in the different way.

614
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I'm saying, but the idea that that's a shortcoming that we can't overcome it, that I think is a mistake.

615
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I mean, I think we should recognize that anxiety is both productive and debilitating, but it's not something that one should even in principle try to eradicate.

616
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:20,000
You can't, the truth of the matter is that you cannot leave without anxiety because all anxiety is a signal to you that there is danger.

617
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Yes. And without it, you cannot, well, without it, you can't survive.

618
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Now there is, however, this issue of anxiety about dying.

619
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And I wanted to see if your feeling is the same, that that anxiety in terms of the ideas that attach to them varies throughout life.

620
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:55,000
That for a 21, 20 year old, the anxiety about dying is attached to different ideas and different fantasies than it is to a 40 year old or a 60 year old or an 80 year old.

621
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Let's say a 40 year old, the anxiety may be very much connected to leaving his children. What will happen to his children? What will happen to his wife?

622
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
To a 20 year old, it may be that he didn't have enough fun and didn't go enough dancing.

623
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:21,000
So the anxiety is fundamental. It's part of, I think, being human, and I probably also in the animal, certainly also in the animal kingdom.

624
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
The anxiety is fundamental. The ideas attaching to it vary.

625
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And I think what you are talking about is that if he's possible at some point in life based on disease or mental deterioration or whatever, to contemplate that I can somehow surmount this anxiety and end of life.

626
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Sorry.

627
01:00:47,000 --> 01:01:04,000
But through a cognitive effort, you can't silence the anxiety. It can't be extinguished, but it can be cognitively softened or modified.

628
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Well, what Adam was saying about meaning is really what I was saying. So anxiety is present, uncertainty is present in all aspects of living and dying.

629
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:23,000
But what does the activity mean? Why are we investing ourselves into something like becoming a parent, for example?

630
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:34,000
You know, you know that you're going to be poor, you know that you're going to be worn out by it, you know that in the long run, your friends who don't have children are actually doing better than the ones that do.

631
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I mean, there are many reasons why you could say to yourself, that's not a very good thing to invest in.

632
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:48,000
But there's some larger meaning that is active in your investment.

633
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And it is coming sort of, it mixes with or integrates into the anxiety.

634
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:09,000
The anxiety then really is, as Freud said, it's not, anxiety is different from fear in the sense that it's the sense of being threatened by a person.

635
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And it's not a clear and present danger, whereas fear is the response to something that is a clear and present danger.

636
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:31,000
So that sense of being threatened is, you know, I think that whole issue of the distinction between anxiety and fear is a big, both neuroscientific and psychoanalytic problem that has not been resolved.

637
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:50,000
But it's just a meaning that's connected with that engagement, you know, and so if you're going to engage with death in a meaningful way, you're, yes, you'll be anxious and so on, but you'll be heading into it with more the sense, you might say even enthusiasm, you know, than if it seems like a meaningless

638
01:02:50,000 --> 01:03:01,000
and stupid end to your existence after which there is nothing or, you know, after which there is just the loss of everything and whatever else.

639
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So the way that you imagine it, I guess, you know, the way you understand it within whatever your collective framework is for the meaning of death.

640
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I think it's very significant.

641
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:32,000
But part of the problem in that in terms of meaning is that it's very hard to not carry it into death, the feelings and ideas that we have while living.

642
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:41,000
So we have the fantasy that when we die, even though we don't say it that way, but emotionally it's almost as if, well, I'll miss my children.

643
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Well, you're not going to miss anything. There's nothing to miss. There's nothing to recognize. There's nothing to realize. It's over.

644
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:03,000
But it's very hard to think of it that way. Spontaneously we always think of somehow we are going to feel some pain because of something.

645
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:13,000
So what I'm taking from this is that the desire, the natural, the fear of death mapping into a desire for life extension or longevity, extreme or otherwise,

646
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:22,000
absent a known strategy for coping with the anxiety and fear themselves is completely irrational, right?

647
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
You shouldn't have those two things going together.

648
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Oh, say that again.

649
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:41,000
The natural desire for life extension or increased longevity, if it's not coupled with an aware strategy for mitigating or dealing with the fear of anxiety that is just going to be present even more as you live longer,

650
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
it would make an international viewpoint.

651
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:52,000
But the meaning of question though, doesn't have to be something that I believe is itself immune from destruction.

652
01:04:52,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So the fact that I have children and thereby I invest in something that goes beyond my own death and that might give my life greater purpose,

653
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
that meaning doesn't depend on me. I think that my children in turn will live forever.

654
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:12,000
The greater product that Adam was mentioning, I do think that our lives need to be tapped into a greater project.

655
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:20,000
But that project itself does not have to be conceived as itself indestructible as opposed to my destructible, finite existence.

656
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:33,000
The idea that meaning requires on some level indestructibility, I think that's an inference that we don't have to accept.

657
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:41,000
But that also means, if you don't do that, then it also means that if it will be destroyed and you're investigating it continuing,

658
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
then you will have some level of anxiety and fear of death, which is not irrational.

659
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:56,000
That would be rational in that case. If I want something to persist, it can be the political product I'm invested in, the community, etc.

660
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:03,000
That doesn't have to do with that. I will persist. But I still have a rational fear of the possibility that I will not persist.

661
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And that's not something I think you can.

662
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And the idea that we should try to overcome that sort of fear has always been starting with a Socrates-Fato, that the Plato's-Fato,

663
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:22,000
that the idea that the proper philosophical idea related to death would be equanimity.

664
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:29,000
The wise man thinks at least the world about death, Sespenoza, and whether you're an Epicurean materialist or a Platonist metaphysician,

665
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:37,000
in relation to death, you still think your task is to overcome the fear of death, somehow proving that it's irrational to fear death.

666
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Whereas I actually think that there are certainly irrational forms of fear of death, but I think there's a rational kernel to the fear of death,

667
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:49,000
which proceeds from the desire to live or decide for something to live on.

668
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And that is irreducible and incurable. And we can develop various ways of coping and negotiating and attenuating that.

669
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
But I don't think that.

670
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:08,000
The desire to live essentially means that from the time you are born and you keep moving in life, your investment is in life.

671
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Your investment is not in death.

672
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And that's what I'm saying. That's what irrational is.

673
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:21,000
So what about another hypothetical pill that by some clever psychochemistry removes the fear and the anxiety?

674
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
How does that change the individual and the culture, even more interestingly?

675
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
The lender of the vegetables.

676
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Yeah.

677
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Completely.

678
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Don't tens of millions of people try to take pills like that all the time.

679
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I mean, there are pills like that that are supposed to relieve anxiety and depression.

680
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Whether it's supposed to.

681
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Yeah.

682
01:07:40,000 --> 01:08:01,000
And they haven't worked that well. The thing that I guess I keep coming back to is that I have, you know, really, I've been engaged with many people who have wanted to commit suicide, both in my own direct practice, but then recently through supervision.

683
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And in two cases, and I don't want to say much about them, but these were very successful people. At the peak of their lives, both women, one of them with young children and the other one without public figures, well known, attractive, you know, educated professionals and so on.

684
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:32,000
And so is that a completely irrational? You're saying that that goes against the nature of life.

685
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I don't want to commit suicide.

686
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I know. It's part of finite life that it can become unbearable.

687
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And I'm not saying, I'm just saying, insofar as you want something, insofar as you have a probability of what to sustain, you also want to live on.

688
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
But it's possible for that to be short here.

689
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
It's possible for it to become unbearable.

690
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,000
That's part of the radical vulnerability of being finite, that it's possible that you won't be able to take it.

691
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
And that's not necessarily irrational either.

692
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:12,000
But it's symptomatic, right, that's the same as the end of any project, then, the end of any commitment, except the commitment to end the possibility of any commitment.

693
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I think the motivations are usually complex, very complex.

694
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I took it used to mean that someone who actually wanted to die, that was a hypothetical example.

695
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:33,000
They want to die and they go about making it very clear that they found a way to do that and they do it in a way that works well.

696
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And so I think there are people who are more afraid of life than of death, and that they seek that because the meaning of life seems to be unbearable or at least terribly disappointing.

697
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And so they seek instead to die.

698
01:09:53,000 --> 01:10:05,000
And there's no real good argument against suicide.

699
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
And the implication of that is that there is no reason not to commit suicide.

700
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Because precisely because when you die you don't feel anything.

701
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
So once you're gone, there is no you anymore.

702
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So there's no you to feel good or bad about your decision. It's a completely incommensurable idea. It intervenes into our life.

703
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Death sort of comes in at an angle. It's not necessarily part of life. It's a termination.

704
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:38,000
So the only conceivable good reason would be to avoid causing other people pain.

705
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,000
If you accept the sort of modernist perspective in that regard.

706
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:52,000
If you have people who would be very hurt by your death physically, economically, or emotionally, then you could say for their sake you wouldn't commit suicide.

707
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:59,000
But it's very hard to come up with a good argument against suicide as it relates to me as the person who is.

708
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:10,000
So if you're starting point is someone is this completely abstract person who's not defined by his engagements in the world, who's not that is primarily caught up in caring.

709
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Because if you are, what you fear with death is not the state of being dead, which is nothing.

710
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
What you fear is the loss of what you want to keep.

711
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Unless you don't want to keep it.

712
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Because there are moments when that's high-degree anxiety.

713
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
The angst is when everything recedes. The world recedes. When it's no longer your world.

714
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
It becomes no longer attached to you and you're no longer attached to you.

715
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
But for high-degree though you still care about not caring. You're still invested in the...

716
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You still care about not caring. So you're not at that point where it would look rational to kill yourself.

717
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,000
It's exciting that you want to care and there's nothing which you care can attach to.

718
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Right.

719
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Sheldon, what's your experience with that?

720
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I have not, but I like Kamu. And he said in his notebooks come to terms with death thereafter, anything is possible.

721
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
So, you know, on the one hand there's the view that Adam raises about suicide. And I agree with.

722
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:07,000
But on the other hand, you know, I think Kamu and his more uplifting, optimistic moments had some...

723
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I think some hopes, let's say, for humanity.

724
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And I think it's long lines of what Martin is saying about harnessing death anxiety and putting it to good use.

725
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Which is, I think, what the Epicureans are saying sort of.

726
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
This is another...

727
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Yeah, maybe. All right. We'll talk about that another time. But Martha Nussbaum, a philosopher has a look.

728
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Yeah, but she criticized him.

729
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Yeah, so I agree. All right. But I'd like her to take on that.

730
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Yeah, that's excellent.

731
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:45,000
So, I mean, I appreciate the Kamu perspective. But I also think occasionally the philosopher can forget they're an animal, you know.

732
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:51,000
There's a part where the ego and the brain just take over. And we are animals, you know.

733
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Just get a little more visceral back to biology, the nature of life to persist, to endure from, you know,

734
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:04,000
quorum-sensing bacteria to the higher creatures of the planet. So, that's the...

735
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
There's a grounding somewhere there.

736
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Although, then the question would be, if you're depressed, then you're a sick animal, right?

737
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
And why should you not end your sickness?

738
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Why do we have such an investment in other people not killing themselves?

739
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
But I thought you were also saying that it doesn't have to connote depression.

740
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
That perspective.

741
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And I think, I mean, I would say that that is the metaphysical face of what is experientially depression.

742
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
It's the same thing viewed in two different points of view.

743
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,000
That if the world no longer has any value or meaning and your commitments to the world fall away,

744
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
you're no longer invested in your own projects.

745
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Because what it comes down to, again, is that there's no third party, there's no God guaranteeing your projects.

746
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
The projects have meaning for you if they have meaning for you.

747
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
And if they don't have meaning for you, then they have nothing, no meaning at all to anyone.

748
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,000
So, then there's no objective reason why you can't kill yourself or why you want them to kill yourself.

749
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,000
There's only other people's subjective desire that you not do it.

750
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
So, I just want to introduce one other perspective.

751
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I've wondered whether this was just too esoteric, but...

752
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:25,000
So, from a Buddhist perspective, and especially from the Vajrayana, the later Vajrayana developments of Tibetan Buddhism,

753
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:31,000
and the kinds of things that people recognize the Dalai Lama and the Karma Pahpa those folks do,

754
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:39,000
there's a tremendous opportunity in the moment of death, and that is the opportunity for enlightenment.

755
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:49,000
And there are a lot of practices, and I've done some of them, for conscious dying in the Tibetan practices among those

756
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:55,000
that have to do with the state of mind at the moment of death.

757
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:02,000
And there's a lot of preparation for that moment and a lot of support that would...

758
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I've just recently gone through a very personal death with someone who was supported all the way through, who was...

759
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:19,000
And the late stages of Alzheimer's with no cortex left at all had been unconscious, was very conscious in dying with the eyes open

760
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
and light actually coming out of the eyes.

761
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And so, the Tibetan practices are specifically focused, and there are some practices in Zen as well,

762
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:39,000
on the opportunity of dying, and not just the opportunity from the point of view of any kind of immortality,

763
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:49,000
but rather for the development of what would be considered the mind stream that has been in the form of this particular lifetime that goes forward.

764
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And so, in these cases, death is really looked upon with a lot of interest and excitement,

765
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:10,000
and of course, there are many accounts of these kinds of experiences that are more or less well known,

766
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:19,000
but these days they're out there, and it's just a very different involvement with death,

767
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:27,000
and it's a very different kind of development than what the Western perspective would typically take,

768
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
and I just put it out there.

769
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:38,000
So, does that perspective as a death as an opportunity, does that depend on the scaffolding of reincarnation and other parts of the belief system?

770
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Yes, it depends on...

771
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,000
It's really hard, again, this gets into particularities about Buddhist philosophy,

772
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:55,000
but it isn't reincarnation per se, it's really called rebirth, and so, in Buddhist philosophy, the continuity from lifetime to lifetime

773
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:03,000
is the same as the continuity within a lifetime, like you're not the same person that you were when you were three, when you were 14,

774
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:12,000
as you move along, your identity, your physical makeup, and your concerns and perspectives all change,

775
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:21,000
and so, as you move over that transition from dying to the next stage, which is a sort of dreamlike stage,

776
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:29,000
you carry some identity, but as you move through that process and then move into existence again,

777
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:37,000
there may be very little trace of or memory of in the same way that you don't remember everything that happened to you yesterday,

778
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:45,000
you can remember some of it, you certainly wouldn't be remembering much from an earlier lifetime,

779
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:54,000
and of course, the Tibetans especially have ways of testing for that and so on when they're identifying a karmapa or a dalaylama or whatever.

780
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
So, but it's just a very, very different framework on death, and it doesn't...

781
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
So, I have a framework that there is...

782
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Before you talked about accepting death, which presumably means that if there is death, that is determination of...

783
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
If there is death, that is determination of a life.

784
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
It's a determination of a particular subject to...

785
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:21,000
So, if you then introduce the metaphysics where that's not really the end of what matters, you're no longer talking about death,

786
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
all you're saying is that you're denying that there is death in the relevant sense, that is to say...

787
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:34,000
That's really kind of a mistake to say it that way, because it makes it seem too distinct, like there is no death.

788
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:46,000
There is actually a profound change when somebody moves out of a physical existence, and it's no small movement.

789
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:52,000
But it's not the end of that development of that consciousness, that's the thought anyway.

790
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
So, then you have a strict separation between the consciousness and the body.

791
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
You have a classical consciousness body dualism.

792
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And in that framework, what really matters doesn't die.

793
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:11,000
So, to present that as a way of facing mortality seems to me very misleading, because if I'm going to face mortality,

794
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I'm facing the fact that I am such a being that I can be completely annihilated.

795
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I'm such a being that I depend on a body that I don't own, and that if it ceases to be, I will also cease to be.

796
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,000
If there's any meaningful thought, if that's not the thought I'm facing, I'm not facing the thought of death.

797
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I've just come up with the metaphysics where there is no one.

798
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I would completely agree with you.

799
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
But you just say that something continues.

800
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
What continues about me...

801
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:46,000
But you're posing the whole argument on a point of view that's not valid to the system.

802
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And so, you can't say that it undoes, that it undoes, does itself.

803
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
It does not.

804
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
It does not.

805
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
It does not.

806
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Just to find death, ask, compete annihilation.

807
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
But is there a material substrate for what survives, or is it purely spiritual?

808
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
It's purely spiritual.

809
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
And see, that's what we don't believe anymore.

810
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
That's what we can't believe anymore, is that there's no such thing as the spiritual.

811
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
So, it is meant to be consciousness.

812
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:16,000
That's what it is.

813
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I think we'd be remiss if we didn't also consider the vicissitudes of the development of death fears,

814
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:32,000
and specifically the enduring influence from childhood when the first appearance of these kinds of concerns

815
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:39,000
that are often rooted in object relations, and the role of aggression in that,

816
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:55,000
that going back to the bodily substrate of experience, that when children begin to become aware of the possible consequences

817
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:02,000
of their aggression towards loved ones, and the fears of having murderous wishes towards others,

818
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I think that it's useful to think about that in connection to fears of death and wishes for immortality

819
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
as kind of reparations and undoing of some of these feelings.

820
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I wonder if anyone wishes to comment on that.

821
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I agree.

822
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I think that there's a great deal that arises from that early sort of instinctual experience of being destructive.

823
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And then that fears arise from that also in relation to the continuity of oneself and others,

824
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
and that those are carried over then into one's view of death.

825
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Most people, when I work with them in analysis or therapy, and I ask them,

826
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
what do you think happens when you die?

827
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Most people say you go into the dark, or you go into the dark alone, or it's over,

828
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
but when I say, so what's that like? That it's over?

829
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:06,000
It's usually something like the end of a movie, or things are just dark.

830
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
It's an interesting thing. That's sort of the imagination of it.

831
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
End of a movie. That is depressing. Popcorn stick into your shoes.

832
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
It's just like where it goes the end, and then there's nothing.

833
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Okay, I think we can go to the audience for questions, but I just wanted to comment something.

834
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:29,000
The last time you were here, you told us that we could get on some kind of rocket or ship

835
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:39,000
and go into another universe and start life there and have the whole new way of experiencing time and space and life.

836
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:45,000
So, the physics, it's not the escape clause. It's immortalizing, if not immortality.

837
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:52,000
It is completely plausible. The trick is you have to find a thousand solar mass or larger black hole,

838
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,000
which is bigger than just a dead star, so we'd have to go a ways to find it.

839
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:04,000
And the point being that that's a big enough black hole that tidal forces don't destroy the body on your way into the event horizon.

840
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And then you gather your friends and your loved ones in another spaceship,

841
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:14,000
and your time asymptotically slows down, and you're, you know, obviously comb your hair and do a very casual,

842
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
royal family type wave, you know, on your way in, because that's the frame you're going to be left with.

843
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:24,000
They'll be left with, they go off, die, etc. So that's the end.

844
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
That's the perspective of everyone else. You have truly been immortalized.

845
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:36,000
You, in your time frame, do travel through the event horizon to an unknown fate, but Kip Thorne, who is the consultant on that movie,

846
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:43,000
you know, he, in the top tier of Gravity Theoris, points out that spinning black holes of that size

847
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,000
do have time-like curves, where in principle you can, you know, cheat time by moving backwards and forwards,

848
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:54,000
meeting previous and future versions of yourself in theory, in the best theory we have of black holes.

849
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,000
So that's the, the nearest black hole of that size is going to be something like 500 light years away.

850
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So we have some technology. We have some technology to work on there.

851
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:17,000
So questions line up and state your name and please keep it in the form of a brief question.

852
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Yeah, for people, for myself and people I know, there isn't so much a fear of dying.

853
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,000
It's the process of dying, the pain and suffering of dying.

854
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And I never understood the fear of dying because if you're religious, you're looking for something better for afterwards.

855
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And if you're not religious, it's all over. So where does the fear and anxiety come in?

856
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Well, I mean, I try to answer my question by saying that what you fear and fear in death is not the state of being dead,

857
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
which is nothing, but to fear, to lose what you want to keep.

858
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:54,000
That is to say, you have fear insofar as you conceive of death as the extinction of the possibility of experience,

859
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,000
and you have an investment in going on, in continuing to have the possibility of experience.

860
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
That's regret, not fear, isn't it?

861
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
No, I think, I mean, whatever you want to...

862
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
It was a big difference in regret and fear.

863
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I don't think it's not regret because it's not past-oriented. It's the prospect of a future in which you will not be.

864
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
And so, I think regret is past-oriented and fear is future-oriented.

865
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
So I think that's adequately called a fear.

866
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:31,000
That I apprehend the possibility of my not being, and precisely because I have an investment in continuing to be,

867
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
that scares me.

868
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
And it doesn't seem like that's a category mistake or irrational.

869
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I think there's a very coherent logic to that.

870
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:49,000
It seems to me that it's like what Rob said, that a lot of the fears are based on experiences from childhood that we've already had,

871
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
and that we reorganize them around dying.

872
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And so we're afraid that we're going into the dark alone, or we're afraid we're going to fall forever,

873
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:05,000
or that some things going to be destroyed, that we've already had those deep fears, and they become reorganized in dying.

874
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Even if you're religious, you have those fears?

875
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Oh, yeah.

876
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Yeah.

877
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Because you don't believe your religion.

878
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Well, dying is a physical, a very physical activity.

879
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,000
And as people go into dying, there are a lot of physical things that happen.

880
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Yeah, I can understand what I said.

881
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And so they anticipate those things, and they see their loved ones going through.

882
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And I think a lot of the imagination does connect to childhood experiences and fantasies.

883
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Thank you.

884
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Hi.

885
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Joan Oronian, a very happily retired surgeon.

886
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:53,000
I told Edward that I thought he should begin this program with a couple of minutes of Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks

887
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:59,000
with a 2,000 year old man, because that might be as close to immortality as we could come.

888
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I like Martin's comments about temporary permanence, and very briefly two examples for me of temporary permanence.

889
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:19,000
One, being a surgeon, and any physician in a teaching institution would have this experience, that your life doesn't change.

890
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,000
The youth comes, is with you, and goes year after year after year.

891
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:32,000
There's a permanence to our existence until we get home and look in the mirror.

892
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Secondly, my wife has just written a book for her children and grandchildren.

893
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
About her father.

894
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Trying to establish some permanence in the minds of the future generations of Mehti Dormagani.

895
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And I think that this is one way that already one generation has seen and knows this man when they had never seen him or known him.

896
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:10,000
And she is establishing some temporary permanence, hopefully for another generation or two.

897
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Thank you.

898
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Go ahead.

899
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
So since we're talking about film and comedy.

900
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Wait, wait, yes, it belongs to comment.

901
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Sorry.

902
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I just wanted to follow up on your thoughts on temporary permanence, that I think that another way of fleshing up that thought,

903
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:33,000
and what you said was very evocative, is the fact that what makes it both

904
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:41,000
difficult but also meaningful to be alive is that you have both permanence and impermanence.

905
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:48,000
If you only had absolute impermanence, there wouldn't be any problem because you wouldn't experience the loss of anything.

906
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Everything would immediately disappear.

907
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:58,000
And if you had absolute permanence, likewise, nothing would be an issue because everything would just be what it is.

908
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:05,000
So the key to thinking about mortality in the general sense, I think, is to think about the co-impicational permanence in permanence.

909
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
That like, things last while also disappearing.

910
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Things last while also being possible to cease to be.

911
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:17,000
And that's where both the passion and the agony of being alive arises from that intersection of permanence and impermanence.

912
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:23,000
And I mean, I'm sure as a surgeon you've had particularly vivid experiences of this, but I think that that is the structure.

913
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And that's also why attempts to escape mortality can either be done like,

914
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
oh, that's just an absolute impermanence. Everything disappears and I don't care.

915
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
That's fine.

916
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Then of course, nothing hurts me.

917
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Or I imagine that there's something absolutely permanent that I don't have to worry about.

918
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
But I think both of those paths are flights from what we are and how things matter to us.

919
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
And we should not indulge those flights.

920
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:53,000
So I'd like also comic, because I also was provoked by the notion.

921
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:00,000
And so the perspective from physics or astronomy, if you like, is that of pattern.

922
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
We're just patterns, really. That's all there is.

923
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I mean, all of these atoms in this room and elsewhere in the whole universe were one smaller than an atom in the Big Bang.

924
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:18,000
The space time paths went through these bizarre roots through stars to become heavier elements without which we wouldn't be here.

925
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
And they congeal or cohere.

926
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:26,000
And not even your skin is last a week. Your internal organ cells may be last much of your life.

927
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,000
So we're just a consciousness ourselves the entire thing. It's just an evanescent pattern.

928
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,000
And the patterns continue. They have, you know, the atoms may decay and tend to the 35 years we don't know.

929
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:42,000
But that's pretty good. That's as close to eternity as I'd care to conceive of.

930
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:49,000
So the impermanence of patterns when we eventually get to understand the brain and consciousness better,

931
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,000
maybe that opens the door also to some of these Eastern ways of thinking, just from the realm of straight up physics.

932
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Well, Roger Penrose thought so.

933
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Okay. I was just going to mention that this topic and discussion might well be summed up in a light vein by Woody Allen's response to the question on this topic of immortality,

934
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:20,000
which when asked, don't you want to carry on forever? He said, no, I just want to carry on in my apartment.

935
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Okay. So the questions that arose for me during the panel, which was very, very good, in my opinion, were answered within the panel.

936
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,000
So I'm just going to make a few quick observations, any comments that the panel would care to make are welcome,

937
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,000
but otherwise I'll just offer them as observations.

938
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:49,000
On the point of our biological heritage, it wasn't mentioned that our prefrontal cortex and particularly structures within that prefrontal cortex,

939
01:31:49,000 --> 01:32:02,000
those structures are unique to human beings. And the way I can best describe it is a Ralo Mais comment in Love and Will that depression is the inability to construct a future.

940
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:11,000
So the need for us to look forward to the future also generates, because we are aware of our own mortality, that anxiety.

941
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,000
And I just thought that was something that wasn't addressed directly and I thought it would be relevant.

942
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:24,000
In terms of the Far East, I think the perspective you were describing might be summed up in a Hindi saying,

943
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:31,000
which translates as in the world, but not of it. In other words, there's being merged with the sensorium and our reactions to it.

944
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
And then there's another perspective where we step back and look inward.

945
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:43,000
And I think that that perspective makes all the difference between one's experience, not just oneself,

946
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:48,000
but one's impending demise. So that's another comment.

947
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,000
In terms of mathematics being invented, there is a raging debate whether it's invented or discovered.

948
01:32:53,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And I think one piece of support for the latter is the robustness, let's say, of unstining relativity,

949
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:07,000
where because he was so convinced that his predictions would be correct and they have been to a remarkable degree,

950
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and he said, if when we're able to actually measure the perturbation of Mercury's orbit around the sun,

951
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:19,000
if it doesn't agree with my theory, the measurement will be wrong.

952
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:25,000
So mathematics does seem to, yes, it is language and therefore is inherently metaphorical.

953
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:34,000
At the same time, if you speak with Professor Nima at Princeton, he's of the opinion that right now we're just getting into

954
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
approaching an error where we have an actual one-to-one relationship between mathematical theory and structure.

955
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,000
So it may not be the case that it's completely metaphorical and just our own invention.

956
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I think that might be it.

957
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Yeah.

958
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Oh, yes. The other thing about the Far East, and again, this nature of permanence and non permanence,

959
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:07,000
it is the case that while that perspective was encouraged within Buddhism,

960
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:15,000
at the same time, we cannot deny that the shogunates and the dynasties in Japan and China were definitely into permanence.

961
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:21,000
So again, it's a matter of perspective versus the social-political context. Any comments or welcome?

962
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I wanted just to make a comment about the business, about mathematics discovered or invented.

963
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:35,000
And I think again, that may not be a really fruitful way to draw a distinction because, you know,

964
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:45,000
it's kind of the, if you think from point of view of Winnicott or Piaget, does the child invent the world or discover the world?

965
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:52,000
You know, on one hand, it seems to be inventing the world and its perceptions, and on the other hand, it's discovering the world.

966
01:34:52,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And so there's something about drawing the distinction between the discovering and the inventing that might be misleading.

967
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
And there's a lot that's written about that in psychoanalysis.

968
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Just a short response to that, and I'll relinquish my time, which is that saying like a watched kettle, and that for boils, right?

969
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:24,000
In natural language, that describes the fact that people are not necessarily aware of, that when we pay attention to a phenomenon,

970
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:32,000
our perception of the passage of time changes, which also speaks to the issue of boredom and a largely extended life,

971
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:42,000
where it's, for me, completely feasible to imagine a point in science and technology where we're able to control that sense of the perception of time at will.

972
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:55,000
So the difference is that with that statement does not hold up to what we know and what we can accomplish using mathematics to actually measure the passage of time while that kettled boils.

973
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:10,000
So there is a fundamental difference between the intuitive humanistic discovery of the world, and a language that is precise and independent of the individual

974
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,000
that reflects the structure in the world.

975
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I'll make one comment on the math issue. I mean, I think it's not a dichotomy. You can have your cake and eat it.

976
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I mean, we're in the culture at the moment Turing is being celebrated, and his, to me, singular achievement was the Turing machine,

977
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:37,000
and that, which I think is what they should have been sending out with a SETI message rather than these little stick men and silly pictograms.

978
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:44,000
They should have just sent a Turing machine because it's the algorithm of all algorithms, the algorithm that can do anything.

979
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:51,000
So it's the purity of a computational framing that can calculate anything that you can imagine,

980
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:57,000
and you tell that to the aliens that were smart, or at least that were in the first run anyway.

981
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Calculate this. Okay.

982
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Thank you so much, Mayor.

983
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I encourage the speaker about this very challenging subject, but just getting back to a second to, you know, play of a dude by, actually it was an Olympic champion

984
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
resolute head with his nickname, which means broad shoulder man, in a sense, anyway.

985
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
One of the main ideas simply was the eight-quarter theory.

986
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:29,000
They didn't even cut into an eight-quarter, so everything that he's growing to a tall majestic oak tree doesn't get lost on the way,

987
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:40,000
it's nothing but a dude. The wind would bloom to this world. We have a presence of soul, spirit, but it's exterior womb space for consciousness to develop over 21 years at the land, in versus the cob.

988
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I'm just curious if I just toss this out. Do you think genetically encoded in that e-con theory for a human being,

989
01:37:46,000 --> 01:38:01,000
or things that we are just beginning to know that might actually still be in there? I'm just tossing that out. Whatever you think.

990
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I'm not sure I understand the question, but how could there be something concealed that we wouldn't understand, but would that be?

991
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:18,000
If you put consciousness in the human being, does not biologically develop your 21 or 22? So you couldn't access your full potentiality until you were 21 or 22.

992
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:25,000
By that time, most education is finished and done. We're in the world of reality. Our brains are just waking up.

993
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:34,000
So if there was anything genetically encoded, we would just be able to access it at that moment and practically nothing to ever think about it.

994
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:43,000
This is very early that audience, when I'm just forcing them out. I think they can answer that question. Thanks for your comment.

995
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
One more thing.

996
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Well, these days, they think it's 25. Not 21. Yeah, for that would be mature.

997
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
85, you mean?

998
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:57,000
25, 25 are the very into matureness, potentiality for.

999
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
What do you think?

1000
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I'm not going to let it go. I'm not going to let it go. You just said that, but it's like, this is like a brand new thing about this.

1001
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:13,000
But it's saying, you know, just getting to that point, when science is going to understand it into a biology, or what that is.

1002
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
So you have to be gone to access.

1003
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Right.

1004
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
It might be a simple point of nature.

1005
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Right.

1006
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:28,000
The guy, you know, Gregory Bateson, Andrew Orton, he calls you a nature in four words, people think nature works.

1007
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Those are the words of four.

1008
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,000
If we're just getting to this essence, we don't even know what's there.

1009
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:45,000
If nature is likely intelligent enough to know that it might be like treating the sort of vision that something might come up like a collective unconsciousness.

1010
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I'm curious if you think of the mind and possibilities beyond thinking.

1011
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I think I'd say yes, if I understand the question.

1012
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I think it would be impossible not to be.

1013
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
What do you guys think about the connection of immortality and singularity?

1014
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I mean, here, we're here in the first while, only 35, you know, we've got to reach that.

1015
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
And it talks about patterns, right?

1016
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:22,000
So body parts are replaceable, and computers can record every occurrence or record everything that we do, and therefore create continuity, and therefore reaching a mortality.

1017
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Any thoughts on that?

1018
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Well, Ray's timescale is dictated by his own projected demise, and he's grossly optimistic, obviously, because strong AI has failed in its main agenda.

1019
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:53,000
There's more is a lot of the thing that makes our cyber lives easier is not being replicated in the cohesion of creating a sort of self-organizing framework that replicates in any part the subtlety.

1020
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And forget about reflective thought.

1021
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:21,000
I mean, we're talking about, so someone like an inventor like guy at Carnegie Mellon, I'm just zoning out on his name, and he considers the full amalgam of robotic sensors and a neural net operating in an environment, sort of roboticized neural creature, is something of like a guppy, you know, in its capabilities, not, and not sending.

1022
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And that's probably about fair.

1023
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:33,000
So, and that is so many orders of magnitude away from where you need to be, even in just a mechanistic way of thinking about it, that, so that projection is wrong.

1024
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Is it off the table entirely and impossible?

1025
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Some people think that you have to hold judgment on.

1026
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:50,000
But if you want to take a different view of that, you could say that in the 100 simple, 100 years of computation and computer science, we have traveled to the world.

1027
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:57,000
We have traveled a road in mimicking biological capability that took evolution 3 billion years.

1028
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
That's pretty good acceleration, you know.

1029
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:07,000
So the futurists, the post-humanists, the singularity people are sort of hanging their hats on that a little bit.

1030
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I just want to say one thing about that.

1031
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:19,000
So, for the sake of argument, even if I were to bracket all the theoretical and practical difficulties of carrying these things out, and, you know, I could speak at length about the theoretical and practical.

1032
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
But say, just for the sake of argument, that it was possible.

1033
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,000
It would still not be, in my view, immortality.

1034
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:47,000
As long as there is dependence on the material support, as long as it's not entirely spiritual to know what that was asking you, there is still the possibility of malfunction that things can, and that possibility of malfunction and that destructibility is not just, that's part of why that existence would still matter to me,

1035
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
even if it was possible.

1036
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:57,000
So I don't think that those are various, there might be other problems with those types of projects and file experiments, but I don't think it's a problem of immortality.

1037
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:13,000
As long as more recognizes that there is material support that enables that sort of existence, because as long as there's that, it's still, it's not corporeal in the sense of an organic body, but it is material in the sense of something that can be destroyed.

1038
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:26,000
And so as long as those things don't spin off into a fantasy that we could be entirely spiritual beings, again, I don't think whatever problems it would be, it wouldn't be those sort of those things.

1039
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,000
And the moral of this is should not have used GE parts.

1040
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
What quick follow-up?

1041
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Would that help us with our accepting our debts?

1042
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I mean, if we came close to it, if we knew that we would continue on, if it's not just a movie, it's something very close to us.

1043
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Would we then accept death in a better way?

1044
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:53,000
It depends on what, I find this idea of accepting death very obscure, and I find that people mean very different things with it.

1045
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,000
In my view, it would usually mean denying death at the end of the day when they're talking about accepting death.

1046
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:05,000
So it would all depend on what you mean by the acceptance of death.

1047
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
It doesn't matter if I exist or if I don't exist.

1048
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
That seems like a horrible thing.

1049
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I think our next person is going to ask questions, can clarify some of these points.

1050
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
I'm going to talk from a clinical perspective.

1051
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:34,000
I have the privilege of working with some people who are dying, and what's interesting is our discussion is all about how we feel about death from the point of view of being healthy and somewhat young.

1052
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,000
When you're in a position where you're dying, you have a very different perspective.

1053
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:45,000
As Sheldon could probably tell you, people who are dying are not as afraid of death as you would imagine.

1054
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:51,000
In fact, some people, as they get sicker, look forward to dying.

1055
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
There's a wish for death.

1056
01:44:53,000 --> 01:45:08,000
In fact, we have a group of patients that we call, they have a wish for hasten death, and some of those, as you know, sign up for programs to die by their own hand in their own way.

1057
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I think that as your life begins to diminish, and the burdens of living become greater, and you have less to look forward to.

1058
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:25,000
You look forward to death as a kind of release or a freedom.

1059
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Again, if you talk to patients, they don't so much think about the fact that they're not going to exist, but they have all kinds of defense mechanisms.

1060
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:43,000
In which there is some sense that they will go on in some form or other.

1061
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Some of them feel that their body will die, but their spirit will continue.

1062
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:59,000
As some have said, as we get closer to death, or those of us who are in the foxholes all become quite religious.

1063
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:03,000
People do become more religious as they get closer to death.

1064
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Many people believe that they are, as Ed said, going to reunite with their family.

1065
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:20,000
There are all kinds of fantasies that play into making the process of dying much less frightening to somebody who's facing death.

1066
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Perhaps the discussion should be about learning something more from people who have actually got close to death or dying.

1067
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
For those of us who are still living are afraid of dying.

1068
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,000
They're less, they can teach us a great deal to make us less afraid.

1069
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
It seems to me that you're describing two very different things.

1070
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:50,000
I mean, one is an example of someone because of the physical or psychological suffering at late stage in life.

1071
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:55,000
You actually want to, you can say like comparatively in this situation.

1072
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I look forward to not existing.

1073
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:03,000
That's very different than looking forward to living on as a spirit or reuniting with your family.

1074
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
In your second example, there's no acceptance of death at all.

1075
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
It's a denial of death, saying.

1076
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
It's the same time.

1077
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Yes, but I'm saying they're very different psychological responses.

1078
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
They're extremely different.

1079
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:19,000
In fact, if what I'm looking forward, if what I want is for my consciousness to end because I'm suffering,

1080
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:26,000
then the second perspective that I will actually not cease to be, that I will have honest spirit, you know, is those are totally different reactions.

1081
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
So there's also some contradictory.

1082
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
But that's how really the mind works.

1083
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:38,000
The mind is not a linear function at very different levels.

1084
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:43,000
People will talk about just what you're saying on the one hand and the other hand.

1085
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:49,000
So they'll say they'll look forward to dying and to ending their life, and the same person will then say,

1086
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:56,000
and then I can be together with my parents and my sister who's dead.

1087
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
And the way they might talk about it, they'll be there perfectly healthy.

1088
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,000
So we're capable of those kinds of inconsistencies.

1089
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Of course, but that's because they're actually still afraid of death, and I sympathize with that.

1090
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:12,000
But I wouldn't say that those are testimonies to how you are not afraid of death or have come to terms with death.

1091
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:18,000
That seems to me that whole testimony you're giving is a testimony to how incredibly difficult it is to face the prospect of dying

1092
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
and how many contradictory fantasies you come up with to shield off that prospect.

1093
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:31,000
And I have a lot of empathy with that, but I don't think it is an example of how someone who has accepted death.

1094
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:37,000
And again, I think that people do accept that many of them.

1095
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:47,000
In your clinical experience, have there been patients who convinced that there is nothing to live death, and no fantasies for those consequences

1096
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:52,000
that you did with chapter life, who are also interested in pacing their death?

1097
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Yes.

1098
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I think we'll...

1099
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Absolutely.

1100
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I mean, you learn a tremendous amount about how adaptable the mind is when you talk to people who are dying.

1101
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
There are great teachers of how to deal with life.

1102
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
In fact.

1103
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Okay, thanks.

1104
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
He works with Memorial Day.

1105
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I would say first of all, I really appreciate that you came here for a conversation and you didn't come and read your statements.

1106
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:35,000
I think we'd all be much better off if we went with Polly and lived in the present, but aren't we pretty much stuck with Adam

1107
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:42,000
and in that there's a evolutionary advantage to living in the future.

1108
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:49,000
And those people are the ones who survived.

1109
01:49:49,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Well, it is arguable as a 12th century Zen writer named Dogen said that the future occurs in the present, the past occurs in the present.

1110
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:12,000
And because of that, there really isn't a present either.

1111
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:21,000
But things arise in the present and we pay attention in terms of the way we direct our actions.

1112
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:34,000
And so there we can direct our thoughts and actions towards the imagined future and also our prefrontal cortex tends to head us in that way

1113
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,000
towards prediction and reliability, that sort of thing.

1114
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:46,000
At the same time, we can become aware that we're doing that and that there are choices within the present.

1115
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
As it arises, it's about three to ten seconds.

1116
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
It's not an absolute present.

1117
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:59,000
But we can become aware of what is going on and where we want to direct our awareness.

1118
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:05,000
And that's really what's meant by living in the present.

1119
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:18,000
So it's not avoiding prediction or the future, nor is it avoiding thoughts and feelings about the past, but the recognition that those are taking place in the present.

1120
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:25,000
So that's maybe not so different from pattern recognition.

1121
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Yeah.

1122
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Please join me in thanking Laura.

1123
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:42,000
And please, short of my barring the door, please fill out the post round table surveys.

1124
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
We really depend on your feedback.

1125
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Thanks again for coming.

1126
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Thank you.
