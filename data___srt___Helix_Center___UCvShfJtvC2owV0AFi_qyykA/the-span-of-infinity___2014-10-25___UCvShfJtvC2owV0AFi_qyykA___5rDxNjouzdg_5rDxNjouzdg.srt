1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I think she's going to put a thought in the lineup for a while.

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Mike?

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I am.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I am.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I am.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I am.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I am.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I am.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I am.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I am.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I am.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I am.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I am.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I am.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I am.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I am.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I am.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I am.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I am.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I am.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I am.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I am.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I am.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I am.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I am.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I am.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I am.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I am.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I am.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I am.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I have the latest book.

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I came out in April.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's called Your Digital Afterlives.

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I like all these infinite computer things.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If you have infinite computers you have infinite minds.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I like all these infinite things.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
computer things. So if you have infinite computers, you have infinite minds, you have infinite

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
... get all kinds of fun.

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, you can move. There's a lot of slack.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, you turn around.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Are we both on the same... oh, we're on two different lines.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, we're on two different lines. Okay.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They're slack-shaking.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, I spent this week with Hugh, and we were working on a grant project, and we spent a week with these two other guys.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We had this little house at this little hotel in Norwich, Vermont.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, and then we would work on this grant and then do other stuff in the morning.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Remember him having, you know, his own private language and his own notations.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No one... no one but he could read.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You're okay? You got your papers?

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, please. I'm going to get the papers.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I just have this.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well, you know, I mean, I would normally actually wear a tie, but I thought, you know, reading the stuff that it was a little...

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
maybe I didn't want it to be too formal. Right.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And so usually I usually do this. I mean, either I'll have the tie, I'll take it off, or I'll bring it and then put it on.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, but the bringing it and putting it on in a certain sense is more economical than this.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That seems roughly speaking half the time you don't have to do anything.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But of course, the other way it's also... you don't have to do anything, but you did something before, when you put it on.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You actually found the most economical method.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But not by design. That was a complete accident.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I just... I just that the last minute thought, you know, I better bring this.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Because I had thought of not because I thought it would just be too formal.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And so, you know...

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
... this is what I see there in the round.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So there are people all around us.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, we get recorded, don't we?

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We get...

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I wonder if one of us should maybe sit over there so the more people can sit to see.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Because all these people are looking at the backs of our heads.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Well, but all of those people.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, but...

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And some of them.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I mean...

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But I'm going to sit beside Joel. I'm going to move.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're going to leave me all by myself.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm going to sit beside Joel.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm going to sit beside Joel.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No, she said...

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hey, can I ask you?

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Suppose I wanted to change seats and go over there.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Because otherwise most of our back heads are to the back of most of the audience.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's fine too.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, I'm going to...

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's fine.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Man, this is demanding.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, you're going to remind me.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
There you go.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Now we have a couple of people here.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, you should expect that, yeah, from the philosophers.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hello?

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I tried.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Is this on?

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I suppose that people do want to look at us.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
They can go over to the other side.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So what do you provide products for?

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Most of the audience.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay, we're going to get started.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Sorry.

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No.

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No.

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No.

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you all for coming this beautiful day.

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm Rob Penzer, the associate director of the Helix Center.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I have some announcements before I introduce our esteemed participants.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
On Wednesday, November 5th at Alumni Hall at NYU Langone Medical Center.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The Helix Center is co-sponsoring with the Jungian Psychoanalytic Association, a round table synchronicity and other matters.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's a continuation of a Helix Center round table of April 2014.

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And moderator and Jungian analyst Beverly Zabriski is again joined by physicists Harold Altman-Spacher and Edgar Chorari, Jungian analyst, and scholar Farzad Mahushin.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This event is free and open to the public, but pre-event registration is required and is limited and may be obtained either through the Jungian Psychoanalytic Association website or in response to an email announcement you may have received with a embedded link to registration.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:04,000
On Saturday, November 15th, join us here for our next Templeton Foundation sponsored round table complexity and emergence with physicists Mark Alfred, Krosberg, anthropologist Terrence Deacon, philosopher Timothy O'Connor, physicist and systems biologist,

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Raul Robodin, and astrobiologist Caleb Sharf. Then on Saturday, December 6th, we have French surrealism, a revolution of the mind, a poetry round table with our Helix Center's Anne Marie Levine, a poet and visual artist,

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,000
moderating a discussion with art historian and literary critic Marianne Caus, author and translator Mark Polizotti, and poet Bill Savatsky.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We continue in December on Saturday the 13th with the Templeton round table to search for immortality with astronomer Chris Impey, poet essayist and senior editor at the New Republic, Adam Kirsch,

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
professor of psychology, Sheldon Solomon, philosopher Martin Hagland, and analyst and Buddhist, Paul Young-Eisendroth.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And now to today's round table to span of infinity, which is part of the Templeton Foundation funded series Science and the Big Questions.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If you could raise your hand as I introduce you, Alfred Sharf Goldhaber is professor in the C.N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics and the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Stony Brook University.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He represents the second of three physics generations in his family.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Collaboration with his parents led to what may have been the first mother-son publication, Physics, something of great interest in the House of Psychonalysis here.

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Collaboration with his parents led to what may, I'm sorry, among his research publications are articles on magnetic monopoles,

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
elementary particles, nuclei, condensed matter, and recently cosmology.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He is co-author of numerous review articles. He enjoys hindsight heuristics, asking why people made discoveries later than they might have,

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
understanding of which may better aid future discoveries.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He and Robert Kreese of the Stony Brook Philosophy Department are co-authors of the just released book, The Quantum Moment, focusing on the cultural impact of concepts from quantum mechanics.

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Joel David Hamkins, his professor of mathematics, philosophy, and computer science at the City University of New York,

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
affiliated with the College of Staten Island and the doctoral faculty at the CUNY Graduate School.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He earned his BS at Caltech and a C. Phil and PhD from the University of California, Berkeley.

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He has held faculty positions at numerous distinguished universities throughout the world.

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Professor Hamkins undertakes research in mathematics, particularly set theory with a focus on the mathematics and philosophy of the infinite,

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and has introduced several new infinity concepts.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He has undertaken fundamental work in the theory of infinitary computability,

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
introducing with colleagues Andy Lewis and Jeff Kitter, the theory of infinite time-touring machines,

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and he has made contributions to the theory of infinitary unitarianism.

146
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Reasonally, he has been thinking about infinite chess, which is chess played on an infinite chess board, stretching without bound in every direction.

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Charles New is professor of astrophysics at the City University of New York's College of Staten Island,

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and an associate with the Hayden Planetarium and Department of Astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History.

149
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
His research focuses on colliding galaxies, quasars, and the star formation history of the universe.

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He earned degrees from Harvard University and the University of Arizona, and has held postdoctoral positions at Kit Peacock,

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and the University of Columbia. Together with co-authors Robert Irian and Neil Tyson,

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
he received the 2001 American Institute of Physics Science Writing Award for his book, One Universe at Home in the Cosmos.

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
More recently, he is the author of the Handy Astronomy Answer Book.

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
He and his wife, who he says is way smarter than he is, have three children.

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Eric Steinhardt?

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Professor of Philosophy at William Patterson University grew up on a farm in Pennsylvania.

157
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He received his BS in Computer Science from Pennsylvania State University,

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
after which he worked as a software designer for several years.

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Many of his algorithms have been patented. He earned an MA in Philosophy from Boston College

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and was awarded a PhD in Philosophy from SUNY at Stony Brook.

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He has taught in the Philosophy Departments at Dartmouth College and William Patterson University.

162
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
His books have concerned Nietzsche, The Logic of Metaphor, Mathematics, and Life After Death.

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Much of his work involves the application of new computational concepts to solve old philosophical problems.

164
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
He loves New England and the American West and enjoys all types of hiking, biking, chess, microscopy, and photography.

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Without further ado, since we only have 90 minutes to talk about infinity, let's begin.

166
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I am the most applied person here, so I should speak last.

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Really not first.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
When I think of infinity, I think of traffic was infinitely bad on the way here,

169
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and that as I pulled up here, a parking spot opened up right in front of me.

170
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The odds of that happening are infinitely small.

171
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
My understanding of infinity is utterly wrong.

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You all should talk about it, but actually I do want to make that point first.

173
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
As an observational astronomer, I will tell you that the universe, as we see it, is probably not infinite.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Our ability to measure something is probably not infinitely precise.

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The universe is not infinitely old, and so in the practical real sense,

176
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
even for astronomy and astrophysics, infinity is not a concept that we can really understand.

177
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Well, how about infinitely many universes?

178
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's something I cannot understand.

179
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Sure you can.

180
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
One, two, three, four, just keep going, man.

181
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's the whole problem.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We can't keep going forever.

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We can't.

184
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So we know that we can't already.

185
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's already true.

186
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We can't see all the way out to the edge of the universe.

187
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We have a cosmic horizon from which we reach.

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If they're different universes, you won't be seeing anywhere.

189
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Now you're throwing the if thing.

190
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
See, so that's not real enough.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm a philosopher, man.

192
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's my point.

193
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I mean, I don't have a telescope.

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But that's my point.

195
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
When I think about what you're saying, it's a question about whether it makes sense to say that infinity really exists or not.

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's an ontological question.

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And apart from this kind of multiverse perspective in physics, then you're saying that there is no infinite in the physical world that we can observe.

198
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But this question about existence, I mean, it also comes up even in mathematical concepts of infinity.

199
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Right now, for example, there's many different kinds of infinity that are studied in mathematics and in set theory.

200
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And one of the main discoveries made by Kantor, right, was that there are different sizes of infinity.

201
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And we have all kinds of different infinity concepts, and we study them and understand them very well.

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But the subject is racked by this kind of philosophical problem that we cannot prove that these infinities exist.

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And not only can we cannot prove it, we can prove that we cannot prove it.

204
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I mean, it goes into the Goethe-Incompleteness theorem and so on.

205
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So many of these infinity concepts are somehow inaccessible to us even mathematically, not just physically, right?

206
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But nevertheless, many mathematicians want to assert, well, there is an inaccessible cardinal, or there is a wooden cardinal, or an almost huge cardinal.

207
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I mean, this enormous hierarchy.

208
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You guys are too negative.

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So the question about whether it makes sense to say that these things exist or not is not just a physical question, but also a mathematical one.

210
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We can't really say for certain that they do.

211
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Well, I think as a non-mathematician, but we have many mathematician friends I admire,

212
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't understand.

213
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Let's see.

214
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Maybe maybe.

215
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, I see it's much too low.

216
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There you go.

217
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
How's this now?

218
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Is that good?

219
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Okay, oh, really good.

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm going to overwhelm you.

221
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Anyway, one of the things that was already indicated by what Joel was saying is that mathematicians have, in a certain sense, a larger world of reality than ordinary people like me, because mathematics has all sorts of objects in it that you cannot get at the corner grocery store,

222
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
but which you can describe an enormous detail you can follow in many, many ways.

223
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The mathematics world has a lot of extra things in it beyond what we can see ourselves.

224
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
One obvious thing is higher dimensional spaces.

225
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We see three space dimensions, and that's it.

226
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Then you can say, okay, today we have space time, so that's four.

227
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Well, that's not necessarily that many, but for the world of mathematics,

228
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,000
there are very interesting things, for example, to say about seven space dimensions, very special properties, and a lot is known about those properties.

229
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't know it, but I know that there are people who do, including somebody who's a near neighbor of mine in the office at Stony Brook.

230
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So mathematics has this richer sense of reality, and in that sense of reality, infinity of various sorts can be manipulated in a variety of ways, for example, classifying degrees of infinity.

231
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And despite the fact that there may be certain things one can't prove, I've never heard of an actual case where somebody said,

232
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:48,000
whoops, I came up against the Girdle in completionist theorem, and I couldn't go any farther, and I wasn't able to figure out what happens.

233
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That just doesn't happen. If it does, can I please?

234
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Let me take issue with something you just said earlier, which is that say these higher dimensional spaces can't be realized physically.

235
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I mean, I can show you a seven dimensional space right here with this bottle, because if we think about how could I position this bottle in space?

236
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I mean, I could put it like this right there, or I could put it over here facing that way, or I could turn it so that the center of the bottle can be anywhere.

237
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's three dimensions right there, just for where is the center, and then which direction is it pointing in?

238
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's another three dimensions that I need to specify, and then I can rotate it, yes.

239
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So this is seven dimensions, right?

240
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But I don't think that's not infinite.

241
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So it's not infinite, but the point is that we're not limited, I mean, in our physical world, we're not just limited to this sort of plain understanding.

242
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But I think you guys, in both physics, I mean, mathematics expands a little more than physics and so does philosophy.

243
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I mean, we have to ask questions about why this universe exists at all, and why does it have the structure that it has at all.

244
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And answering some of those kinds of questions tends to lead us towards deeper mathematical and infinite ideas.

245
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So if we start to wonder not just physically where did our universe come from, a big bang or something like this, but why is there anything at all?

246
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Why does anything with any structure exist at all?

247
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Why does mathematics work at all in physics, especially when the mathematics seems to involve, at least in the background, various kinds of infinities.

248
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And so for the philosopher, certainly reality is not limited to the physical world either.

249
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And I think obviously different opinions on whether or not God exists or whether or not there are other kinds of infinite structures, perhaps infinite minds that maybe aren't divine.

250
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But infinity has played a very large role in philosophical thinking about objects and structures that may be much larger, infinitely larger than the physical universe, and which the physical universe would require in order to exist at all.

251
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So I think you guys are a little too skeptical.

252
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, you mean skeptical in the sense of saying we don't know if there can be such a thing as infinity, and either one of you can say, we do know there is such a thing as infinity.

253
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What kind of skepticism are you talking about?

254
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Well, I think that the skepticism, I guess, would be to say that probably, okay, you can't see infinite structures through a telescope or a microscope or touch them or find a particle collider.

255
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But one might wonder why the mathematics that describes the particles and the collider works or why the telescope can be pointed at all.

256
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And so it seems like physics, my argument would be that physics presupposes infinity, even if our universe happens at night.

257
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't quite see the presupposition except in the sense it's certainly true that physicists are very free about thinking about infinite space or possible infinite energies and so forth.

258
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:24,000
They certainly can formally consider them, but a crucial aspect of the formal consideration is that when they're all finished, the infinity should drop out and they should have a set of finite quantities they can talk about.

259
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So they can use it definitely as a conceptual aid, and I think that's what you were saying philosophers do too.

260
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But that's a somewhat different thing.

261
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I wanted to just add one other thought, which is infinity, oh, I wanted to add two other thoughts.

262
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The first one was, why stop there?

263
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm not promising. I mean, you could go in from here. The first thought was, I was told, I'm sure all of us were told, don't prepare for this session.

264
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And I was thinking about that later, and it's a little bit like when somebody is saying, I have trouble going to sleep, and he's told, there's a perfect way to go to sleep.

265
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You just don't think of an elephant.

266
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Of course, once you've been told that, you're stuck.

267
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But in a similar way, with any topic, but particularly with this one, if you're told, don't prepare, nevertheless, the mental processes subconscious or not are going along.

268
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And undoubtedly, are going to give a different result from what would have happened if we'd received the letter of invitation and by a special helicopter, we were jetted in here within a few minutes after having received the invitation.

269
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I think he would have gotten a very different result.

270
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So don't prepare is a slightly...

271
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But we'll apply for that grant, if we can get it.

272
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That sounds like a very good idea. So that was one thing I wanted to say.

273
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Another thing is that infinity, if you take it literally going back, means just something that doesn't end.

274
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And we all know about things that don't end. The most simple and beautiful, perfect example, I think, is the edge of a circle.

275
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Imagine a tunnel that's in a circular direction, goes all the way around, and you're going in it, and the edges are very smooth and so forth.

276
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
There's no telling when you're supposed to stop or start.

277
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And so, therefore, you can go on forever. I don't know who's doing this.

278
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I don't think so.

279
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Ah.

280
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
We all got it.

281
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah.

282
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't know if we're still on the air, but in any case, we're not making a lot of extra noise.

283
00:22:47,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So, infinity as endless is something we definitely can all experience, and we can conceive of infinity in the sense of going around that circle an infinite number of times, but we cannot perceive it.

284
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
We cannot achieve it.

285
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So, it's something we can think about. We can conceive of it.

286
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And it's invaluable. I think it's one of the great things that has come with modern thinking. I don't know whether the cavemen had it at all or not, that they could imagine things which they don't actually see, don't actually experience, and by manipulating them in their minds,

287
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
they could get orientation about things that are very important to them.

288
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And so, infinity may or may not exist in quotes in the sense that one can somehow or other prove that there is an infinity dimension of the universe or something of that sort.

289
00:23:46,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That may not be true, but it nevertheless is an extraordinarily useful concept which has been going on at least since the days of the Greek philosophers, probably not sure that cavemen didn't have ideas about it.

290
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But one of the most famous early examples of somebody so to speak, spiritually using infinity was the famous paradox of Zeno.

291
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The idea there was, in its simplest form, you are trying to reach a certain target. On the way, you have to go halfway.

292
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:30,000
After that, you have to go another halfway. After that, you have to go another halfway. And there is an infinite set of points you have to pass, which means you couldn't possibly ever get a point of view.

293
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And you could possibly ever get to the destination.

294
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Sure, you could.

295
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Well, of course. But the original form of that was talking about a hair which has fallen asleep and now is trying to run and catch up with a tortoise.

296
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And that was the example in which Zeno liked to express this.

297
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So there's another form, Zeno's paradox, which says, in that form, the conclusion is that you can't ever arrive there because before you arrive there, you have to get halfway there.

298
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And before that, you have to get halfway there again and so on.

299
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And you can't do all these infinitely many things, therefore you cannot arrive.

300
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But with Zeno, one of his original formulations was that you cannot even ever start.

301
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And so it's often described under the phrase, all motion is impossible.

302
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Because before you get all the way there, you have to have gotten halfway there.

303
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
But before you get halfway there, you have to have gotten halfway to halfway.

304
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And before you do that, you have to have gotten halfway to that.

305
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So in fact, you can't even ever start, right? This is, I think, a more compelling way to disagree.

306
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Well, that's not... But I don't think that those things... Those are old things.

307
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I mean, right now we know we have the mathematics that's used in physics.

308
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's interesting to apply that mathematics to the mind.

309
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's very interesting to apply it to larger concepts.

310
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And one doesn't have to be religious to think about infinitely great beings that could think infinitely great thoughts

311
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and have infinite memories and infinite computer.

312
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Well, you find these things in literature.

313
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You find them in, you know, boarhaste and things.

314
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And people who have described infinite structures that are combinatorially infinite and that contain all possibilities.

315
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Now, Leibnitz talked about the Palace of the Fates, which was an infinite structure, like an infinite hotel.

316
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And every room contained another possibility, right?

317
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And there are infinitely many possible universes and so infinitely many rooms in this hotel, or this palace, as he called it.

318
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And it's fascinating to think of what modern math enables us to... How it enables us to approach those ideas and those structures

319
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
when you think about the possibility of infinite computers that you've worked on.

320
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And those are... I mean, it strikes me that infinity is always the best bet.

321
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You know, if I had to bet, if there is... If I was told that there's something that exists, and I had to say, is there one of it?

322
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Are there many of it? Or are there infinitely many?

323
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I think picking infinitely many would be the most reasonable thing.

324
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Because otherwise, you're... Yeah?

325
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's a math-imatically sure. But in reality, this is the thing we're talking about.

326
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I think Fred brought it up very, very well. I had not even thought until just now as an example of my poor preparation.

327
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
That the infinite loop in computer science is truly actually an example of infinity.

328
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But you can't actually run an infinite loop an infinite number of times, unless you have an infinite amount of time,

329
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
which we don't think we do because there might be more infinite amount of time in the future.

330
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But in the past, we know that the universe began.

331
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
That time, as we understand it scientifically, if we think science actually is true,

332
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
our particular universe started at a time, T equals zero.

333
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So if you want to think about stuff that is not real, go ahead.

334
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Does it say not real? You just mean not physical?

335
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And maybe I should be more correct.

336
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Or not in our universe.

337
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Not in our universe, not...

338
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That's an official.

339
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I can believe that. I'm cool.

340
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I think this question of existence is really quite fascinating.

341
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
In mathematics, we make existence claims all the time.

342
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
There is a number x such that if you're not, it's equal to two.

343
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So what does it really mean, though, to say there is a number such that...

344
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Well, maybe you mean something like, well, if you write down two points, whatever it is,

345
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
or some number between two and three, you can write down more and more digits.

346
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And when you square that, you get a number that's really, really close to two.

347
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
If it's a little bit too small, then you're going to get 1.99 something.

348
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
If it's a little too big.

349
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
So we can sort of zero in.

350
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Well, what do we really mean when we say there is a number x such that when you square it, you get two.

351
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And I think it's a highly problematic thing.

352
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And so mathematics is full of these kind of existence claims.

353
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
There is a topological space that's, you know, Lindelof, but not her editor, Lindelof,

354
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
or whatever kind of existence claim you're making in mathematics.

355
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
What does it really mean to say that something exists?

356
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So there's this subject called set theory, which is trying to answer this question

357
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and provide a kind of foundation for these kind of mathematical existence claims,

358
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
you know, to set all of these kind of existence claims in mathematics in one system.

359
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And I think it succeeded fairly well.

360
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And if you think about it, you realize that actually the physical existence claims are even more problematic.

361
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I mean, we can see there's this table here, and I can knock on it, and it feels solid, and so on.

362
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And so it seems that there is a table here, but what does it mean for something to exist physically?

363
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's completely mysterious.

364
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I mean, it's related to the philosophical question about that.

365
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Why is there something rather than nothing?

366
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's not the question I'm talking about.

367
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That's just the question, why is there something?

368
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But what does it mean to exist physically?

369
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't think you have any idea.

370
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You cannot give an account of it.

371
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You can observe the moons of Jupiter and someone and say, well, they exist,

372
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and there are really moons orbiting Jupiter.

373
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But what does it mean for something to exist physically?

374
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's completely mysterious.

375
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And in comparison, in mathematics, if I say, well, there's a set containing the empty set, and that's it, and no other members,

376
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
we can give a pretty coherent account of what that means.

377
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I think much more coherent than any kind of explanation of what it means for something to exist physically.

378
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Okay.

379
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Then...

380
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You guys are not hooked now.

381
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I know Joel makes excellent points.

382
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
If we posit that the existence of something called infinity is just as valid as the existence of this table,

383
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
then please educate.

384
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I can tell you a table is this round thing on which several bottles of water and several cough drops are sitting?

385
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
What is infinity?

386
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Can you educate me, for example, of Georg Cantor's original idea of many different kinds?

387
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Can you give me three or four different kinds of infinities, and which kind is actually more infinite than the other kinds?

388
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Sure, he can do that.

389
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yes.

390
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
If you could do that, then we can start asking ourselves how real really is infinity.

391
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I won't interrupt you because I know it's very hard to do.

392
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But once you say that...

393
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yeah.

394
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Because, for example, your example of a square root of two is excellent.

395
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
The square root of two is a number that if you multiply it with itself, you will get exactly two.

396
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Okay.

397
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
But you can't write it down.

398
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You can spend from now till 10,000 years from now writing on a piece of paper all the digits that come after the point 1.4.

399
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:45,000
2, 1, 3, 5, bah-dah-dah-dah. You can get arbitrarily close to two, but you will never actually reach two.

400
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So how can you say this number exists if you can't even write it down in its entirety?

401
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So from that, please educate me because I would like to know how I can reconcile these realities.

402
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Well, I mean, one thing you can say, what Cantor proved right is that the infinity of the natural numbers.

403
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So the natural numbers are the numbers that start with zero and go zero, one, two, three, and so on.

404
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And most people feel that they have a pretty good sense that that's a coherent concept, a description of natural numbers.

405
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Piano wrote down the axioms of the piano of the natural number system, and it's involving induction and so on.

406
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So this is the size of this set is one kind of infinity.

407
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And then there's another kind of infinity that Cantor looked at, which is the infinity of the continuum.

408
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So this is the number of points, say, on the number line.

409
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
If you think that every point on the number line can be described with a real number by its coordinates.

410
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So it's a little bit less than two and a half and more than two and so on, and you can give it, say, its digits, you know, 3.14159 or so, you know, whatever the number happens to be on the number line.

411
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So this is the infinity of the continuum or of the real numbers.

412
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And what Cantor proved is that these are different infinities.

413
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So there are simply more real numbers than there are natural numbers.

414
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And the proof is not difficult because what does it mean to say that two infinities are the same?

415
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Two infinite sets have the same size?

416
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Well, it should mean that you should be able to match them up.

417
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
There should be a kind of correspondence between them.

418
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So suppose that we could make a list.

419
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I mean, the natural numbers can be put on the list, you know, there's the 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on.

420
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So if we could put all the real numbers on such a list,

421
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
suppose we had a list that included all real numbers.

422
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Now I can describe a new real number which is not on the list and that will be a contradiction then.

423
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Proving that it was impossible to have all the numbers on the list.

424
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And the new real number that you make is just the one so that in the first digit, it's different from the first number on the list.

425
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And in the second digit, it's different from the second number on the list and so on.

426
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
So this is called the diagonal argument because these digits go on the diagonal.

427
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So what Cantor proved is that for any proposed list of real numbers,

428
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
you can calculate a number that is not on that list.

429
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And therefore, it's impossible in principle to put all the real numbers onto one list.

430
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And so it's a bigger infinity because if they were the same size, you could put it on the list.

431
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's what it would mean to have the same size.

432
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But of course he proved it.

433
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's not just that there's two infinities.

434
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
They keep going.

435
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I mean, a more general version of the argument shows.

436
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
In fact, you always get bigger and bigger infinities.

437
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And the number of infinities is bigger than any given infinity.

438
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's not just that there's so many.

439
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Well, this challenge, I want you to, I mean, you guys raised the key question about infinity and about the existence issue.

440
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And just let me go back to both of you.

441
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I don't want to talk much here because I want to raise the thing.

442
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah. I mean, because if we ask you guys, Joel asked about what does it mean to exist when you say physicists say exists.

443
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And it starts out with something that's very elementary and it seems like, yeah, I can touch it.

444
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But that's of course not what you mean.

445
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And as soon as we start to ask you, you'll tell us about, you know, particles, about molecules and atoms.

446
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And so we'll have less than atoms.

447
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Well, but it'll keep going.

448
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It gets worse, right?

449
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Because we'll say, well, what's an atom?

450
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And you'll say, well, yeah, there's some electrons and protons and newton.

451
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I say, oh, that's great.

452
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
What's a neutron?

453
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And you'll say, well, there's some quarks.

454
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And they're bad.

455
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And I'll say, well, what's a quark?

456
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And as we go further down in all this, it just dissolves into more and more equations.

457
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And I say, well, what's a quark?

458
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And you say something, well, there's this field and there are these quantizations of the field.

459
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And there's going to be these incredibly complex mathematical operators that, you know, transform the field in certain ways into itself.

460
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And so physical existence, to get back to Joel's point, because I think Joel's right about this.

461
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I mean, I think so, physical existence really ultimately seems to dissolve into mathematical existence.

462
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And if you're committed to that, then you might as well just go with the whole cantorian set theoretic hierarchy

463
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:00,000
and say, well, the physical universe is just one small structure in this enormously linear structure.

464
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Because whatever, whatever, as a philosopher, I want to know about existence, the clearest accounts of existence,

465
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
since I think Joel is right, the clearest accounts of existence are the accounts that you find in set theory.

466
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I mean, those guys don't have any confusions about the data.

467
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I was thinking, I mean, it's the clearest.

468
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I just say it's more clear to me.

469
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Well, I'll say it's the clearest.

470
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Such a kind of simpler, for example, some kind of number theoretic assertion that there's an odd prime bigger than five or something.

471
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Okay, so it's pretty clear that there is one, you know, seven, for example, it's an odd prime bigger than five.

472
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And so this is in existence coming in mathematics. It is clear, and it seems more clear to me than any kind of physical assertion about,

473
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I mean, what it means to say that something physically exists.

474
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I just have no idea what that means, and I'm not really satisfied by your account or any account that's talking about even atoms

475
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
and so on, because I just still don't know what it means to exist.

476
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah, and I agree with him.

477
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I mean, it's not clear what it means to say that without using the mathematics,

478
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
and once you've used the mathematics, then the mathematicians win.

479
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Right, I mean...

480
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Let me try to wield Fred as my instrument of redemption here.

481
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
He just said, from the physics point of view, that you can have an infinite something, like a wave function,

482
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
but eventually it collapses down to something finite, like a quantum number,

483
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
that then defines the state of something that we would call a particle that exists.

484
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Perhaps the right way to think about infinity is to accept that infinity exists,

485
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:52,000
but it exists to serve the finite, that we are satisfied, and we must be satisfied with what is finite and what is tangible,

486
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:01,000
but to explain it to a satisfactory level, we need to resort to something which is not tangible and finite, that is the infinite.

487
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Fred's quantum mechanical or general particle physics, shall we say,

488
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
expertise can address that much better than my astronomical astrophysical expertise.

489
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's interesting. You said that I had said something which I didn't remember saying,

490
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
so instead of trying to follow up exactly on that...

491
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Sorry about that.

492
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Instead of trying to follow up exactly on that, I want to talk about an interesting thing people have been saying just now.

493
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You have tables made of molecules made of atoms, and the atoms have this and them and that in them,

494
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and that reminds one of the old saying, big fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite them,

495
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
and so it goes on and on in finite them.

496
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
But in the case of the world, the physicists have been trying to explore,

497
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:06,000
there have been two issues over the last 50 years, I would say, that have come up in elementary particle theory.

498
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,000
One is that people didn't see how the elementary particle theory could be completed,

499
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
how as you went to smaller and smaller distance scales and tried to describe what was going on,

500
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
you could get a consistent picture.

501
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
In fact, if you tried the ideas that you had, they didn't seem to quite work.

502
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And so there is something now called the standard model, and many of you may have heard,

503
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,000
that there was one remaining thing to put into the very center of the standard model,

504
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:49,000
the Higgs particle and the Higgs particle was apparently found at Seren last two years ago by now.

505
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So that was apparently or was found?

506
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Well, apparently meaning the general opinion which I would share is it was found,

507
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
and the interesting thing is whether one should or shouldn't have been surprised.

508
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But in any case it was found, and it completed the standard model.

509
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Now, here's the problem.

510
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
The standard model is now complete.

511
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
No exceptions of any sort have been found to the predictions associated with the standard model.

512
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But according to our best way of doing mathematical analysis of the model, it isn't complete.

513
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
There is something missing about it.

514
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Well, it might turn out that that isn't true.

515
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,000
No, that's just what it is, and we won't find anything more, because there isn't anything more.

516
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:47,000
If so, that would be an end to this big fleas and little fleas, an end which would surprise many of us,

517
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
but it's conceivable.

518
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Now, turning it around the other way, there are many people who have suggested that something called string theory

519
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
has the tools that you could use to provide a basis for the standard model.

520
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And string theory ran into a big problem, which didn't involve infinity, but it involved a very large number,

521
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:19,000
something like the natural exponential of 500, which is pretty big.

522
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And so people said, well, this is a disaster. This theory isn't really very well defined if there are

523
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
500, 8 to the 500 different initial conditions you could put on it.

524
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So then other people said, ah, this explains everything, because the reason we have a world where one of these conditions was chosen

525
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
is because if we're here and we can observe our world, then that must be the one that it was.

526
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And other than that, it was a completely random event, and somewhere or another, there may be an infinity of other

527
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
universes, which are totally different, which don't have people, but maybe do have giraffes.

528
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So the problem, the interesting thing is, the problem that was posed was of a very large, but still finite number,

529
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
that somehow said, well, how can you possibly deal with such a big number in your theory?

530
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
But it wasn't even infinite at all.

531
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It could have been that string theory would have turned out to have an infinite number of possible solutions,

532
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
but at least is now understood that isn't the case.

533
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And that large, large number was deemed to be already too large, and people said, oh, what's going to happen next?

534
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Well, at the moment, there is absolutely zero evidence that anything is going to happen next,

535
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and that maybe there is some different logic which we haven't quite yet understood, which will say the standard model

536
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
really is complete and consistent once we've added that extra feature.

537
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
If that were the case, we could say that if it happened, I'm not saying it will, we could say elementary

538
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,000
particle physics has been pursued to the end, and the end was not infinitely far away.

539
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,000
That is at least a possible thing that could have happened, and it wouldn't be the first time somebody has suggested something like that,

540
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
because if you go back to Lucretius with his hard little particles,

541
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:34,000
then the way he looked at it, and the way Newton later looked at it very explicitly, was there was no way of breaking these particles apart.

542
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So maybe there is something like that, and we just haven't quite realized it yet.

543
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Well, why would that? I mean, the question that I would still ask is, even if our universe happens to have this logical

544
00:43:46,000 --> 00:44:00,000
code, that's no argument that there aren't other universes, and I would ask you the question, you said maybe we should be satisfied with the finite,

545
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and I am completely unsatisfied with the finite. I think that some mathematicians and philosophers have said that

546
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:18,000
it's not infinity that's weird, it's the finite that's weird, because from the perspective of infinity the finite looks badly broken.

547
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And so why, when I think of, if I think of things like, I hear all this well, we can't get there, we can't go that far, we can't go around the circle infinitely many times,

548
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:38,000
because I guess my life will come to an end. Now, there certainly are lots of philosophers and theologians who have said, well, no it won't.

549
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:47,000
There are people who argue either for infinitely long lives, immortality, there are people who argue for even an infinite sequence of finite lives,

550
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:58,000
maybe through reincarnation, and that wouldn't have to be in this universe, it could be Buddhists and Hindus, as well as Western thinkers have argued for a plurality of universes with a plurality of incarnations,

551
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:10,000
which seems to me to be far more satisfying than the messy little finite life that I have. So even if I'm delusional, which is almost certainly true,

552
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:19,000
that wouldn't refute the fact that I'm not satisfied. Even if all I get for dinner is green beans and I don't get any ice cream,

553
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:29,000
that doesn't mean I'm satisfied with it. And I know mom and dad are going to say, Eric, you should be satisfied, but I'm not satisfied.

554
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I still want, and it seems like my hopes and desires, which has often been expressed religiously, and even if that's false, it's still the hope is true.

555
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It's still true that I have a hope for a kind of infinitely rich life and a kind of infinite richness of meaning.

556
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And the torture, of course, of being human is that even if I'm finite, I can conceive of that.

557
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And that variability to conceive of an infinity beyond the petty little finitude of my life is exactly the itch that makes me, that I need to scratch, and that's why I'm not satisfied.

558
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I love that, Eric. I do. It is completely correct. I do have a piece of paper with me later if we have time to share it.

559
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:38,000
The one point that makes me agree with you completely, but the only one, the finite thing that makes me agree with you, about the infinity and thinking about infinity, the dissatisfaction with the finiteness or the finitude of your own existence.

560
00:46:38,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And this is my sort of very practical, experimental scientist kind of reply. I think that there is so much in this finite universe to give us satisfaction for an indefinite period of time that we don't need infinity to go any further in seeking satisfaction.

561
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:21,000
In other words, infinity is almost a construct designed to give us humans a little bit of comfort in what otherwise would be a depressingly limited existence.

562
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:35,000
We don't need an infinite number of things that we could do. 10 to the power of 100 is enough, really. We don't need to live an eternal life.

563
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:52,000
When we die, death of course is frightening to many of us. It is a clear and finite end to the existence that we kind of know of ourselves. Even though, of course, when we were babies, our existence was very different from when we were children, from when we were adults, from when we were elderly.

564
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It all changes and it keeps changing. It is variety, not infinite, but still really rich and very cool. And yet if we're still concerned and worried about that, we say eternal life, infinite existence, reincarnation over and over again, re-existence until all infinity, it gives us comfort.

565
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:33,000
But there is no need for it if we really satisfied that the amount of finite creation or cool stuff in our universe will satisfy for all intents and purposes, and maybe even more than that, our existences and our meaning.

566
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I think I recalled Rob mentioning that Dr. Chris Impe will be here in a program a couple of months from now. I'll tell you now, Professor Impe was on my thesis committee in graduate school, and a wonderful, brilliant, thoughtful man he is.

567
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And that's one of the things he says in one of his books. Life is short, right? It's fleeting. But it is up to us to give it meaning.

568
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And so if we wish to use infinity as a way to give us meaning, thinking, feeling confident that we're going to live forever in one form or another, before, after, during, in paradise or in purgatory or in Hades or whatever, that's cool.

569
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I'm cool with that. But we don't need it. I am satisfied with all the other possibilities that we already know could exist, and that enough is enough to give me meaning and scratch that itch which I'm worried about.

570
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
But he bothers me. Why? Because... Let me jump in here because I want to read something.

571
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Okay. I want to say why you bothered me first, because mathematicians can do this. If I count, if I see you say, ask me, what's the biggest number? And I said, five.

572
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I'd be like, cool. Tell me about fours. Maybe like, oh, four is beautiful. I said, let me jump in.

573
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Let me do this. What you need to live here for feeling like, and what there is, these are two different things. Maybe there is much more than what you need.

574
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I mean, as sort of my kind of personal way of interacting with these ideas is always just to explore whatever is interesting and fun and curious. And if there's an idea on the table, then I want to investigate it and see where it goes.

575
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And so if there's some kind of infinity over here, then I want to look at it. Infinite chess or infinite computation or whatever it is.

576
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And so, for example, you mentioned E to the 500, and you just mentioned 10 to the 100, which is a number also known as a Google. And so I'm reading this contest that Doug Hofstater ran a number of years ago.

577
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And I recently was in Shanghai and ran an experiment of the same kind at Food on University with the students. And the contest was...

578
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So we announced a week before the event that everyone should come and write down on a three by five index card the biggest number that they can. Just describe the biggest number.

579
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You could write, you know, use a description. There was a limit you couldn't use more than 100 characters, you know, standard character set or something.

580
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And so what's the biggest number you can describe on a three by five index card?

581
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:19,000
You could say 10 to the 100, you could say the number of grains of sand in the Sahara Desert, which is actually, I think, a much smaller number than 10 to the 100.

582
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Or... So if you take this 10 to the 100, it's also known as a Google, right? And so one can get much, much bigger numbers than that.

583
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So if you say a Google Plex means 10 to the Google. So a Google is 10 to the 100. That's a one. If you write it in order, it's a one with 100 zeros after it.

584
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:56,000
That's a Google. There it is. You could never maybe count up to a Google. This would take way too long. But a Google Plex, right? This is a one with a Google number of zeros after it. You couldn't even write this one down. It's incomparably larger.

585
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And you can write down other big numbers like, for example, well, a Google bang is a Google factorial, right? So it means a Google times a Google minus one times a Google minus two and so on.

586
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So it's a mind-bogglingly huge number, right? So does anyone know which is bigger, a Google Plex or a Google bang?

587
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Does anyone Google Plex is bigger? I'm not sure. A Google bang is bigger because a Google Plex has a Google number of tens in it.

588
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And a Google bang is the same number of terms, but many of them are much bigger than 10. So, okay, well, then you could also say, what's bigger, a Google bang Plex bang bang or a Google Plex bang bang plex?

589
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Or, you know, you have a kind of vocabulary for referring to these enormous numbers. They're absolutely finite. But these are mind-bogglingly huge numbers.

590
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:59,000
There's also a Google stack, which means 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 and so on, a Google number of times, right? And so this number is just really enormous.

591
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
But you can just say a Google stack. It easily fits on a three by five index card, right? So if I write this number, then.

592
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So one of the thing about the contest that Hofstadter did, in which I did in Shanghai also, was that we announced a prize and the base of the prize was a million dollars.

593
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So whoever would write on the biggest number would get the prize. The prize was not a million dollars. The base, the actual prize awarded was a million dollars divided by the winning number.

594
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And so...

595
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
But the winning number was...

596
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
We're not paying you a Google bang.

597
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Yeah.

598
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,960
So I made sure to bring, and I discussed it with the organizers in Shanghai in advance, I brought a few shiny pennies because we announced that the prize would be, you know, double-t

599
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,960
rounded upward to the nearest cent. And so the prize was...

600
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:54,960
Because people submitted these enormous numbers, but it's a lot of fun to think. I mean, with regard to what you're saying, our capacity for describing these big numbers.

601
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:05,960
So with very little space, and with very little sort of short vocabulary, we can describe enormous, finite numbers.

602
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:12,960
And this kind of project, I think, is carried on into the infinite. And this is what the set...

603
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:23,960
The large cardinals and so on. We're describing these enormous infinities that are mind-bogglingly huge, but yet are amenable to our reason and our ability to manipulate them.

604
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:31,960
And it's a lot of fun. Maybe we don't need them to be happy, as Charles says, but anyways, I'm totally interested in them, and I want to figure out what's going on with them.

605
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:42,960
And this does lead, in fact, to the piece of paper that I did prepare at Joel. And again, just like with Eric, I agree with you that thinking about these things and examining them is a great thing.

606
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,960
So did Albert Einstein, actually.

607
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:54,960
But the very fact that we can think about these things suggests to me that we have a capacity to exceed or transcend the finite.

608
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:11,960
Sure, at least in the capacity. But then that means that there's something within me, within even my finitude, that points beyond itself to the infinite and tells me that I cannot be entirely finite.

609
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:18,960
There's something about me that can grasp these infinities. Even mentally, that's fine, because I'm a thinking thing.

610
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:31,960
And so the fact that we can study these infinities, if one tried to conceive of eternal life and it just drew a blank.

611
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:40,960
Because you said, I don't know, is it seven? Is it maybe it's 50 years, or maybe 123 years? That's it.

612
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:50,960
But anyone can conceive of, even in the simple word of, you know, forever, going on forever. And that's even a very simplistic concept of the infinite.

613
00:55:50,960 --> 00:56:05,960
So the fact that I can conceive of the infinite, to me that there's something within me that isn't satisfied with the finite, because there's something in me that points beyond my own finitude.

614
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:14,960
And I can conceive of there being infinitely many universes beyond this universe. However, even if this universe is only finite.

615
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:24,960
And so I'm always suspicious. And I'm happy to think that I might be wrong in thinking that maybe my capacity to think of the infinite is somehow a delusion.

616
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:31,960
I lie to myself all the time in other respects. Why not lie to myself this time? Well, it's something I want, right?

617
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:37,960
I think I'm good looking. You're not lying there, Eric. You're good.

618
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:45,960
Well, you don't know what's going on in here. You'll be very confused. So why not? So, okay, it could be delusional.

619
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,960
But it's not like the other delusions that I have.

620
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:57,960
It's not delusional at all. It is totally okay that you like to think about infinity. And thus, you conclude that there is some part of you which is infinite.

621
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:03,960
I'm cool with that. But that's actually a finite thought process. You have finished it off.

622
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:09,960
In other words, you have become satisfied with the fact that there are parts of you that you will never understand.

623
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,960
I'm not satisfied with that. Well, it bothers me.

624
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,960
Then you can go forward and keep thinking about it just as Joel is describing, which is awesome.

625
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,960
Which is the great thing about life. And so this is the one thing that I wanted to mention. And this is our pal Albert Einstein.

626
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:33,960
Okay, in 1932, he was asked, well, in 1930, he was asked to write something about what he believed about religion and science and so forth.

627
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,960
Over the next intervening years, it got a little bit more codified.

628
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:42,960
Eventually, someone actually recorded on some records what he believed. And he wrote it down.

629
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,960
And the last paragraph of this, we call it a credo, right, that explains what it is.

630
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:53,960
He says, and I tried to translate this in the German as accurately as I can with the help of Julie who was downstairs.

631
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,960
And it goes kind of like this.

632
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:03,960
The most beautiful and deepest experience a man can have is the sense of the mysterious.

633
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:11,960
It underlies and grounds religion as well as all serious efforts in art and science.

634
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:18,960
Me who has never had this experience seems to me, if not a dead person, then is at least a blind person.

635
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:30,960
To sense that behind anything that can be experienced, that there is something that our minds cannot grasp, whose beauty and subliminy reaches us only indirectly.

636
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:40,960
This is religiousness. In this sense, I am religious. It is enough for me to wonder at these secrets and to attempt to grasp humbly with my mind.

637
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,960
A mere image of the lofty structure of all there is.

638
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:53,960
So, the word mysterious in the first part of that paragraph is actually not well translated into English.

639
00:58:53,960 --> 00:59:06,960
It's das gheimnesfollen, which in German kind of means that which is full of secrets, or the secretiveness of everything.

640
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:25,960
In my classes, I often teach, as one of the little bits of philosophy I actually teach, aside from Kantian metaphysics, is that science and non-science are two perfectly valid ways of looking at the universe.

641
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:32,960
They are actually two different ways of seeking knowledge. They do not necessarily have to conflict.

642
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:41,960
People will use religion against science. People will use science against religion, but really science and non-science can coexist just fine.

643
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:50,960
Chris Imbi, who was mentioned on my thesis committee, he team taught cosmology to me and my colleagues, my classmates years ago.

644
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:59,960
His teammate, a priest named Bill Stager, who taught me theoretical cosmology, while Chris taught me the observational side of cosmology.

645
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:19,960
So, really, you can exist side by side. But what Einstein is saying here is, in the sense that he himself, although basically an atheist, considered himself religious, was that he, like those who sought truth non-scientifically, was inspired by this sense, this feeling of mysteriousness.

646
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:36,960
In that sense, I am in complete agreement with you all. We are finite. It is enough to be finite and to quest for the infinite. And that span of infinity inspires us to be more and more all the time, without having to be more and more all the time.

647
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:49,960
But you make it sound like it is a kind of beneficial thing for infinity to be mysterious. But of course, the history of science is that we come to understand things more. And in mathematics, this is also true.

648
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:58,960
I would say that, for example, one of the most important points to make about the sort of mathematical study of infinity is that there has been enormous progress.

649
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:10,960
And that we aren't confused about things that previously were mysterious. For example, even Galileo was confused about the sort of concept of two sets having different...

650
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:23,960
He observed for the number of natural numbers as the same as the number of squares. You know, the numbers 1 and 4 and 2 is where this is 4 and 3 is where it is 9 and 4 is where it is 16 and 25 and so on.

651
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:33,960
Because he saw that correspondence, because you could associate each number, it is square. And so he said, look, the number of numbers and the number of squares have the same size because we can match them up.

652
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:45,960
But it seems in some sense that the number of squares is much less because of course most numbers aren't square. I mean, the squares are kind of spread out and there are all these big gaps between the squares as you go up.

653
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:54,960
And so the point is that he threw up his hands and said, therefore, we don't understand infinity. And maybe even actual infinity is kind of nonsense or mysterious.

654
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:09,960
But now we're no longer confused about this point and canter help us see that, well, this is just part of the nature of these infinite sets, is that a set can have the same size as a proper subset of itself. And this is just how it goes.

655
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:18,960
And so there's a kind of clarity for these notions. Now, whereas under your description, it seems like you were kind of happy that it was mysterious.

656
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,960
But why should you be happy that something is mysterious? That's just another way of saying that you don't understand it, right?

657
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:28,960
If it's mysterious, it's not fundamentally mysterious, it's just that we don't understand it yet.

658
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:35,960
So let's look at it more closely. Let's use our skills and let's grapple with it and try to understand it, yeah?

659
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,960
And history has shown that this is possible often. Thank you for helping me clarify what I was trying to say.

660
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,960
You're exactly right. I am not at all advocating that we stop wondering.

661
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:52,960
What I'm saying is that we should always keep wondering just as you did, just as you described, Galileo gave it up.

662
01:02:52,960 --> 01:03:04,960
Newton also gave up originally, right? He couldn't figure out how the solar system could stay together with his law of gravity until other people later on figured out if you use perturbation theory, you could explain why these complex systems can stay together.

663
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:13,960
So I completely advocate seeking truths or seeking to understand that which is not yet understood.

664
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:22,960
What I want to feel satisfied about and happy about is that there will always remain things that are not understood, and we should keep going.

665
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,960
And don't be sad that we can't explain everything all at once.

666
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:33,960
Even if we, like Fred said, if we're done with particle physics and the standard model is complete, there are still many, many more mysteries left.

667
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:38,960
And I am satisfied with the idea to know that what I know is finite.

668
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:54,960
There is so much more an infinite amount of stuff that is unknown, and I hope we keep pushing at it and going more and more and more, but be happy with what we've got so far, always pushing for the future and knowing that there will always be something mysterious yet to go for.

669
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,960
I hope that's a little bit more clear of what I said. Thank you for giving that opportunity for me to clarify.

670
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,960
I think you gave with one hand and took away with the other.

671
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,960
Did I have a contradiction in there?

672
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:18,960
Not a contradiction as much as I think Joel is right about pointing to the fact that, well, these mysteries, it's a box of secrets that we keep taking secrets out of an understanding.

673
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,960
But the question about satisfaction and design is large there.

674
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:31,960
I can understand that there are mysteries and I can acknowledge that and still say that I'm not satisfied with the finite.

675
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:40,960
And the fact that our studies of the infinite, it would be one thing if we studied the infinite and we just kept coming up with contradictions or nonsense.

676
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,960
You study it and no one could agree.

677
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,960
There's five different mathematicians.

678
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,960
There are 100 different theories and they don't agree.

679
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:55,960
And it's just noise and it starts to look like poetry or it starts to look like.

680
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,960
That was a sly dig.

681
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,960
But it's not.

682
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,960
I mean, they do agree.

683
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:06,960
I mean, the Russell Paradox and all the panitimies in set theory and so on.

684
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,960
Except they were resolved.

685
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:15,960
Sure, but at that time I imagine it was something like what you're describing and completely unsettled in the foundations were totally unclear.

686
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:20,960
I mean, it was resolved.

687
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,960
It wasn't like, oh, we just can't understand let's give up.

688
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:30,960
And what developed was something that is as even more accurate and precise, we turned to mathematics.

689
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,960
We said, I don't know.

690
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,960
Mathematicians probably don't get dust on their telescopes.

691
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,960
We get chalk dust all over our body.

692
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:44,960
So when it turns out to have this logical objective universally agreed upon structure,

693
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,960
it's like it's less and less of a mystery and that there's really something there.

694
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:56,960
And I can acknowledge, of course, that my present body, who I am, is finite.

695
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,960
My present life is finite.

696
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,960
But when I see this structure that seems to have as much truth in it as anything,

697
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:12,960
and a structure, the mathematical structure of infinity, a structure to which even physicists turn when they try to articulate their theories,

698
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,960
then I think that that's the structure that must be the real one.

699
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:25,960
Now, I don't know exactly how I relate to that structure, but I can use my thought to try to make arguments to figure that out.

700
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:32,960
And so I'm a little worried about, if I thought it really is just a box of secrets, then maybe I should stay out of there.

701
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,960
If I keep going on, I see that I can understand more and more of those secrets and they're not mysteries anymore.

702
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:46,960
And so when I see the progress of mathematics and when I see physics turning more and more to mathematics to solve its own problems,

703
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,960
then again, I think that the mathematical structures are the fundamental ones,

704
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:59,960
and I start to think that maybe my capacity to grasp those structures requires that there be some part of me or some aspect of me,

705
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,960
which is infinite too. I mean, I'm going back to that.

706
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:09,960
And so I don't see that there's, I mean, the box of secrets in the box of mysteries just means today I don't understand this.

707
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:18,960
It's not sealed off to us. Now, we are limited, of course, so maybe humanity will never be able to understand certain things, of course.

708
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:24,960
But I'm happy with mystery, but I'm not happy with it being an excuse.

709
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:31,960
That's, I guess, for thinking that there are things that we shouldn't try to understand

710
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:38,960
or that there are things that will forever somehow remain outside of our grasp.

711
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,960
Well, that's a very different statement.

712
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:52,960
I think, for example, that people who believe that their lives are finite, that they are failing to understand and to reach for something which is really there,

713
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,960
because we know about infinite things and so why shouldn't our lives be infinite?

714
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,960
I don't see the logic in that sequence.

715
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,960
I wouldn't quite make that argument.

716
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:03,960
Good.

717
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:16,960
I mean, I don't want to say that my life is infinite, or excuse me, that my life is finite and it's surrounded by an atmosphere of mystery, and that's okay, and I'll leave it at that.

718
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,960
Right? I tend to think that, okay, my present life is finite.

719
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:26,960
I can understand the infinite. Mathematics has these virtues that even physicists use.

720
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,960
Therefore, I'm very suspicious that my life is only finite.

721
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:40,960
But when you say my life is finite, you are saying that intellectually, do you feel your life is finite?

722
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:41,960
Oh, hell yeah.

723
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:42,960
I don't think so.

724
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:49,960
I don't feel how you would be feeling five minutes from now.

725
01:08:49,960 --> 01:09:05,960
And I don't think when you are ten, I think you refer to this, you know, a child is different, is because at any one moment, one doesn't really know intellectually one knows, but emotionally one feels this is it.

726
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,960
Where am today, this moment, this is where I'm going to be.

727
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:18,960
So when you are 40 years old, you don't think I'm intellectually meeting, but you don't really feel what you're going to feel when you're 50 years old.

728
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,960
Or 60 years old or 70 years old.

729
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:31,960
So in terms of the emotions, it seems to me, there is a kind of lack of finiteness.

730
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,960
A lack of finiteness.

731
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:34,960
Yes.

732
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,960
Well, yeah, I would agree.

733
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,960
So there's more infinite than finite.

734
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,960
Yeah, desire is infinite.

735
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:50,960
So in mathematics and in philosophy, one often makes the distinction between the sort of actually infinite and potentially infinite.

736
01:09:50,960 --> 01:10:03,960
And I think it's relevant to what you're saying because, of course, many mathematicians and philosophers held that somehow actually infinite mathematical objects are problematic and don't exist.

737
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,960
We shouldn't ever say that we have something that is infinite all by itself.

738
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:15,960
But for example, the natural numbers are potentially infinite in the sense that if you have a natural number, you can always get a bigger one.

739
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:21,960
And they're somehow unbounded and you can keep getting more and more, even if you have only finitely many at one time.

740
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:36,960
And so what you're describing is a kind of, I mean, to me, it sounds like the way you think about the way you live your life is kind of potentially infinite in the sense that we think of it as kind of not bounded and one can always extend a little bit longer or something.

741
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:50,960
And so the actual infinity, which is, I think, me, your perspective is, and so it's interesting for me to compare those kind of mathematical philosophies with the sort of personal life philosophies that you guys are talking about.

742
01:10:50,960 --> 01:11:08,960
That reminds me, especially speaking of this issue of finite or not finite lifetime, of something that I was very surprised by within the last few weeks.

743
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:25,960
Ezekiel Emanuel, who's the older brother of Ram Emanuel, who ran the Congress for a while and now is running Chicago, and Ezekiel Emanuel announced that he felt it'd be worthwhile to live past the age of 75.

744
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:34,960
Presumably based on observing people he saw who were over 75 and he thought, I wouldn't want to be like that person.

745
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:42,960
And a lot of people, especially anyone over 75 can find this very insulting.

746
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:47,960
But what I found strange about it is, how would he have chosen that particular point?

747
01:11:47,960 --> 01:12:03,960
How would he have said, what are the criteria which say, that's the point when you should really get a little raft or canoe and just paddle yourself out into the water the way, supposedly, the Eskimo's used to do.

748
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:08,960
It's a very strange idea that you can somehow pinpoint it.

749
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,960
So it was the absolute reverse of wondering, where can you find infinity?

750
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,960
I have found the exact precise moment of ideal finiteness.

751
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,960
And that seems at least equally problematic.

752
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:22,960
Yeah, right.

753
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:29,960
If you're going to pick the finite, then you have to pick a finite number and you're going to say 75 years.

754
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:38,960
Why not, and I figure like you think when I'm 75 then I would say, well why not 75 years and a couple months?

755
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,960
And then keep, and so, yeah, that's a problem with the finite.

756
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:49,960
But it bounds itself in a way and yet you can conceive of more.

757
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,960
And if you can conceive of more, you're going to want more.

758
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:59,960
And at least even if thought in some sense has this demand for infinity.

759
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,960
And then mathematicians take this to the extreme, right?

760
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:10,960
We can conceive of countable infinities and then uncountable infinities and measurable cardinals and mallow cardinals

761
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,960
or wooden cardinals and these infinities upon infinities which are those are mind boggling.

762
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,960
You know, once you get beyond the mallows, I'm boggles.

763
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:32,960
So what about the religious idea of eternal life or eternal damnation or eternal paradise or eternal nothingness?

764
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,960
Well you could have or you could have secrets.

765
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,960
Are you cool with that?

766
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:48,960
Can we agree that that impulse to be infinite or eternal came originally from human beings' desire not to be done when we turn to dust?

767
01:13:48,960 --> 01:14:00,960
If that is the case and when for thousands of years now rewarded those who will believe in our way of belief

768
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:07,960
by saying if you believe this way, don't worry, your life can suck now but you will eternally be rewarded, right?

769
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:16,960
And actually it is a sufficiently compelling message that billions of people around the world today are perfectly cool with that.

770
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:28,960
But they don't mean mathematically why is that idea of eternity which is infinite time so comforting?

771
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:34,960
How does it match mathematically with the comfort of saying I don't know what that means but I'm cool with that?

772
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:55,960
If in fact, let's say I've never done this before but let's say we were to ask a devout person who belonged and was inherent to a religion that promised eternal life for someone who believes in this religion, who adheres to this religion.

773
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,960
If you ask that person what does eternal mean to you?

774
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,960
Do you want to be around for a Google stack years?

775
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,960
How would you like to be around during that period of time?

776
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:14,960
Would you like to float on a cloud playing a harp with wings for a Google stack years, right?

777
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:23,960
Would you like to live as you were when you were 16, free and happy, running the world, doing whatever you felt like?

778
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:34,960
But in five billion years the sun is going to turn earth into a thousand years.

779
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:41,960
The sun's heat will be so great that it will have already wiped out all life as we know it on the surface of the earth.

780
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:54,960
Can people really grasp that mathematically? No, this is something that was created sociologically.

781
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,960
This is a great opportunity for anyone in this room to think about.

782
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:07,960
I mean, created because there was a need to create it or was created as some kind of sociological rule.

783
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:15,960
This is what I don't know. But it is conceivable. I mean, and it's not all, there are obviously many different religions in the Abrahamic traditions.

784
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:19,960
You often have that notion of an eternal life forever living.

785
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:26,960
Of course, more Eastern religions often have an idea of a sequence of reincarnations which are each finite, right?

786
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,960
And so I can conceive of those kinds of lives.

787
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:42,960
But it certainly seems that within world religions, generally speaking, that desire that yearning for the infinite expresses itself.

788
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:51,960
And I don't think one needs to understand the stack of large cardinals, these enormous infinities that professional mathematicians deal with

789
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:59,960
in order for me to be an ordinary person to understand, well, I could live more.

790
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,960
I can understand what that, there's always a tomorrow after today.

791
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:11,960
Even if the sun burns out or blows up the earth, this is always the physics, it's always so depressing.

792
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:18,960
It's like I can understand that maybe there could be a newer and a new sum, a new universe,

793
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:25,960
or somehow, as Buddhists tell us, we get reincarnated in another universe after this one is destroyed.

794
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:31,960
I can understand that there's another one. There's a next, whatever you say, a next life, a next universe, a next number,

795
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:34,960
a next higher infinity.

796
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:40,960
And so I think people have an intuitive grasp of that, and it's that yearning, that constant desire.

797
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:46,960
Desire is always desire for more. You never desire what you have. You have it.

798
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,960
I'm happy. I'm glad I have what I have.

799
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,960
I'm glad I have what I have, but I want more.

800
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:58,960
I want more of what I have. I don't necessarily want more of what I don't have.

801
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,960
I would like to have more of what I don't have, but yeah.

802
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,960
More times? I mean more time with my wife, right?

803
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:13,960
I mean more nice dinners with my wife. I want more adventures and fun and just holding hands sitting on a park bench with my wife.

804
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:19,960
I don't need to explore that other aspect, you know, what if I were holding hands on a park bench with someone?

805
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:22,960
It was not my wife. But that's a social thing.

806
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,960
Depending on where I am and what society I could be sitting on a park bench with many wives.

807
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:28,960
The bottom line is...

808
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,960
Incidentally many.

809
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,960
Well, maybe.

810
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,960
What do we need?

811
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,960
I will say this.

812
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:43,960
Let's play infinite chess.

813
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,960
And here's where I wander into the realm of regular life, the departing from mathematics and science for a moment, right?

814
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,960
I have asked myself many times in life, what is it that really matters to me?

815
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,960
In the end, what do I care about?

816
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,960
Aside from my personal happiness and being able to eat and sleep indoors, right?

817
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,960
What actually matters to me in the whole long road of life?

818
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:04,960
In the end, I came up, if I had to boil it down to one word, it would be legacy.

819
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,960
I would... legacy.

820
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,960
L-E-G-A-C-Y.

821
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,960
You mean your own?

822
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,960
Yes. I would like to leave a legacy.

823
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:14,960
Or alone.

824
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,960
Yes. And this is the question I don't have the answer to.

825
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:24,960
I am satisfied because I know I'm going under the ground someday, right?

826
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:30,960
But if I have children, if I have students, if I've written papers or books that people have read,

827
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:36,960
I know that I will be able to go on, I will have left a legacy, and that will satisfy me.

828
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:42,960
But at the same time, I know that legacy isn't going to last on Earth for more than a billion years before we're all fried.

829
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:48,960
The Earth itself won't exist in five billion years at all, it'll be burned to a crisp.

830
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,960
So how long do I need to feel this legacy?

831
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,960
Am I dissatisfied that it's gone down to the next generation and that's good enough?

832
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:01,960
Is it not the notion of eternal life as you were describing and the notion of legacy the same thing?

833
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,960
Possibly.

834
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:10,960
In this case, I am satisfied if I personally do not have eternal life, but my legacy lives on beyond it.

835
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:19,960
But both of those thoughts underscore a need to do something beyond or have something beyond today.

836
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:20,960
Exactly.

837
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:26,960
And so this is the basis of the conversation that we've been having right now, where I say,

838
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:33,960
I am satisfied with my finitude as long as I know that I will continue to quest for the infinite.

839
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:40,960
So this kind of thinking is really what led, I think, to a lot of the work in this topic of infinite utilitarianism that was mentioned

840
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:49,960
because the sort of fundamental issue there is sort of moral philosophers thinking about the question of right and wrong,

841
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:55,960
in a situation where you're making a choice of the range of possible actions you can undertake,

842
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:00,960
and some of them maybe have effects that lead infinitely into the future.

843
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:09,960
And maybe one of them causes a certain pattern of goodness and badness or whatever in the world, unendingly into the future.

844
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,960
And another one has a different kind of pattern.

845
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:18,960
And so the kind of philosophical or mathematical problem is how could we compare two actions,

846
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,960
if this one leads to a certain pattern, this one leads to goodness.

847
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,960
But it's not the case that this one is always better, but only sometimes better and so on, and they go like this,

848
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:30,960
and then you still want to choose between these actions, which one should you do, which one is the right action to do.

849
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:36,960
And so this principle is that people identified and so on, and this led to this theory called infinite utilitarianism,

850
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,960
and it's really quite interesting.

851
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:45,960
I mean, I approach it sort of in my usual way as a kind of source of front curiosities, really,

852
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,960
because these principles, of course, every single one of them is wrong for some reason or other,

853
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:54,960
which you can identify by describing a certain situation in which the principle says you should do one thing,

854
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,960
but actually you can see from another reason that you shouldn't.

855
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:05,960
For example, suppose you had infinitely many $2 bills, you know, you're stored in Hilbert's bank or something, right?

856
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:11,960
And, okay, you're walking down the sidewalk, and there's a $1 bill on the sidewalk.

857
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:17,960
So you, should you pick it up? Well, if you pick it up, then you have infinitely many $2 bills,

858
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:24,960
and one $1 bill, and so if you put it into your bank account, you know, so one bill in each room of Hilbert's Hotel is something good.

859
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:33,960
Now, if you compared one person who had a $1 bill and then 2222, with the person who has only $2 bill, so it's 2222,

860
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:39,960
it seems like the second person is better off, because, you know, they have all two's, and the person has a one there.

861
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:43,960
And so it seems from this kind of, okay, so this was one of the principles that was introduced,

862
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:48,960
implied that you shouldn't pick up the $1 bill because you would become poorer by doing so.

863
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,960
Okay, so this kind of thing, it's quite interesting, but it's a little bit related to what you're talking about,

864
01:22:53,960 --> 01:23:01,960
because you're worried about sort of this infinitely into the future, what should you do now so as to choose.

865
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:07,960
And I think it's quite interesting, and it leads to, uh, uh, what's Pascal's wager, too?

866
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,960
That's true, I guess. What's Pascal's wager?

867
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,960
Pascal's wager says is an old thing, but Pascal, who was a mathematician,

868
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:18,960
he was also like one of the first persons to think about gambling in a rigorous way, right?

869
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,960
Probability and statistics, because he was a betting man.

870
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:29,960
And so Pascal's wager is this, it says like, well, now Pascal, of course, was a Christian, so his wager was for Heaven or Hell.

871
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:35,960
And he thought, well, make a little box, and suppose I think God does not exist.

872
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:39,960
Or suppose that nation has put that way, suppose God does not exist.

873
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:45,960
Well, if I be, if I convert to Christianity and I do good things, if God doesn't exist, I really haven't lost anything.

874
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,960
I just die.

875
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:51,960
What if God does exist, I go to Heaven and I get an infinite reward.

876
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:58,960
Now suppose on the other hand, right, I think to myself, well, I'm not going to become a Christian, that's all crazy stuff.

877
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:04,960
Then I have, then I get the other two boxes, and the one says, well, God doesn't exist, it doesn't matter.

878
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,960
I die, zero.

879
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:14,960
But if God does exist, I go to Hell, because I didn't believe, you know, and my disutilities, I suffer infinite pain.

880
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,960
So he says, well, you have a choice now.

881
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:21,960
And so of course, it's Pascal. He says you have a choice now, either to believe or not believe.

882
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:26,960
And the outcome of that choice could either be infinite pleasure or infinite pain.

883
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:32,960
If you get the choice wrong, you get infinite pain.

884
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:48,960
So you might as well, and he's saying you could be an atheist for all practical purposes, but you might as well hedge your bets and go to church and at least try to be a Christian, because at worst you get nothing.

885
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,960
Right?

886
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,960
You got to, at worst, you get nothing.

887
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,960
You get to, God doesn't exist, or God doesn't exist rather, and you get nothing.

888
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,960
But on the other hand, if God does exist and you convert it, then you get it Heaven.

889
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:11,960
So Pascal's wager is a thing that says, right, even now you have choices to make that could have infinite, right?

890
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,960
And again, he doesn't say, well, Christianity is true, that would be a separate thing.

891
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,960
He says, if you're just betting, you don't know if it's true or false.

892
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:23,960
But you have to make a choice. Somebody asks you now to make a choice, right?

893
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,960
And just based on statistical principles, you should say, yeah, I'll convert.

894
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:34,960
Because your maximal loss is zero and your maximal gain is infinite pleasure.

895
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:41,960
I think Bill O'Reilly made a con argument like that in one of his books a few years ago.

896
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:43,960
Yeah, I don't remember the book. I think he, I think.

897
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:56,960
There's an interesting, shall we say, somewhat more finite version of this, which I think people would come out maybe in a different way.

898
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,960
And that is, you know, there's the issue about global warming.

899
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:07,960
Is it happening? And if it is happening, is it because of things that we're doing with burning fossil fuels?

900
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:16,960
And the statement that I have heard made, which I agree with as a matter of fact, is, suppose we're wrong,

901
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:25,960
supposing burning fossil fuels is not really contributing in a significant way to the warming that has unquestionably occurred.

902
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:33,960
Then, nevertheless, we still wouldn't have lost because fossil fuels are a valuable resource,

903
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:40,960
and by preserving more of them for later use in something else than just going up a smokestack,

904
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,960
we actually are likely to be beneficiaries of doing that.

905
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:50,960
So that it's just the prudent thing to do. It sounds awfully much like Pascal's Wager,

906
01:26:50,960 --> 01:27:00,960
but I have a feeling that most people who would accept Pascal's logic would not accept this logic and vice versa.

907
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,960
It's very amusing.

908
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,960
But people accept this kind of logic all the time. When you buy insurance, for example,

909
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:12,960
you're paying out a small amount because of a very remote chance that something, so you're giving, you know,

910
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:19,960
you're suffering a small loss because you feel that this, you know, compensates for the fact that something terrible might happen

911
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,960
and then the insurance would help you out and you'd be much better off.

912
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,960
It's essentially the same calculation, right?

913
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,960
I mean, there's many other instances when, for example, I mean, you can imagine,

914
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:35,960
well, what's the odds that, for example, there's some wealthy person here in New York who right now is wandering the streets of New York

915
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:43,960
with a big wad of cash, and he's going to give it to the first person he finds with a purple polka dot on their hand.

916
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:48,960
It's very unlikely, but, okay, maybe it's a some tiny, tiny chance that that's true,

917
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:54,960
so should we all paint purple things on our hands just in case, you know, because we do, it doesn't take that much time,

918
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,960
I could just get a purple mark or we could all do it, and then maybe one of us would get such money.

919
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:04,960
It's essentially the same logic, right, that you're describing, and it's just absurd, isn't it?

920
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,960
I mean, of course, no one thinks that this is a good idea to paint a purple dot on your hand just in case you've just some of...

921
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,960
You've just refuted insurance.

922
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:20,960
Well, I mean, so we reason with such kind, my point is just that we undergo such kind of reasoning all the time,

923
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:29,960
but it's a balance between how remote is the possibility or not, and the mere fact that the payout in Pascal's Wager is infinite

924
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:34,960
in the one case has to be balanced against, you know, the chance that it's actually happening, right,

925
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,960
and it's the same kind of calculation that you would go with my imaginary experiment.

926
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,960
Of course, we don't think that there's anyone going to give you money just because you have a purple dot on your hand,

927
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:51,960
it's so remote that it's not even worth doing it, right, and I don't think any of us are going to do it just because I mentioned that idea would be absurd to do it.

928
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:56,960
But meanwhile, with insurance, it's essentially the same kind of logic, but in the case of insurance,

929
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:03,960
these are odds that we can know much better and have studied in actuaries, you know, analyze these odds very carefully,

930
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:09,960
and this is why it's rational to buy insurance because those odds are calculated very accurately.

931
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:16,960
Well, given the finitude of our time here, I think we're going to go to audience questions, so if people can line up,

932
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:23,960
and please state your name, and please try to keep your comments in the form of a question.

933
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:36,960
Question dimensions.

934
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,960
I saw you, I saw you, I was thinking, oh yeah, okay, well, I mean, you bring it in.

935
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,960
It's not seven dimensions, it only six.

936
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:52,960
Hi, very good. I'd like to bring the related topics of neurobiology and knowledge into this discussion in the following away.

937
01:29:52,960 --> 01:30:00,960
It was raised by, it was mentioned by Eric when he was talking about, is there a limit to what we can know?

938
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:05,960
There may be a limit, you know, and you said, of course, it's possible.

939
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:14,960
The question that I'd like, however many of you would like to address is what you think about that,

940
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:19,960
is there an inherent limitation to what we can know?

941
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:31,960
And if you're viewers, especially for Joel, is there any relationship at all to Godel?

942
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:38,960
For example, if what we can't know is a complete knowledge of our own cognitive processes, for example.

943
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:39,960
That's the question.

944
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:42,960
Oh, I see, so let me just mention, let me just start.

945
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:51,960
So of course there's a famous argument based on Gertel's theorem that somehow the human mind can't be like a,

946
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:58,960
a, a, a, a, by a computer in principle because of the incompleteness theorem and the argument says, well, you know,

947
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:04,960
we can see that whenever we look at a theory that it's true that the, the Gertel's sentence, you know, that I am not provable statement,

948
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,960
which we can prove is not provable in the assertion, we can see nevertheless that it's true,

949
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:13,960
therefore we cannot be running a computer simulation.

950
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,960
I mean, are simulated by, by a machine.

951
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:20,960
And I think this, this argument, this is, I think what you're referring to at least a little bit.

952
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,960
And this argument I think is not well accepted.

953
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,960
And most people think that it's seriously flawed.

954
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,960
And the reason is that, I mean, it's clear that what's going on in the mind is a finite process.

955
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:38,960
There's, I don't know the number of neurons, but maybe someone here knows the order of magnitude of the number of neurons

956
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,960
and they're related in a certain way.

957
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,960
And, and it's not infinite.

958
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:46,960
It's a, you know, there's a certain number of, of neurons in a human mind.

959
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,960
And it's definitely finite.

960
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,960
And they react in a certain way with certain connections.

961
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:53,960
And so all of this is completely finite.

962
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:58,960
And in principle, there's no reason why those chemical things couldn't be simulated on a computer and so on.

963
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:04,960
And, and it seems to just be refuted just on that ground.

964
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:11,960
I mean, of course, I mean, as a, as a logician, I know also the step when you go from seeing that the theory is true,

965
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,960
to prove it in the theory, this, this is the flaw in the argument.

966
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:15,960
It's not really accurate.

967
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:20,960
Of course, for some theories that we believe in, and, and we, we can see that they're, that they're true,

968
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,960
then we also believe that they're consistent.

969
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:23,960
And so we can make that step.

970
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:29,960
But after you've made this step an enormous number of times, it's not something that I agree that we can just see that it's consistent

971
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,960
to go more step.

972
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:37,960
But I don't agree at all with this, with, with this girdle argument that somehow we cannot be simulated because of the incompleteness.

973
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:44,960
And so then, how would you translate that to whether you agree or disagree with David Hilbert,

974
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:52,960
the mathematicians know Hilbert and Hilbert space, where on his, he gave this wonderfully concise and beautiful statement.

975
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,960
That's on his tombstone as well.

976
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:55,960
We must know.

977
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:56,960
We will know.

978
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:04,960
So that's the drive to investigate the mysterious and the unknown.

979
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:09,960
But my question is, do individuals here think one way or the other?

980
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:16,960
Is there a limit to what we can know, whether it's about our, or not, just in general?

981
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:24,960
Is the Planck scale, for example, we can know about the structure of the universe, or is it a turtle's all the way down?

982
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,960
Is it right? So that's the question I'm really asking.

983
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:35,960
How you see, is there an inherent limitation to what we can know in our quest to know, or not?

984
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:39,960
There are all kinds of limits into what we can know.

985
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,960
I mean, there are limits of our visual system, for instance.

986
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:47,960
How many colors we can distinguish or things like that?

987
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:53,960
There are limits with how far scientific instruments can resolve things, limits to our capacity to think about.

988
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,960
Just in a way.

989
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:02,960
But I'm not sure that that's maybe quite the question that you're asking.

990
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:12,960
I mean, so there's a certain sense in what's distressing, at least to me, is that I always think that I, however much I know, I could know more.

991
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:21,960
And that's, and even if I see that there are limits as much as I know that I have limits to my biological lifespan, right?

992
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:27,960
So maybe I get to 75 and I knock myself off or something, as has been advised.

993
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:32,960
You know, there's a capability of having more.

994
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:38,960
I can realize that, gee, even though I'm limited, there could have been more.

995
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,960
Let me answer you in a slightly different way.

996
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,960
Sociological functions, I know, that's what I promised.

997
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:51,960
The sociological function that at any point in time are belief about what we know, they seem equivalent.

998
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,960
You often have people say, well, I know that to be true, but it's really just a belief.

999
01:34:54,960 --> 01:35:06,960
And one of the beliefs that plagues this kind of investigation throughout intellectual history is that whatever is thought to be knowledge at a point in time is often deemed to be eternal, right?

1000
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:07,960
It will not change.

1001
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,960
This is what we know.

1002
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:15,960
If nothing else, the history of scientific discovery proves that to be incorrect.

1003
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,960
That's what that was my question.

1004
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:18,960
Thank you.

1005
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,960
We're going to have to move on.

1006
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,960
Any final response?

1007
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,960
My question is directed to Dr. Liu.

1008
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:38,960
You stated, you stated Dr. Liu with the outset that most scientists today believe in the Big Bang and therefore finite time since the beginning of time.

1009
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,960
That's right.

1010
01:35:40,960 --> 01:36:00,960
Many of your colleagues would take issue with that, those who believe in Andre Linde's theory of chaotic inflation, which implies infinite time, both forward and backwards, and the multiverse in layman's terms.

1011
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:12,960
Could you please, now, if you believe in the Big Bang is the beginning of time, could you please explain to us, well, the beginning of time implies nothingness before the beginning of time.

1012
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:23,960
Could you explain to us your conception of nothingness and why it's more physical or more intellectually appealing to you than infinitive?

1013
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:32,960
The fact that a Big Bang occurred or that there is a T equals zero in our universe today does not imply that there was nothing before.

1014
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:38,960
The understanding of people like Andre Linde that you described, not necessarily.

1015
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:51,960
You see, when you describe Andre Linde and stay Steinhardt, or various, not you, like other Steinharts, the less handsome one, I don't know.

1016
01:36:51,960 --> 01:37:04,960
But about cyclical universes or time existing beforehand, they do not suggest that the using the moment of the Big Bang as T equals zero is wrong.

1017
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:09,960
Rather, they say that there is ways to extend beyond that amount.

1018
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:12,960
And so it's actually not inconsistent with what I'm saying right now.

1019
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:23,960
If you think that our universe, you count time from T equals zero and we'll call it all for the sake of argument or for the sake of just terminology,

1020
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:38,960
you could structure something beyond our universe which doesn't have our definition, our physical definition of time as a dimension, as they describe in the general theory of relativity.

1021
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:47,960
But you could still have stuff that exists. So Fred very briefly mentioned string theory and would love to get into that with you in some future time,

1022
01:37:47,960 --> 01:38:01,960
but be satisfied with the understanding that modern astronomy and astrophysics and cosmology does not attempt to discount the existence of nothing or something.

1023
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:09,960
But rather to explain how the universe as we currently observe it and experience it exists and behaves.

1024
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:14,960
If that's sufficient for you for now, we can go from there.

1025
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:33,960
To my original question, what is your conception of T equals zero?

1026
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:46,960
My conception fundamentally is that there existed a T equals zero and then from there our universe has gone on.

1027
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:52,960
Beyond that, there is additional hypotheses. There are speculations. There are thoughts. And I am not actually equipped to what those things are,

1028
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:57,960
but I am encouraging people who wish to think about them, such as you, to continue to think about them.

1029
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:08,960
And perhaps we can set up something that can be tested scientifically, hypothesized and then predicted and then tested by some sort of evidence or simulation.

1030
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:20,960
Just because I see the universe based on the evidence we have now to exist in the way that does not preclude the existence of other stuff.

1031
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:27,960
Before, after, during, regardless of how you define dimensions, time, space, existence, etc.

1032
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,960
Doesn't what you are saying imply infinitude?

1033
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:34,960
No, it does not. Not necessarily infinitude. Not at all.

1034
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,960
As a dimension by infinitude of some dimension or dimensions.

1035
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:39,960
No, no it doesn't. It actually does not.

1036
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:41,960
We will have to leave this as a mystery.

1037
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:45,960
Yes, right. We are happy to talk with you more about that.

1038
01:39:45,960 --> 01:40:01,960
So with that, maybe as a backdrop, I am surprised given the sort of ontological direction of the conversation that we are talking about sort of theoretical linguistics and the linguistics behind sort of discretizing the continuum and the implications.

1039
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:08,960
So what I find surprising is that there is nothing about the conversation of infinity that seems to be specific to infinity, rather,

1040
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:15,960
it could be mapped that you have had on to imaginary numbers or the existence of zero if we go back two thousand years.

1041
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:25,960
And the concept of a closure as necessary to support the conceptual machinery of discretized elements describing continuous surfaces seems relevant here.

1042
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:30,960
And I just want it would like to see what that does or how you would take that ball.

1043
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:39,960
Well, I would agree a lot with that because of course the question in these sort of ontological questions are the nature of existence, mathematical existence or physical existence.

1044
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,960
They are not so much connected directly with infinity.

1045
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:49,960
But one thing that you could say is that at least in my subject in the research area of set theory, for example,

1046
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:56,960
the mathematical activity is beset with enormous problems of this nature.

1047
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,960
We don't know whether these infinities exist or not and we can't prove they exist.

1048
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,960
And so what should we do?

1049
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:11,960
We need a kind of mathematical philosophy that will help us understand the principles by which we are allowed to make these kind of mathematical existence assertions or not.

1050
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:16,960
And so this is a way that it's connected, that it hooks up, I think, in an interesting way.

1051
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,960
And of course, I mean the problem is that that subject is extremely technical and so on.

1052
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:27,960
It's not suitable for a general form to talk about the precise nature of those different infinities.

1053
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:47,960
And as a consequence, really the subject needs sort of people who are expert both in mathematics in these concepts of infinity and also in the kind of philosophical questions about how do you justify these kind of abstract ontological existence claims.

1054
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:55,960
And there, one of the words he mentioned is closure, which I think would be stimulating right to the mathematician.

1055
01:41:55,960 --> 01:42:05,960
And to you, I mean, if closure is one of the things that if I believe in one and I believe I can add a number to a number, then I might think that reality has to be closed under that operation.

1056
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:13,960
And that all the things that that operation applies to it, if I can take a power set, then I might think, well, reality has to be closed under this structure.

1057
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:21,960
And as you start to look at closure, I mean, closure is what drives, certainly philosophically, a lot of arguments for infinite structures.

1058
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:26,960
It seems odd to posit a lot of stuff and then just say, but that's where it stops.

1059
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:32,960
And because you immediately have the question of why does it, I mean, like if I say, well, the biggest number is 57.

1060
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,960
And wait a minute, why did you stop there?

1061
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:45,960
Because that seems to violate closure principles. And so as you move to saying, like, let's keep striving for closure, then it gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

1062
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:49,960
And the bigger and bigger and bigger gets nastier and nastier and nastier.

1063
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:55,960
And that drive for closure, which I think drives a lot of the large cardinal research.

1064
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:58,960
But it's interesting that you say that because this is kind of inductive reasoning.

1065
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,960
I mean, there's two kinds of inductive reasoning.

1066
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:08,960
There's a sort of ordinary inductive reasoning is the reasoning process by which when you observe many, many instances of something you conclude that it's going to keep happening that way.

1067
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:15,960
So we think the sun is going to rise tomorrow because look, it's risen every single day, you know, that we can remember, okay, this is inductive reasoning.

1068
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:16,960
You observe many cases.

1069
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:21,960
I mean, if you think about the sort of chicken getting up on the farm, you know, that the farmer's going to treat him very well and so on.

1070
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:24,960
Maybe you get a kind of counter example situation, right?

1071
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:29,960
But then there's another kind of induction that's used in mathematics, inductive reasoning and it's a mathematical induction.

1072
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:33,960
And this is a mathematical principle, which is, you know, you can prove it.

1073
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:37,960
And it's not, it doesn't admit this kind of counter example, right, with the chicken.

1074
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:46,960
And this is the principle by which, you know, if you can prove that if something happens at the number zero and you can prove that whenever it's true at a number, then it's also true at the next number.

1075
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,960
Then you get to conclude that it's true for all the numbers because you can see how it propagates.

1076
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:56,960
It starts out being true and then it's true at the next one and therefore it's true at the next one and therefore it's true at the next one and so on forever, right?

1077
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:07,960
But now what you said is actually making a connection between the two kinds of induction because you're saying that the reason we think that the universe is closed under something because we can see that when we had it, we can always add one and get a bigger number.

1078
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:14,960
And so it's a kind of inductive, I mean, if I was the chicken, I could say I could always add one more day, but it's not really true, right?

1079
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:17,960
So, the infinity would be bigger than the analysis.

1080
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,960
So the infinity would be bigger than the rules of the...

1081
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:27,960
Right, so what he's saying is that the reason we believe the piano axioms is because of this kind of other kind of induction, right, that we can always add one more.

1082
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,960
Thank you, thank you.

1083
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:42,960
Okay, first of all, let me admit I'm out of my league here by some, but for the gentleman in the brown shirt, yes, you.

1084
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:52,960
If you haven't already, you might want to read Krauss's A Universe from Nothing, which by the way, I understood maybe 30% are.

1085
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:53,960
That's more good.

1086
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:55,960
That's more than me.

1087
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:57,960
Nice job, or me.

1088
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:59,960
Well, maybe I'm exaggerating.

1089
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:00,960
No, Lawrence.

1090
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,960
Lawrence rocks, yeah, no question.

1091
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,960
Just a couple of quick things and I have a question.

1092
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:08,960
I'm sorry, I don't know anybody's name.

1093
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:09,960
Charles Lou.

1094
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:12,960
Yes.

1095
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,960
You use the word religion.

1096
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:23,960
And I think in the context in which you used it, it's probably not correct.

1097
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:29,960
The dictionary definition of religion is belief in the metaphysical or transcendental being.

1098
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:42,960
You spoke to metaphysical or transcendental, but you didn't define that as connecting a being.

1099
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,960
Therefore, I think what you're looking for is spirituality.

1100
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:55,960
And based on that, however, I think we should look into changing the dictionary definition, but that's another thing.

1101
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:56,960
Okay.

1102
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,960
That particular definition wouldn't include, say, polytheistic religions.

1103
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:01,960
Say again?

1104
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:05,960
That particular definition would not allow polytheistic religions.

1105
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,960
Say, if you believe in many gods or Buddhism, yes.

1106
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:12,960
Or Taoism or that's a very heavily westernized definition.

1107
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,960
But that's okay.

1108
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:14,960
That's all right.

1109
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:18,960
Your point is taken, yes, definitely.

1110
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:25,960
I think it was you, sir, who said if I can conceive of something, then it's got to be.

1111
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:28,960
I don't think I said that.

1112
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:31,960
But, okay, then, then.

1113
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:33,960
Somebody said that.

1114
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,960
I think I probably would have said that.

1115
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:36,960
Oh, okay.

1116
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,960
I don't know if I said it, but I believe it.

1117
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,960
So how about that?

1118
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:47,960
In many dreams, we see ourselves flying as an example.

1119
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:51,960
So we are conceiving of our ability to fly.

1120
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:56,960
And yet, no matter how many times I may have that dream, I know I will live a fly.

1121
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:57,960
Let me answer that.

1122
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:58,960
Can I answer that?

1123
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:05,960
Because actually, throughout my life, I had flying dreams, particularly when I was younger

1124
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:07,960
in high school and in college.

1125
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,960
And in my dreams, I was flying.

1126
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:13,960
And it was always very difficult to fly.

1127
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:16,960
I had to make a lot of effort to move.

1128
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:19,960
I did fly, but it was very difficult.

1129
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:24,960
And I had to push very hard in my dream.

1130
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,960
And this went on for years, these flying dreams that I had.

1131
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:33,960
And then I realized one day what I was really dreaming about.

1132
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:38,960
And that was, well, I was on the swim team in high school.

1133
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,960
And I swam a lot.

1134
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:46,960
And the sensation of what was flying in my dream and what I had always conceived of

1135
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:52,960
this flying was actually physically exactly what it feels like to swim under water.

1136
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,960
And I had to push against the water.

1137
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:58,960
And so just because you dream about flying doesn't mean that you actually are flying.

1138
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:03,960
I was really swimming in my dream, but I was conceiving of it incorrectly as flying.

1139
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:06,960
And I don't think there's conceiving.

1140
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:11,960
Well, I mean, conceiving of something isn't the same thing as imagining it.

1141
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:14,960
That might be a little too academic of a distinction.

1142
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:20,960
But if I were to say that you dream of flying, if I wanted to go out on a limb,

1143
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:24,960
if I did say that that's conceiving of it, I don't think I would ever mean to say that

1144
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:28,960
conceiving of something means it's going to happen in this life,

1145
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:33,960
or it's going to happen in this universe, or it's going to happen in my apartment.

1146
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:34,960
Right?

1147
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:41,960
I mean, I can conceive of having a lot of things that aren't going to fit in my apartment,

1148
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:45,960
or of doing a lot of things that aren't doing this life.

1149
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:49,960
And so if one were committed to thinking that if I can conceive of something,

1150
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:54,960
then it must exist, that would probably commit me to believing in a lot of things

1151
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:59,960
that are way beyond anything I can experience physically in this life,

1152
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:01,960
or in this city, or in this apartment.

1153
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:02,960
Right?

1154
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:03,960
Now, of course, that could be false.

1155
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:07,960
But I mean, if one was to say that, because you said you were going to...

1156
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:08,960
Isn't that what I'm saying?

1157
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,960
You said you were going to be lying, but you know you're never going to fly.

1158
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,960
No, no, no, but I started with the fact that I had it wrong.

1159
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:20,960
I guess it was you who said, if I can conceive of something, then I can do it, ultimately.

1160
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,960
Ultimately.

1161
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:24,960
Maybe not now.

1162
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,960
In another universe.

1163
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:27,960
In infinity.

1164
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:28,960
I don't know.

1165
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,960
I don't know.

1166
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:30,960
Yeah, sure.

1167
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,960
Okay, anyway, here's a very quick question.

1168
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:35,960
Not an easy one, though.

1169
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:40,960
We always talk about the circle as opposed to the line.

1170
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:42,960
And the circle is finite.

1171
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:43,960
I beg your pardon.

1172
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:44,960
The line is finite.

1173
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,960
And the circle is infinite.

1174
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:47,960
What?

1175
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:50,960
The line's infinite, circle is infinite.

1176
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,960
The line's segment.

1177
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,960
Are you referring to like a...

1178
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:56,960
A segment or...

1179
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:57,960
Just a part of the line.

1180
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,960
Like a microphone.

1181
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:00,960
I think you're doing fine.

1182
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,960
Yeah, hold on.

1183
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:02,960
Don't let them...

1184
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:03,960
Don't worry.

1185
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:04,960
Don't let them...

1186
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:05,960
That's a basic message.

1187
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:06,960
No, keep going on.

1188
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,960
I think you're not so far off.

1189
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:09,960
Just finish your...

1190
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:10,960
Oh.

1191
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:11,960
What I didn't understand...

1192
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:23,960
Well, assuming my original premise and even if I'm wrong.

1193
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:32,960
Well, because I defined it the way I defined it, I understood that the belief was...

1194
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:38,680
You can go round and round and round and round and circles and keep needing new...

1195
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:40,960
New ground.

1196
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:49,960
Whereas I don't see how you could do that unless you had an infinity of circles.

1197
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:50,960
Rather than going around...

1198
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:54,960
Because you're going around the same one, whether you're going forward or backwards, aren't you

1199
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:59,960
hitting the same obstacles or paths or whatever?

1200
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:10,960
And if it were possible for that to be infinite, then in the line which only goes so long,

1201
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:19,960
a finite line, wouldn't it be the same going back and forth that you'd hit the same?

1202
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:25,960
In other words, how is the circle differentiated from the line?

1203
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:26,960
Yeah.

1204
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:27,960
Okay.

1205
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:32,960
I brought up the circle early, so maybe I should respond, but everyone else here can correct

1206
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:33,960
me.

1207
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:39,960
The circle has the property that it has no end, but it's obviously completely finite.

1208
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:42,960
You can see the whole circle and that's that.

1209
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:49,960
Could it be true that if you start going around the circle, then the first time you see movie

1210
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:56,960
stars, then the next time you see scientists, which is much less interesting, or something

1211
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:00,960
of that sort, of course it's possible.

1212
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:06,000
But in any case, what is certainly true is that there is no obvious limit to the number

1213
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,960
of times you can go around the circle.

1214
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:12,960
Whereas if you have a line of a certain length, there's an obvious limit to how long you can

1215
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,960
go in one direction.

1216
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:20,960
If you add the idea of going backwards, then there's no limit, so they become equivalent.

1217
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:23,960
Thank you.

1218
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:30,960
Let me say something because I find it interesting about what you said, namely, in computability

1219
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:34,960
theory, there's this famous sort of unsolvable problem called the halting problem.

1220
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:40,960
And this is the problem of, given a sort of computing device or a program, you want to

1221
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,960
answer the question of whether it will ever finish or not.

1222
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:50,960
And Turing proved that you cannot design any computational device that will answer this

1223
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:55,960
and it's simply contradictory to be able to determine the answer to the halting problem.

1224
01:52:55,960 --> 01:53:00,960
But if you think about computation, then there's kind of two ways for it to go infinite, for

1225
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:05,960
it never to complete, and that is it could enter some kind of repeating loop.

1226
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:10,960
And this often happens with my programs by accident.

1227
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,960
So you can imagine a computational process that was kind of repeating.

1228
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:15,960
This is like going around the circle, right?

1229
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:19,960
It's just repeating the same state inside the machine forever and it's never going to

1230
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:20,960
happen.

1231
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:23,960
And this is a kind of easy case of the halting problem because when that happens and you

1232
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:28,960
can check, then you can kind of detect this when it happens.

1233
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:32,960
And say, look, it's never going to halt because it's repeating and we can see it came back

1234
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:35,960
to the same configuration and so it's never going to halt.

1235
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:41,960
But another kind of more complicated kind of non-hulting is when the computation proceeds

1236
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:44,960
forever, it never halts, but it also never repeats.

1237
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,960
So it's not kind of stuck in this loop.

1238
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:51,960
It's more like what you're talking about, namely, it finds movie stars and then scientists

1239
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:54,960
and then sports people or whatever.

1240
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:59,960
And it's kind of metaphor for a non-repeating kind of trajectory, right?

1241
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:00,960
And so...

1242
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:17,960
Sure, but...

1243
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:23,960
My point is that there's a mathematically precise way in which that's the hard case of the

1244
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:30,960
non-hulting problem, so this kind of non-repeating case is much more robust.

1245
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:35,960
You don't ask about sort of the alternative or if there is an alternative to thinking of

1246
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:36,960
time and space as infinite.

1247
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:40,960
I mean, how would you ever conceive of a limit or how would you ever get to a point like

1248
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:44,960
I think Dr. Lumens with the Big Bang where you say, okay, this is the beginning and no,

1249
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,960
we know there was nothing before it.

1250
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:49,960
You'd live in a boring world.

1251
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:53,960
Well, I think there are several aspects of that.

1252
01:54:53,960 --> 01:55:00,960
First of all, as far as being able to conceive of something as finite and yet not bounded,

1253
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:06,960
the circle is the perfect example and you can generalize that, for example, to a sphere.

1254
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:10,960
And Einstein, let me originally start thinking.

1255
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,960
Just cover them when I read the book.

1256
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:18,960
Okay, Einstein, you originally started thinking about...

1257
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,960
Now I've got these wonderful equations of general relativity.

1258
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:24,960
Now what kind of universe could I have?

1259
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:33,960
And his intuition was that the kind of universe he would have would be a static universe.

1260
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:39,960
And now if it's a static universe, you could say, well, is it infinite?

1261
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:45,960
And he said, no, the obvious thing would be it would be a universe which would be an

1262
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:51,960
analog in more dimensions of the surface of a sphere, the two-dimensional surface of a sphere.

1263
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:57,960
There's no particular point on the surface which is the end, any more than with the circle.

1264
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:01,960
There's any point on the circle which is the end.

1265
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:06,960
And yet, and it has the property that is the same all the way around.

1266
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:13,960
So he found a model he could make of the universe which had this property that...

1267
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:19,960
And this is when he introduced what is now called the Einstein cosmological term into his theory.

1268
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:30,960
He found he could make an equilibrium between things which were trying to make it get smaller or get bigger

1269
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:33,960
and in such a way that it would stay at one size.

1270
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:41,960
What he didn't realize but was very quickly pointed out to him was that in fact his model was quite unrealistic

1271
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:47,960
because the tiniest little perturbation would cause it to either collapse or to explode.

1272
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:53,960
And that's why in fact his model was not really a good one.

1273
01:56:53,960 --> 01:57:00,960
And it's why later on he is reputed to have said that nobody can find the exact place where it's recorded in the police blotter.

1274
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:08,960
That this was the biggest mistake he ever made to introduce the cosmological term which now appears to be there.

1275
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:12,960
But not to give quite the universe that he was thinking of.

1276
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:22,960
So yes, I think there are ways to conceive a universe which is finite and that's what he was doing.

1277
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:27,960
And that's also true of what we think of the observable universe.

1278
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:29,960
Observable is very important.

1279
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:36,960
We could never observe an infinite universe because that would require some kind of infinity in time.

1280
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:40,960
And we don't have that much time to observe most of us at least.

1281
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:57,960
So therefore I think reconciliation of the idea of finiteness with the idea of not having any special point anywhere in the universe is perfectly possible.

1282
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:08,960
But the universe we live in doesn't appear to be that type. It appears to be one which is like a plane or a straight line.

1283
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:14,960
But one where we don't see any sign of an end to it anywhere.

1284
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:15,960
Thank you.

1285
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:17,960
Go ahead.

1286
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:18,960
Hi.

1287
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:23,960
I just had a thought about Pascal's wager and I wanted to see what you thought of it.

1288
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:27,960
So this is sort of meant to be humorous. So I hope it doesn't offend anyone.

1289
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:37,960
But basically if you inflict a finite amount of suffering on yourself to go to church and pray and act religious and everything.

1290
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:41,960
And then at the end of your life it's determined that there is no God.

1291
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:50,960
Is there any instance in which that finite amount of suffering outweighs the infinite amount of hell that you would experience if there was a God?

1292
01:58:50,960 --> 01:59:01,960
Yeah, no, that's right. Right. Right. So I could have gone out partying but instead I stayed home and was very devout.

1293
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:09,960
So yeah, I think there's an interesting, the wager comes in many different flavors.

1294
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:17,960
And so Pascal's own view was that no matter what, you only have a finite loss.

1295
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:22,960
If you decide to become, let's say, an Abrahamist, you decide to become devout.

1296
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:26,960
You only have a finite loss of fleeting earthly pleasures.

1297
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:34,960
Which for him was to the infinity of pleasure in heaven versus the infinity of pain and hell was equivalent to nothing.

1298
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:39,960
Now, you know, he could have been wrong about either one of those, right?

1299
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:48,960
You know, the wager comes up in other ways. One of the stranger ways people might have seen this occasionally is Rocco's Basilisk.

1300
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:56,960
Which maybe is something that, you know, people who think that believe in the singularity or that computers are going to take over the world.

1301
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:02,960
And so you have a choice as to whether or not you're going to help the computers of the future evolve.

1302
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:06,960
Or are you going to fight the emergence of the great computer in the future?

1303
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:17,960
And of course, if you believe the great computer in the future actually will exist, then you might come to think that you're living in a simulation in that computer's mind now.

1304
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:23,960
And I've done a very bad thing here because as soon as you learn of Rocco's Basilisk, you're guilty.

1305
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:27,960
So now you have a choice as to whether or not you have a great computer of the future evolve or not.

1306
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:33,960
And since you suspect probably that it might not be nice to us, maybe you like the Terminator,

1307
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:37,960
you might be inclined to think that you shouldn't bring it into existence.

1308
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:43,960
And since you're probably inclined to think that you shouldn't bring it into existence, it's going to punish you when it does come into existence.

1309
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:45,960
I'll go in like a second.

1310
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:47,960
God, or something like that.

1311
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:54,960
Yeah, Rocco's Basilisk is an application of Pascal's wager in like, you know, transhumanism and singularitarianism and Ray Kurtz file.

1312
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:58,960
And there's been some nice articles and there's some things in the Times and some on Slate.

1313
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,960
And it's a funny thing that people actually believe in.

1314
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:05,960
So Pascal's wager can be put in all these different contexts.

1315
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:10,960
But so you're right, there are ways to think of it that are other than Pascal himself thought.

1316
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:16,960
But your question is great because I was thinking exactly the same thing when I was talking about it.

1317
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:27,960
The answer is there are some infinities and some finitudes in which the finite thing is actually to you more valuable than the infinite thing.

1318
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:28,960
Right.

1319
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:32,960
I think in the form that was described, you don't really see that.

1320
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:40,960
But I could imagine that like I could, let's say there were a statue that was set of me forever after I'm dead.

1321
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:41,960
Right.

1322
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:45,960
Or there's a statue that's put up with me when I'm alive and as soon as I'm dead they take it down.

1323
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:49,960
Which one would I appreciate more?

1324
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:50,960
Right.

1325
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:53,960
So that's the kind of thing where I would think about that.

1326
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:54,960
That's a really kind of cool.

1327
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:56,960
But that's a great question because I was thinking about the same thing.

1328
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:00,960
I think you're questioning just the following kind of logic situation.

1329
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:05,960
I mean you suppose you own a house and you buy a ten year fire insurance policy for your house.

1330
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:08,960
And so you have to pay some money for this insurance.

1331
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:12,960
And then at the end of the ten years it turns out you didn't have a fire.

1332
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:15,960
So do you say darn it?

1333
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:17,960
Because I wasted my insurance.

1334
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:21,960
Or do you reason, oh I shouldn't have bought the insurance.

1335
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:27,960
I think it would be that you shouldn't have bought the insurance because fire insurance for your house is a great idea.

1336
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:30,960
And the fact that your house didn't burn down doesn't prove that you shouldn't have bought it.

1337
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:32,960
It just means you got lucky.

1338
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:34,960
But it's essentially the same calculation.

1339
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:40,960
And for ten years you were able to sleep at night knowing that if some reason your house burned down you get another one.

1340
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:42,960
Which ain't such a bad thing.

1341
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:45,960
But I want to respond to something you said if this time.

1342
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:51,960
So one of these examples in this infinite utilitarianism context is really interesting because.

1343
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:56,960
So imagine that there's infinitely many people spread sort of uniformly on the lattice in all space.

1344
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:02,960
And that they're all very unhappy but that there's an expanding sphere of happiness.

1345
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:09,960
It starts out very small with only one person but as it gets bigger once you're inside the sphere of you become very happy.

1346
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:17,960
So that's one world, world A, and world B is just like that except everyone starts out happy and there's an expanding sphere of unhappiness.

1347
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:21,960
So the sphere gets bigger and once you're inside then you become very unhappy.

1348
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:25,960
So now the question is well which world is better?

1349
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:34,960
Well on the one hand I mean the world B had infinitely many happy people and only finitely many unhappy people.

1350
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:41,960
So at any given moment in time there's infinitely more happiness in the second world than there is in the first world

1351
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:45,960
which has only finitely much happiness and infinitely many unhappy people.

1352
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:49,960
From that perspective it seems like the second world is just way better than the first world.

1353
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:55,960
But on the other hand from any individual person's perspective of course you'd much rather be in the first world

1354
02:03:55,960 --> 02:04:01,960
because then at some finite point you change from unhappy to happy and then you're happy from that point on.

1355
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:09,960
So the case is that every individual person in the world would rather be in world A but nevertheless there's a strong sense

1356
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:15,960
in which world B has infinitely more happiness altogether than world A.

1357
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:20,960
It's a nightmarish problem. We have time for one more question.

1358
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:35,960
I thank you very much for a great discussion. When I came to, immigrated to the United States I had to understand how American society is functioning

1359
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:48,960
and a guy told me an anecdote which explained it and if God goes like this, a question, what

1360
02:04:48,960 --> 02:05:00,960
which is bigger than infinity? And answer, infinity plus shipping and handling.

1361
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:11,960
And that's explaining how this society and what how capitalism is working.

1362
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:23,960
But I was a little bit surprised that you did not discuss the limitations of language.

1363
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:40,960
In this limited universe, finite universe, we have a finite number of symbols that we describe these universes.

1364
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:58,960
And despite of it, we still can make symbols and define something that does not exist here and can imagine it.

1365
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:15,960
For me, it's the question. How, why? With this limited number of symbols, we still can describe and imagine something that does not exist at all.

1366
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:28,960
Well, I think that's one of the mysterious powers of language. I mean, we can do that and you raised a good question.

1367
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:34,960
How can we do that? I mean, certainly there are a lot of philosophers who say that as long as your description is consistent,

1368
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:43,960
then there does exist something that corresponds to it. And again, that might not exist in your apartment or here in this universe.

1369
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:52,960
So that's just an excellent question. I mean, it gets back to the question that we all talked about at the very beginning,

1370
02:06:52,960 --> 02:07:00,960
which is how do we think about what exists? How do we think about existence? And if one were probably a mathematician,

1371
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:08,960
they say, well, if it's consistent, it exists. And many philosophers who are realists would say the same thing.

1372
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:15,960
But that would certainly lead to reality being infinite in probably every conceivable way.

1373
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:28,960
Let me say something. So the logicians have a very intricate account of the connection between language and mathematics.

1374
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:36,960
And we have formal languages and different ones and we try to understand exactly how it is that a language is able to describe mathematical objects.

1375
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:42,960
And some languages are too weak to do so. And other languages are strong enough to do some, but not others and so on.

1376
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:46,960
And so I would answer your question by saying, well, we do pay attention to the language.

1377
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:53,960
And in fact, some of the infinity concepts in the large cardinal hierarchy are described in precisely those terms.

1378
02:07:53,960 --> 02:08:00,960
For example, there's a kind of large cardinal called the indescribable cardinal because they're precisely indescribable in a certain language,

1379
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:05,960
although they are describable in another one. And then there's the totally indescribable cardinal and so on.

1380
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:11,960
And so these are kind of mathematical, I mean, they're much too technical to give the definitions,

1381
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:19,960
except that they are using this concept of language and analyzing the power of language to describe mathematical objects.

1382
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:23,960
And it's all a part of the subject really is, I think.

1383
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:32,960
Let me add a little thing, which is when I'm teaching students in a physics course, one of the things I tell them is you're going to have to learn

1384
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:41,960
that a physicist has no trouble putting on one equation, on one page the same symbol, let's say the letter A,

1385
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:50,960
several different times with several different meanings. And therefore, having a finite number of symbols is not actually a limitation

1386
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:55,960
of the number of concepts you can introduce. It's definitely not.

1387
02:08:55,960 --> 02:09:03,960
But then, given that we're getting close to the end, there have been several mentions, but I think mostly Erica's mentioned department.

1388
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:09,960
I don't know whether I should want to see what your apartment looks like. But anyway, it's too small.

1389
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:18,960
Well, that's New York. It reminds me of something I heard not too long ago that Woody Allen was quoted as saying,

1390
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:25,960
I don't want to live on in my films. I want to live on in my apartment.

1391
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:33,960
Well, allow me to give the final word to him, who, speaking of masters of another kind of language,

1392
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:44,960
and who I think spoke for many of us when he said, I could sit in a nutshell and consider myself a king of infinite space

1393
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:52,960
were it not that I have bad dreams. So please join me in thanking Joel, Eric, Alfred, and Charles.

1394
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:32,960
Thank you.
