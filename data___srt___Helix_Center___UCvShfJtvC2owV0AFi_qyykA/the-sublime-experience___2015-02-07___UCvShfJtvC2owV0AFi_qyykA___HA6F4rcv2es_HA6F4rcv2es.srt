1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:56,960
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,360
If I could have your attention for a brief moment.

3
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,720
So we're about to begin.

4
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,160
Thank you all very much for coming.

5
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,920
So this is a roundtable on the sublime experience.

6
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,920
And it is funded in part by a very generous grant from the Templeton Foundation.

7
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,080
But one of the stipulations of that is that we have surveys that we need to be filled

8
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,120
out by a certain number of people for every single roundtable.

9
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,120
That otherwise, I don't know what would happen.

10
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,760
Maybe they'd ask for their money back.

11
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,720
But either way, I was not present for the first 15 minutes of when everybody was arriving.

12
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,920
So I didn't get a chance to harass you individually.

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,080
So now I have to do it en masse.

14
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,440
So if you'd be very, very generous and gracious and be willing to fill out a survey, the first

15
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,720
half is for before, the roundtable is so filling out right now or during, and then the second

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,280
half is for afterwards.

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,880
I guess just raise your hand slightly or eyebrows or something, and I can come around

18
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
with surveys.

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,880
I have a couple pens, but if you have your own pen, you should use that one.

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Okay.

21
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:08,440
While Julie is doing that, I'll introduce our program.

22
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,480
I'm Ed Nurse-Sesien, Director of the Center.

23
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,240
Next, not next week, the week after the February 21st, we are going to show in the morning

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,760
the documentary Particle Fever, and then in the afternoon we are going to have a roundtable

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,920
with the title, The Quest.

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:41,120
The participants of that are Sarah D'Amiro, Alberto Manguel, Gene Strauss, and Mark Levinson.

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:52,680
Then on March 7th, we have a roundtable on consciousness, and David Chalmers from NYU

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,720
called Friston from the University College London, Gabriel Jackson from Stony Brook, Pete

29
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:07,320
Hott from Princeton, Ken Paller from Northwestern, and Nicholas Schiff from Cornell will be the

30
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,920
participants of that.

31
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:21,640
So today's roundtable is on the sublime experience, and I will read you briefly the bios of the

32
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,200
participants.

33
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,360
They are available on the website if you want to dig deeper into it.

34
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:36,920
Paul Fry, sitting there, is the William Lamson, Professor of English at Yale.

35
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,600
He was educated at UC Berkeley and Harvard.

36
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,240
He's seven books and numerous articles cover many fields, the history of lyric, British

37
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,720
romanticism, the history of criticism, the history of aesthetics, philosophy and literature,

38
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,920
recent literary theory, and literature and the visual arts.

39
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,400
I will stop there.

40
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,040
That's about a quarter of what I have.

41
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,280
James Judd, who is sitting here, is music director of the Israel Symphony and the Little

42
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,160
Orchestra Society in New York.

43
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,920
His previous directorship include the New Zealand Symphony, the Ochast National de Lille, Adelaide

44
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Symphony, and the Philharmonic Symphony.

45
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,760
He's been a regular guest, conducted many orchestras around the globe, and he leads

46
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,120
annual tour of Asia and the Asian Youth Society.

47
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,600
And as an opera conductor, he's led the English National Opera, Glendenborn, and Florida Grand

48
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Opera.

49
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,840
And again, I'll stop all the other major achievements.

50
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,040
Alan Richardson, who is sitting there, is Professor of English at Boston College.

51
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,280
He holds degrees in English from Princeton University and Harvard University.

52
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,600
A romanticist by training, he has published extensively on the literature and culture

53
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:11,480
of the British Romantic era, especially in relation to issues of education, race and colonialism

54
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,440
and scientific psychology.

55
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,040
He's devoted his research more recently on the intersections between literary studies

56
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,960
and the sciences of mind and brain.

57
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:33,320
And finally, Sandra Shabshay has a BA in intellectual history from Penn, from University of Penn's

58
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,480
Pennsylvania and her PhD in philosophy from Columbia University.

59
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:45,080
She's an associate professor of philosophy at Indiana University and her interest center

60
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,360
on the 19th century German philosophy, especially Kant and Schopenhauer, as well as contemporary

61
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,120
aesthetics and ethics.

62
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,480
We had a fifth participant, Amir Exel, but unfortunately he fell yesterday on ice in

63
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,520
Boston and broke his forearm so he won't be with us.

64
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Thank you.

65
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:20,560
Well, I thought that perhaps I could get us started in a good philosophical fashion.

66
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,080
I thought I would ask a definitional question of everyone.

67
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,000
What is sublime experience or what is a sublime experience?

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,840
Well, I'm glad you asked it that way because when I did my work on the sublime, it became

69
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,600
clear to me that not everyone agrees that there is a sublime experience, but I do feel

70
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,840
that there is one.

71
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,080
So I like the way that your question is biased towards my physician if we have physicians.

72
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,600
Some people think that the sublime is just a language game, what Wittgenstein would call

73
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,160
a language game, a way of talking about certain class of experiences that we decide to label

74
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,560
that way a rhetorical trope.

75
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,720
But most sublime theories up to the 20th century clearly thought there was an experience of

76
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,120
the sublime and something that you could feel before there was ever a word for it.

77
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,000
I guess that that's what I feel just to start with, that it is an experience and it's an

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
experience of, for me in brief, when you realize palpably, when you realize viscerally in

79
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,320
your body as well as with all of your acting mind, that the world is greater than you have

80
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:47,160
ever supposed than you can take in with your senses and with your cognition.

81
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,960
It's an experience that's both cognitive, and emotional, and very powerful.

82
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,240
And my guess is that many of these rooms feel that they have had such an experience.

83
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,920
I know that I have.

84
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,440
I do think that there is certainly a sublime experience.

85
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:16,080
I think that the terms for it have varied in history and that the sublime experience

86
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:25,120
as the response initially in a state of fear, then in a state of recovery, and in a certain

87
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,560
sense after that, a state of possession, that is to say possession of the experience, but

88
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:39,880
at the same time possibly being possessed by the experience, I think flourishes particularly

89
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,800
in the 18th century.

90
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:52,920
The terms sublime applies most recognizably to that experience then, and that as one moves

91
00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:03,640
into the 19th century, partly owing to Kant's third critique, but perhaps not as much of

92
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,480
influence as the zeitgeist or whatever.

93
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:17,160
In my own view, the experience or becoming aware of the imagination, that is to say,

94
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:25,040
an internal faculty, that one is alerted to by the experience of something almost incommensurable

95
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:33,040
in the external world, replaces the sublime, and that the word sublime as it's used in

96
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:40,320
the rheumatic period becomes a little more casual, sometimes it even means chemical sublimation

97
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:49,000
as when Byron calls a rascal, rapscallion of a lawyer, the sublime of rascals.

98
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,360
That's a chemical term, the pure distillation of rascals.

99
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,080
And then I think that since then, and this is something I'm going to stop and need to

100
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,880
talk about, well I think that since then, the experience itself has become more unstable.

101
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:16,440
In Freud, I think that a comparable sort of experience is the uncanny, and that's something

102
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,120
we might want to come back to as well.

103
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:27,360
And there are other aesthetic categories as described in the 20th and 21st century that

104
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,800
in various ways may be encroached on what we mean by the sublime without taking away

105
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,640
the fact that there is such an experience, so I've gone on too much.

106
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,680
Well I think from my experience as a musician, I would veg as a suggestion, is that me?

107
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:53,280
It seems to me that I'm growling and I don't mean to, that perhaps the sublime is easiest

108
00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:00,960
to be accessed through music, that I remember my experiences as a very small child, not

109
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,280
being aware of particularly what I was listening to, some great works of music, great choral

110
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,360
works, great bah.

111
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:15,640
Then later, realizing that that music had transported me in a special way, that's right

112
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:24,280
up to now I'm trying to analyze and understand, but I think that through great music, and

113
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:32,080
I think we could all agree on certain pieces of great music, we can find the sublime, access

114
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
the sublime.

115
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,680
Well, now you have to.

116
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,840
Oh, I know I understand some of my own questions.

117
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:48,400
I think I also agree that there is such a thing as sublime experience and that it has

118
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,680
a certain character to it that makes it distinctive.

119
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:04,120
I also think that the term sublime as you, Lutupal, has become stretched in various ways

120
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:12,920
to sort of take on perhaps an experience of horror on canny and actually one of the art

121
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,120
critics for the New Yorker whose last name I can't pronounce very well.

122
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:27,160
That's it, Peter Shallow said in response to an exhibit of works by Casper David Friedrich

123
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:34,440
that the sublime doesn't mean anything today, that it's been stretched too far.

124
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,480
And so one of the things that I've actually been working on in contemporary aesthetics

125
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:47,080
is to come up with some sense of the concept of the sublime response that has a certain

126
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:54,880
shape to it and doesn't fall victim to Chaldal's charge that I think he said something like

127
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,840
it's the sublime has had 200 years to start meaning something coherent and it has failed.

128
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:08,400
But I would say that there really is a category, a set of category that makes sense, that is

129
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:18,440
kind of a mixed pleasureful experience in the 18th century when the category came to

130
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,000
be significantly theorized it was seen as kind of the whole of beauty.

131
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,440
So beauty was seen as largely very pleasurable, tranquil experience often of smooth or polished

132
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,760
formed, beautiful formed objects and the sublime was seen as kind of a more painful

133
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:51,960
tumultuous experience of often formless or vast overwhelming kinds of a paradigmatically

134
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,560
natural objects or scenes.

135
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,640
But it seems to me that there still is a kind of experience of being overwhelmed that is

136
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:10,360
both it's painful and it's also pleasurable that we still feel today that answers to the

137
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,120
concept of sublime.

138
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,160
If I could respond to where you started Sandra, I don't think it's such a concern that terms

139
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,200
and concepts get stretched out because that's what we do as language users.

140
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,840
We try them out in new contexts and we stretch them out as long as it's not really a problem

141
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,560
as long as we have central examples.

142
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:40,280
So we can talk about an examining table and we can talk about a massage table but we

143
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:46,440
still know that what a table is and this is our central example is something like this.

144
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,880
So if everybody had a paradigmatic example of the sublime experience that might help

145
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
us.

146
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,800
Obviously James has already given us his.

147
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,080
It's listening to what Mollers ninth or Beethoven's ninth.

148
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:08,480
Yes and the moment when the audience comes to tears for me it would be being really high

149
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,080
up in the mountains and being able to see range after range after range of mountains

150
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:21,680
all around me and be completely unable to take it all in and yet sort of in awe of this.

151
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,160
I still really like the natural supply.

152
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Do you have a central example?

153
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,320
Paul, I would be perfectly happy with yours and it's interesting of course that in the

154
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,680
development of landscape painting the Dutch in particular specialized in extended prospects

155
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:46,160
that were just like that painted from a high angle so that you saw against the across the

156
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,640
flat country of Holland through innumerable villages and spires becoming smaller and smaller

157
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:59,360
in the distance and finally arriving at what might be the sea but is so far away that it's

158
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,800
difficult to tell.

159
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:09,840
I certainly agree that that's a central experience of the natural sublime on this opposition

160
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,760
that the sublime is in the world and not in our head.

161
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:21,760
I think that already we're coming to the point where the question of whether the sublime

162
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:34,240
is bound to be very large or bound less, it already becomes a matter of interest because

163
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,840
to speak of the shape of the sublime experience I think is right the experience itself does

164
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:50,980
have a shape but the sublime the catalyst that which gives rise to the experience is

165
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:59,240
arguably and it depends who you listen to either almost infinite but still finite that

166
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:07,240
is to say an object in the external world or something that we think or constitute in

167
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,440
our minds as the infinite because of course we don't know the infinite in the external

168
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:19,920
world and this is one of the controversies about the sublime and it's very interesting

169
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:28,040
that even people who modern critics and thinkers who theorize about the sublime seem not altered

170
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,080
to get altogether to agree on it.

171
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:37,280
There's a book by Stephen Knapp of Professor Berkeley called Personification and the Sublime

172
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:47,560
that supposes sublime objects including supernatural beings, even human beings to have a finite

173
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
outline.

174
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:56,760
We recognize them in the form of their personification, a device or technique that we associate with

175
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,280
allegory so in some sense we can see them clearly.

176
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,840
In that case if you take built as your sublime literary text, Barak Solance who'd say well

177
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Satan is the sublime figure because Satan is a being that you can see but you're mistaken

178
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,560
if you think you know what the real extent of his magnitude is and we can come back to

179
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,640
that I don't want to dwell over it for the moment.

180
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,040
What I wanted to say for the moment was if on the other hand you think of the figures

181
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:38,480
of sin and death in Milton, not so much Satan but the figures of sin and death you see that

182
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,440
Milton's whole point about them is that they're shapeless.

183
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,320
Their magnitude is communicated as that which is boundless and has no form.

184
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,960
An underlying question for me in thinking about this and it may have to do with the relation

185
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,880
between the sublime and the science is the question of whether the sublime as it were

186
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,120
has a form.

187
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,760
Well can I follow through on that?

188
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
You mentioned Beethoven.

189
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,320
Let's think of a piece we all know probably Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and I mentioned

190
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,240
this for a few reasons.

191
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,320
You look at the score, I've had the manuscript or the notebook in my hands from a library

192
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,080
and cracker, but the score of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony you see something incredibly

193
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:32,320
structured and perfectly formed in the hands of a great interpreter and I think the sublime

194
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,160
in Beethoven's Ninth needs a great interpreter.

195
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,760
For example, Foutvegler, if you listen to the recordings of Foutvegler live of Beethoven's

196
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,520
Ninth Symphony, he transports this formal structure into something that at the end of

197
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,520
his performance, his particular performance, he goes beyond the pain barrier in terms

198
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:59,280
of tempo and in terms of spiritual ecstasy and takes us into something that's completely

199
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,240
eternal I think.

200
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:08,160
And yet interestingly, I mean, Vagner talked a lot about Beethoven.

201
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Foutvegler, the great Wagner interpreter, Beethoven interpreter read much or thought

202
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,680
about his interpretations through the writings of Schopenhauer for example, both Wagner and

203
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Foutvegler.

204
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:31,200
And so what I think music needs is music is not on the piece of paper sublime.

205
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,920
It needs great interpretation because Beethoven's Ninth can sound perfectly pedantic.

206
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,800
Well, one thing that also might be...

207
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:49,920
Is the distinction that made in the Third Critique between the mathematical and the dynamical

208
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,420
sublime.

209
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:58,920
So the mathematical sublime deals with vast formless objects or expenses, possibly expenses

210
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:10,000
of time and the dynamical sublime is about great power and sort of overwhelming power

211
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,360
dominance.

212
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:22,000
And so in some ways, one might think that an experience of a particularly sublime interpretation

213
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,320
of Beethoven's Ninth would trigger more of the dynamical sort of sublime so that one is

214
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:40,280
experiencing kind of being overwhelmed by some kind of power or emotional expression.

215
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,760
And perhaps it's not, in that case, it's not a kind of sublime that answers to the more

216
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
mathematical vastness.

217
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,680
That's interesting because there is a work by Schokhausen for three orchestras written

218
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:58,680
in 1954 which is incredibly complex because it's written on the 12-tone scale.

219
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,120
But every dynamic is controlled by mathematics.

220
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,400
Every note is controlled by mathematics.

221
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,960
The instrumentation, three different orchestras placed around the hall, very complicated for

222
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,360
the conductor because you have three conductors.

223
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
Each orchestra is playing at different tempers.

224
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,720
But it's perfect mathematically and it's so, so satisfying.

225
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,480
So that's probably an example of music that you can just look at as a trained musician

226
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,560
and find the sublime mathematical purity.

227
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,840
Go and listen to it if you don't know.

228
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,720
It's a challenging piece but it's wonderful.

229
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,600
Yeah, really wonderful.

230
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:50,960
A pioneering thinker concerning the sublime was a Greek teacher of Roman youth preparing

231
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,480
to enter into civic life somewhere between the third century named Lunginus.

232
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,600
And he wrote a treatise called On the Sublime.

233
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,160
And he distinguishes there in ways that aren't, I think, fully analogous with Kant's mathematical

234
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,920
and dynamic but at the same time rather interesting.

235
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:19,520
On the one hand, there's the sort of power expressed by the tearing apart of the fabric

236
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:28,360
of language through rhetorical devices, an opening of a gap or wound in ordinary discourse

237
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:37,040
where somehow what he calls visualization or the experience of something arresting or

238
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,640
terrifying from the outside emerges.

239
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:49,120
And on the other hand, he speaks also of a sublime experience that one has if one's an

240
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:56,840
auditor of Demosthenes being as he puts it, hit over the head again and again and again

241
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,040
and again.

242
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:05,520
In other words, with Demosthenes, it's a matter of sustaining the experience of being overwhelmed.

243
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,080
In other sorts of rhetorical experience, it's a matter of a sudden tearing apart of the

244
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:19,280
fabric of the experience which he calls persuasion or the coherence of an argument that can be

245
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,640
very exciting and compel us because it is coherent.

246
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,800
But at the same time, this sort of experience tears that apart leaving a sudden rift or

247
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:42,320
gap through which as he puts it, the experience of the sublime floods.

248
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,960
I just taught Lon Jaines to my undergraduates and one of the things that always interests

249
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,480
me when I teach that piece is at the end of it, he starts this discussion or picks up

250
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,120
discussion that he's had already with someone else about what kind of society fosters the

251
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
sublime.

252
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,280
So apparently, there are certain societies that foster more sublimity than others and

253
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:13,160
he wonders at first, is it that democratic societies and he's thinking of Athenian democracy.

254
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,720
That's what fosters the sublime.

255
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,240
But he says, no, what I really think is that affluent societies like ours, where people

256
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:27,000
get very interested in consumer goods, what we would call consumer goods, money, those

257
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,400
people are so preoccupied with mean thoughts of things.

258
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,960
Lon Jaines says at the beginning, if it's treated as anything that it's cool to despise

259
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,120
can't be sublime.

260
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,160
So it's cool to despise money.

261
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,680
We all know that it's a bit so that it can't be sublime.

262
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:54,920
So a money society has much less sublimity than a society that prizes genius and characters.

263
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,640
So I don't know what people think of that.

264
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,800
Maybe that's the problem, not that we've defined a sublime too thinly, but that we're

265
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:11,800
addicted to consumer goods and we've seen too many ads that say a cigar is sublime.

266
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,080
Do you remember that one?

267
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,040
You have to be a certain age.

268
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,520
Back when they could advertise cigars that way.

269
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,360
Is there anything to that?

270
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
I think so.

271
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,760
Actually, I go back to Kant a lot.

272
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,320
I think Kant had a very nice way of understanding the sublime.

273
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:42,520
And one of the key analyses that he gave was that in contrast to the beautiful, which

274
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,560
is a kind of experience of proposiveness, of a sort of being at home in the world where

275
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,960
things accommodate themselves to you.

276
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,760
Their forms are comprehensible and one can sort of slip easily into a kind of tranquil

277
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,840
free play of the intellectual faculties in the beautiful.

278
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:10,920
The sublime is an experience of contra-proposiveness where you do not feel at home in the world,

279
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:18,920
where things are difficult, they challenge you, where the paradigmatic for Kant, the

280
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:26,720
environment is hostile in a way either to our intellectual faculties, hostile to comprehension

281
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,360
or hostile to us existentially.

282
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:38,440
So I do think the sublime does seem to be a kind of experience where one is being challenged

283
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,520
in some way.

284
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,680
So if things are too comfortable, if your environment has been made so comfortable through consumer

285
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:54,520
goods, you're feeling pretty at home in the world where the sublime is a kind of, at least

286
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:00,640
according to Kant, kind of feeling not quite at home, which leads one to, so that's the

287
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,160
painful aspect of it, the experience of a person's or human limits, limits to our cognitive

288
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,560
abilities and limits to our, but to our very own existence or our own power.

289
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,600
So you're rooting for more snow right now, as well?

290
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,080
Now you know who to blame.

291
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
That's right.

292
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
Yeah, it's true though.

293
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,160
I think here in New York, if we had three feet of snow, we might have a greater chance

294
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,120
of an actual experience of the sublime rather than.

295
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,440
Some don't allow that the music of Marla, you mentioned earlier, it can be sublime because

296
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:41,360
Marla is so earthbound with tragedy and with the personal battle and so on.

297
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:48,480
But I've always found that repetition that you get in Marla sometimes of banality and

298
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,640
of struggle releases something just so moving and profound.

299
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,880
And I was thinking, as you all speaking, about a book I was just reading by a fantastic historian

300
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,760
Brian Moynihan about the Leningrad Symphony of Schostakovich and about the circumstances

301
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,160
historically surrounding the siege of Leningrad.

302
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:14,000
I mean, it's too horrific, but I do recommend the book, Siege and Symphony.

303
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,640
And thinking about the seventh symphony of Schostakovich, I don't know whether any of you know,

304
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,360
in the first movement, that is a prolonged, I say prolonged, ten minutes of side drum,

305
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,840
snare drum, just repeating this banal kind of threatening march.

306
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,400
And through repetition, but this is another area, I suppose, of hypnotism repetition.

307
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,720
I'm not sure that does that lead to the sublime, but through this grotesque music that some

308
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,640
people can't stand, frankly.

309
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:50,720
They dismiss, many people dismiss the symphonies of Marla, they can't take it, and dismiss Schostakovich.

310
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:58,280
But for me, that music, just through the pain and so on, really, really takes it somewhere.

311
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,040
The beauty of Mozart doesn't always do.

312
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Yeah.

313
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:08,320
Well, that's Demosthenes, I think, in the Londginian register.

314
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:15,600
And the element of repetition is an aspect, just as sheer accretion or accumulation of

315
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,120
Kant's mathematical sublime as well.

316
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:27,520
And I do see, somehow, a distinction between experiences, both sublime, one of which arises

317
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:34,120
from repetition or accretion, and the other of which arises from, as I say, a kind of

318
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:41,880
a blasting apart, which is momentary, is not sustained or repeated, but is momentary.

319
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:53,880
I thought, by the way, that if only for truth and advertising that we should acknowledge

320
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:01,400
rather strong adversary current in the 20th and 21st centuries concerning the sublime, because

321
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:08,000
it has been accused, if that's the right word, of being both patriarchal and tyrannical.

322
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:17,040
In other words, if one were to parse an ideology of the sublime, there are many who would say

323
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:25,720
that it's gendered, not just masculine, but hypermasculine, and that politically, and

324
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:31,360
this in some ways comes out already of the discussion at the end of Londginis, that

325
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:42,040
politically it's anti-democratic, that is to say, it imposes on the recipient kind of

326
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,720
tyrannical authority.

327
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,800
And this is very widespread.

328
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,280
I won't name names.

329
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,680
But a number of people who have made arguments of this kind, and it's interesting to think

330
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:02,440
about something I think those of us sitting here care about a great deal, under this sort

331
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:12,720
of threat and maybe thinking about how to counteract it, or at least put it in perspective.

332
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,640
I know that line of argument well, as you can imagine, and I don't buy it, and it's

333
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:25,600
partly because even in Londginis, one of his great examples of the sublime is a poem

334
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,880
lyric poem by Sappho.

335
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,440
And it's the first time in classical literary criticism I know of that a woman writer's

336
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,800
work is taken that seriously.

337
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,440
And I'm not a classicist, so I don't know this for sure, but is that the only reason

338
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,920
we have this poem by Sappho?

339
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,440
Because Londginis preserved it that way?

340
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,240
I think maybe I heard that one.

341
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,960
I think that it is the most preserved form of poem, though.

342
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,440
It was on, its praises were on everyone's lips.

343
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,440
And had been.

344
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,680
I mean, the extraordinary thing about the poem, as Londginis says, is that it expresses

345
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:13,520
uncontrollably emotion in perfectly controlled verse, the verse which we now call, sapphix.

346
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:19,480
It's an absolutely perfectly controlled meter, and yet constantly straining against it is

347
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:27,440
the volcanic emotion that she's feeling about her lost, beloved, anectoria.

348
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,200
And it's very emotional, and it's very physical.

349
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,600
It's very bodily.

350
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,000
And she's looking at this beloved woman, and she's sweating, she's trembling, she's gasping

351
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,520
for breath, she's cold and she's hot.

352
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,920
And it's the combination of all these things, Londginis says, that makes it sublime, the

353
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:51,400
fact that she can weave together all these chaotic and even contradictory physiological

354
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,800
symptoms as well as an.

355
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:59,480
So in Burke too, the great 18th century sublime theorist in the English tradition, in Burke

356
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,480
the sublime is very physical and very bodily.

357
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:11,400
And part of the slam against the sublime was that it's disembodied, and it's transcendental,

358
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:17,800
that there's such a rich sublime tradition, including Londginis and that citation of Sappho,

359
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,440
you know, that says, no, we feel the sublime in our bodies and with our bodies.

360
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,920
It's not up there someplace.

361
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,880
That's the, as I'm listening, I keep wondering, it's not anything I know much about.

362
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:43,960
But as I listen, I am not clear what's the, what is the experience and what is the product

363
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,000
that causes that experience.

364
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:58,840
So when you go up on the mountain and you are looking, is that perspective, that scenario

365
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:05,920
what you are seeing or is it what you are feeling the sublime.

366
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,520
And as a second question is, what is it you are feeling?

367
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:16,760
If you were to, because it seems there's always a lack of sharpness to me when we say

368
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,200
it's sublime.

369
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,600
What is it?

370
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,920
And what is it we feel?

371
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Is it joy?

372
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Is it all?

373
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:32,160
Is it the uncanny feeling which contains elements of some anxiety or discomfort?

374
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
So my...

375
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:41,040
Yeah, you know, the mountains by themselves are, if nobody's there, the mountains aren't

376
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,960
sublime, right?

377
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,560
The sublime is a human experience.

378
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,320
You need a human observer to have the sublime experience.

379
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,640
So that one's easy.

380
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,680
You know, the ocean isn't sublime when no one's out at sea in it, but you know, when

381
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,520
you have a huge wave and you're seeing it, it's sublime.

382
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,000
You know, that lack of definition is, this will sound like a cop out, but I don't think

383
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,400
it is.

384
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,160
The lack of definition is built into the sublime because it's what eludes our categories.

385
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,920
It's what Teats has this lovely phrase, you know, when he talks about how the Elgin

386
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,040
Marvel's Teases Out of Thought, the sublime is what Teases us Out of Thought.

387
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,800
We can't...

388
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,760
Our well-honed, you know, cognitive abilities are well-used, stable categories.

389
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,320
They just fall by the wayside.

390
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,560
It's a moment for me, the sublime is a moment of breakdown.

391
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:45,880
And in that moment, we get this sense that the world was greater than we ever suppose.

392
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,600
And Kant would add that, you know, the human mind is greater than we ever suppose, because

393
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:55,040
somehow, even though we can't imagine it, we can't take it in, we're still cognizing

394
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,800
it in some odd, intuitive feeling way.

395
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,520
So it's hard for me to know exactly what Kant means at that moment, but it's almost

396
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,320
like we feel our way into it.

397
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,160
We can't grasp it, but we know it's there.

398
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,760
I understand that, but then when I listen to James, and I'm very happy that he's here,

399
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,640
because he brings a perspective which I think is so important in this, he feels the sublime

400
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,360
a lot of the time.

401
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,320
You have to go up those mountains.

402
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:41,080
And James, he's almost constantly in the sublime.

403
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,960
That's why I started off by saying, I think music is the easiest.

404
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,200
But I was thinking about the mountains as well, because I had that same feeling when

405
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,800
I'd go up into the mountains.

406
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,120
And now I was thinking, I'm trying to figure this out for myself, the great symphonies

407
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,760
of Brookner.

408
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,240
I always think are sort of written for the mountain tops.

409
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,240
And he was writing his music to the glory of God, but somehow when you hear those giant

410
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,440
symphonies with their perfect mathematical structure, that's sort of where it takes me.

411
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:23,920
But music is not about trying to replicate the mountains.

412
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,840
And Beethoven in the pastoral symphony, as Wagner said, is not trying to depict the

413
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
countryside.

414
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,320
It's going beyond, beyond, beyond, beyond.

415
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:41,800
So for me, when I listen to a Brookner symphony, I get an extra dimension, frankly, than I

416
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,560
do from just being on the mountain top and being overwhelmed by that.

417
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,240
And great music for me.

418
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,080
That's because I'm a very simple soul, I think.

419
00:38:52,080 --> 00:39:01,440
Great music just puts me in touch, I think, with everything that has existed for all of

420
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,600
my lack of knowledge about pretty much everything.

421
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:10,240
That somehow there is a truth and a unity.

422
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,600
It's not a religion.

423
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,840
And I think I'm not going to say that, to what extent is all of this eventually just

424
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
chemicals?

425
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,920
I mean, this worries me a lot.

426
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,560
I'm thinking about, I try to analyze why do I have these feelings about music.

427
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,160
And I want to know more about what it is, and these days.

428
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:36,600
And is there not a path that is leading us to believe that all of this is simply actions?

429
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:43,120
Well, going back to the distinction between the sublime and the experience of the sublime

430
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,720
in the mountains.

431
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:54,120
Kant actually mentions the peasants of the Savoy, the Savoy, who are so acclimatized

432
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:59,000
to the mountains because they live there, that they have no experience of them at all.

433
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,320
And it's just their daily environment.

434
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:11,120
So that what Kant is suggesting is that a certain distance from the quotidian experience

435
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,320
of whatever it is that surrounds you is required.

436
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,800
And in a certain sense, that's not chemical.

437
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,120
Because if it were a chemical, you're in a mountain, you're going to have the experience.

438
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:30,600
And that's that, whereas Kant is suggesting that it must, to some extent, be a question

439
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,120
of environmental distance and not intimacy.

440
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,400
And that's where the element of fear, for one thing, comes in, which is so frequently

441
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,960
associated with the first phase of the experience of the sublime.

442
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:50,720
The idea is that initially, in response to something that seems overwhelming, we feel

443
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,000
fear.

444
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:00,760
But then we realize that we're not actually in danger, that it is a kind of a proxy danger,

445
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,320
that we are in effect safe.

446
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,960
We're standing at the top of the mountain, but there's the railing that the tourist

447
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,400
industry has put in for us.

448
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
And okay, fine.

449
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:23,360
And then, through a kind of recoil or retrieval of self-respect, we internalize the experience.

450
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:34,440
And we feel that in some sense, it is the result of our own emotional or negative power.

451
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,400
So that, and Lonzainus says this too.

452
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:43,320
He says, the amazing thing about a great utterance is that it transports us.

453
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,880
It puts us into an ecstasy, extosus.

454
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
It transports us.

455
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:55,600
So that we imagine that we ourselves have produced the thing that we have heard.

456
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,600
So he takes you through the whole experience as well.

457
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,400
It's like a kid watching a baseball game and swinging his little toy bat.

458
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,080
He hits a home run and he's just so enthusiastic, swinging his bat.

459
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,080
He thinks he hits the home run himself.

460
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,320
He had through the intensity of identification.

461
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:20,400
He has this moment of thinking he did it, which is part of the excitement.

462
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,640
Right, in music, the great interpreters are recreators.

463
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,120
I think the moment of performance, you are the creator.

464
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,400
I mean, you have to be to make it convincing, I think.

465
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:41,520
Well, one thing that fosters a puzzled over with this sublime experience that is this

466
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:50,080
kind of mixed, painful, pleasurable experience, which I think will get to some of your worries

467
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:58,520
is that it's not clear where exactly the pleasure should come from this experience.

468
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:07,160
So if the experience starts off with a feeling of being kind of terrified or overwhelmed,

469
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,120
potentially insignificant in some ways, where does the pleasure come from?

470
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,040
And that's been kind of a puzzle for philosophers from the 18th century on.

471
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,480
I've just been thinking about that.

472
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,800
And in relation to the experience on the mountain and the experience of great music, it's a

473
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,560
profound and wonderful loneliness.

474
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:39,160
You know, pleasurable, but terrifying, but worrying about wonderful loneliness.

475
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,960
That's interesting because part of the political critique is that the sublime is demagoguery

476
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:54,400
and that the power of an orator is capable of transforming masses into a single entity

477
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,640
or sinister community.

478
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
Yeah.

479
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:07,600
Well, I think the various philosophers have tried to come up with the answer to, you know,

480
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,680
where's the pleasure coming from?

481
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:18,440
And in some ways, I guess you get a more democratic kind of an answer from the transcendental

482
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:26,560
philosophers that in some ways that this experience highlights a kind of power within the individual,

483
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:35,720
within all human beings, in some ways to withstand this terrifying or overwhelming environment

484
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,440
or force.

485
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:45,880
So that there's a kind of a dialectic between feeling existentially very small and frail,

486
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:53,960
feeling powerful and in some ways transcending natural limits that one is confronted with

487
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,680
in these kinds of experiences.

488
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,680
So yeah.

489
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:03,880
And by the way, in New Zealand, you seldom find those safety rails when you go.

490
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:11,400
You know, so I wondered to what extent are a search for this sublime in nature in this

491
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,520
country where there are too many safety things there for it to remind you, whereas in New

492
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,280
Zealand, there's this fantastic kind of risk and people get killed and eaten by sharks

493
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:28,120
in Australia because there's no notice saying that sharks could eat you, you know.

494
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,120
So yeah.

495
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,880
Hands the privilege of music.

496
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
The what?

497
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,880
Hands the privilege of music.

498
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,880
Yes.

499
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:43,680
But is that the whole sublime experience?

500
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,120
In other words, you feel the fear.

501
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:57,880
But does the absence of the safety net, let's say, prevent you from the recoil and recovery

502
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:03,480
that is allegedly or traditionally part of the experience?

503
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:09,160
In musical terms, I realize that the only times that I think I can produce music of any

504
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:15,160
worth, which is probably seldom to be honest or any obvious, is when there's...

505
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,520
Don't say that, you will not have a job.

506
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,720
There's absolutely no sleep.

507
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,720
No, no, no, no.

508
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,800
You have to really throw all of that away.

509
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,320
And the great performers that I think, or we talked about Fuddfenga earlier, an age where

510
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:37,480
they were doing less repertoire, but doing it with such a whole-heartedness, it's very

511
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:43,080
seldom that I hear this is a terrible thing to say, right?

512
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:49,080
Modern performances where I don't feel safety net and there's something too structured as

513
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,320
there's something around the performance that doesn't release the sublime.

514
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,400
I mean, listen, sorry, but I'm thinking of no safety net.

515
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,720
Listen to Glenn Gould playing Goldberg variations.

516
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,440
If you want the sublime.

517
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,200
And that's also interesting because when I think about that, you can watch him play

518
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,880
and you can listen to him play.

519
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,240
And is the experience the same?

520
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:21,040
Is it even more sublime when you see this soul so wrapped up in his loneliness with this

521
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,360
music that you're drawn in profoundly?

522
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:30,960
Yeah, there's a category.

523
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,040
As you were talking about the lack of the safety net, I was thinking, if you read people

524
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:44,800
that nature writers like John Muir or that class, there's a class of experience called

525
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:52,080
edge experiences that often get represented where, again, you're pushed beyond what you

526
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,920
think is possible for you.

527
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,040
And yet you still survive.

528
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:03,920
And that is often a moment that that unleashes the sublime description.

529
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:10,240
And so I agree, if you play with a net, if you've got the guardrail, it's not going to

530
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,240
happen.

531
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,200
On the other hand, if you don't survive, then you can't ever tell about it.

532
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:22,840
I guess that's what I meant about the shark.

533
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,600
What about Chopinhauer?

534
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,600
Chopinhauer.

535
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:32,360
His theory of the sublime is, I think, very Kantian.

536
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:37,520
He kind of takes over a lot of the Kantian theory, the distinction between the dynamical

537
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,200
and the mathematical sublime.

538
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,760
But the key difference, I think, between their theories and actually this might lead into

539
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:52,600
the music as well, is that for Kant, the source of the pleasure and the experience of the

540
00:48:52,600 --> 00:49:01,480
sublime comes from the recognition of a super sensible part of us, which is for Kant our

541
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:10,560
rational location, our vocation to sort of understand, fathom nature as fully as possible

542
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:18,520
and our moral rational vocation to be able to obey the moral law no matter what kinds

543
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,840
of obstacles are put in our way.

544
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:29,360
And Chopinhauer had a very different view about morality and different take on the powers

545
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,560
of reason.

546
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:38,200
And so he replaces the role of reason in Kant with a certain kind of attitudinal freedom

547
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:46,000
so that when one is faced with very terrifying landscape, let's say you're facing a volcano

548
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:55,360
or a tornado or something or a raging storm at sea, that the pleasure that one would feel

549
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:03,120
according to Chopinhauer's theory would be a sense that one has a power to sort of respond

550
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,120
to it in a different way.

551
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:14,760
So one can not care, one can kind of disengage from the will.

552
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:19,200
But actually, Chopinhauer's theory is really interesting for music and I think why he was

553
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:28,200
such a darling of composers in that music for him was extraordinarily special in that

554
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:37,640
for his metaphysics, the ultimate nature of the world is will, sort of a blind striving.

555
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:46,760
And Chopinhauer thought that music actually was a copy of the metaphysical will and so

556
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,800
actually one's experience with music would be, with the right sort of music would be

557
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,840
more powerful than any other experience with art.

558
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,400
And one thing that's puzzled me though actually about Chopinhauer's aesthetic theory with respect

559
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:07,880
to music is that he himself does not apply his categories of the beautiful and the sublime

560
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,680
to music.

561
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,280
He talks about music as being the most powerful art form where we really sort of tap into

562
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:22,360
the ultimate nature of the world and we resonate with universal emotions and that gets us closest

563
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:30,680
to the way things really are but he does not talk about music as either a beautiful or

564
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:39,960
sublime but it seems that those categories would naturally fit quite well with music.

565
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:48,200
And I know Hanslek wrote on the musically beautiful but I was wondering actually if you

566
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:57,160
thought that is there a specific sort of music or there are specific kinds of forms in music

567
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:03,360
that you think would be the musically sublime that would be.

568
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:08,440
Of particular forms it's difficult to say.

569
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,880
I mean the Chopinhauer was such an influence on great music.

570
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:19,880
You can't imagine certain pieces I guess existing the same way without Chopinhauer in my limited

571
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:25,600
knowledge you know what I've read about the influence with Wagner and so on.

572
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:33,760
But when we think back in music I think the first sort of music I would call sublime might

573
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:41,960
be the music that had relatively little formal structure in a sense like music of Palestrina,

574
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,780
these great core pieces of Talis.

575
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:56,200
Music that just seems to hypnotize to flow, to be in touch with something that just goes

576
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,680
directly to our souls without us having to have any knowledge.

577
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,480
I think that's a great thing about music.

578
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,280
Maybe what he was capturing, talking about the will that music is closest is because

579
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:15,920
it's something so natural and to be very simplistic about it that wherever we go in the world

580
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:21,240
and we play a minor triad and we play a major triad everybody is going to understand what

581
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,440
is sad and what is happy, what is the fast rhythm, the slow rhythm.

582
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:33,720
So it's just I think was he saying that there's something so simply natural about music?

583
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:41,400
Yeah, I definitely thought that there was a kind of universal language of feeling to

584
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,520
music, at least the right sort of music.

585
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:53,000
He had tremendous criticisms of program music and music that wasn't truly expressive.

586
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,280
I think Wagner was very careful to talk about Beethoven, it's not a picture, the pastoral

587
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,280
symphony.

588
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:06,400
So many composers subsequently have been very, very cautious about attributing any kind

589
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,640
of description to that.

590
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,840
I put something and then withdrawn it later for this very, very reason because when you're

591
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:19,040
listening to the scene by the brook of Beethoven, you're not picturing a brook with fish and

592
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,600
glints of water.

593
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,760
Sometimes when we interpret that music and you're working with an orchestra and you're

594
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:29,160
not getting the sound you want, you do describe and you try to get the music by painting a

595
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,160
picture from home.

596
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:35,960
But that's not what it's about, it's about the overwhelming feeling of emotion.

597
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,680
How do you separate emotion from the sublime?

598
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:48,480
I mean, what is the difference between overwhelming emotion, overwhelming happiness and sublimity?

599
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,480
What is that?

600
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:57,560
Well, I think the sublime needs to be in some ways turbulent.

601
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:03,280
So there needs to be some kind of dialectic, maybe this is controversial, but some sort

602
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:12,360
of dialectic between a kind of feeling overwhelmed and then in some ways which would seem quite

603
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:23,040
negative, feeling overwhelmed by emotion or overwhelmingly sad and then some sort of positive,

604
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,000
effective experience that counters that.

605
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:36,280
So I'm not sure if an overwhelming sense of happiness would be a candidate for a sublime

606
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,600
experience unless there was in some ways some turbulence there.

607
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:45,800
It's interesting because most people when they talk about their love of Mozart and a

608
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:51,080
phrase of Mozart that really moves you, you talk about the happiness of Mozart but always

609
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:55,360
with a tinge of sadness, there's always something more than just happiness.

610
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:00,440
It's always, this genius always somehow reflects a contrast.

611
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,680
Oh, in the holy halls.

612
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,480
Yes.

613
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,120
What about program music?

614
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:14,080
Is there the possibility of sublimity in barely oats when we know the head is falling

615
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:22,520
from the guillotine into the basket or in Peter and the Wolf or whatever program music one

616
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:28,600
chooses to name, is there a possibility of sublimity or does the, I don't know, literary

617
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:33,240
ness or narrative ambition of the music somehow preclude the sublime?

618
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,160
No, I'm thinking actually the barely of somebody fantastic.

619
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:42,880
You think of the first movement of his inspiration from his unrequited loves and so on.

620
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:48,360
But when you think of the nature of that music in the first movement, I think that reaches

621
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:55,640
a kind of sublime because it just transcends any kind of poem or any kind of feeling.

622
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:02,320
I'm not sure about the march to the scaffold with the head falling into the basket but

623
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,480
maybe we need that contrast.

624
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,120
I think programmatic music can be sublime.

625
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:13,720
Think of, you know, you might like the Strauss Alpine Symphony where he does sort of describe

626
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,200
in chapters the journey of the mountain.

627
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:23,920
I think that that can reach in our minds in great performance, a tremendous sublimity.

628
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,360
I think it can be.

629
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,360
Why not?

630
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,440
But it somehow also, I also feel that those great pieces don't need the programmatic

631
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,440
content.

632
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,520
As we've been talking about the sublime in music, I've been thinking about are there

633
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:43,000
art forms that can't convey the sublime very well and I was thinking about film because

634
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,600
clearly there are films that try to convey the sublime.

635
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:51,200
But if you see them 20 years later, they just seem sort of pathetic in those attempts,

636
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,400
like the Ten Commandments.

637
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,480
I think for early audiences that was like, wow, that's onswire.

638
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,480
We see it.

639
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,480
They're not a spore option.

640
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,480
Yeah, right.

641
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,320
The first time you saw no spore option.

642
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,680
But they have to have music as well.

643
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,680
Right.

644
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,280
Well, and they do use music but like James Cameron's Titanic, that was an attempt to mass market

645
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:19,760
the sublime or the perfect storm at that moment when Mark Wahlberg for all his muscles is

646
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,960
about that big and the wave is that big.

647
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,440
That's a sublime moment but does it work or is it sort of cheesy?

648
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,680
Can film is film unable to sustain?

649
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,400
Can I make?

650
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,400
As opposed to...

651
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,400
I'm not trying to be a snob.

652
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,400
I'm just...

653
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,400
No, I'm just...

654
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,400
I'm just inviting you guys to be snobs.

655
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,840
I'm trying so hard.

656
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:51,960
Well, I mean, the question of whether artworks at all could be sublime has been a somewhat

657
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,760
controversial issue.

658
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,360
I mean, so in some ways that, you know, every...

659
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:02,840
Well, should I say, pretty much every work of art has some form or it has beginning,

660
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:11,400
in case of musical compositions, beginning and an end or a painting has a frame, you

661
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,680
know, there's a form to a film.

662
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:20,640
So would that in some ways discount it from being sublime just there?

663
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,960
And actually on some readings of Con, Con does sort of say, no, artworks can't be sublime

664
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,920
even though he has certain examples that he uses of sublime artworks but it seems like

665
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,640
it's a position that he made, it really held.

666
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:41,480
But it seems that it's as long as one can kind of...

667
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:47,720
If one has the sort of emotional response to say the Titanic, especially when it first

668
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:56,280
came out and there had been a lot of imitators, if one can have the experience of feeling

669
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:04,440
somehow overwhelmed or by the power of the sea and get into that dialectic of thought

670
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,360
and emotion, then why not?

671
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,120
Why couldn't that absolutely be sublime?

672
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,520
I don't see any reason in principle why it couldn't be.

673
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,600
It creates the New Zealand experience.

674
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:23,440
But it really does come back to the question though of the place of form and thinking about

675
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,600
the sublime again, as you say.

676
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:31,400
And you began by, or at one point reminded us that especially in the 18th century the

677
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:39,920
sublime is the gendered beautiful, Addison and Burke describe the beautiful as smooth

678
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,440
and round and soft.

679
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,480
Get it?

680
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:52,560
And associates the beautiful with reproduction.

681
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:59,040
The sort of the whole 18th century, Addison says of the beautiful, he distinguishes three

682
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:07,600
categories, the beautiful, the uncommon as he calls it, which came to be called the picturesque

683
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:12,000
and the great, which came to be called the sublime.

684
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,440
Well, the purpose of each of those is spelled out by Addison.

685
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,480
He says that the beautiful exists to procreate the species.

686
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:30,160
He says that the uncommon exists to inspire curiosity and to increase knowledge and that

687
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:36,560
the great exists to make us experience reverence for God.

688
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:45,280
In other words, it is something finite, but in the contemplation of which we realize that

689
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,600
there's something infinite.

690
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:50,880
In other words, in a certain sense, it already anticipates the argument of God except it's

691
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,880
not a subjective idea but a spiritual or transcendent idea.

692
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:07,360
But the beautiful is plainly the usurper of any idea of form because even the picturesque

693
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:14,280
to some extent, and certainly the great or the sublime, tend to take us out of form,

694
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:21,640
not necessarily not by way of form, I mean, obviously the intermediation is formal, but

695
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,080
it takes us out of form.

696
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:31,880
Whereas the beautiful is as it were form and for itself and for its own sake.

697
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:38,280
So the place of form in this conversation, I continue to think is an important one.

698
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:43,880
This round table, you have a picture, a Turner picture, right?

699
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,800
On the website, I think.

700
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:52,320
And just as you were speaking, I was reminded that Fingal's Cave of Mendelssohn, this wonderful

701
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:57,400
piece from the 1830s, came out the same, I think was performed the same year as the

702
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,400
Turner picture.

703
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,400
Is that right?

704
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,920
Of Fingal's Cave.

705
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,560
And that is framed.

706
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,040
Mendelssohn's music is not.

707
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,920
Which is closest to the sublime, I wonder.

708
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:14,320
Well, the Turner does its best not to be formal.

709
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,640
You have this huge cliff.

710
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:22,720
The actual cave is almost impossible to discern in the painting.

711
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:30,600
You then have the sea and you have the one thing that is formally and conspicuously there

712
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:39,560
is the, looks like a freight boat with a big cloud of black steam coming out of it.

713
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:46,200
On which we understand Turner was seated when he was thinking about how to compose his painting.

714
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,320
And that's what you can see.

715
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:54,000
As if to say, well, I am doing this from a perspective and I can show you the perspective

716
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,080
clearly.

717
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:02,520
But I don't actually want to show you the cave itself, maybe for just the reason that

718
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:06,440
if I do, music will have the advantage of me.

719
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:13,520
But as you describe the Turner painting, there's that loss of outline again and that confusion

720
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,840
of categories, what sky and what sea.

721
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:23,480
Or you know the burning ship paintings, what's fire and what's lightning coming down and

722
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,680
what's a shaft of light.

723
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,400
And it goes back to the Sappho poem where you're trembling and you're cold and you're hot

724
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,400
and you're sweating all at the same time.

725
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:39,800
And you can't organize your experience.

726
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:44,520
Your experience becomes radically disorganized and yet it's more powerful than it's ever

727
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,520
been.

728
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:51,200
So, for me, Turner totally works as a sublime but it's probably because he really captures

729
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,280
that suspension of our ordinary categories.

730
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,680
That seems to me to be one of his big programs in his art.

731
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:03,440
He was way ahead of music at that time after all.

732
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:09,480
I mean Mendelssohn's music is absolutely beautiful but very formally structured and is more obviously

733
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,080
picturesque, although I would argue that it isn't really.

734
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,080
It goes much deeper than that.

735
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:20,400
But when you think of what Turner was doing in the 30s, was 1832 I think.

736
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:36,560
I mean, music came several decades later, music that was so unfocused in the way.

737
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:43,040
You're going to the impressionists and it's amazing how I have to give it to Turner over

738
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,520
Mendelssohn.

739
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:51,600
It's interesting too that when you think about Turner, when you think about some of

740
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:59,320
the composers, there's a lot of hostility initially when they're doing their great works.

741
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,840
A lot of people don't understand them.

742
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:10,520
And is that somehow tied in with the sublime, the art that goes ahead of its audience, which

743
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:15,600
would again make it very different from a mass marketed film that wants to manipulate

744
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:20,680
its audience, that wants to hit its audience right where it already is.

745
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:26,240
Stravinsky famously said, I was the vessel through which Lesaka passed.

746
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:34,360
And you think of Schoenberg's music, which I would argue is absolutely sublime when he

747
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:43,560
became more expressionistic with the 12 tone system, so to speak, which music sounds more

748
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:48,640
modern today than most music being written today, actually, in the century on is still

749
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:53,000
totally misunderstood.

750
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,760
It seems that music takes a long time to catch up and we're in a world where we are so visual.

751
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:07,400
I would love to see a sublime cuddly toy made and my sublime cuddly toy would be a sort

752
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:16,840
of 12 tone wind up thing for babies to see what influence that would have on their perception

753
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,960
of music in later life.

754
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:26,320
I was just going to remark, in fact, in response to Alan's question how it is that art we consider

755
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:32,240
to be sublime or at least to have a legitimate aspiration to sublimity is so often greeted

756
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,720
with hostility.

757
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:38,320
And once spontaneous first response is, well, obviously, we fear what we don't know.

758
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:46,360
So it's a sublime emotion that we're having and it just kind of gets stuck on the dislike

759
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,080
that comes of fear and what we don't know.

760
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:56,200
But at the same time, you know, there again the question of is there a sublime experience?

761
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,960
The initial feeling of which is not fear.

762
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:05,680
I think that in the time being music and the way in which we respond to music, you've been

763
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:12,640
very strongly suggesting that that probably we need to not that some sublime experiences

764
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:20,840
don't begin in fear but that we need to dissociate, let's say our definition of the sublime experience

765
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,640
from the notion that it begins in fear.

766
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:30,200
There's a sublime moment in music which you either consider sublime or cheesy.

767
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,200
I consider sublime.

768
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:37,160
There's a wonderful oratorio by Edward Elgar whose music I love being English, the dream

769
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,520
of Gerontius or Gerontius.

770
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:45,400
And there's a moment in that enormous work where there's a terrifying sort of march in

771
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:55,960
the music and everything just goes crash and still where Gerontius is allowed or perhaps

772
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:59,920
allowed to see God for a moment but can't face.

773
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,200
And I'm thinking it allowed to see the sublime in a way.

774
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:08,080
So I don't think it's anything to do with God that's too restricting.

775
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:16,680
But it is the most amazing moment in music where it's so f***ing music, it's so fearful,

776
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,520
it's so overwhelming.

777
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:28,640
And the moment of reaching something, it's unattainable and everything collapses.

778
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:33,080
So the sublime is unattainable, Elgar's case.

779
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,880
Ready for questions?

780
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,880
Yes.

781
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,880
Okay.

782
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:46,680
Please line up.

783
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:55,960
It seems to me that there are a few ghosts who have been haunting this discussion and

784
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:09,560
I would like to hear your remarks on that and that those would be society, culture and

785
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,280
class.

786
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:18,840
And neither of those have been mentioned in an explicit way and it seems to me to be

787
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:26,560
very much the foundation of the sublime the way it's been discussed here.

788
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:38,080
Yeah, well we talked a little bit about society in relation to Longinus, right?

789
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:43,600
And his concern that this debate that was going on, whether you need a democratic society

790
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:49,240
for this, which is interesting because that would distance it from these fears that the

791
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:53,520
sublime is related to authoritarianism that Paul mentioned.

792
01:10:53,520 --> 01:11:00,480
Or whether what you need is a society that's less commercialistic and materialistic.

793
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:07,320
When you mention class, I don't know if there's an implicit question there about whether the

794
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:14,760
sublime is an inherently upper class phenomenon that you don't have a sublime until you have

795
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,760
a...

796
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,840
Yeah, please.

797
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:27,400
What I mean is when we're talking about sublime in music, it seems to me that there's most

798
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:34,800
of music that most people listen to really has a great class difference from the classical

799
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:40,600
music, especially 12 tone music.

800
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,840
What about the pretenders?

801
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:53,000
I mean, I think right, there's as much ecstasy and sublimity there as in any music.

802
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,720
But somehow that hasn't been a part of this discussion and it seems to me we're talking

803
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:08,360
about a particular notion of the sublime, which really has a class foundation or at least

804
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,880
a part of the foundation does.

805
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,720
Right, my vote would be for Jimi Hendrix.

806
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:21,240
But seriously, and you know, you're right, I mean, here we're all academically trained

807
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:30,120
and so we're going to our stock academic examples, Turner, Moller, Milton, you've heard them

808
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:34,680
all and you're right, there's a bigger world of sublime out there.

809
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,360
It's interesting in terms of the limits of the discussion, it is interesting that we

810
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:42,600
don't want to talk very much about religion because there's clearly an overlap between

811
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:48,600
the awe of the sublime and the awe of a lot of religious discourse and experience.

812
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,880
So yeah, you've definitely located one of our blind spots so far.

813
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:58,240
All along the watch tower in particular, if we vote for Jimi Hendrix.

814
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:03,320
And the musicians pointed you, I mean, one of the things I truly believe is music is

815
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:11,320
music, you know, so within the day of music, I hate the barriers that we put up that are

816
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:16,440
both restrictive and suggestive of class and elitism.

817
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:30,680
But what I'm just thinking about mostly is culture, which licenses ecstasy and that's

818
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:43,720
the kind of sublime that I find the most aggressive, you know, has the most aggressive

819
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:51,240
call on my particular way of responding.

820
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:59,640
And it's distinctly a social form and that really hasn't been mentioned.

821
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:09,560
Yes, we understand about, you know, whether it's democracy or you shouldn't be so, you

822
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,360
know, much interested in money.

823
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:16,640
So the wealthy who don't have to worry about money, it's not the poor people, right?

824
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,280
So do they somehow lack for the sublime, right?

825
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:29,000
Could I jump in actually just quick because I do think we've been largely talking about

826
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:35,600
an aesthetic tradition that considers aesthetic experience to be disinterested.

827
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,120
And so there is a certain kind of presumption that, well, one needs to have some leisure

828
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:46,440
time, one needs to be able to take, you know, time away from one's concerns in order to

829
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:50,040
appreciate something in a disinterested fashion.

830
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:57,480
That you could say, well, that's a privilege of people who have some significant leisure

831
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,240
time.

832
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:06,760
But at least with the 18th century tradition of the sublime, I would say it focused more

833
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,040
on nature, though, than art.

834
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:18,120
And one of the environments that was seen to be the most sublime were the starry heavens

835
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:25,200
above us, which is anybody, you know, with eyes to look up at the night sky.

836
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:32,520
So I think it's, I mean, I agree that kind of class bias, one needs the leisure time

837
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:38,920
in order to have a kind of disinterested appreciation, but the objects, the sublime, I would think,

838
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,440
in some ways, are more democratically open.

839
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,440
Okay.

840
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,040
I'd be more of a discussion.

841
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,880
Or is these days flexible?

842
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:50,880
Yeah.

843
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,680
I would allow people with questions for it.

844
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,680
Okay, go ahead.

845
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,120
Thanks, everybody, for a memorable discussion.

846
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:07,400
My question is for Professor Frye specifically in a concerns ecology and the sublime.

847
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,480
Characterizations of the sublime historically have been inflected with terms of terror

848
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:15,720
and fear, which precipitate from the central concern of death and the subjectivity that

849
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,640
gives rise to.

850
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:22,600
It's universally acknowledged, or ought to be universally acknowledged, is tracked towards

851
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:28,880
what C.S.L.A. would call the death of earth in four quartets.

852
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:35,400
Fossil fuels accumulating in our atmosphere just rang for me when you talked about the

853
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:39,280
sublime as repetition and accretion.

854
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:44,440
And that production is ingrained in our quotidian lives, our daily lives.

855
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:50,880
So if the experience of the sublime requires a kind of distance from quotidian experience,

856
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:55,480
then that be achieved in this particular context.

857
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:00,080
If it requires this kind of internalization of a proxy danger, what happens when the danger

858
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,160
is very real?

859
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,600
How does that complicate the internalization process?

860
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:13,280
Guess what I'm getting at in the context of our ecological moment, the impending catastrophe

861
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,280
probably.

862
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:18,240
We don't have a time scale, but it's looking that way.

863
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:22,320
The reality of sublimity available to us.

864
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,480
If it's not, is that a problem?

865
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,800
And if that's a problem, is it a political problem?

866
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,800
Thank you.

867
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:29,800
Thank you.

868
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,360
It's a very interesting question.

869
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:38,720
I think the very concept of the Anthropocene itself is sublime, primarily because it has

870
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:46,160
to do with the traditional, very traditional way in which the sublime is a questioning

871
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,760
of the limits of human power.

872
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,920
There's an odd paradox about the Anthropocene.

873
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:59,200
On the one hand, we are holding our feet to the fire as a civilization in a way that

874
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,120
we never did before.

875
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:08,240
And on the other hand, we are supposing ourselves to have greater power than we supposed ourselves

876
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,320
ever to have before.

877
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:15,480
And in either case, you could say, that it's something like a sublime experience.

878
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:23,360
I suppose the question is, depending on the degree that one might feel that the Anthropocene

879
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:32,200
is, how can I say it, a strong argument as opposed to a concern of global warming?

880
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:41,040
One might wonder about whether or not the relationship between the human and the impending

881
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:45,840
disaster remains sublime in the same way.

882
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:53,600
You could argue, given the agreement most of us probably share that the debate is impending,

883
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:59,000
you could argue that this is very much like the traditional sublime moment in which one

884
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:05,920
is having a Birkian experience of being overwhelmed by something external.

885
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:12,480
And you could argue that if we accept the strong argument about human responsibility,

886
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:20,920
that that's more like the content experience of recognizing something in yourself in response

887
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,040
to what you see in the external world.

888
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:28,560
So I guess I would put the ecological question in relation to the sublime in those terms.

889
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:35,360
Sorry to have gone on, but you did ask me.

890
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:41,360
I too would like to thank the panel for a fascinating and broad-ranging discussion.

891
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:47,800
The question I have, I guess, relates to the difference between the object that's nominally

892
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:53,480
sublime and the experience, the chemicals in our brain.

893
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:59,560
I'm told that the liveness in the newtons have a sublime experience thinking about numbers.

894
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:04,520
That would not be my experience, but I accept that they do.

895
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:12,760
The question I have is, is there a relationship between the peak experience that may not have

896
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:21,800
any objective cause, particularly the zen and the art of archery type experience that

897
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,720
we experience not necessarily for archery?

898
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,760
It may come from Le Maud Joust.

899
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,200
It may come from hitting a perfect forehand.

900
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:35,600
It may come from various other types of events.

901
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,120
Is that similar in some sense?

902
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:42,560
It feels to me as if it's similar, but maybe a minor league form of the sublime, not in

903
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:47,800
the level of appreciating Bach or feeling transported, but I'd be interested in your

904
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,800
thoughts.

905
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:58,080
I think it's close, but I think that it absolutely borders on it, but that the difference for

906
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:02,760
me would be, well, it depends on how you experience.

907
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:08,480
If you experience it as the ultimate moment of mastery, like you really got it, then to

908
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:14,480
me it's not sublime, but it's close because you've transcended your usual capabilities

909
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:21,080
and done something like being in the zone.

910
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:27,640
If you had this moment where you had no idea what you did, and then you looked and the

911
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:32,240
arrow was quivering right in the heart of the bull's eye, that's more like the sublime.

912
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:37,320
When you weren't there, you didn't get to be there, and yet it happened.

913
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:42,040
Again, you get a sense that, wow, there's something going on that I don't have a handle

914
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:47,120
on, control over that's bigger than me, and yet it just did this thing.

915
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:53,920
That to me would be closer to the sublime, if not the sublime itself.

916
01:21:53,920 --> 01:22:01,520
The marvelous discussion, and it's all present for me because I haven't been thinking about

917
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,240
the sublime.

918
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:11,400
My experience with what's happened here is all within the context of the now.

919
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:20,160
It was going to say it wasn't a sublime experience, and I don't mean that as a subtle comment

920
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,640
on the discussion, which I think was terrific.

921
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:29,560
Instead, it became a graphic experience for me after a progression because when I came

922
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:32,520
in, I began to hear a discussion of binaries.

923
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,040
You had fear, and then you have this experience.

924
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,800
You have something else.

925
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,000
You have go to the mountains.

926
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,640
You hear music.

927
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:48,480
I was hearing a binary, and largely a binary of flow, an experience and a consequence.

928
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:57,480
And it became graphic, and eventually, out of the past because it was spots, it became

929
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,680
sublime.

930
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:08,720
I was hearing a discussion of sublime, and philosophers may have disagreed, which suggests

931
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:15,160
to me, therefore, they were landing on different landscapes or having different experiences.

932
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:20,120
And within this context, there is no set definition, at least, that I heard of the sublime.

933
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:24,640
So we have a plurality of sublimbs.

934
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:30,200
Mostly as I say, the binary was something leading to something.

935
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:35,960
But there was not a word used that I'd like to see if you have any comments on it.

936
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:45,760
It suggested, constantly, discontinuity, that in this plurality of experiences, I would

937
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:53,840
say with music, it's a flow, not a discontinuity from what's happening to the sense of the

938
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,080
sublime.

939
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:05,920
But in the disruption of life, severe loss, suddenly, all expectations, and impasse.

940
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,400
There's a discontinuity.

941
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:14,440
On other levels, there are discontinuities, expectations, totally.

942
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,000
No, wow.

943
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,800
And you could have that.

944
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:25,680
So I'm seeing this graph of physical.

945
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:30,400
You mentioned various physical things happening, and then the sublime.

946
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:37,760
Sensual, many senses, visual, and sensual, leading to this.

947
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,280
Emotional, strong emotional experiences.

948
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:45,520
So I just wanted to share that, and then get a sense of, particularly, the sense of how

949
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:53,400
discontinuity, as well as the flow, are related to this experience, and then the product,

950
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,160
which we call the sublime, but should be sublime.

951
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,160
Thank you.

952
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:02,200
I feel very strongly that discontinuity is at the heart of the sublime.

953
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:09,240
And that's why I talked about the rift in the fabric of communication, or rhetoric,

954
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:16,400
or discourse, something that unexpectedly bursts through.

955
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:22,200
And I think in the 20th century, one of the more interesting instances of thinking of

956
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:28,960
it this way is in the work of the Frankfurt School philosopher Walter Benjamin, who speaks

957
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:39,560
of distraction or cerstroyonk as a necessary component of the experience of genuinely modern

958
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:42,320
art.

959
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:47,160
And the way I always try to explain it is that it's basically it's saw on the road to

960
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,160
Damascus.

961
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,120
He's writing his horse along.

962
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,520
He's paying no attention.

963
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,720
And all of a sudden he falls off his horse.

964
01:25:54,720 --> 01:26:00,120
And he picks himself up, dust himself off, and he realizes that now he's Paul, somebody

965
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:08,520
with whom I can identify, and that he has had a transformational experience.

966
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:15,800
He could not have had this experience except as a form of disruption or distraction.

967
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:20,440
He couldn't have had the experience if he just kept galloping Damascus.

968
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:29,080
There had to be this moment of complete disruptive surprise which opened up for him the possibility

969
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,840
of a transformative experience.

970
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:37,640
And I think that's the way Benjamin thinks of distraction and, for example, the work

971
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:38,640
of art essay.

972
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:42,480
I want to say about discontinuity in terms of music.

973
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:48,360
Well in music, I'm just thinking as you were speaking that you think of the sublime continuity

974
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:55,120
of the music of Mozart, and he wrote from one moment to the next that you can see just

975
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,400
a complete flow.

976
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:01,120
And then you think of the disruptions that Beethoven went through in order to achieve

977
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:07,280
the fifth symphony, and how he almost didn't get to the point that we know now is the sublime

978
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,280
work.

979
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:12,920
Because his work was constantly, he was disrupted by his own thoughts.

980
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:19,880
He was such a lack of continuity in his thought, and yet he chiseled away and managed from

981
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:24,000
all of this to produce these cohesive, wonderful pieces.

982
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,480
That's probably nothing to do with your question really, but just as simple musicians.

983
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:35,480
Yeah, I'm wondering how much does one state of mind determine whether you have a sublime

984
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,920
experience as opposed to the actual event?

985
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,960
Can anything cause someone to have a sublime experience?

986
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:46,960
If they're in the right frame of mind, particularly if they're on the right drugs.

987
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:56,000
I actually think sort of depending on your view of the sublime, I think if you go with

988
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:03,520
a more physiological view of the sublime, like in Burke, where it's in some ways a kind

989
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:13,200
of relief from a terror or a kind of relaxation of mental and bodily exertion, then it seems

990
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:19,400
like it would be kind of a fairly easy experience for anyone to have.

991
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:26,080
But I think those who take a more transcendental approach to the sublime see that there's much

992
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:32,520
more of a cognitive element to a sublime experience that involves a kind of train of thought

993
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:37,600
about one's place in the universe and a human's in nature.

994
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:43,760
And in that case, I think you might need a little more education of a certain sort or

995
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:50,240
you might have to have a certain ideas in order to have that sort of sublime experience.

996
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:56,240
Wouldn't that imply that the same event would cause the same people to be sublime?

997
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,240
Why?

998
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:00,280
It seems like people have very different experiences with the same event.

999
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,680
So there's not absolutely about it.

1000
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,920
It just depends on the person.

1001
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:11,920
Yeah, although I think even though different people might have different experiences, you

1002
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:16,520
might think that well, certain experiences are more appropriate for the environment than

1003
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:20,440
others or certain experiences may be more serious.

1004
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:25,000
So I think in some ways it doesn't mean just because people might have different experiences

1005
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:31,480
doesn't mean that there's no normativity available to us about these experiences.

1006
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:36,600
I think he goes back to the first intervention that I mean there is cultural conditioning

1007
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,360
in the experience of the sublime.

1008
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:46,520
And probably there isn't anyone who doesn't fall under one form or another of that cultural

1009
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:56,920
conditioning and therefore responds to a certain set of external events as the sublime.

1010
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:04,920
I think that's possible, very, very probable and that that means all kinds of music, all

1011
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:10,600
kinds of art, all kinds of experience in the natural world.

1012
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,600
Thank you.

1013
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,600
Hi.

1014
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,160
Thank you so much for this awesome roundtable.

1015
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:20,160
I have a question that's similar but looking at it from a different perspective from the

1016
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:29,040
individual feeling connected to the universe and whether or not the sublime or that moment

1017
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:36,280
of feeling beauty or feeling sublime be a way to connect to society, to feel like a member

1018
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,280
of a community.

1019
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:42,280
For example, I know that feeling standing on top of a mountain and you know that feeling

1020
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:48,640
and you know that feeling and that I could know that feeling when you mention it implies

1021
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:52,840
that there's some kind of shared or communal experience.

1022
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:58,600
And if you could talk about how I'm also coming through this from the perspective of Emerson

1023
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:03,440
and his idea of like the common heart and human sentiment and if you could talk about

1024
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:15,200
how that could maybe be the foundation for society or community.

1025
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,160
You went on the mountain.

1026
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:25,320
So that's a really thoughtful question and I appreciate it.

1027
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:29,920
And I'm understanding it various ways and one is at first I thought you were asking is

1028
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:35,680
there a kind of a social sublime and then I started to get worried about there's the

1029
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:44,320
fascist sublime where you're part of the crowd and that to me is not the sublime maybe just

1030
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,320
because I find it distasteful.

1031
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:52,680
I'm not sure I have a good intellectual reason to rule that out but then I understood you

1032
01:31:52,680 --> 01:32:01,440
saying do you tap into something that then connects to everyone else?

1033
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,040
We were just talking about the sublime disruption.

1034
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:08,240
Can the sublime also lead to connection?

1035
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:17,160
I guess there it would be insofar as the sublime shakes you out of your habitual sense of self,

1036
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:24,440
makes you out of your sense of you as a stable individual with this name and this history.

1037
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,520
Then does it enable new kinds of connections?

1038
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,320
And yeah I would say yes.

1039
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:37,320
Hi, thank you for your discussion.

1040
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:43,800
I have a question about the permanence of sublime and a couple of examples about this

1041
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:49,600
is I always take pictures of everything so I'm very observant of my surroundings and

1042
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:54,520
a pigeon on a rail on the way to work one morning will cause me to take pause and it's

1043
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:57,080
almost sublime something so simple.

1044
01:32:57,080 --> 01:33:01,120
And the next morning I'll see the same thing and it's not there but the memory of the first

1045
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,760
one remains.

1046
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:09,320
So memory and sublime I think is something that I wonder about but also going back to

1047
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:15,160
the mountains for example let's say you make that trip with someone you love and you lose

1048
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:22,120
that loved one and suddenly that experience is shifted into a very different painful type

1049
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:23,120
of sublime.

1050
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:28,200
I was just wondering if you could comment on that.

1051
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:35,480
Actually the mountains is a really interesting example and there's a book called Mountain

1052
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:43,920
Gloom and Mountain Glory, thank you, Marjorie Hope Nicholson and if I recall correctly her

1053
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:51,560
thesis is that actually it wasn't until about mid-17th century that is that right that people

1054
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:59,680
started actually thinking of mountains as sublime and not blights on the earth's surface and

1055
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:07,960
that's largely because of theological views that held that the earth was originally made

1056
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:14,560
by God to be perfectly smooth and that it was because of the fall and sin that then the

1057
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:22,200
world became you know a pocked with mountains and so in some ways it seemed that at a certain

1058
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:31,520
point it had to be people's ideas about the earth and theology that enabled mountains to

1059
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:37,160
become sublime and I think to be experienced as sublime I think one of the issues that

1060
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:44,640
you raised about you know sort of what's the subjective component to the sublime experience

1061
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:53,040
how much has it to do really with the ideas we have of the world and the metaphysical ideas

1062
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:59,360
or even personal subjective associations you know I climbed that mountain with the love

1063
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:08,040
of my life or something like that so I think I mean that's gets at some of the subjective

1064
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:15,120
aspect of this experience and which would make it I think very difficult to give any convincing

1065
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:20,680
account of sublime experience that is perfectly objective you know that well these kinds of

1066
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:29,160
things are sublime and these are not it seems to have a lot to do with personal and also

1067
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:40,200
cultural and intellectual associations what interests me about this lecture is it starts

1068
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:45,760
out with a particular point and then radiates all over and the complexity of the subject

1069
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:51,960
becomes vaster and vaster now I'm a pain story and so I'm going to speak a little bit

1070
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:57,880
on a biased point of view from my particular stance but this kind of discussion has happened

1071
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:05,000
more in the last 10 15 years and prior to that there wasn't as much interest in the sublime

1072
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:12,040
and when you go back in history and you see religion took a very strong point and then

1073
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:17,240
we move into the 19th century with nature and then art took on the role of the sublime

1074
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:23,880
it became the mediator of the transcendental and then the art world changed and it went

1075
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:29,920
into a gear of high and low and there was a questioning about should we be involved in

1076
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:34,760
the cloud should we be thinking more about what's happening on the sidewalk around us

1077
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:41,800
to look at all the all the de-trius of the world and the the emphasis on this peak experience

1078
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:47,400
on this this experience of transition or the friction within the pearl that brings about

1079
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:54,280
this this thunder was not essential and I'm finding now in these years which is interesting

1080
01:36:54,280 --> 01:37:00,920
with the pendulum is swinging and there's more discussion about this nature of of things

1081
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:08,440
of this sort and so again it is such a brought up so I didn't because there were so many

1082
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:13,720
subjects that came under but perhaps the most important thing discussed was the concept

1083
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:22,680
of discontinuity which does bring out the the awe and the sense somehow that we are the

1084
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:29,640
human condition is a very fragile and and limited condition and I think it's that awareness

1085
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:33,880
how fragile we are as as humans and as the earth is.

1086
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:42,760
The 20th century saw a widespread distrust of aesthetics in general one might want to say

1087
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:52,600
not just of the sublime the beautiful for its part came under a comparable cloud the literary

1088
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:58,680
critic A.A. Richards early in the 20th century spoke of the phantom aesthetic state and what

1089
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:08,760
he meant was the state of disinterestedness in Kant in which we have an aesthetic experience

1090
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:16,520
as opposed to a pettitive experience or a cognitive slash moral experience the only one of those

1091
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:24,200
experiences which being which is disinterested being the aesthetic experience the 20th century

1092
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:32,760
skeptical of most things has been skeptical of disinterestedness in general and has insisted

1093
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:40,680
through the great triumvirate that recur called the hermatives of suspicion marks Nietzsche Freud

1094
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:49,640
has insisted that experience is interested and that there is no bracketing of a certain kind of

1095
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:57,000
experience as though it were disinterested so therefore in in in this sense it was the aesthetic

1096
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,680
in general that went into a kind of eclipse people were afraid to talk about their appreciation

1097
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:13,000
of art or of their environment on aesthetic grounds now this it seems to me for a variety of reasons

1098
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:19,560
that I'm not sure I fully understand because perhaps I'm a little skeptical myself despite being

1099
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:29,800
very interested in aesthetics this it seems to me has somewhat subsided this as it were hostility

1100
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:35,640
toward the aesthetic and we're hearing in addition to hearing more about the sublime again we're also

1101
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:44,040
hearing more about the beautiful there are people main scary just to name one who are dedicated to

1102
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:51,240
what I think in the early 20th century would have been called cult of beauty and insisting on the

1103
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:58,360
return of this as a category which is intrinsically an ethical one and I think the return of the sublime

1104
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:06,600
also has an interest and implicitly ethical dimension of the kind that we've been obliquely

1105
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:12,200
talking about during this whole discussion so that that's how I would maybe explain if that's the

1106
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,440
right word how it's returning you know

1107
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:20,040
there's been a great emphasis on deconstruction of everything a whole concept so it's curious now

1108
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:26,920
that the parts are being looked at that is unbroken but I think it seems to me also there were a

1109
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:32,760
couple of moments in the middle of the 20th century though where the sublime kind of in painting came

1110
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:35,560
back yeah right

1111
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:52,440
I thought that was sublime but I was afraid to say something okay okay hi this discussion seems to be

1112
01:40:52,440 --> 01:41:01,480
dancing around the fringe and not tackling the issue that would seem to be essential to most

1113
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:09,320
people who think about this subject namely what is the meaning of these experiences yes on one

1114
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:15,960
level a mountainous mountain is just a rock and then somebody comes along and has a different

1115
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:23,640
experience of it is that experience merely an illusion based on the chemicals that are dancing

1116
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:31,320
around inside our body or is it just that those chemicals are associated with an experience

1117
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:38,280
that has some real meaning that tells us something that is beyond the immediate reality of our

1118
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:44,360
perspective and is carrying and giving us some clue to another dimension some would call it mystery

1119
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:51,880
of course some people with that because then that takes you into the realm of spirituality and

1120
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:59,000
some people then get suspicious are you talking about God perhaps and many feel much more comfortable

1121
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:09,720
in reducing it to the materialistic level and talking about these chemicals dancing inside so I

1122
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:17,960
wish you would address that these experiences meaningful in giving us a clue to something that is beyond our

1123
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:25,320
understanding beyond our immediate perception but that represent that represents something that is

1124
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:33,560
a reality but something that may be beyond our grasp of our immediate reality I would like someone

1125
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:38,840
else to answer that question because I feel like I've already come closest to that of anyone but I

1126
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:43,000
did want to say this is like the third or fourth time that the chemicals in the brain have come up

1127
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:48,760
and I just wanted to make a point about the chemicals every thought we have is because of

1128
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:56,840
chemical reactions every perception every movement we make none of that happens without chemical

1129
01:42:56,840 --> 01:43:02,200
reactions in the brain so to say something's just chemical everything everything in our

1130
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:08,040
mental lives is chemicals in the brain so it doesn't reduce it or you know that that's cut for me that's

1131
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:14,120
that's sort of a category mistake so so I just want to get the chemicals that's not entirely true

1132
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:18,760
what you're saying because there are many people who do believe that it's just the chemicals I mean

1133
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:27,000
one big school of neuroscience for example would say that that brain is just it's another name for

1134
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:34,840
consciousness and that consciousness is brain okay and that's another way of saying that it's all

1135
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:40,040
physical it's all chemicals of course I mean we couldn't be here we couldn't be having this

1136
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:45,720
discussion unless we were encased in a body with all of the physiology associated with that but is

1137
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:53,160
there something beyond that these experiences merely illusions is your experience of music merely an

1138
01:43:53,160 --> 01:44:00,760
illusion because it evokes those chemicals in your body and do the chemicals produce the

1139
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:06,440
experience does the experience produce the chemicals or are the chemicals just associated with an

1140
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:13,320
experience that has some meaning yet beyond the immediate reality I mean I can't answer that music

1141
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:21,320
that question in music I I believe that my reaction to music when I first heard it and I hear it now

1142
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:28,440
is something beyond something I don't understand can't comprehend but I'm always trying to challenge

1143
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:38,920
that I find the fascinating and challenging that with with questions all the time and why I don't

1144
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:45,080
believe that that it's God I don't I'm not sure what it is but I do believe that that sense sense

1145
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:53,800
of sense central loneliness that we discussed earlier brings me together with something that I

1146
01:44:53,800 --> 01:45:05,800
think that that in great music that it does serve a purpose I believe the great music can simply

1147
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:10,360
bring us together whether we want to call it God whether we want to call it spirituality whatever

1148
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:16,920
we want to call it I really believe not only great music great art that is its its role its

1149
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:23,560
purpose its design its glory well there's a legend about Verdi that as a child

1150
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:34,520
the first time he heard a symphony or some music that overwhelmed but he fainted and then his parents

1151
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:41,480
decided that maybe we should get him that piano he's been asking for I think your question is a good

1152
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:48,280
one but I don't think we have an answer for it well there may not be an answer but I think it's a very

1153
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:53,320
important thing but I think it's your answer but if I understand you correctly you are trying to

1154
01:45:53,320 --> 01:46:00,440
say at which point does the chemistry stop and something else is added to it I don't know if anybody

1155
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:08,120
can tell you at which point chemistry stops and something is added to it unless you bring in belief

1156
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:17,800
could I actually well I do think there's a there's a non-theological answer that I'm kind of sympathetic

1157
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:24,520
with that comes out of the shop and how are kind of tradition which sees the the the meaning of

1158
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:32,520
sublime experience as a kind of revelation of freedom so that which is a pretty mysterious thing

1159
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:38,840
you know that we are beings who are natural beings but we also seem to have free will and

1160
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:44,120
operate on a what some philosophers call a space of reasons that is not

1161
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:53,400
just reducible to kind of a causal story and for for a common shelf and how are the the experience

1162
01:46:53,400 --> 01:47:02,760
of the sublime was the way we could have a felt recognition of our freedom when I look thank you

1163
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:08,360
come to realize a little more question okay go ahead well when I come to realize that everything

1164
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:18,520
in the external world however large or distant is nonetheless finite the discovery of the very

1165
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:28,200
concept of infinitude that I find in myself is the signal in this in the sublime experience in this

1166
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:37,800
tradition of freedom because freedom is nothing other than the escape from limits and if the

1167
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:46,040
experience of the external discloses in me the escape from those very limits the power to escape

1168
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:52,120
from those very limits that in that tradition that's another way to put it is the meaning of the sublime

1169
01:47:55,960 --> 01:48:01,720
okay two more questions and then we'll stop first like I saw on this day I'm going to

1170
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:05,480
first oxhole couldn't make it because this question was originally meant for him but

1171
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:15,800
it's about a distinction so I study mathematics and it's not clear to me that I've ever experienced

1172
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:22,200
the sublime in what I do but it's all it's been clear to me that I've certainly experienced wonder

1173
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:29,080
and our discussion of wonder at least my impression of it is it's something that's it's got wonder

1174
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:35,720
arouses a kind of productive curiosity about the world and it sort of fosters curiosity in science

1175
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:42,760
and my question I guess is there a distinction between wonder and the sublime

1176
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:55,080
and is if there is is the sensation of the sublime is that well certainly it seems to be only

1177
01:48:55,080 --> 01:49:02,360
encountered in the arts and literature and music and what would that look like in a sort of a

1178
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,040
more scientific mode

1179
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:17,480
what you know for me wonder is obviously they're close because the experience of awe can be applied

1180
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:23,960
to wonder or the sublime right so that so there's our our stretching of language again but if I

1181
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:29,800
were going to try to distinguish wonder from the sublime I would say wonder makes us it it

1182
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:34,920
there is a certain amount of awe involved with it but it makes us want to it makes us want to

1183
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:40,520
know more and more about something right this is wonderful I want more intimacy with it I want

1184
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:49,000
you know to really plunge into it now that wonder peaks us and and gets us engaged the sublime

1185
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:55,720
knocks us off our feet right and and makes us feel that any amount of knowledge would be inadequate

1186
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,080
to what we've just experienced

1187
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:08,840
to what extent do you think context is important especially in light of your comment that or

1188
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:15,720
I believe it was your comment that art you know the analysis in the 20th century shifted away from

1189
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:22,200
a formal you know aesthetics or understanding because many people who appreciate modern art

1190
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:29,880
appreciate it with an understanding of the need for context such that the Matisse exhibition

1191
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:35,480
you don't necessarily have to know his place in history or his place in or what it represents

1192
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:41,160
but the actual apprehension of it many people speak about it being joyful and and creating

1193
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:47,720
possibly a sublimity or a sense of of great happiness with music on the other hand to what

1194
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:56,680
extent can do you need a formal knowledge of it for example I I can't really access Schoenberg

1195
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:03,880
I don't have enough knowledge to to appreciate him and and would you call it aesthetic level

1196
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:08,360
it's not satisfying to me and I know it's from a lack of knowledge whereas

1197
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:15,160
Socrates is it's accessible to me for whatever reason it's not in that tone I don't think it's

1198
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:22,840
the same extent of of what would you call it complexity if you will if you could just address

1199
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:26,760
that well that's a different language the difference between Schoenberg and Stravinsky some people

1200
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:33,720
will still find the Stravinsky very difficult and in principle I don't I think great art you can't

1201
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:39,960
like everything and that what is great will hit you without you needing to know anything about

1202
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:46,680
the ingredients of the meal exactly the first part of what you were talking about interests me if you

1203
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:53,960
you talked at very early in the day about Marla's Ninth Symphony the shared experience the context

1204
01:51:53,960 --> 01:52:01,400
of the shared experience is a very interesting one to me if you go back home and look on YouTube

1205
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:07,640
you will find a performance of the Ninth Marla's Symphony by the Lucerne Festival Orchestra with

1206
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:16,440
Claudio Abado conducting and the performance is so extraordinary I would suggest leads the whole

1207
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:26,280
hall of 2000 people to about 15 minutes of total silence at the end where that shared experience

1208
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:33,400
and context has led to a sublime experience for all those people that you can also get

1209
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:42,440
from just watching and participating and for me that's one of the great sort of truths of what

1210
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:53,080
can do and the in context. I can just a quick point about something you said and and this lady will

1211
01:52:53,080 --> 01:53:00,200
correct us because she probably has her own views of it I would say that there is actually a fairly

1212
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:07,240
important difference between aesthetic appreciation and formal analysis I would not say that formal

1213
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:14,920
analysis went into Eclipse in thinking about the art of the 20th century whereas what did tend to

1214
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:23,720
go into Eclipse or underground as one might say was the willingness to say oh that's beautiful or

1215
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:29,320
that's sublime or it's ugly or it's grotesque or any of the other aesthetic categories that one

1216
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:35,400
might point to formal analysis on the other side on the other hand is something that I think has

1217
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:41,320
flourished in the in the 20th century so maybe a distinction is needed there but that's a little

1218
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:45,480
that's pathetic because we all understood what you were saying and it was very interesting.

1219
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:50,440
It was the last question why let you ask your question but make it briefly.

1220
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:58,600
I'm a little sorry that you conflated sublime with aesthetics and beauty because I think they're

1221
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:06,440
very very different issues and you can often appreciate aesthetics and beauty in in just about

1222
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:13,400
any field that you want to talk about and not have sublime experiences with any of them and I think

1223
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:18,920
this sublimity is something that you could it's almost like a pointillistic response

1224
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:28,040
and you can you mentioned Glenn Gould and you can conjure up probably from anyone here who

1225
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:34,760
knows him how to get a sublime experience out of looking into his eyes on film

1226
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:45,880
little variations or one one chord in Tristan or one chord in the second string quartet of Schoenberg

1227
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:52,600
or a sound of UC Bierling you know what what these things do and you could pick anything you could

1228
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:59,080
talk about birds or flowers or mountains and have these kind of experiences without

1229
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:08,600
they have anything to do with aesthetics you can you can have associative experiences even from

1230
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:21,000
ideas if you want to talk about someone's idea let's say of Schoenberg or Walter Benjamin and

1231
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:28,120
then you can conjure up a whole class of ideas associated with what they're talking about and

1232
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:38,840
have a sublime experience it's an abstraction it's it's a way of going into the universe of having an

1233
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:46,760
infinite opening you know looking at one color out of a Roscoe painting or one one

1234
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:56,840
gestural element in an abstract painting or Palestrina I mean or early blues or early jazz or anything

1235
01:55:56,840 --> 01:56:05,960
you know it this sounds you know naying it it has there's something obviously physiological there's a

1236
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:13,880
strong chemical component a physiological component but there's an associative component that as you

1237
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:19,560
say can go from culture to culture to culture you could share it with almost anyone who knows

1238
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:24,840
nothing about what we're talking about and they will know the meaning of sublime or the meaning of

1239
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:31,080
numinous you know which is a word that wasn't used there are so many other things that the flowing

1240
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:36,200
into eternity it's not a question but I just felt listening to so many of these things that

1241
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:43,800
that there is a broad category and someone said which I thought was fascinating that no that

1242
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:51,240
can you share the sublime if someone says something to someone else it's like like the old joke well

1243
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:56,440
it's not the joke that's funny it's the way you tell it you know it's the number the way you say

1244
01:56:56,440 --> 01:57:03,480
the number of that joke and it's the same thing if you talk about the the pointillism of an event

1245
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:11,640
that conjures a sublime experience so that opens it can you then share that with other people thank

1246
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:18,840
you thank you and we have one more we have one more question last question and briefly of course

1247
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:24,920
and this and this is a question and by its nature it will be brief but I'd appreciate to ask it

1248
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:30,200
around the panel because it's striking for me that's something that's central to the discourse of

1249
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:38,280
18th century Jewish mystics about the sublime as an opening into unumistica into the experience of

1250
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:47,480
of of oneness and the move across the divide between human self and and divinity is is is the

1251
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:53,080
emotional tone that goes along with that and that and that actually can be seen as the engine's way

1252
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:59,000
into that is humility and while you've touched on we've touched on sort of the other side which is

1253
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:08,440
almost a secularization of the of the of the of the of the translation into divinity in terms of freedom

1254
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:14,680
but while on this side of the divide the feeling that of sublimity that it goes along with with

1255
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:19,320
the feeling of the of the encounter with the experience of the sublime of humility has been

1256
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:25,800
missing entirely from this discourse and I'm I'm curious about that so I appreciate going around

1257
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:32,040
the panel and addressing that in some way oh hey really confines the expression of the sublime
