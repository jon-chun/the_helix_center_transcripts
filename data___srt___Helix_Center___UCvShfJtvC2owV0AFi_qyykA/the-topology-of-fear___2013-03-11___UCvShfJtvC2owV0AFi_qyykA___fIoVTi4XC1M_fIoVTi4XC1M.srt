00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
I'm Edward Narcissian, Director of the

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,400
Helix Center and I welcome you to

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,600
today's program on the topology of

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,120
fear. I should tell you that next

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,000
Saturday the program is on Elizabeth

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,960
Bishop and the participants are Bonnie

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,920
Costello, Lloyd Schwartz, Alice Quinn, and

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,440
Jean Valentine. Programs for April will

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,880
be on our website. On the website we

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,080
also now have a section for conversation

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
so if there are any thoughts and

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,840
questions that you have after today's

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,200
meeting or opinions that you have you

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,960
can go on that side on that

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,200
under conversation and write whatever

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,040
you are thinking. Today's round table

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,360
was proposed by Professor Gratiella

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,320
Chichilniski, she's Professor of Economics

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,600

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,640
right? And at the Cardozo, Cardozo Law

84
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,720
Review. So, Gratilla is going to get

85
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,920
things going. The topology of fear, which

86
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,240
is the title of this meeting today, this

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,480
roundtable, puts together two different

88
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,200
concepts. One from mathematics, pure

89
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,120
mathematics and that's topology and the

90
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,560
other one is fear and generally emotion.

91
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,280
And we have here specialists from both.

92
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,480
So, I wanted to introduce very briefly

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,320
the topic before we have the usual format

94
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,960
that these roundtables use. We're all

95
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,120
very curious about emotions and the

96
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,200
emotion of fear is very well understood

97
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,240
by anybody who looks at what happens on

98
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,160
an everyday basis and the press, what the

99
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,400
press chooses etc. And the article that

100
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,760
the topology of fear, which is here, is an

101
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,160
article I published a few years ago.

102
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:09,440
Essentially, looks for a mathematical

103
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,000
explanation of how fear fits and helps

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,040
define our decisions in a way that is

105
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,320
not the same as we are used to. And we are

106
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,840
talking, we are talking, we have here very

107
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,560
impressive specialists. In fact, the best

108
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,480
thing about this roundtable are the

109
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,920
people here. And so, I'm not going to be

110
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,720
talking too much about that because that's

111
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,840
their field, although I have done some

112
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,480
experimental work on this. But the

113
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,400
critical thing about topology is that it

114
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,600
helps you explain a form of rationality

115
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,120
that puts fear in a rational context in a

116
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,720
way that is different than what we are

117
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
used to in decisions, analysis, and in

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,240
psychology, and in economics, etc. etc.

119
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,960
in the social sciences. So how does that

120
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,080
work? The branch of mathematics, topology,

121
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,680
we were discussing just before with

122
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,480
Linda, who is a mathematician, as you can

123
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,520
tell you about that, is really about what

124
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,640
does it mean to be nearby? What does it

125
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,200
mean to be similar nearby? And they are

126
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,280
very different versions about what that

127
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,080
means. For example, you can say that the

128
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,480
weather in New York is similar to the

129
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,160
weather in Siberia. If, on average, we

130
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
have the same temperature. But if in

131
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,280
Siberia, or in a desert, the temperature

132
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,280
is extremely cold over parts of the year,

133
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,560
and then very hot over others, you would

134
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,000
say, no, it's not quite the same. So what

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,160
do you mean the weather is similar in New

136
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,320
York and in Siberia? What exactly do you

137
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,320
mean by that? There are two versions at

138
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,800
least two, but they are two actually. One

139
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,960
is, let's look at things on the average.

140
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,440
Let's look at the average of the weather

141
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,640
over this century, over this millennium,

142
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,360
that's one way, over the earth, that's

143
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,600
another way. The other way is look at

144
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,040
the extremals. What's the worst that can

145
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,720
happen? What's the highest and the lowest?

146
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,240
And we won't say that things are close

147
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,240
by unless the extremals are nearby. And if

148
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,400
we do that, we're looking at what nearby

149
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,880
means in a completely different way. We

150
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,520
define the completely different

151
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,920
apology, and all of a sudden what appear

152
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,600
to be rational behavior because of a

153
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,880
emotional reasons appears to be

154
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,480
mathematically very, very rational. So

155
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,080
just wanted to be more precise in the

156
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,200
paper, the topology of fear, Paul said

157
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,520
brief outline and he has to be very

158
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,800
brief. I looked at the disjoint that

159
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,680
appears when you try to explain in

160
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,800
experiments how people behave under

161
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,840
conditions of fear and they appear to

162
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,960
behave irrationally. An experiment upon

163
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,280
experiment and upon experiment shows

164
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:16,080
that. And where does it come from? So in

165
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,960
the paper I show that if you look at the

166
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,360
axioms which are the basic beliefs on

167
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
which the theory of decision is based,

168
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,400
and you assume that instead of making

169
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,040
decisions on the average and valuing the

170
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,960
average and caring about the average, you

171
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,440
look at the extreme ones. Mathematically

172
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,600
that difference is the topology of fear,

173
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,960
and in terms of decisions it leads you to

174
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
completely different decisions and

175
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,840
rationality for example. You would say

176
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,120
that if you wanted to invest in a fund

177
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,640
you may look at the average returns that

178
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,040
this fund brings to the investors. But

179
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,840
you may say that's okay that's all very

180
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,720
good but I'm afraid it will be a market

181
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,400
crash. Fear and therefore I'm going to

182
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,200
invest in the fund that assures me that

183
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,960
even if there is a market crash I will

184
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,400
have my money back or most of my money

185
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,360
back. Those are two criteria, completely

186
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,240
different criteria and depend on the

187
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,160
topology and I'm saying when you have

188
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,240
fear, when there is fear present, when

189
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,960
there is catastrophes, real events with

190
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,160
enormous consequences, you tend to use

191
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,880
the topology of fear to determine what's

192
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,000
close to each other and that leads you to

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,840
make decisions which are considered to

194
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,840
be irrational by the standard decision

195
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,440
theory. Namely, no I'm not going to invest

196
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,160
in the investment fund that gives me the

197
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,040
higher expected returns. Why? What's wrong

198
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,400
with you? Are you going to be rational? No,

199
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,160
I'm not. I'm afraid. I will give a lot of

200
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,800
weight to what happens in that fund in the

201
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,720
case of a market crash and I will not

202
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,480
optimize according to the what is the

203
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,720
expected return alone. I will not do that.

204
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,040
That's not irrational according to the

205
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,480
standard theory it turns to be rational

206
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,360
it cannot be explained. So by introducing

207
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,560
the topology of fear you can explain a

208
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,440
different form of rationality and then it

209
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,400
leads to the following criteria that is

210
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
okay I'm going to invest in the fund that

211
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,560
gives me the highest expected return

212
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,600
provided that the worst that can happen

213
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,320
in the case of a catastrophe I'm willing

214
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,120
to accept it. It's like maybe I will lose

215
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,120
5% of my portfolio but no more. Now this

216
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360
sounds like a reasonable thing to do, particularly

217
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
these days with a gun being what it is.

218
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,640
But it's contradictory to what we think

219
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,960
is a rational decision making and it

220
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,320
leads people in experiments to say

221
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,080
humans are irrational. You just don't make

222
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,280
decisions by what you expect that will

223
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,360
happen. The expectation part is really

224
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,680
averaging things. The consideration of the

225
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,000
catastrophe and the extremal is looking

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,800
at the worst that can happen and it is

227
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,800
using the topology of fear. This turns out

228
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,400
to be mathematically connected with the

229
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,120
theory of the incompleteness of

230
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,200
mathematics and with the resolution that

231
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,480
Bertrand Russell gave to some of the biggest

232
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,280
contradictions that appear system that has

233
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,640
the richness of mathematics. But we are

234
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,680
going into details I wanted to explain

235
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,360
that going way beyond the issue of the

236
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,800
fund, the dimension, that is nice because

237
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,040
it's an everyday phenomenon that we're

238
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,200
not afraid of. How do we make decisions

239
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,800
about jumping into an accident and trying

240
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,480
to pull a person out? We are governed by

241
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,480
fear. Well under those conditions we need

242
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,440
to expand our notion of what rational

243
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,000
means and what the topology of fear does

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,560
it gives you a mathematical tool, a

245
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,720
measurement tool, an experimental tool to

246
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,760
define rationality in a way that admits

247
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,200
certain ambiguities and allows you to

248
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,280
cope both with the extremals that you

249
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,720
behave with when you are involved in a

250
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,840
situation that has a catastrophe or can

251
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,040
cause fear and at the same time the

252
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,720
average behavior that you consider when

253
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,800
you are being you know naturally weighing

254
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,680
the probabilities of what can happen. They

255
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,960
do things emerge. So the result of that

256
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:02,320
paper is that when you consider fear and

257
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,480
when extremals do matter and you use a

258
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,360
topology of fear which is your value

259
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,960
system, the topology of your value system

260
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,560
is what matters, what's similar to what.

261
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,040
Then you will end up behaving like that.

262
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,160
You will choose the electric network for

263
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,880
our city so that it maximizes a throughput

264
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,720
of electricity but minimizing the worst

265
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,080
that can happen in the case of a blackout.

266
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,760
Does it sound reasonable? Yes. It is

267
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,120
inconsistent with the way we view

268
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,280
rationality until now through averages.

269
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,960
So what I just said is reasonable but

270
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,800
there were notions of rationality until

271
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,760
now have eliminated it as if it was

272
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
irrational. I can give more and more

273
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,560
examples. So instead of doing that I

274
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,800
wanted to say that that gives you a use

275
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,160
for mathematics that really opens up a

276
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,240
completely different sphere and we will

277
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,680
hear maybe more about that from Linda but

278
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,400
I was told before by David that the

279
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,280
French are not adverse to using topology

280
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,720
when they try to study the internal

281
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,720
psychological behavior and she's going

282
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,360
to explain that in their own in help

283
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,560
people make decisions. So I think with

284
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,400
your permission I will stop here because

285
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,080
I am more interested in what these people

286
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
have to say than what I have to say. I

287
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,240
hope it's an introduction. It's the beginning

288
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,320
and right maybe you can pay

289
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,080
any sense of vision for it. Yeah I have a

290
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,520
comment and so you try to take an

291
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,320
everyday word like rationality and turn

292
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
into more of a scientific mathematical

293
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,320
concept. Is that correct? No. I mean no

294
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,880
it is my... No I think it's a very good

295
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,200
point. I have to say that Joe's work is fantastic

296
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,560
so you know it's my pleasure to be

297
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,720
answering your question. No what they do

298
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,000
is something different. I look at the

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,720
definition of rationality that we use in

300
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,880
just about every scientific discipline I

301
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,880
know and it has to do generally speaking

302
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,840
with having some actions and the

303
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,600
driving from those actions to logical

304
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,840
statements that we are willing to accept

305
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,280
because we accept the actions. That's the

306
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,520
way mathematics is constructed. I just

307
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,720
described to you what mathematics is. I

308
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,880
also described to you what is decision

309
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,880
theory? What is probability theory? We

310
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,680
start with axioms and then anything that

311
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,560
we're willing to accept as rational is

312
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,480
what derives from the actions in a

313
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,720
logical system that we accept. That's the

314
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,400
way science proceeds. I didn't say it should

315
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,440
proceed. I said proceeds. So the

316
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,920
rationality that I speak about is not a

317
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,200
loose word that we use at breakfast. Maybe

318
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,320
it should be but that's not what I'm

319
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,800
talking about. I'm talking about scientific

320
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,400
rationality. I'm talking about the fact

321
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,680
that quantum probability, quantum theory

322
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,160
has axioms that were defined by von Neumann

323
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,080
in 1932. From those axioms

324
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,160
logical speaking you derive the entire

325
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,280
quantum theory and everything can be

326
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,080
drawn back in the logical steps, mathematical

327
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,480
steps to the axioms. That's rationality.

328
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,160
So what have I done here? How am I

329
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,160
redefining rationality? Am I changing the

330
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,440
logic? No. What am I doing? I'm changing

331
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,640
the axioms. Okay but it's a scientific

332
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,600
view of rationality. But you started

333
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,800
asking me if it was a loose way of

334
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,080
understanding the language. I was more

335
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,600
interested in the scientific part. So you

336
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,440
have a scientific view. Yes. But you on

337
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,200
the other side you took fear and used the

338
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,720
everyday version of it. So you didn't

339
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,400
have a scientific approach to fear. You

340
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,840
had an everyday version of fear. Well yes

341
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,600
and no in the sense that after I changed

342
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,680
the axioms and I said golly when you

343
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,200
have catastrophic events, real events at

344
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,600
that terrible you need to use the topology

345
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,000
of fear. Different axiom, different

346
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,400
results, different rationality. And he

347
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,720
says okay but with respect to fear you're

348
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
still woosy woosy. You're not giving me

349
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,920
the scientific version. Right. And he's

350
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,440
right. I don't know what fear is. What I

351
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,040
do know is that I have carried experiments

352
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,280
in which people are subject to

353
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,160
propositions that inspire extreme fear

354
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,400
to see whether they behave according to

355
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,240
the axioms and the logic from those

356
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,320
axioms using the topology of fear will

357
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,120
imply. And the answer is yes so far

358
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,840
because you can never prove anything with

359
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,960
experiments. You can only prove that you

360
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,120
don't know that you have made a mistake.

361
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,800
But if you don't define fear you can't

362
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,240
scientifically use it. No what I do is I

363
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,240
define the topology of fear as a topology

364
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,960
that takes into consideration as a value

365
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,440
focuses on extreme acts. The words that can

366
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,360
happen. And that topology then gives

367
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,360
rise through to a different axiom through

368
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,720
logics to different behavioral patterns. I

369
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,040
check them. I tested them experimentally

370
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,840
with a team in France but this is baby

371
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,160
stuff compared to yours. Well you know I

372
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,280
think the I have a problem with fear

373
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,720
myself. So. You're afraid? Of snakes yes

374
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,840
but that's not the problem. The problem

375
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,840
is I'm afraid of what we've been calling

376
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,240
fear for hundreds or maybe thousands of

377
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,840
years. And I've gotten really hung up on

378
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,720
the question of how everyday language

379
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,040
relates to the scientific language

380
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,440
especially in emotion and fear. Because I

381
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,200
think we've made a lot of mistakes. And

382
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,680
in my own work I've made mistakes as

383
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,000
well. So I've studied how rats detect and

384
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,040
respond to threats for 30 years and have

385
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,600
called the brain systems that we've

386
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,320
identified the fear system. And I think

387
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,600
that's a mistake. So I'm publicly

388
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,240
announcing my my errors here. I think you

389
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,840
should still buy his book. By the next

390
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,600
one. Explain this. Which book you can give

391
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,760
us a title? It's called anxious. Anxious.

392
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,440
But it's a it'll be a while yet. Still

393
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,480
working. So anyway so the by studying the

394
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,960
way the brain detects and respond to

395
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,400
danger. We've identified circuits that

396
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,640
are very important and ultimately in

397
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,240
fear. But they're not fear circuits. And

398
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,960
for many years when I've been introduced

399
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,520
to give lectures I've been introduced to

400
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,280
someone who's discovered X, Y, and Z about

401
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,800
how we feel fear. And nothing could be

402
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,880
further than the truth. So I'm trying to

403
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,000
backtrack a bit and look at what we mean

404
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,600
by fear. And I'd like to just describe

405
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,960
you know how you go about the science of

406
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,520
doing something like this. Take a couple

407
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,200
of minutes to do that. So in you know

408
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,520
for studying the psychology and its

409
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,440
relation to the brain psychology of fear

410
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,360
into relation to the brain. We have to

411
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,000
first define identified the everyday

412
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,480
experience that we're interested in.

413
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,320
That's basically what we do in psychology.

414
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,440
Paul is interested in reward. So that's

415
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,760
an everyday concept. And he turns that

416
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,600
into some kind of scientific approach.

417
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,280
So you first define what you're

418
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,080
interested in fear. And you say well fear

419
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,560
is an emotion. And it's different from

420
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,120
other things that we call mental states

421
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,080
like conditions or thoughts. And it's

422
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
different from other emotions like

423
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,480
sadness and anger and empathy and so

424
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,200
forth. It's closer to anxiety. Maybe

425
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,480
that's kind of a topological relationship

426
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,280
in some sense. And in fact I think mostly

427
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,720
what you were talking about is anxiety

428
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,360
rather than fear. But we'll get to that in

429
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,960
a minute. So you've identified the

430
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,560
you've defined the thing that you're

431
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,080
interested in. And then you figure out

432
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,800
some experimental way to study some

433
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,120
aspect of that. So I've done that by

434
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,640
studying the way the brain detects and

435
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,800
responds to danger. Now when you do the

436
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
the experiment your goal is not only to

437
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,240
study the little thing that you're

438
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,000
modeling but also the bigger thing that

439
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,400
you want to make you want to gain some

440
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
clarity on the bigger picture that you

441
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,680
started out with fear. And so these two

442
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,400
processes of defining and researching

443
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,000
often go hand-in-hand. So over the last

444
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,040
hundred and fifty years or so when that

445
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,840
fear has been studied in various ways

446
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,200
it's gone through a lot of transformations.

447
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,560
The first approach has been to start with

448
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,320
the everyday experience. Darwin talked

449
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,120
about fear as a state of mind that's

450
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,320
evolved. Freud talked about fear and as

451
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,200
a conscious experience it might be

452
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,480
turned into an unconscious or repressed

453
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,280
state. William James talked about it. And

454
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,480
then the behaviorist came along and said

455
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,880
well this all this talk about consciousness

456
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,800
is getting in the way of doing research.

457
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,760
So let's talk about fear as a

458
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,080
disposition to act in a certain way. And

459
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,640
then a little bit later that was

460
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,320
turned into something called an

461
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,120
intervening variable. So the behaviorist

462
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,960
talked about observable events like

463
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,360
stimuli and responses. A behaviorist

464
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,240
Carl Toman introduced the intervening

465
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,960
variable which is something that sits

466
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,760
between the stimulus and the response but

467
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,080
has no psychological or biological

468
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,880
reality. So fear in that sense was a

469
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,640
concept that relates an external event

470
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,480
with an observable response. It wasn't a

471
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,040
real thing. It wasn't a fear in the

472
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,120
sense of a psychological experience. It

473
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,480
was just in a variable that explains how

474
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,520
certain stimuli give rise to responses.

475
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,120
The next step was these got turned into

476
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,920
hypothetical constructs. So the

477
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,160
hypothetical construct of fear was a

478
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,920
one of the main idea was as a drive. So

479
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,120
it was a drive that when reduced

480
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,160
eliminated the the aversive state that

481
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,480
you're experiencing. And then this became

482
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,000
turned into a biological entity certain

483
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,200
kinds of states of the brain. Now the

484
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,360
original ideas that were coming along

485
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,040
when people talking about brain states

486
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,320
of fear were in something called the

487
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,160
conceptual nervous system because they

488
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,960
didn't know enough about the details of

489
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,520
the brain to talk about the real nervous

490
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,440
system. So again it was all

491
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,080
hypothetical. It wasn't a real thing. But

492
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,520
then finally research on brain circuits

493
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,440
came along and we were able to identify

494
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,640
circuits of fear. And now that those

495
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,120
circuits have come along to explain how

496
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,720
the brain detects and responds to danger

497
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,560
something else has happened. Those

498
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,480
circuits you know all of this effort has

499
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,240
been to not talk about the not talk

500
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,640
about fear as a psychological state as

501
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,160
we're studying animals and we wanted to

502
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,960
be able to understand how the stimulus

503
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,040
produces the response without having to

504
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,240
assume anything about the psychology of

505
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,600
what that animal might be experiencing.

506
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,960
But then once you have the circuit the

507
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
circuit starts to be psychologicalized

508
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,400
into a fear circuit. So that circuit is

509
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,320
also generating the feeling of fear which

510
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,960
people who are studying those circuits

511
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,920
never really say. So all of this is a

512
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,640
long way of saying we have a lot of

513
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,600
problems in starting with a psychological

514
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,320
concept like fear and getting back to

515
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,480
how the brain is working but then coming

516
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,280
back to understanding the psychological

517
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,120
concept. And I think there's a way to do

518
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,520
that. What we have to do is first

519
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,960
distinguish what is that psychological

520
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,280
concept from one of the underlying things.

521
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,160
And I'll just wrap up by saying that

522
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,120
every organism whether it's a bacterial

523
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,640
cell or a human has to be able to detect

524
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,920
and respond to danger. It doesn't need to

525
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
feel fear to do that. Even in a human

526
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,560
brain the brain can detect and respond to

527
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,160
danger without building the stimulus is

528
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,480
there and without having any experience

529
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,200
at all. So what the organism is doing

530
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,240
whether it's a bacteria or a human is

531
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,160
detecting and responding to a threat. And

532
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,920
somewhere in the course of evolution when

533
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,640
the brain acquires the capacity to be

534
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,120
consciously aware of its own activities

535
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,040
you have the feeling of fear that comes

536
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,360
along or the feeling of anxiety or love

537
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,240
or whatever else. So I think we have to

538
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,400
distinguish the feelings. I think that

539
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,800
the everyday language is the way we

540
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,200
should think about states like fear and

541
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,760
anxiety and love and so forth. And that

542
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,280
the scientific way of thinking about

543
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,600
these things has to explain where that

544
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,720
comes from but without assuming that

545
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,400
it's the same thing as the scientific

546
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,120
stuff that we're studying. I don't know if

547
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
that makes any sense at all but it's...

548
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:11,840
This is fascinating. One thing I wanted to say is that as we start a new geological period on planet Earth

549
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,240
the the anthroposphere in which humans are

550
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,560
dominating the planet the notion of fear or rather as he points out

551
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:28,480
the threats. He's saying just let's talk about threats okay we are not clear what

552
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,360
we mean by fear or do we need to have an emotion

553
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,840
but the response to threat is what we're talking about.

554
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,880
Well we do have fear we experience it but

555
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,920
that's not what the brain... the brain

556
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,840
circuits that detect threats do not exist in the brain to make you feel

557
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,880
afraid. They make you... they're in the brain to allow you to detect threats.

558
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,600
So let's back off and say instead of fear let's talk about the response to

559
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,120
threats and then I'm saying what he used a

560
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,200
keyword evolution. It turns out that the brain

561
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,400
is like an automobile that has pieces of all sorts of primitive material like

562
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,440
bicycles and monosycles and until it gets to a modern automobile

563
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,720
we have all these pieces and they're loosely connected with each other in

564
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,960
some way or another that we somehow understand but the point that he's

565
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,200
making is if we made it so far he's because somehow

566
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,920
we relate we we reacted to threats and what I'm saying is and we are in a

567
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:35,760
position now where emotions may be evolving as the threats are evolving

568
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:42,000
because in the anthropocene this new geological period that started in 1945

569
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,200
we are facing totally different threats so the response to threat which is what

570
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,680
he says is the only thing I can be clear about which is what the brain

571
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,320
is doing. It's now something that is evolving because the

572
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,280
threats are completely different. We used to be afraid of our survival

573
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,400
in nature as other animals where our predators

574
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,680
were it is nature who has to be afraid of us now

575
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,600
so we have other fears the fears of what we ourselves

576
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,480
may be going to do so this evolution of emotions

577
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,000
is you know I think leading a lot of people to think well

578
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,640
are emotions reasonable good should they orient our actions

579
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,920
or not and to the extent that the response to threat is an emotion and I

580
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,080
don't even know if it is an emotion. It's not I would say no. There it is.

581
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,240
Let's get the other people in the discussion. Paul what do you think?

582
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,680
I'm trying to jump in right there. Gretel I'm struggling a little bit with

583
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,200
understanding the relationship to topology

584
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,360
and I mean I heard what Joe said very clearly which is

585
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,800
maybe we aren't talking about fear maybe we're talking about the way

586
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,680
organisms respond to threats and I understand when I put on my hat as an

587
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,720
economist being both an economist and a neuroscientist

588
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,520
I'm very sympathetic to the classical economist definition of rationality

589
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,560
that people are consistent that they follow some set of rules

590
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,680
or maybe even an economist would say a human behavior is maximizing something

591
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,040
that we have goals that we perceive towards these are all alternative

592
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:29,200
ways to say the word rationality. So it seems to me the classic story is

593
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,000
if I'm afraid my behavior is discontinuous across this boundary where

594
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I become afraid and my behavior stops being rational and

595
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,440
goal-directed and progression and consistent and become something else

596
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,560
disordered dysfunctional and it seems to me that the

597
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,840
core of the argument here is that you found a way

598
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,360
to say well maybe that's not true maybe this is one thing and I was wondering

599
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,040
if you could elaborate for me a little bit more for all of us a little bit more

600
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,960
about topology and how it does that how it takes a

601
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,400
discontinuous disordered behavior and reveals it not to be discontinuous

602
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,080
disordered or unproductive.

603
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,600
I did not introduce Paul so I didn't know the introduction of anybody else so I

604
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,000
didn't tell you how great these people are but you probably understand

605
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,200
already how they are clarifying things and cutting things down to size.

606
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,440
Okay Paul yes the rationality is defined through maximums with logical

607
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,080
deductions. I'm saying if I change the actions

608
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,560
and I keep the rationality scheme which is using

609
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,880
a logical deduction I will get to explain actions

610
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,240
that were considered to be discontinuous and irrational before and you are

611
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,480
asking me explain how. Well I were given some intuition

612
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:03,040
for topologies role in that. Maybe I can say something.

613
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,880
What topology is all about is in some ways

614
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,200
defining what continuity is about because when you say something is

615
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,440
continuous you want to say that if I move if I don't move too far and I'm

616
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,760
measuring something that's happening out there it's not moving too far or

617
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,200
I'm looking at my results and if these results

618
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,880
are close together what people do what whether it's an economic

619
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,320
model whether it's biological model whether it's a physical model

620
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,320
I move a little bit that came from stimuli that were

621
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,840
close together and that is what continuity

622
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,080
really means and to say that it's discontinuous

623
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,720
says that well if I have nearby things here

624
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,960
the events that they create can be very far apart.

625
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,080
So you come down to the idea of what's nearby and so how do

626
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,720
so if you want to if you change the topology

627
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,440
about saying what are your nearby things you can turn

628
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,520
what seems in this model to be discontinuous

629
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:27,040
because those things that you start close they got far apart here when you're

630
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,440
measuring them this way but when you change the topology you

631
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,240
change what's nearby here they become closer together

632
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,320
so that and Graciela's example about weather for example

633
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,160
if you just say things are nearby if they have nearby

634
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,160
averages then you're going to have this big discontinuities

635
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,080
if you say okay when are things nearby they're nearby

636
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,200
if the average temperature over the year is nearby

637
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,120
and their extremes are also close together

638
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,080
things are different if they have very different extremes

639
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:10,560
well then you have a different model and what's continuous one one model can be

640
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,480
discontinuous in another model and so I think that

641
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,720
it's very this idea of saying topology and fear

642
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,440
you're taking different kinds of words that we're all used to using in different

643
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,040
contexts I mean this is part of what you were saying how do we use these

644
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,080
words and I think that if you want if you're trying to set up

645
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,840
some kind of model that you can work with you do have to

646
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,880
make these words have definite meetings in the context of what you're talking

647
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,720
about so fear when we talk about the topology of fear

648
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,560
we're talking about certain ways of measuring things if we change the ways

649
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,000
of measuring things then maybe different things are

650
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,480
closer together or not but it's very hard to take a very

651
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,920
amorphous concept of fear talking about it this way

652
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,560
and then here's your model and so you know you want to make the model it

653
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,600
kind of reflects the things that you really are interested in

654
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,360
I mean that's what people do when they try to set up mathematical models you

655
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,920
try to find the things that you're really interested in

656
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,920
and use those as the building blocks for your model

657
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,480
and build those into your axiom system so that

658
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,520
you get out things that you can predict from otherwise why do you want a model

659
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
so far does that be?

660
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,440
Helps on them let me bounce it back and you tell me

661
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,840
if I got enough to really grab on to that

662
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,200
I mean when I hear you say continuity the three of us are probably all

663
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,240
immediately thinking about the mathematical term continuity and it

664
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,600
may have slightly different meanings to different people in the room

665
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,720
but what I hear saying is if we look at a change in the environment and a

666
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,920
change in behavior we say oh look you know the environment's getting a

667
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,720
little bit riskier and people are getting changing

668
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,840
their behavior a little bit change it a little more they change it a little more

669
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,200
change it a little bit more suddenly you make a little change and

670
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,160
the behavior looks completely different so I think to me as an

671
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,760
economist and nurse scientist that's discontinuous right yeah oh sure and

672
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,720
so I had this problem which was that the thing I was manipulating the risk

673
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,240
looked continuous to me and the behavior looked discontinuous to me which left

674
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,160
me kind of like oh well that's not good and I'm hearing you say that the

675
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,880
critical idea here is well when you see discontinuous behavior

676
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,240
that doesn't line up with what you think is a continuous state of the outside

677
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,200
world maybe you're looking at the outside world wrong

678
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,400
maybe there there's a lens that makes the outside world

679
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,360
either look discontinuous or flip the other way makes the behavior look

680
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,880
continuous right yeah in fact to be very specific

681
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,360
you as I said by using different polo you are using different values

682
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:07,360
so something that you in example I gave before

683
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,200
your value is on average you want to be as well as you can when you invest

684
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,000
your money that's the way you value an investment

685
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,400
an investment approach but then all of a sudden

686
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,400
there is a small probability that this here there will be a market crash

687
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,760
under the average response which is what you were saying

688
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,120
and you were saying you will just you know

689
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,600
neglect the market crash you will deny a market crash

690
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,600
and you will dive into the market crash which is what happens to us

691
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,400
so you're not looking at the worst that can happen

692
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,400
that would not be your behavior if you're using the normal

693
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,920
the polishing under the polishing of fear it doesn't matter to you how small is

694
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,840
the probability of the event if it is bad enough you're going to

695
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,000
focus on it really hard and then through these results

696
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,240
I give a complete characterization that tells you how

697
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,760
the human behavior the russian human behavior in corporate instead two parts

698
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,960
incorporates I want to be on average as well as I can

699
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,560
so I like the temperature to be on average 70 degrees

700
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,320
but I'm going to also mind if there is a jump of 100 degrees from one day to the

701
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,440
next I can't deal with it so I'm going to look at those two

702
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,240
things and that leaves you to totally different

703
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,480
behavior and not to look at the average temperature

704
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,320
if you don't look at the average temperature you look irrational

705
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,760
according to that criteria and it goes you know

706
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:56,560
this can be made very very very precise mathematically as precise as you want

707
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,960
so in the case of a market crash we might have avoided the market crash

708
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,960
if the people in Wall Street instead of using the economics of averages

709
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,160
which is the standard of unemployment theory they would have used the economics

710
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,280
of reacting to a threat which is what I call the topology of fear

711
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,400
and that leads to a decision criterion or function

712
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,640
in which the words that can happen all of a sudden may pop up

713
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,680
whoa we can go into a crash whoa stop break change behavior is that

714
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,480
discontinuous well it would be if you're just doing

715
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,920
a damages but if you're looking at the words that can happen it

716
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,880
wouldn't be this continuous so the notion of rationality which is tied up with

717
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,960
continuity as Linda says depends on how you measure things what your

718
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,400
values are what you what you observe what you care for

719
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,480
does it make sense yeah David why don't you know

720
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,200
and then there's a great deal that's been said already that in terms of

721
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,920
psychoanalysis raises a number of interesting

722
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,760
questions but just this last point about continuity and discontinuity and about

723
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:21,440
flipping the topology of the response so as to find a continuity where it

724
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,800
appears that there's a discontinuity is a position that one experiences as a

725
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,880
psychoanalyst all the time that is one of the things that takes place

726
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,440
in listening very closely to the discourse of a patient

727
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,520
is linked is one hears or finds links

728
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,600
proximities continuities where it appears there are discontinuities

729
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:54,080
in the content that's being talked about there also for example things which

730
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,440
may seem highly unrelated on the face of them on the surface

731
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,960
through further discourse you begin to see how they are in fact linked

732
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,680
so you you find unexpected continuities unexpected proximities

733
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,040
right on the level of meaning for example

734
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,280
a person is to associate a little bit he will show you exactly

735
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,120
if you free associate he'll give you an example yeah

736
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:34,960
we're already using a couch but people are speaking about one topic

737
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,840
in what appears to be a clear rational

738
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,000
depiction of some story and suddenly they have a thought

739
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,320
and they say I don't know where this comes from it's got nothing to do with

740
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,920
what i'm talking about right but under the

741
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,440
structure of a psychoanalytic treatment which is that you say whatever comes

742
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,520
into your mind they say this thought that's random

743
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,560
that seems completely unconnected as they speak about it

744
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,040
and it happens this is a daily event this is not an unusual event in psychoanalytic

745
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,360
work at all as they speak about it of two or three

746
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,280
minutes into things of course i see why i thought about this

747
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,080
it happens to us all all the time we have an association which seems entirely

748
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,440
discontinuous and we discover the continuity

749
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,080
right i mean how do you know it's a real continuity

750
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:31,200
as opposed to one that's interpreted without any interpretation

751
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,920
now the question there of course is what do you mean by real

752
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,680
content i mean that is a question it's more about how this gets back to the

753
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,480
sides of the well the way it gets back and

754
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,080
uh is that it has to do with the the level of analysis

755
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,520
you know each of us work in a different framework of analysis

756
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,280
but uh what's of interest to the psychoanalysts is subjective

757
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,960
reality its subjective experience is not just

758
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,600
the description but the articulation of subjective experience putting it into

759
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,600
language conveying it to another person so

760
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,040
the continuity is real by virtue of the subjective experience

761
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,680
what its reality is in terms of other criteria is another question

762
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,800
so in my field we have something called memory

763
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,880
reconsolidation where you take a memory out as as you do in

764
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:33,760
psychoanalysis examine it and what we and others have found is that when

765
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,720
memories are are taken out in this way and made in

766
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,200
in a made active they go to a period of vulnerability where they can be

767
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,480
changed and then restored and the new reality becomes what's restored

768
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,640
rather than what the original reality was

769
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,440
and so a common example is someone witnesses a crime

770
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,120
and gives a report to the police on the day of the crime

771
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:05,120
and then they go to court to testify and rather than talk about the details

772
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,240
they gave the police they come up with details that were in a newspaper

773
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,880
article that they read in the meantime so reading that article reactivated the

774
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,120
memory caused new information to be stored and then that becomes the

775
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,080
reality that they carry forth as the next memory

776
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,920
so the you know the extreme version of this is your memory is only as good as

777
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,680
your last memory and that's that is an extreme version but

778
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,440
there's some truth okay i have to say something directly

779
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,920
related to that uh and to uh poll was saying mathematically

780
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,320
when you have when you have

781
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,920
the foundation of how we observe reality is probability and statistics

782
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,040
that's how we observe things we measure things and we take

783
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,560
statistics okay that's we look at statistics of what

784
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,880
you don't see one option you you look at statistics of it

785
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,440
now these same axioms of are using the extreme

786
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,960
at events lead to a different probability and statistics

787
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,320
which when you look at the stochastic processes that they generate

788
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,320
when you have a probability function and you pull out

789
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:24,400
uh you pull balls from an urn that has a different distribution

790
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:31,360
then you plot how many were red how many were black etc that gives you

791
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:36,880
a stochastic process that's what it's called and the prices of the stock in

792
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,120
wall street also are a stochastic process

793
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,160
the observations of particles in the universe are also a stochastic process

794
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:52,960
etc well if you take these axioms and you put

795
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:59,440
the topology of fear and derive the stochastic process that occur

796
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,600
they are not random walks and they are not smooth diffusion processes

797
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:10,640
they are diffusion processes with jumps that's a theorem

798
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:16,080
now what you are saying and what you are saying is you observe a person

799
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,600
talking about an event and all of a sudden they make a jump

800
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:26,320
which is discontinuous which you say unrelated

801
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,680
well there is a theorem coming from these axioms that says

802
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,520
that's the way it is they will be market charges

803
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,680
they will be discontinuities on the second analytic chair and they will

804
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,800
the discontinuities are the rule not the exception

805
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,600
but they are not really discontinuities when you take into account

806
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,640
the value system or the topology of fear that is underlying this form of

807
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,440
rationality they are what you expect to be

808
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,840
in fact you prove they are going to be jump diffusion processes

809
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,800
that's why the mass in the universe is not uniformly distributed that's why

810
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,480
you have stars so you have nothing for a while and then you have

811
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,000
you know jumps in mass that's why people in the couch

812
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,520
all of a sudden come up with something strange but could you predict what

813
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,560
the patient is going to come up with you can predict the

814
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,960
frequency in which they will occur you can predict

815
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,160
the form that this probability distribution takes

816
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,840
and then you can carry experiments about it and

817
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,880
that gives rise to a new form of probability and statistics

818
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,640
and it reproduces what what happens for example with earth quakes

819
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,520
I just want to add a dimension to that

820
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,520
and in so doing bring it back to the question of emotion and to the question

821
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:52,880
of fear and threat because that your argument I think is that fear

822
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,560
introduces a particular form of discontinuity

823
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:06,640
which can be accounted for by a topological structure which will

824
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,120
match the values of that new form of discontinuity

825
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:17,760
what I'd like to suggest that the discontinuities are only apparent

826
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:28,160
yet so it seems to me though that there

827
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,520
there is something about you know

828
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:40,640
you it's not clear that fear it I mean it works maybe in this context but

829
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,560
there are a lot of situations people are building now these huge

830
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,320
supercomputers and they've got thousands of computers that they put

831
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,560
together and they know as these things go they generate

832
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,520
heat you know they're going to generate heat so you know that this one is going

833
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,880
to fail and you have to program them in such a way

834
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,320
that when this one fails this one is taking over

835
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,240
and so that people when you're looking at the output it all looks very

836
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,120
continuous because you don't see that this one

837
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,280
stopped and that one started but in fact

838
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,440
there was this jump now this is and all of this

839
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,600
has nothing to do with the emotions this is because people have thought about

840
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:27,360
well how are you going to deal with situations where you know

841
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,160
something's going to get hot you don't know which one's going to get hot

842
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,640
you don't know when you have some sense of mean time to failure but

843
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,880
you try to build this in to the system and

844
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,840
but this is not an emotionally charged situation where you're dealing with

845
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,160
some kinds of discontinuities and so you try to create models where you think

846
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,000
this is going to work and in that sense you create

847
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,200
topologies which are measuring what's going on

848
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,120
and there is something similar to that in terms of you're saying

849
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,200
you have a topology you want to create a topology that takes

850
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,800
these what seem to be rationalities when we put it in the context of the market

851
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:16,000
as discontinuities and make them into a situation where you can

852
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,640
know what to expect so that you know you know how to react to them you know

853
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,760
that the market that you can make a situation where you're in good shape

854
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,800
so the so is using the word fear throwing in

855
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,800
an emotional charge into the discussion commensor

856
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,880
and you agree with him because he said well i just you know i just he's saying

857
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,720
it's not really fear it's like the there is a systematic way in which we

858
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,760
respond to threat and we better know how to do that because otherwise we

859
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,360
wouldn't be here and that's what it is and you may or

860
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:55,120
not feel fear right and so there is no role for the

861
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:00,160
emotion no the once once you've detected a threat

862
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,480
and it invades your consciousness then it's a whole new game then that's when

863
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:10,320
fear is there and begins to act back on the the whole system

864
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,920
and everything changes i i work in the first 15 milliseconds

865
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,680
of stimulus so that's what i'm trying to understand

866
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,520
but you know by the time that you have the awareness of something

867
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,080
obviously it's a whole new ball game so you will say the reaction to threat

868
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,560
in the first few milliseconds is what it is no fear no emotion it's just a

869
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,800
reaction to threat and then eventually the brain picks up

870
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,440
oops it realizes what's happening it's observing itself

871
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,920
and then it feels fear right there's another step though so

872
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,120
the the brain first detects first we react to danger so you're walking

873
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,560
along there's a snake on the ground you stop and then you realize there's a

874
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,520
snake right because your brain is detected it or you're walking down the

875
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,240
street you jump back and the bus goes flying by

876
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,200
so you're able to the bus the bus so our car whatever taxi so

877
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,440
your brain is able to identify these these stimuli that are potentially

878
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,880
dangerous uh and and allow you to react in hardwired pre-programmed ways

879
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,400
now once that's happened that changes the state of the brain so that you

880
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,840
become more sensitive to threatening stimuli

881
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,160
you you have goal-directed behaviors that begin to be called upon through

882
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,200
past learning and and so forth that allow you to then

883
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,760
perform instrumental or willful behaviors that help you cope with the situation

884
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,680
not necessarily consciously but then at the same time you're beginning to

885
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,840
become consciously aware of everything and then that will also impact as well

886
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,400
so we can think of like three levels here and then once

887
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,280
you're conscious of it then it's a whole nother ballgame where

888
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,040
you know you're consciously planning things and you may say that that's

889
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,720
a complete artifact as well there could be a topology going on that's making

890
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,680
predictions about what the next step is going to be in

891
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,640
consciousness is a total epiphenome i don't think that's true

892
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,720
but we certainly don't understand what consciousness is and how it works

893
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:13,600
one question are emotions good or bad they're both

894
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:19,120
so how do we know whether we should yield to our emotions or not

895
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,640
well first of all you can't i'm just asking a simple question

896
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,080
i mean you wait in terms of your reaction you can't stop that i mean first you're

897
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:30,240
gonna react and then you may you know you may short circuit it but it starts

898
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,880
uh and then that's what will determine whether you

899
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,960
continue to respond or not and you may not even be able to stop it

900
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,760
but if we develop emotions as part of this process of coping and observing

901
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,920
etc and rationalizing what happens when we react to threat

902
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,040
and now in the Anthropocene threats have changed

903
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,920
are there were emotions changing different threats different emotions

904
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,520
depends on what you mean by emotions i mean it's you know it's it's all about

905
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,080
defining what the terms are i think the you know i think David was in the middle

906
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,040
of something when we got off track so maybe we should go back to that

907
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,680
well it relates to your question and and it's to introduce another

908
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,520
uh term in the question of decision-making and that is the notion of desire

909
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,640
because it seems to me relevant that in making a decision the subject is not

910
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,680
simply engaging in a rational calculation of

911
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,160
advantage and disadvantage the subject also

912
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,680
experiences something about a fantasy a wish

913
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,040
an idea of what the consequence of success

914
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:50,160
will be um as part of subjective life one

915
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,000
continuity one proximity that is very striking

916
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,960
is that very close to the experience of desire

917
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,240
is the experience of threat

918
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:08,000
yes i'm using the topological i'm using the topological idea that is

919
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:16,480
that is whereas we might think that nothing could be more discontinuous or

920
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,720
further apologize to the experience of

921
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:26,160
the first thing that is that is

922
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:33,200
think that nothing could be more discontinuous or further apart

923
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:39,840
as for example someone speaks about a wish that they have

924
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,320
and they begin to articulate the nature of that wish a wish for some

925
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,320
outcome some behavior some activity to take place

926
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,640
as they articulate more and more about that wish including unexpected

927
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:57,200
elaborations about that wish what often takes place is an experience of some

928
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,920
kind of inhibition something stopping them

929
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,440
they stop i can't go on i can't really say more

930
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:09,200
about this to talk about what you want to talk about your desire freely

931
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,000
is a very difficult thing to do something takes place something

932
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,760
related to what i think joe is talking about as as a threat

933
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,360
responds to threat pre-conscious the desire is a response to threat

934
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:28,320
no no in talking about desire in articulating desire

935
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:35,200
we observe a response to threat in the form of of of some kind of an

936
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,920
inhibition some kind of a stopping some kind of a difficulty

937
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,680
right going at are you saying anything more than

938
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,320
if you want to put ten thousand dollars in

939
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:54,000
grass yellow spond and you think grass yellow is gonna give you

940
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,560
three thousand dollars more by the end of the year so you'll have 13 000 so your

941
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,320
desire is to change your ten thousand into 13 000

942
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,240
then you have the idea what if grass yellow doesn't succeed and i lose my

943
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,680
money is that what you mean by desire and threat

944
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,680
no because that that i mean that that's a very rational you know what you're

945
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,440
worried about there well now i'm talking about the more

946
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,160
and it's a garden variety i think we all experience it you think

947
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:28,720
i have a good chance of doubling my money in this investment

948
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,960
but there's something about that that bothers me there's something i

949
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,760
you know what i'm not i'm not sure i can actually

950
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:43,600
bring myself to act on that knowledge it's an inhibition

951
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,840
why do people get in their own way why do what i would suggest is this

952
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:52,240
happens constantly this happens in daily life

953
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,120
this isn't a rare event under extreme conditions so you're afraid of what you

954
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:05,280
want i think people are generally afraid of what they want

955
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,440
now in post-traumatic stress disorder

956
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,920
isn't it doesn't it come up in some cases where you associate something that you

957
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,960
want very much with something which is a tremendous

958
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:22,480
threat to you like what i mean what do you mean

959
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:28,560
well let's look at the case of domestic violence

960
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:38,560
so you are in love with his man and one day he tried to kill you

961
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:43,360
and then out of that you have this association you love this person that

962
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,480
is all these warmth and these wonderful feelings

963
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,040
but then all of a sudden you relay that with the worst possible experience

964
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,920
which is that your life may be at stake in a horrible way

965
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,680
so you're describing to describing the person's

966
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,240
subjective conscious experience but underneath that are going to be

967
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,600
approach and avoidance tendencies that have been conditioned by those

968
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,320
experiences so there may be some uh you know some very good times that

969
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:17,360
created positive relationships stimuli associated with that person that

970
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,640
are attractive and appealing but also the very negative things

971
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,200
they're going to be pulling you in the other direction

972
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,720
so these are these are the kinds of things they're going to be triggering

973
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,840
these implicit unconscious processes every time you encounter that person

974
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,720
uh and you know which one wins probably the

975
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,480
adversity is it is uh it's going to win in every situation

976
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:45,440
because but Joe the what you were saying seems to me would make sense

977
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:52,000
if uh the example wasn't grads yellow's example because grads yellow's example

978
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,760
is that your actual life is being threatened it's not that

979
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,080
you say you know he's a nice guy because he buys me nice presence

980
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,600
but whenever he comes home for dinner he starts yelling and screaming

981
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,240
that's uh when you were talking about an extreme example like

982
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:14,080
she's talking about how would you justify remaining with somebody who

983
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:18,080
actually is threatening your life and he's saying there would be natural

984
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:22,800
because what you most desire is also what you're most afraid of

985
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:27,520
not really saying that

986
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,160
i wouldn't put it that simply in in in the sense that it's in all cases

987
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,720
all i'm saying is that there is an unexpected proximity

988
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,640
in the sense that uh you were talking about it topologically there's an

989
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:48,640
unexpected proximity between threat and desire unexpected by what we might

990
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,960
think of as a an ordinary topology but the topology

991
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,920
that that a psychoanalyst comes to work with

992
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,040
is the expected proximity of threat and desire

993
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:06,000
i can give you a research example that i think helps to address this question

994
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,160
um one of my colleagues Regina Sullivan uh has studied

995
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:15,360
rat pups and at a very early age while the pups are still

996
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:20,400
nursing um pups what's pups maybe pups maybe rats

997
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,960
nursing with the mother um a stimulus that's associated with the mother

998
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,920
but uh is also connected to to a painful experience

999
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:34,240
in the pup uh the the the pup will treat that stimulus

1000
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,600
as a positive stimulus so it's as if you know the mother may be abusive

1001
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,520
but the pup is dependent on them on the mother so the connections formed are

1002
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:49,200
still in the positive approach uh vein but as soon as the the pup stops

1003
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:53,120
nursing um the those same stimuli now become

1004
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,880
aversive and the pup will avoid those under any circumstance

1005
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,440
now that okay that's fine but then in the adult you can bring back

1006
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:08,960
this infant uh attraction by stress so raising cortisol levels in

1007
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,640
the adult rat will bring back the infantile pattern

1008
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,040
of approaching the dangerous harmful stimulus

1009
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:21,040
so to the extent that PTSD is often something that

1010
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:26,880
uh a person doesn't just develop PTSD after one stress in life often it's

1011
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,480
something where one has been traumatized as a child

1012
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,000
and then that sensitizes the brain to to later stress

1013
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,320
you can imagine how the same kind of mechanism would kick in

1014
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,640
wow

1015
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:47,200
so essentially what he's saying is that masochism is cortisol

1016
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:53,520
well the the topology actually is uh

1017
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,440
it's actually doing a lot of work for us here because it's telling us

1018
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,520
again values in some cases what you really care for but also

1019
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,280
in reality what things are close to which i mean it's really

1020
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,920
it's uh i mean i there is no question that

1021
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:15,520
it really depends on the topology we use depends on the way we're wired

1022
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:21,040
but also our culture certain things in our culture are considered to be

1023
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,600
similar and that topology that proximity is

1024
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,240
completely

1025
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,920
hard wire i mean there's no particular reason for it

1026
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,120
uh i was going to give examples but i want to create anything to

1027
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:41,680
uh difficult to comprehend but what you're saying is very interesting for that

1028
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,240
i mean i think was agreeing with what you said about desire

1029
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:53,920
and uh well so what i was saying out of that was that

1030
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:01,280
we can put a topology on emotions that our

1031
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,600
measure two two emotions are close together if they

1032
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,600
both make you feel relatively good or if they both make you feel

1033
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,120
relatively bad and we sort of tend to think of

1034
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:18,400
um being happy is on the way to being ecstatic which is

1035
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:25,040
sort of closer than being in great fear or

1036
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,760
being terribly sad and i think what you're saying is that

1037
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,920
off if you change your idea of what the topology is

1038
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,880
and you say we put emotions together it would say that they're close if they

1039
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,040
occur at the same time or in close

1040
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,800
prux you know if you see within a given individual

1041
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,800
these emotions occurring simultaneously then maybe that's

1042
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:55,920
when you say these should be close so that's a different topology that you

1043
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,520
can put on emotions saying that these are these are close together

1044
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,400
because they occur often together as opposed to having

1045
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,280
that they're far apart because they have

1046
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,680
uh you know they seem far apart about what they make people feel

1047
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,600
from it

1048
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,760
Paul did you get the response to the question you have?

1049
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,240
I think so i mean i i understand a little bit more this notion of

1050
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,160
what you mean by topologically consistent and i mean i think

1051
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,360
the discussion here has really focused on how emotions are topologically

1052
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:35,280
consistent how they that might align with the topology of

1053
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,480
fear and the topology of efficient decision-making

1054
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:44,240
i'm not exactly sure how these two sets of ideas the one psychological

1055
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,720
about topology and the other economic basically about topology

1056
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,800
exactly align and i see joe chafing constantly at the border between those

1057
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:56,960
two ideas but what about reward prediction error

1058
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:02,240
which is something you study i mean that's a discontinuity

1059
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:06,800
i'm sorry i didn't hear you yeah did you know did i want to go there?

1060
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,680
i don't want to go there i don't know if that's true

1061
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,360
but if you have a something that's being predicted and that

1062
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,840
prediction is not coming true and that's triggering

1063
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:22,480
you know i mean i i view that as a very continuous process because i'm thinking

1064
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,800
well i'm expecting to find a full glass of water and i find only half

1065
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:31,040
a glass of water so i'm surprised negatively by half

1066
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,360
i mean these are you know little things that you learn from

1067
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,320
don't expect whatever but i know what she's talking about

1068
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:40,000
but i i don't i don't see those as discontinuous at all

1069
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,760
i mean those map and normal topologies those are just straight linear spaces

1070
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,800
i i mean i don't want to descend into mathematics here but

1071
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,800
i think this is something really different

1072
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:58,080
well i have a question about topology that maybe Linda can answer

1073
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:03,520
the model that some psychoanalysts use to map the space

1074
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,200
where these unexpected continuities occur is

1075
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:12,320
uh it can be talked about in a variety of one of them is the cross cap

1076
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,760
the project the real projective plane yeah

1077
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,520
the self-intersecting plane yeah right

1078
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:29,520
um just does that make sense to you as a topological model

1079
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,120
related to the questions that we're talking about

1080
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,440
here

1081
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:46,320
I guess for my my sense thinking about that kind of model is

1082
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:49,760
that

1083
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,760
what is special about it is

1084
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,640
that it's an example of something that is not orientable

1085
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,800
so the simplest example of that is the Mobius strip

1086
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,720
where you take a piece of paper like this and then you

1087
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,560
want to glue the ends together and you glue it like this and the thing is that

1088
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:21,360
you can keep going around it it has only one side right i think

1089
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,960
what you're saying more about this question of

1090
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,760
proximities that you don't expect to find is

1091
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:35,680
that you have a situation where you're looking at

1092
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:40,800
this global question of dealing with these emotions and trying to see how they

1093
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,560
fit together and they're sitting it's more like a surface that comes around

1094
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,560
and meets itself it's not the question of orientability

1095
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,760
that is what characterizes cross cap but the idea that you have something

1096
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,480
that what we call in mathematics is immersed

1097
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:00,640
rather than embedded that you have you have a surface that comes around and

1098
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,600
intersects itself it comes out and then it comes around it might

1099
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,560
intersect itself again in some other kind of

1100
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,960
special place so it's more this question of

1101
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,920
the fact that you have self-intersections and

1102
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,160
immersibility as opposed to embedibility in terms of the

1103
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,760
mathematical technical terms for yeah that is a great

1104
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:26,560
image of those modes of intersection called singularities yes

1105
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,080
it's a very evocative term for a psychoanalyst

1106
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:35,040
i mean you know if you the simplest kind of

1107
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:39,760
thing is you know if you take a curve that you grow on the plane that comes

1108
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:43,440
around and intersects itself in one point

1109
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:48,320
well you can write down equations for surfaces where

1110
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:51,600
the surface lives in a bigger space because there are more variables but

1111
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,760
then they intersect in a whole line or in bigger and even bigger

1112
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,480
pieces and sometimes it does it in a nice way and sometimes it does it in a

1113
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,080
very not very nice way and there are lots of theories to think about these

1114
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,040
various singularities and see how they come about

1115
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,840
but you think also is that sometimes the opposite

1116
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:18,000
speaks and that's what you were saying with this type of emotions i mean the

1117
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,120
extreme desire and extreme fear or feeling of threat

1118
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,000
meat but the only thing i would say that

1119
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,080
somewhat differs from your position is that i find that this is

1120
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,920
occurs all the time i don't think it's a rare

1121
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,920
event i think in decision-making all the time

1122
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,480
there are these singularities these conjunctions of opposites these

1123
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,880
unexpected i agree all right what i'm saying is that

1124
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,600
when you look at it from a conventional approach

1125
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:55,600
you like this and you dislike a threat okay they're separate and what you're

1126
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,800
saying is no don't expect them to be separate expect them to

1127
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,960
converge and in mathematics expect them to come together all the time

1128
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:07,120
and they do and i agree with that and that leads to a totally different types of

1129
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,800
type of mathematics and you can predict different things

1130
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,040
for example believe it or not you can predict some things that's happening

1131
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:19,360
quantum probability using this type of mathematics

1132
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:24,240
that you couldn't predict otherwise and and maybe that we should be using one of

1133
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:27,840
those because the quantum probability scheme

1134
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,640
that is also the biological connects with the issue of frameworks and i

1135
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,160
don't understand why since i call ushists or understand that we think in

1136
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,280
frameworks those two fields have not been

1137
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,440
closer together

1138
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,200
did i say something wrong i don't know

1139
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:55,280
yeah i think i'd like to just go back to the the basic question of

1140
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,920
a fear versus anxiety because i i think most of the stuff you talked about in

1141
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,400
your example would fall into the category of what scientists call

1142
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,600
anxiety more than fear

1143
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,520
so the typical scientific definition is fear is

1144
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,880
a state that occurs when there's an immediately present threat so like the

1145
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,720
snake on the ground whereas anxiety is one where you're

1146
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:23,360
anticipating a threat now by that definition though

1147
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:27,040
really almost everything that we call fear is anxiety because

1148
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,880
it's usually not you know the snake itself but the

1149
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,480
what what you're what's you know there's nothing about the snake that's

1150
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,200
inherently dangerous it's the you're worried that the snake is

1151
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:41,280
going to bite you so all of that is becomes anxiety

1152
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:45,600
um now one way to to look at these things is in terms of

1153
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,320
what's called predatory imminence um this is a theory that michael

1154
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:56,960
phanslow ucla is advanced and he has a scale of uh different degrees of

1155
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:02,400
temporal and spatial proximity that determine uh how a rat is going to

1156
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,840
respond to a particular threat or any other organism

1157
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,840
so if the stimulus if the threat is like immediately

1158
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,240
in front of you uh then you have you you will freeze

1159
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:20,240
if it's a little bit further away um you will freeze but sort of be

1160
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:24,240
engaging in uh what's called risk assessment kind of head bobbing and

1161
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,960
moving back and forth but when you're frozen you're just

1162
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,560
dead solid no movement at all but if the threat is further away you're kind of

1163
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:34,080
checking it out if the threat is very far away you might

1164
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,920
just run away because that's uh the best thing to do if if you have

1165
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,760
the opportunity to escape and if it's really far away and

1166
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,280
is not even visible then you know there's no response at all

1167
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,480
even though it may be potentially present so

1168
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:53,440
an animal that is um is hungry for example he's what hungry

1169
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:58,320
we'll have to overcome certain concerns every time he goes out of the the

1170
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,160
nest and into the world there's a chance there's a probability that he's

1171
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:06,480
going to be eaten but uh he knows what's going on in his

1172
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,640
local area so he's going to take that chance to go find something to eat

1173
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,240
uh so there's no threat present but he has to be vigilant just in case but he's

1174
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:17,840
going to still perform the behaviors he needs to unless the threat is actually

1175
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,320
detected at some distance and depending on how close it is the uh

1176
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,160
the way it will respond to be different so it seems that maybe that's just too

1177
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,520
simple mud in terms of topology but it seems that there's a

1178
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,960
topological relationship between what the animal is going to do

1179
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:38,160
and uh what it expects and so forth that is a very good example

1180
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:42,080
yeah okay i think we can go to questions yeah

1181
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,920
i think there is a couple of questions here

1182
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,360
they have to be questions they don't have to be statements and long comments

1183
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,640
great questions please

1184
01:14:54,640 --> 01:15:01,200
let me refer i did have a comment that was going to turn into a question so

1185
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:05,520
let me rephrase it uh i think uh joseph mentioned as

1186
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,640
Paul did later on but you were very explicit that one of the issues here

1187
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,400
is definition of terms so i went the question i have for

1188
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,640
Linda i think at first um in topological space especially

1189
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,240
mathematical top uh topology uh the notion of

1190
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:25,200
continuity versus a continuous versus discrete transformation

1191
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:29,520
is very very precise so i think the whole idea of discontinuity here

1192
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:35,600
was used in a context that strays from a strip topological

1193
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,840
uh interpretation so i wanted to ask you that uh and i'm quite

1194
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:46,080
understanding well in that um if one if if if you're talking about for

1195
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:50,880
example the uh transforming the topology uh based on certain axioms

1196
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,400
into a second topology based on different axioms

1197
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,280
if that's a continuous transformation that's one thing

1198
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,320
if there's separate type of topologies it's something else

1199
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:06,000
yeah so right so i think basically what she's defining is a separate

1200
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,280
okay it's not it's not that it's not that you're making a continuous

1201
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:16,800
transformation from one topology to another yeah yeah yeah no

1202
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,800
and then the since that's cleared up the question i have for you specifically

1203
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:25,680
would if you have looked into or think that looking into

1204
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:31,760
um abelian lee groups would have any traction in this context

1205
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,280
and i break i bring that up because of its relationship to quantum mechanics

1206
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:43,040
and that lee groups have been shown to um be very useful in probabilistic

1207
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:48,080
interpretations of quantum events yeah so i'm actually bresiella can probably

1208
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,840
answer that better than i can because she has worked with

1209
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,160
mathematics of those models so she would know better weather

1210
01:16:56,160 --> 01:17:01,760
you really how you how you use the abelian yeah but they would kick me out of

1211
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,080
here if i started talking about that but yes i mean

1212
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:12,320
if you everything they were saying is very very close to quantum

1213
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:18,080
probability by that among other things you have different frameworks in which

1214
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,280
you look at things now when you do have that and you

1215
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:26,400
transform one framework into another that is a group of transformations

1216
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,600
that gives rise to either abelian or non-abelian groups

1217
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,160
oh very good okay so then i'll talk to you later about

1218
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,760
the relationship of min max uh to that statement

1219
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,120
wow that i i don't know it's like linda said

1220
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:43,440
they are not connected i mean typically speaking what you do there is you

1221
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,360
transform if a basis of coordinates into another

1222
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,280
and you're not using min max no but in terms of the topological

1223
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:56,320
representation of the two different uh state spaces that's what i put not now

1224
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:02,880
thanks hi i'd like to ask if you could define

1225
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:10,400
embedded versus immersed and if there is a an analogy in both psychoanalysis and

1226
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:15,600
in the work show that you do this question only in new york city

1227
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:29,200
i was an amazing question okay so it's um if i have a surface that's embedded

1228
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:34,160
it will intersect itself if i have if i have a curve

1229
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,840
i mean it's easier to think about a curve that comes back

1230
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:42,800
and crosses itself if it crosses but i can think of it as a curve because it

1231
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:48,000
makes sense to follow it around right so when i follow it around like

1232
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,440
shoelace and i go to tie it that's where it crosses itself

1233
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,680
if it fuses together if it doesn't come together

1234
01:18:55,680 --> 01:19:01,600
if it's if if when i follow it around it never touches itself it's embedded

1235
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,080
very simple

1236
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:09,120
okay so your necklace isn't bad if it doesn't come together

1237
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,960
actually but yeah i can do it doesn't you're right

1238
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:25,280
but is there an analogy in the sense that when you start thinking about

1239
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,800
emotions that are close together in terms of say the way they make you feel

1240
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,920
or and you start going through moving through

1241
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,080
emotions that are close together and then these are

1242
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:45,920
would somehow feel very far apart but in terms of their occurrence within the

1243
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:51,280
space they come together again as in feeling good

1244
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:56,720
and then feeling fearful and so you've made this transition through these

1245
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,760
various different emotions and you come together and all of a sudden there you

1246
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,280
are in the same place yeah i'll i'll give you one other

1247
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,880
example uh it has to do with the notion of transference

1248
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:12,080
in psychoanalysis transference yeah the notion of transference

1249
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:16,720
it to put it very simply is that an event taking place

1250
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:20,160
can be simultaneously meaningful in two

1251
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:27,680
points of time two points of time i.e. a memory and an encounter in the present

1252
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:32,880
can be at that moment experienced as a simultaneous event

1253
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:38,640
so there is exactly the kind of so you've gone from when it happened before

1254
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:43,200
through some period of time and now you experience it again

1255
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:48,880
and so it is in the but it feels like so you're in the same point from the

1256
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:53,280
point of event but a different point in time yeah and that is

1257
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:57,280
transference in psychoanalysis you know defined topologically

1258
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:02,640
so from the neurobiological point of view that what you just described is

1259
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:08,720
the you know when we scientifically we think of

1260
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:13,120
being able to attend or be conscious of a particular thing in our mind

1261
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:17,440
means that that information is in what's called working memory

1262
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:22,400
so maybe you first had one state one of these states in working memory

1263
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,960
or the other but now they're both in working memory so they're simultaneous

1264
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,560
but in terms of you know so-called emotions whether you can have two

1265
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,240
emotions at one time in terms of the biological

1266
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:40,800
underpinnings of emotion is i don't think we we know the answer but

1267
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,200
you know if we think of for example

1268
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,480
what what these states do let's say you're in a state that's been triggered by

1269
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:57,280
the presence of a threat it begins to monopolize your brain because it

1270
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:02,640
takes over causes you know this is a survival situation

1271
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:06,640
so your brain is now in a state where everything has to be dedicated

1272
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:11,440
to survive the moment so that's why it's monopolizing so it would be hard for

1273
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:15,600
another state to take over at that point unless it had some

1274
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20,000
greater priority so let's flip things around let's say you're really hungry

1275
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:25,520
so the the nutrition energy balance system has taken over your brain

1276
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:32,640
but um you know that there's a predator right out there where you've got to go

1277
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,280
get your food so you're not going to go out you're

1278
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,480
going to stay hungry for a while on the other hand

1279
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:43,840
let's say you know the predator's there and you're still hungry and you're

1280
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,440
really hungry you're on the point of starvation now so you have to risk

1281
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:52,320
encountering the predator to get some food so these are uh

1282
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,840
can be thought of as different points of monopolization that where the

1283
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,680
states are almost uh discontinuous and switching back and forth

1284
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:04,000
as needed on the momentary state

1285
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,840
okay

1286
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:12,720
frustrated by this idea of this this model this

1287
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:17,680
topology which is is trying to be imposed on

1288
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:23,200
something and it doesn't fit and well it seems to me that i've been

1289
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:29,760
i was a computer programmer most of my life and i understand programs that

1290
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:36,080
i understand programs that uh you know possibly predict to like which

1291
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,440
where you're going to put your money you know if you're

1292
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:44,800
a vase of uh you want to avoid too much risk and something like that you could

1293
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,880
put it but it can't be just it isn't something simple

1294
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,840
it's something very very complex you would have a case's well case

1295
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:58,000
from from this age to this age or this you would have right a

1296
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,040
very complicated program and and the complicated program

1297
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:09,680
would have to follow the analysis and the input from the people who uh

1298
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:14,640
were actually dealing with something real it's sort of like uh

1299
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:22,480
uh science following observation and then uh people coming up with

1300
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:26,320
uh this happens this time and this time and this time and then the theories

1301
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:31,280
are evolve and uh when the after the theories evolve

1302
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:35,840
something comes up that this that doesn't quite fit in so it's slightly

1303
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,400
modified you modified the program slightly to fit it in and to me that's

1304
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,800
what science is about it is i i find it very frustrating to think of

1305
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:50,240
a topology uh that uh that's very vague and i don't know

1306
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:54,400
what any practical use for it and and i don't see how it's going to

1307
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:58,000
work you if you have a programmer programming

1308
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,360
these decision tables interviewing every

1309
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:07,920
uh analysis and you can i could set up a i believe i could set up

1310
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:12,880
certain questions that therefore a individual patient and every person

1311
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,640
would be different and they would have these different things that they would

1312
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:21,680
be afraid of and when they wouldn't then you they would become very predictable

1313
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:26,080
if you fit it into a program and then you could would test it to see if

1314
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:30,000
if it would work and when it didn't work you would have to modify it

1315
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,760
and but i don't understand i a an abstract philosophical

1316
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:43,600
uh topology imposed somewhere or or where it isn't either

1317
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:51,840
influenced by the underlying analysis and or experiments that would say

1318
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:56,800
prove that this analysis of theory was wrong you have to start with the

1319
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,520
observation observation of the rats or

1320
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:07,760
observations of or much more complex observations of human beings by

1321
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:14,320
analysts uh getting uh getting all this data and then you

1322
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:19,600
come up with after the fact with a formula that would work i can't see

1323
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,560
coming out starting with a formula and then

1324
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:27,120
important from the outside first of all is a fascinating comment

1325
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:33,200
fascinating from your experience to tell us that um but

1326
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:39,120
let's look at the rat okay so the question is

1327
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:43,040
you want to predict what's going to happen to the rat or he wants to predict

1328
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:46,560
what's going to happen to the rat when he grows up

1329
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:51,200
so he's not pursuing that i think what he's doing well you want to predict

1330
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:54,160
no what your what what you can keep with the program

1331
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:57,440
all the same rats when they were growing up

1332
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,120
observe many of them see what happened to the ones who

1333
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:05,520
be who had this experience and the ones that didn't have that experience

1334
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,440
and then you then you do that after the fact what's your name

1335
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:14,160
ready ready what the polish is doing is telling you

1336
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:18,480
what to look at what to look at yeah what's important

1337
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:22,640
okay and if you tell me that is a large philosophical theory that doesn't

1338
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:28,240
matter that's not what the polish is telling you

1339
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,760
what what matters is is the average behavior of the mother

1340
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:36,640
or whether the mother at some point took a deep dive and did something

1341
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:40,880
that have caused a big impact on the young brain

1342
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,200
what matters more what you do on every day basis with a child

1343
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:50,400
or what you do what you did once and that's extremely

1344
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:55,040
so the same thing is through about a computer

1345
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:59,680
programming yes you want to say you want to feed data

1346
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,680
and then you want to see if the data is within this neighborhood i know this

1347
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:07,840
is going to be the result but suppose that you say no what matters is

1348
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:12,480
what's the minimum of all the numbers you feed and that's going to determine

1349
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,120
whether it's going to go this way or it's going to flip

1350
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:19,760
and your computer program so the question is what is important

1351
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:23,360
are you testing for the correct thing is that yes

1352
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,080
and therefore that is very crucial it's not

1353
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,120
oh philosophical and that's what we're talking about

1354
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,880
by topology by the way i take the opportunity to say that

1355
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:37,600
i brought 15 copies of the article the topology of fear

1356
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,840
if you want to read them they would be left i did not read it before so i'm sorry

1357
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,920
no of course not but i mean they're sitting there

1358
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,600
so in some sense it's really very fundamental because that's what science

1359
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,520
is looking for patterns but i think like a psychology

1360
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:55,680
it seems to me that psychologists are doing that they are coming up with

1361
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:58,880
tests they're coming up with tests that it seems to me that

1362
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,800
that's very anyway i don't i'm not going on

1363
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:05,600
yeah thank you very thank you and i will read your

1364
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,720
article thank you

1365
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:16,240
why has anybody mentioned uncertainty which seems to me

1366
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:22,160
uh the fundamental condition of human condition and

1367
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:26,080
which to link what the psychoanalysts said

1368
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:30,880
with what you were saying you've got your financial decision that

1369
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:37,120
needs to be made and at the same time somebody has

1370
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:41,440
a desire in both cases what's really an issue

1371
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:46,880
is the uncertainty of the outcome that comes with our normal day in and day

1372
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:52,480
out living and decision making we have to make

1373
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:58,880
so that what what we're talking about and it really is the response to threat

1374
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:03,200
as well because what is the threat we're responding to

1375
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:08,560
we're responding to the threat of uncertainty because that's the way life

1376
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,400
is we don't know what's happening from one

1377
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:17,440
one second to the other psychoanalytically if somebody has a strong

1378
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:22,000
desire it seems to me it's fairly natural to

1379
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,480
also have fear associated with it because it's uncertain we don't know that

1380
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:32,400
will come out it's not a matter of the

1381
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:39,200
specific desire that we fear it's another aspect of it

1382
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:45,680
that we know the uncertainty that we may encounter in reaching

1383
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:49,760
in having that desire satisfied but again what

1384
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:54,480
by basic point is what was missing in this whole discussion

1385
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:59,040
was nobody talking about uncertainty and the fact that

1386
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:02,160
in each and every case what you're really looking at

1387
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:10,880
is we're here now and we're either perceiving threat perceiving concern

1388
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:15,520
that's the future and that's where the uncertainty comes in

1389
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,280
and let people answer it but we're going to have a round table on uncertainty

1390
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:23,280
later in the year okay everything we said was about

1391
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:27,440
uncertainty everything from the from the word go

1392
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,000
when we started saying well you don't know what's going to happen with the

1393
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,800
market conditions are you going to invest to get

1394
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,160
the best possible expected return that's uncertainty

1395
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:39,360
are you going to be afraid or and focus on the market crash

1396
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:43,600
another form of uncertainty the question is how do you define uncertainty and

1397
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,640
what do you focus on are you focused on on the average

1398
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:50,480
uncertainty of the weather or are you focused on the maximum and the

1399
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,440
minimum well you see but but this is where i get

1400
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:57,600
my question regarding the the mathematical explanation

1401
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:02,560
in the uh the topography and again a couple of times you alluded to

1402
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,320
quantum mechanics okay and we know that quantum mechanics

1403
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:10,560
the uncertainty principle and the idea of what you're trying to do

1404
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:15,280
is predict probabilities mathematically but when we're talking about

1405
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:20,000
i think the topic of human uncertainty we're talking again to go back to the

1406
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,240
subjective the the individual trying to make their

1407
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:28,240
own decision and all i can say at that point

1408
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:32,320
i mean it is so much more complicated i think

1409
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:36,160
than what we've said but you still got a look at it from the standpoint of the

1410
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:41,760
individual and again each one of us has to face our future and we do it

1411
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,880
every minute of our lives it's too bad Paul is not here

1412
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,720
because that's exactly what he works on the way the brain is a Bayesian

1413
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:52,960
statistical probability generator and how our decisions are based on these

1414
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,760
probability estimates and incidentally what i wanted to talk with him but

1415
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,840
is the Bayesian decisions or the Bayesian updating

1416
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:07,360
which is that you have the belief and then you get a new piece of information

1417
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:11,920
and you update your belief that's what Bayesian uh theory does

1418
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:17,360
well how do you update your belief mathematically you updated so that they

1419
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:21,600
know updated distribution that you adopt

1420
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,760
uh minimize the errors given what you now know

1421
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,840
and the minimization of error depends on

1422
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:34,400
the topology do you want to minimize error on the average

1423
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:39,360
or do you want to minimize the extremal errors it makes a completely

1424
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,560
come a drastic difference to your Bayesian

1425
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:46,960
optimization whether you want to minimize the worst possible error

1426
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:52,800
or the average error so therefore you even then the the issue of the

1427
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,360
the polish that you use makes a big difference and

1428
01:33:55,360 --> 01:34:00,240
your issues about the animals making decisions like that the frozen animal

1429
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:04,640
making a decision are getting more information as you just said that's

1430
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:07,280
making a Bayesian decision it starts sitting there

1431
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:11,440
frozen and scoping up what is that Bayesian updating

1432
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:14,640
right well is it scoping up for the average

1433
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:18,400
of what the predator is going to be or for the worst possible thing that's

1434
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,800
going to happen and is he going to react differently

1435
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,440
and the answer is very differently and that's what the

1436
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:28,000
topology of fear price of capture sorry so

1437
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,320
let me give you a simple example take physics you drop a ball from a

1438
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:37,760
tall building and you can predict by an equation how long it will take to

1439
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,080
hit the ground however if at the same time you happen to have an earthquake

1440
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,440
which is a rare event you get a different outcome the point of this is

1441
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:49,040
trying to explain a bit more because i think people are not used to that

1442
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,720
it's a very important example so so the point i'm trying to make it

1443
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:56,080
really really are two complex systems involved here

1444
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:00,640
there's the reality and then there's the brain and they both have this

1445
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:05,040
phenomenon that they are capable of all the butterfly effect

1446
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:11,200
of having a discontinuity that is a very small new piece of Bayesian input

1447
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:15,600
will cause a drastic change in your updating of your information

1448
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,640
so the question i have in the studies in the trying of

1449
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:22,160
the notable effort and noble effort everybody's trying to do to try to put

1450
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:26,880
this on a scientific basis there's some of the fundamental limitations

1451
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:31,360
that come with it being a complex system and even more

1452
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:34,160
fundamental when you have two interacting complex systems

1453
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,880
that is the brain and the reality it's trying to deal with

1454
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,960
so my question to the panel is how does one

1455
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,400
simultaneously recognize that there's no fixed point here

1456
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:49,680
that both the decision making apparatus that is perceiving the reality

1457
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:54,240
has this capacity for a butterfly effect that is to have a discontinuity

1458
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:59,440
and suddenly change its reaction instantaneously for very

1459
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:02,160
incrementally small new piece of information

1460
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:05,440
and the reality itself that it's trying to make a decision about

1461
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:09,600
has that same basic property how does one

1462
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:14,160
fix it how does one know how when this entangle where that extra little

1463
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:18,320
input came from it was in your case because the person had an experience

1464
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:22,640
in real life that was a butterfly effect it traumatized them

1465
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:25,440
and it therefore made a fundamental change in how they're going to

1466
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:29,760
subsequently react or was it something that the reality was

1467
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,800
essentially continuous but something else that as you talk about in the

1468
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:37,600
background suddenly made a fairly normal thing

1469
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,000
cause a discontinuity in their brain how does one

1470
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,160
disentangle those two things you go on there coupled

1471
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:47,600
you know your question is related to the one before and i think it's about the

1472
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:52,320
limits of knowledge and factoring the limits of knowledge

1473
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:58,240
into your expectations and your schemas of analysis your theory of

1474
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:03,520
rationality even to have built into it

1475
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:09,600
that idea of you know an uncertainty factor an accidental factor

1476
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,360
unpredictable factor it's a change in the position of

1477
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:17,760
knowing right so there's one other comment in this it seems to me that

1478
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,400
the thing that i always think about in this context

1479
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,920
is that and i think that's what uh

1480
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:28,480
residuals theory i think is useful in is that

1481
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:32,960
if we walk around with an expectation of a continuous reality

1482
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:37,760
with a machine that is inherently discontinuous in the way it functions

1483
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:43,520
that will lead to some very incorrect analysis of what is going on how the

1484
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:47,440
system is reacting and the way to compensate for that at

1485
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:50,080
some level is what i call what is called commonly

1486
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:56,080
metacognition that is to acknowledge in a feedback loop to yourself

1487
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,880
that you are dealing with a series of discontinuities

1488
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,240
and have some mechanism both scientifically and personally

1489
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:07,120
in order to process and make your decisions that ask yourself that question

1490
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:12,240
or is this new piece of information that is causing this discontinuity

1491
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:17,440
something that i should be analyze and make a fundamental change or not

1492
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,960
and therefore be able to somehow compensate for the fact that you know you

1493
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:25,040
have two interacting circumstances that can expose you to these very rare

1494
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:28,240
moments that could cause a very significant change in your reality

1495
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:32,800
that's not particularly warranted but there are animals that have been

1496
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:37,120
around since the uh you know earliest times of life on earth

1497
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:40,160
that are so primitive they can't possibly have metacognition yet they've

1498
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:43,440
adapted to these discontinuities pretty well

1499
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:47,600
i don't think they have 99.9 percent of the species

1500
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,200
bacteria for example

1501
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:53,600
yeah because they do something and so they're the lifetime

1502
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,760
so they've adapted to that okay that's not a that's not a mechanism

1503
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:03,360
available to us and you are 90 bacterial DNA so don't stand there

1504
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:10,080
talk against them okay next question um so i'm a

1505
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,960
trauma psychiatrist that's how i make my living and i did read this paper

1506
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,520
years ago and have thought about it for many years because i know graciolan

1507
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:18,400
have taught this paper and i i sort of the comment i sort of do want to make a

1508
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,520
comment follow-up question the comment is i think that this is a ground

1509
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,720
breaking paper and the reason i think this is a ground breaking paper

1510
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:28,240
is because it's very in some ways it has a very similar place in the history of

1511
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:31,120
this kind of science to the famous paper by

1512
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:35,760
by backer about rational addiction and what the paper by backer with rational

1513
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:40,720
addiction did was to move the boundary of what is rational to show that i could

1514
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:45,520
use purely axiomatic rational modeling to explain addiction

1515
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,880
which broadened the concept of what rationality was

1516
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,880
and shrunk the concept of what irrationally and emotionally driven things

1517
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,080
one that he showed that you could actually mathematically and rationally

1518
01:39:56,080 --> 01:40:00,560
predict even something as unusual as it as addiction and i think graciolas

1519
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:05,040
paper takes that even a step further and expands our notion of what is

1520
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,320
rationality and what we mean by rationality is something to do with

1521
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,800
consistency something to do with compute to

1522
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,160
computability something to do with predictability

1523
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,520
and those notions of rationality so i think it expands the very concept of

1524
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:21,760
what we think is rational and what we have to think is and and therefore

1525
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:25,440
there are it's actually less that we have to explain by this vague notion of

1526
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:28,720
emotional and irrational and i think it really think it does

1527
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:32,080
an amazing job of that but i think if you want to explain that paper you have to

1528
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:35,040
sit down with a friend of yours who's a mathematician to read this paper trust

1529
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:38,640
mail that way thank you

1530
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:42,080
hi um i've got a quick question about how i raise this up

1531
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:47,040
about the proximity of fear and desire so it's been suggested that because

1532
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,400
these emotions oftentimes occur together that there might be some

1533
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:54,480
tight-knit relationship between them so they should be close in our topological

1534
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:58,080
map of these emotions but your that's what it is

1535
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:02,720
your example um of the rat who's hungry for something that's in the same

1536
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:06,880
area as a threat makes me think that the closeness

1537
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,480
the the frequent reoccurrence of these emotions in tandem

1538
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:14,640
might say more about the events than the actual proximity of those emotions

1539
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:18,640
every event has multiple components some of which are good and some of which

1540
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:22,640
are bad and it has multiple potential components some of which are good and

1541
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:25,680
some of which are bad so you have different reward circuitry and

1542
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:29,760
different fear circuitry and they might be activated at the same time

1543
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,560
for the same event simply because there are different components to these

1544
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,640
events if my fiance invites me to go to dinner with her parents i'm

1545
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,640
afraid to act like an idiot and i'm also excited

1546
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:44,400
so i just don't think that should inform our topology

1547
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,360
of these emotions it might be the case that different events

1548
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:50,480
can excite both of these emotions and i was wondering

1549
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:56,640
you agree disagree well in order to answer that uh we would have to get into

1550
01:41:56,640 --> 01:42:00,640
the notion of desire and what i mean by that or what is meant by that in psycho

1551
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:05,200
analysis that there is a logical connection

1552
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:11,440
between fear and desire not a contingent connection so what is it

1553
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:14,720
uh it has to this will take a lot longer than

1554
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:18,720
than we can get into but it has to do with

1555
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:25,280
um the uh how can i do it quickly it has to do with

1556
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:34,880
the experience of satisfaction of a wish and the complex symbolic

1557
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:40,320
meanings of that satisfaction there are fantasies

1558
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:46,720
that accompany the satisfaction of a wish and those fantasies involve

1559
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:52,640
ideas that are forbidden why as i said it's going to take a

1560
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:56,640
long time to answer this question what what it touches on is the

1561
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:59,920
i just it is it's it's the notion of repression

1562
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:03,440
in a psychoanalytic sense the psychoanalytic notion of repression

1563
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:08,800
that something occurs that makes desire

1564
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:16,880
linked in some way to the forbidden and it's the linking to the forbidden

1565
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:20,880
that constitutes the threat i guess i i guess constitutes the source of the

1566
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,480
threat so it's not contingent joe's example was about a contingent

1567
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:28,400
connection which can also exist but also i mean

1568
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:33,360
anything that you desire is potentially threatening for its loss

1569
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:36,480
so i mean threat comes with almost everything in life

1570
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:39,840
you know and that's the the most fundamental thing of staying alive is

1571
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:46,240
warding off the threats and the opportunity to acquire something useful

1572
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:50,640
uh will usually cost you something there will be some threats involved

1573
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:54,480
that you have to overcome to get it but also then you have to face the

1574
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:58,320
uh the threats that come from maintaining hanging on to it

1575
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:02,240
but it's love or anything else i i would agree that it's about the

1576
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:06,560
the centrality of loss i'm wondering but what is there oh i'm sorry

1577
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,800
just to just to comment on your example of the fiancé

1578
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,240
there it's not a given that you should be afraid because you're going to meet

1579
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:26,320
your fiancé's parents it is then you need to see him

1580
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:30,720
i guess i'm wondering if you could consider even the psychoanalytic

1581
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:35,680
desire for mastery just to simplify the discussion might you consider that

1582
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:39,440
a component of that same stimulus the event that you fear

1583
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:42,880
and the desire for mastery of that fear couldn't that be considered

1584
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:48,480
a component and then you can avoid the difficulty of letting that influence

1585
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:52,320
your topological map that way

1586
01:44:57,120 --> 01:45:03,680
um so i guess what your question is is could there be

1587
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:09,120
a more sort of Euclidean or linear explanation

1588
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:16,080
of how it is that threat and desire link up i i guess ultimately i'm thinking

1589
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:20,080
it would be a mistake to conflate the events that trigger certain desires

1590
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:24,640
and those desires or emotions generally in themselves so ultimately we're just

1591
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:28,240
dealing with different systems and i guess i i kind of agreed with your

1592
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:32,080
point uh what what is the top topological map telling us i

1593
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:35,120
understand its utility and driving research questions

1594
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:37,600
but does it really tell us anything about

1595
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:40,880
the act does it have any predictive value yes

1596
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:46,080
and that's my point that's the point if you didn't forget it

1597
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:50,960
who cares thank you okay thank you question thank you

1598
01:45:50,960 --> 01:46:10,160
so we will end here
