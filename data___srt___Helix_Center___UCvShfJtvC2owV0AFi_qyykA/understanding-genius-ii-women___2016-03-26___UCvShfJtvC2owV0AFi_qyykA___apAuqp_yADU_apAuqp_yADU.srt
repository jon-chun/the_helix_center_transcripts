1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
I'm Edner Sesien, welcome to this program on Genius. This is the second one we are doing,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:17,360
the first one. Essentially only discussed male geniuses, and Anne-Marie approached me afterwards

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:25,040
and says, what about all the women? So then we decided we will have a second one. So Anne-Marie

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,400
Levine, who is a member of our advisory board, who is a poet and a visual artist, has organized

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:39,300
this meeting and she will run it. Our next meeting, we may have a meeting in April, but

6
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,880
I'm not sure yet, but our next scheduled meeting is on May 7th and it will be on fear

7
00:00:45,880 --> 00:01:04,360
and anxiety. Thank you. That's a very unshirful note on which to start. Although truthful.

8
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,280
So welcome to this round table. I'm Anne-Marie. I don't know if I was just introduced or not,

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,080
but anyway, I'm going to introduce the participants, but I want to tell you a little bit as Ed

10
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,000
did about the origins of this particular round table. I don't usually do this, but the program

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,520
was inspired by a previous helix program called Understanding Genius. And as it happened,

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,320
the sole woman on the panel didn't appear because her airplane was delayed. I'm not

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,560
sure if this affected the discussion or not, but as I listened, I realized that Genius was

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,000
being understood as a solely male property. Much it occurred to me as the nude in painting

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,600
or photography is immediately understood to be female. Genius was defined by the four

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,560
male participants as a combination of IQ and accomplishment. I thought the definition

17
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,400
accomplishment was a very poor one for the history of gifted women since they were so

18
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,640
often prevented from accomplishing anything at all or from developing their gifts or from

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,760
having their accomplishments recognized simply by virtue of being female. But sometimes they

20
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,680
did succeed. So where, for instance, in that discussion was Marie Curie, who won two Nobel

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,000
prizes, her daughter who won a Nobel in chemistry, Rosalind Franklin, who at the very least did

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
much of the work that led to the understanding of DNA, not to mention Hedy Lamar, noted movie

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,120
star and physicist. I then realized that the Genius has mentioned we're not only all

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,880
men, but all scientists. Where were all the women and where were the geniuses in the arts,

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:44,400
male and female? My feminist streak was activated and I am an artist. I spoke first to Darren

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,800
and then to the executive committee, which does our programming, and they agreed that

27
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,000
we should do two more programs about Genius, one about women as Genius and one about Geniuses

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,760
in the Arts. The last one will happen next season. So I put together a round table of,

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,640
and I swear this is an accident, four women and one man. By intention though, they are

30
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,400
historians, an anthropologist and an artist, all with a special interest in the historical

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,920
evolution of the idea of Genius. Okay, now I'm going to introduce the panelists in alphabetical

32
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,200
order, and I'll ask you to raise your hands as I mention your names so that people will

33
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:28,840
recognize you. By the way, the complete biographies are on the website. I've shortened them. Joyce

34
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,960
Chaplin is the James Duncan Phillips professor of Early American History at Harvard University

35
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,200
and director of Harvard's program in American studies. She has taught at six different universities

36
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,280
on two continents, a peninsula and an island, and in American studies program on the Atlantic

37
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,160
Ocean. Her interests are equally varied. A specialist in Early American intellectual history,

38
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,280
environmental history and the history of science, Professor Chaplin is the author of an anxious

39
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,960
pursuit, agricultural innovation and modernity in the lower south, 1730 to 1815, subject matter,

40
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:12,200
technology, the body and science on the Anglo-American frontier, 1500 to 1676, the first scientific

41
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,560
American, Benjamin Franklin and the pursuit of Genius, round about the earth's circumnavigation

42
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,120
from Magellan to orbit, and with Alison Bashford, the new worlds of Thomas Robert Malthus, rereading

43
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,960
the principle of population. She's also the editor of Benjamin Franklin's autobiography,

44
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,360
a Norton critical edition, and with Darren McMan of Genealogies of Genius. Her reviews?

45
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,240
Pardon me? Sure.

46
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,440
Why are you doing this? If she's desperate to raise their hands, we don't have to get

47
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:58,080
the audio on the line. But not on your paper. It's on the line.

48
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,040
This is what we do here. No, not always. In such a way, it's on the line.

49
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,440
You can stop with mine. Her reviews and essays. What? That's a compromise. You can stop with

50
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:18,440
mine. That's true. Kathleen Keat, a professor of European history and secretary of the faculty

51
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,560
at Trinity College, Connecticut. She received her PhD in history from Harvard with a year

52
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,040
on pass on at the Institute de tout de Paris. Her undergraduate degree is from the Harvard

53
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,680
Extension School, which she received while working at the Harvard College Observatory

54
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,920
Astronomical Plates Stacks Library. Her research works to broaden the field of history by

55
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,720
including within its purview, previously neglected, but rich subjects of study. Her first book,

56
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,120
The Beast in the Boudoir, Pet Keeping in 19th Century Paris, helped create the thriving

57
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,240
field of the cultural history of animals. This was followed by an edited volume of cultural

58
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,760
history of animals in the age of empire. A second major project addressed the complicated

59
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,160
history of attitudes towards ambition in French culture. Her book on this subject, Making Way

60
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,640
for Genius, the aspiring self from the old regime to the new, was published in 2012.

61
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,400
Currently, she is writing a history of Geneva and the Alps in the 18th Century, provisionally

62
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,280
titled, Becoming Visible, a History of the Alps in the Age of the French Revolution. I

63
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:35,280
will assume that I have been introduced. I'm not sure. I do three kinds of arts. And skip,

64
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:44,160
pardon me? I guess I wasn't interested. I was a concert pianist and then a writer, poet

65
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:52,520
and experimental fiction writer now and a visual artist in many ways, principally digital

66
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:59,160
at the moment. I paint on the computer. I'm interested in the idea of genius, prodigies,

67
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:10,400
et cetera. Darren McMahon is the Mary Brynze Mead. We locked Professor at Dartmouth College

68
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,640
and was formerly professor at Florida State University. Born in Carmel, California and

69
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,040
educated at the University of California, Berkeley and at Yale, where he received his

70
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,000
PhD, McMahon is the author of enemies of the Enlightenment, the French counter-enlightenment

71
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,880
and the making of modernity. Also of happiness, a history which has been translated into 12

72
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,960
languages and was awarded best books of the year honors for 2006 by the New York Times

73
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,920
and many other publications. In 2013, McMahon completed a history of the idea of genius

74
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,840
and the genius figure called divine fury, a history of genius. He's also the editor with

75
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,760
Ryan Hanley of the Enlightenment critical concepts in historical studies with Samuel

76
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,000
Moyne of rethinking modern European intellectual history and with Joyce Chaplin of genealogies

77
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,040
of genius. McMahon has taught as a visiting scholar at Columbia and NYU, Yale, the University

78
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,980
of Vermont, the Ecole no Maldes Superior, the Ecole des Otitudes and the University of

79
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,680
Potsdam. His writings have appeared in such publications as the New York Times, Wall Street

80
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,800
Journal, Boston Globe, the list is distinguished and as long as it is distinguished.

81
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,840
Susan Seymour is Gene M. Pitzer, professor emerita of anthropology at Pitzer College,

82
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,800
where she served as vice president for academic affairs and dean of faculty, as well as coordinator

83
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,840
of women's studies for the Claremont colleges. Her research has focused on changing family

84
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,960
and gender systems in India, specifically a longitudinal study in Boubanechwar, India.

85
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,240
Her books on India include the transformation of a sacred town, Boubanechwar, India, women

86
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,840
education and family structure in India and women, family and childcare in India, a world

87
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,840
and transition. Her article, multiple caretaking of infants and young children, an area and

88
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:11,640
critical need of a feminist psychological anthropology won the 2004 Sterling Prize awarded by society

89
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,040
for psychological anthropology. In recent years, she has focused on two principal projects,

90
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,800
rethinking the Western concept attachment. It takes the village to raise a child attachment

91
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,680
theory and multiple childcare in Ellor, Indonesia and in North India. In the edited volume attachment

92
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,720
reconsidered cultural perspectives on a Western theory and two on researching and writing

93
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,080
a biography of her Harvard mentor, Kora Dubois, titled Kora Dubois, anthropologist diplomat

94
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,160
agent. This is a woman who did succeed in a man's world in every way. Dubois' distinguished

95
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,160
career included groundbreaking research in the culture and personality movement of the

96
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,160
1930s. Co-chairing a seminar with psychoanalyst Abram Cardner on the impact of culture on

97
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,160
psychological development at the New York psychoanalytic Institute, but apparently not this one,

98
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,120
1935 to 37, directing research and analysis for the OSS in Southeast Asia during World

99
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,360
War II and becoming Harvard's first ten-year female professor in the faculty of arts and

100
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:21,360
sciences. So now I will sit down and become part of the panel and I'll ask Darren to begin

101
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,440
by. Thanks, Emery. Yeah, I'm the token male on the panel. I'm happy to be here. I was

102
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,560
actually fortunate enough to be at the last discussion about genius as well and I thought

103
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:40,920
I'd just begin maybe by explaining why we didn't talk about women a lot in the last section

104
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,720
and why the issue of women and genius is particularly vexed but also particularly important. And

105
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:56,080
that is primarily because the very category of genius as a term that we use to measure

106
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:03,440
others is a male category. It's invented by men, for men in the 18th century and indeed

107
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,120
there's a long sort of prehistory prior to that that's also profoundly gendered. The very

108
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:18,120
word genius derives from the Latin Genogeneré which gives us words like to beget a gene to

109
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:26,800
father and it's conceived by the Romans as a kind of guardian spirit of all men and exclusively

110
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,320
men, a god of birth. So there's a link to procreation, male procreation, there's an exclusive sort

111
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:40,640
of gendering of the very term and this is built upon over the centuries by kind of layers

112
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:50,120
of prejudice but when the cult of genius emerges in the 18th century this is even further reinforced.

113
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,360
Somebody like Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the 18th century can say that women simply cannot be

114
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,640
geniuses and you see then in the following century in the 19th century a whole kind of

115
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:10,280
scientific apparatus designed to explain that. So everything from measurement of cranial

116
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:21,400
capacity to sort of psychological and medical evaluations of women explaining why they don't

117
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:28,880
have the capacity for genius. There's an irony here in that when the cult of genius emerges

118
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,440
in the 18th century the way geniuses, male geniuses are described is often in terms of

119
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:43,040
certain feminine characteristics. So we associate genius with imagination and imagination in

120
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:51,760
the 18th century is a kind of dubious notion. It's the thing that women have when they

121
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,720
read novels, one of the reasons why it's thought to be dangerous for women to read novels in

122
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,680
the 18th century because their imagination will start and it will lead them into trouble.

123
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,480
Geniuses of course are people who are particularly imaginative. Geniuses are particularly sensitive.

124
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,400
They're talked about in this way in the 18th century as having the special capacity to

125
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:17,520
feel, to feel for others to get inside the hearts and minds of others but this is also

126
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:25,160
a way that women are spoken about. Genius are prone to kind of fits or convulsions,

127
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,760
the divine fury that Plato talks about, women have hysteria. So there's a way in which even

128
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,640
at the same time the concept is gendered in its origin, certain feminine characteristics

129
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:43,360
as it were ascribed to women. Now there's a whole history of women, courageous women

130
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:51,560
that Kathleen has written about who check this, this prejudice, the Stalinist stereotype.

131
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,440
So you have Gertrude Stein very famously saying, I am a genius at the end of the 19th century

132
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,880
and there are people in the 18th and 19th through that as well, combat the category. But

133
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,520
I think that's just the place to start by noting what is in some ways an obvious point

134
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,760
but profoundly important that the genius is a kind of profoundly gendered category to

135
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,960
begin with and I think we can go from there.

136
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:24,920
Anyway, let's talk about their work. I think it's gendered because it comes out of a long

137
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:31,880
patriarchal tradition that we are still dealing with. As an anthropologist I think about different

138
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:38,440
kinds of patriarchy a lot and try to think about the psychological effect on women in

139
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,320
particular of different kinds of patriarchal institutions and it doesn't surprise me at

140
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:51,560
all that women are not generally categorized as Jesus given that history. Sure, exactly.

141
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,080
Not history cross culturally and history since basically since we became agriculture

142
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,400
force. Right. I do a longer sense of history. Sure.

143
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,080
And it must be said that it was never a category that was about human equality of any kind.

144
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,800
I think that is the bigger problem and that the long, long history of gender inequality

145
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,080
is really one aspect of the difficulty of using genius nowadays. I think genius is a

146
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:27,520
great problem to contemplate in terms of deciding how much of our society really is democratic.

147
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,720
That is founded on a fundamental idea about equality among all people. However, that might

148
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,640
not be exhibited in everyday practice. It has to mean assumption about democracies.

149
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:45,440
Genius doesn't exactly comfortably fit along those lines. And I think even when ideas about

150
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,000
democracy are modified with ideas about meritocracy, well some people have different or greater

151
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,160
merits than others. How is that going to be adjudicated? And this is where designation

152
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,360
of who is or isn't a genius very often maps on to fundamental problems of democratic

153
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,360
culture and fundamental asymmetries in terms of how we are willing to think about human

154
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:21,400
merit. I'm also struck by how at least some women who want to present themselves as geniuses

155
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:29,040
adopt gender terms of masculinity. Madame de Stal, Charmaine de Stal was accused of

156
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,960
being masculine but she also presented a little bit as masculine in order to fit the type of

157
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:47,760
a genius in a way. And by the same token she expresses her genius in a kind of way that

158
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:57,360
encourages inspiration. But there seems to be a kind of model that women follow of being

159
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,040
male in order to succeed in certain professions. That's her another idea. Although I don't

160
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,800
think anyone thinks she's a genius but a celebrity.

161
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:21,480
From an anthropological point of view, why are there female goddesses? They're goddesses

162
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:31,640
but then there are no female geniuses. Well I don't think I'm not aware of Indian culture

163
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:40,120
generally talking about genius but they would include women. And the interesting thing about

164
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:47,320
India is that it's both a very patriarchal society in terms of the family system and

165
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,520
the caste system and yet you have all these female goddesses and women are considered

166
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:59,320
potentially very powerful. And heads of state. Pardon. And heads of state. And have been

167
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:07,560
heads of state. Yes. And governors etc. They have certainly surpassed us in terms of political

168
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:19,600
leadership. But Hinduism never became a monolithic patriarchal system and it gives a lot of openings

169
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:27,120
for women. That is an interesting question though. Why you have Athena as the goddess

170
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:34,280
of wisdom and yet not human embodiments. And of course that also brings to mind a dubious

171
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:41,640
place of women in the discourse of genius and that is as muse. Genius as inspiring figure.

172
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:51,120
Even goddess who gives to the genius his creative capacity. And that there's a long history

173
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,440
of the geniuses as the women as muse for genius. And then in the 19th century you get in somebody

174
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:08,720
like in Balzac or in Zola. And Zola's novel the figure of the mistress as at once kind of

175
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:18,840
muse and then also impediment to male genius. Right. The distracts or siphons off male kind

176
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,680
of virile intellectual energy and then poses a conflict. Right.

177
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,960
And that's the conflict in contemporary India. And I would suspect it was an ancient Greece.

178
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:38,000
Right. And there's the embedded problem that I think for a woman to be superhuman in some

179
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,840
way makes her monstrous rather than necessarily divine. And so the phenomenon that would exist

180
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,680
for a man being inspired by a kind of divine power reads differently. Yeah. When that is

181
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,760
exhibited by women where there are long western traditions of categorizing powerful women

182
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:06,200
as varagos. They're not quite natural for instance. Even female rulers. And likewise

183
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,720
any number of holy women for instance who yes they're comparable to men but there's

184
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,360
also something wrong with them. And so there isn't the same positive designation of that

185
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,560
divine attribute in women. I mean they're always dangerous because they bite you serve male

186
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:28,560
power. And they do begat children even though men control think they control the system.

187
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:36,800
Yeah. Going back to the question of Zola's, there's actually two interesting women in

188
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:45,120
that. There's the woman news who helps in the self destruction of Claude. But there's

189
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:52,160
also the wife of the character who is meant to be Zola. And so La has a really interesting

190
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:59,440
argument I think in that novel about the function of genius and creativity. Because the artist

191
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,040
burns himself up and can never create the masterpiece. But the writer character who's

192
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:13,440
supposed to be Zola goes to work every day and comes home to a family life that's directed

193
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,200
by his wife. So I'm saying two things. One has to do with the balance between inspiration

194
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:30,360
and work which even in Zola a recognized genius he understands that that's not really how

195
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:37,080
you get that done. But also in the 19th century world there's very little room for a woman

196
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:46,240
of genius. I'm not sure when there ever has been a lot of room. A woman of genius. 19th

197
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,000
century difficulties notwithstanding. I mean I'm really stuck as well that there's a kind

198
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,120
of a cumulative problem that it's one thing to be female and be a genius. I'm aware of

199
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,240
the example of Phyllis Wheatley for instance, the 18th century African American poet. So

200
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:09,520
black female genius probably not. And so the way in which female obviously belongs to a

201
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:17,160
larger category of social experience and cultural expectation. I think that is a continuing

202
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:24,440
problem 18th, 19th, 20th centuries and probably still now. Even for men I would think that

203
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,040
to be a man in a genius seems less problematic perhaps and being a woman of genius but it

204
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:36,400
depends obviously a social class, ethnic background, educational standing. So again I think the

205
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,040
problem of women and genius is one facet of the bigger problem about well who is unequal

206
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,120
and why do we say that.

207
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:53,360
Yeah Senator if you go to small non-western society some of which are not patriarchal.

208
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,680
You have women who get to be shamans for example and are considered really important,

209
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:08,280
have special powers and are recognized and that's okay. But it takes a very different

210
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,800
type of society and egalitarian society.

211
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,600
Or reasonably egalitarian society.

212
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,200
Also I think there's a question of whether that is a shamanism for example is exactly

213
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,960
like genius or what the similarities it does not. I'm just saying if we go to something

214
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,600
else where women are allowed to be in a special category where actually it's more like what

215
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,360
Deryn described historically that there were supernatural powers women could have them

216
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,560
and women in India can have them today.

217
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:51,640
I think the point that Joyce was making about gender being embedded in a kind of larger

218
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,640
problem of inequality is really important. I like to point out that the same man who

219
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,720
declared that it's a self-evident truth that all are created equal Thomas Jefferson can

220
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,400
turn around and speak quite openly as many people in 18th century American, Eastern Europe

221
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:15,560
do of natural aristocrats. That is people who are born to be superior to lead and used

222
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,560
in fact genius as one of the categories by which define these people and that I think

223
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:26,040
gets to the heart of this problem that Joyce mentions in democracy. It's kind of actually

224
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,960
a really striking thing that the cult of genius emerges in the very same century that human

225
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,080
equality is on the table as a possibility politically and socially.

226
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,720
That creates for somebody like Jefferson a huge problem. How do you run a society without

227
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,760
hierarchy? We're going to get rid of blood hierarchy on the basis of gentry and aristocracy

228
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,320
but we need to put something in its place and intelligence becomes one of these categories

229
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,320
and then that category then is justified by a science, what in the 19th century would

230
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,080
have been a science we would call in many cases pseudoscience today that placed women

231
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:17,000
along with a whole slew of others, people of color, Jews on a spectrum that showed sort

232
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,360
of white males of European descent on one end and then people of color, women and so

233
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:30,920
forth on the other. The science that begins with physiognomy and craniometry leads to

234
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:37,840
brain science culminates in IQ. In fact you can show that the founding fathers of the

235
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:46,960
IQ exam, Bine and Lewis Turman come out of genius research studies in the 19th century

236
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:58,080
and they share many of the prejudices. So, Galton, Turman, they have discomfort, well

237
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,720
they just believe categorically that women can't be geniuses and Turman sort of from

238
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,880
his data says actually women do pretty well in IQ exams but then says at the extremes

239
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,960
right at the real extremes where geniuses are four or five standard deviations from the

240
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,360
norm they don't have it right and they say similar things about Jews and so again the

241
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,400
point being is that this category of genius is a problematic one in all kinds of ways

242
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,560
not simply vis-a-vis gender. And precisely because it is in a sense defined during the

243
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,960
age of revolutions in the 19th century because a sort of tremendous source of cultural anxiety

244
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:44,040
well do you want to be equal or do you want to be unusual and the choices for people who

245
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:50,360
are going to be in a sense classified as not toward the top why should there be one or

246
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:56,600
the other and it is really a kind of removing opportunity rather than offering it.

247
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:05,640
So, have it come back because we're in an age of anxiety again? Perhaps I do think that

248
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,320
we're worried about whether we are still or increasingly a culture of meritocracy. I

249
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:17,960
think that's a question that is of great concern for every generation but perhaps maybe for

250
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,440
younger people these days about what kind of society are they going to enter as adults.

251
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,440
It does seem like it's a moment where economic opportunities and therefore social and cultural

252
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,840
opportunities might be closing so who is going to get through and on what merit and

253
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,840
yeah I think that's one reason genius is a newly operative category for us.

254
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:48,840
Well also if being special is somehow important being most special is to be most important

255
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:55,400
and so that would be one way to kind of rule a thumb say what a genius is and so I mean

256
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:03,320
it's a little bit just interesting about how we might nurture our progeny and make sure

257
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,520
that everyone feels special but how special are you compared to other people. I mean I

258
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:15,560
think that goes to the cultural issue about meritocracy and success and ambition and who

259
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:21,640
gets to succeed and who doesn't and I think some of the anxiety comes from the fact that

260
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:28,160
in a meritocracy if you don't succeed it's because you're not good enough and we still

261
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:36,280
do hide a lot of the impediments to getting to a certain place.

262
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:43,840
So that's one thing but I also wanted to go back to the point of origin that Darren was

263
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,760
mentioning about the 18th century and the 19th century and I wonder whether one of the

264
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:57,120
reasons why it gets so fixed the issue of gender and masculinity is that we welcome a

265
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,200
world in which progress is very important and we say that one of the characteristics of

266
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:09,600
a genius is to be able to see into the future and so perhaps the future that we want to

267
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:17,000
see in the 18th and 19th century possibly today too has to do with technology has to

268
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:26,120
do with the economy has to do with some of the fields in which women were not well committed

269
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,400
at the time.

270
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:34,160
So if a function of genius is to be able to leap into the future and see where we're

271
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:40,600
going maybe that's one of the reasons that gets so associated with the privilege with

272
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:47,240
masculinity the two things go together we were not interested in the 19th century or

273
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,960
today in a world that works with imagination as unless it's to the degree that it works

274
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:00,360
with technology and imagination Microsoft and Google.

275
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,520
So are you kind of indirectly equating genius with function?

276
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:12,120
I actually like to think of the relationship between genius and function.

277
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:23,440
I don't think it's just says that I truly understand the importance of say a Mozart

278
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,400
but I think if we think in terms of how the word genius functions in our society or calling

279
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,920
certain people geniuses and not reading certain people as geniuses or not I think it might

280
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:45,000
help unlock what what we mean by it what we mean by the word and how then it works.

281
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,440
Rather than assume that it is a natural category of being or that it measures something trans

282
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,880
historical I do think that the designation of the world and how word sorry and how it

283
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:03,120
functions is really analytically important more so than determining well yes no maybe

284
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,280
in the case of actual historical people.

285
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,440
And that is actually a place where one can show that when the category emerges in the

286
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:17,720
17th century people who refer to most often as genius with poets and creative artists

287
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,480
and then you get the introduction of statesman the kind of exception that proves the rule

288
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:30,200
is Newton who's spoken about as a genius from very early on but often in a way that characterizes

289
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,440
in more like an writer or poet than a scientist and it's really not until the 20th century

290
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,880
with the Calderon Einstein that that immediate association between genius and science and

291
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,640
technology is made and today this is I should fill you in on the back story when we were

292
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,760
downstairs we were all commenting on the fact that genius has reemerged relatively recently

293
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,080
as a kind of topos of discussion in popular culture but also in academic culture in a

294
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,360
way that would have been unthinkable 20 or 30 years ago when genius was still so implicated

295
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:09,000
in its dark past its its racism its misogyny its connection to eugenics and we've spent

296
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,080
in the at least in academic circles the last you know several decades kind of deconstructing

297
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:21,000
genius and yet it's it's back and we're sort of trying to figure out why that's the case

298
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,320
but it is back and it's been spoken of and I think one of the ways in which it's spoken

299
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:33,440
of is precisely as as Kathleen says with respect to Google with respect to Microsoft with respect

300
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,480
to business technology and culture and you know maybe there is this hope that that scientists

301
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:45,280
of genius can get us out of terrible problems like global warming so that we can still you

302
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,880
know run around in our expensive cars all the time and so forth but so when you say genius

303
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,680
is come back what is it that this come back exactly the conversation about this issue

304
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:02,320
the conversation sure it does the conversation since it's not back in anthropology does the

305
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,920
conversation never was there women I mean is that part of the conversation I think so

306
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:18,880
I mean you know the I believe in Julia de Christiva I mean yeah like geniuses actually female

307
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,000
genius functions as a female yeah I mean even some people are writing that or that way

308
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,240
yeah and even even for historians I think that obviously we're talking about a certain

309
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:38,920
idea that is floating around the global West and has very United States dimensions that

310
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,000
yeah really you referred to Silicon Valley is a very specific site genius which is a very

311
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,560
particular place on earth let's just say so I'm not I'm not sure where it's back certainly

312
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,880
within Western academia picking up I think on some of the public's willingness to use

313
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,040
it again as a innocent category of description whereas we obviously approach it with more

314
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,120
suspicion about what it represents in the longer history and a disbelief that is actually describing

315
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:13,000
something real yeah I mean yeah I think one can point to ways in which it's back in as

316
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,760
you say not just in the United States but in Western media more generally but there is

317
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,880
a surprising resurgence of interest in it as an analytical category it seems within in

318
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:31,000
academic circles which is quite striking I think well say when could say that genius

319
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,280
is good to think with now so we're trying to think about issues of meritocracy we're

320
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:43,720
trying to think about issues of child raising we're trying to think about practical questions

321
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,840
about how to see it solve global warming maybe there'll be a technological solution I'll

322
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:57,960
grow into things like that but inter for historians it's become a category that helps us maybe

323
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,080
see the difference between the 18th century and the 19th century or our connections with

324
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:10,320
different periods so that's what we might mean by good to think with it helps open up a certain

325
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,400
plane in history that we hadn't thought through before sure and therefore the work that it

326
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:24,960
is supposed to be doing in any given era is quite striking that the older poetic artistic

327
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:32,200
sense of genius only gave way to our modern scientific technocratic idea of it with Einstein

328
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,240
so it's really quite striking that Darwin for various reasons is never really described

329
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,760
as part of a cult of genius and that's a really interesting 19th century would seem

330
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,280
lapse in terms of the development of genius but it makes perfect cultural sense and only

331
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,440
now I think are we moving really even away from science in terms of discoveries about

332
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:00,240
the natural world to a technological application of our knowledge to solve problems in a world

333
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:07,520
where I think we are all worried about shrinking natural resources shrinking opportunities

334
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:17,160
and therefore the human mind has to expand and genius does that for us whoops well slightly

335
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:26,240
related question and a little bit maybe interesting with respect to concerns about gender I'm

336
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:35,880
thinking about the recent triumph of a computer over the go master and I'm just thinking to

337
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,080
argue that whether computers or the artificial intelligence are in fact masculine or whether

338
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:49,400
they're neutral or feminine or feminine.

339
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,800
Nootful would be the real achievement right that it's beyond gender somehow it's machine

340
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,440
intelligence cannot be described in terms of men and women.

341
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,240
Except for there's of course huge public discussion about the lack of female coders right and

342
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,800
computer engineers is a real problem so and I mean that's actually a really interesting

343
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
question to be asking I think.

344
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,360
But again a very culturally distinct one since that the I R our idea that mathematics

345
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:24,160
and computer science belong to men is again Western and India mathematics and coding are

346
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,520
more open to girls than they are here so an interesting way in which internationally that

347
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:37,720
machine genius may eventually if it is the work of many global hands to be neutral.

348
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:44,600
I was struck in the description of the battle between the human and the machine with the

349
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:52,520
go that the machine had seemed to have found an inspired way to win the game it had been

350
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,520
a way that hadn't been thought of before so the go master said I had never thought of

351
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,440
using those kinds of things as opposed to simply thinking more quickly to get to a certain

352
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,920
point.

353
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,800
So perhaps the machine had genius in this older fashion sense of of inspiration.

354
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:23,520
I'm also reminded that the Hamilton speaks a lot about genius the obviously the show

355
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:29,920
Hamilton exclamation point.

356
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:37,360
Burr talks about you know everybody geniuses lower your voices he mentions that his mother

357
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:47,640
is a genius and there's a sense that you know a kind of reification of the revolutionary

358
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:55,160
moving history forward through acts of individual and collective genius and that might be something

359
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:01,520
that has such resonance today because maybe it goes back to a question about anxiety who's

360
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,200
going to solve our problems who's going to solve global warming who's going to figure

361
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,160
out who the bad people are in Paris and Belgium and stop the bot means you know who's going

362
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,640
to do this is it going to be collective is it going to be individual how are we going

363
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,840
to get there.

364
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:25,160
And here's where I think I'm going to be a part of it.

365
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:31,520
But here's where I think the ideas about genius intersect with those about charisma and leadership

366
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,200
as well as I mean we were talking earlier downstairs about the cult of celebrity and

367
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:45,320
the idea about particularly people grabbing the spotlight as Hamilton did and does every

368
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:53,280
night again and again and again where having ambition and wanting to be prominent can

369
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,360
be qualifications or be perceived as qualifications for problem solving.

370
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:06,720
And establishing when as a genius because another point we were beginning to develop downstairs

371
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,440
to have to do with it has to somehow to do with success too.

372
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,680
I mean if you were four years old and you know if that person is a genius.

373
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:24,840
So achievement and getting to the place where one can achieve is one of the vital questions

374
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,720
and I think that intersects with the usual gender because it has historically been so

375
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:36,000
much easier for a male to get to that space than for a female to get to that space.

376
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:47,320
One of the projects I'm working on has to do with a man in Geneva who explores the Alps

377
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,160
for the first time.

378
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,560
But he has a sister who is almost invisible in history.

379
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,120
Sounds like a familiar story.

380
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,280
But it's very interesting.

381
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,240
Her sister's name is Judith Yudith.

382
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,600
And Voltaire is living in Geneva at the same time she is growing up.

383
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:10,560
And she asks Voltaire if he would be her mentor.

384
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,680
And she writes him letters and they meet.

385
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,840
And he plays along with her.

386
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,080
And then at a certain point in time something horrible happens.

387
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,880
And it appears that they have a little bit of possibly a sexual encounter.

388
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,320
It's probably not true.

389
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,560
But her reputation is ruined throughout Europe because of this.

390
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,560
It's written about in Grimm's.

391
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,200
Why wasn't it enhanced?

392
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,760
Why did it ruin her reputation?

393
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:48,400
It ruined her reputation in Geneva as a 1617 18 year old girl.

394
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,520
It enhanced Voltaire.

395
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:59,680
So that Grimm and Grichalu and in fact the court circle laughed at his net Voltaire.

396
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,840
He's almost 80 years old and he's still having these things.

397
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,760
It's actually Madame de Dene who spreads this room.

398
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,160
So it's terrible for her.

399
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:15,200
But what is interesting is that the young Madame de Chatelet also had As Voltaire be

400
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,560
my mentor.

401
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:23,920
And it works for her and she becomes very important as a mathematician, translator of

402
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,760
Newton, et cetera, et cetera.

403
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:32,880
And what I'm trying to say is that there's a more vulnerable way in which women have

404
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,640
been able to get to the world of success.

405
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,720
It is often through the world of the masculine.

406
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:46,600
So it's also very open to, we might even say abuse, but vulnerabilities too.

407
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,400
And that's just part of the problem, the gendered problem.

408
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:57,680
And I began with talking about saying that genius is recognized through achievement.

409
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,720
It's just a more difficult and more complicated way in history for women to get to that place

410
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,720
of achievement.

411
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,520
And it certainly been allowed to begin.

412
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:16,760
And it's certainly important for 18th century ideas of genius that it seem untuttered, that

413
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:23,760
it have a kind of natural and internal foundation within the person who's going to be so designated.

414
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,800
And that to be dependent on the education or the tutelage or the patronage of another

415
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,440
questions that.

416
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,400
And so the way in which a particular young woman might work through a male patron would

417
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,800
immediately question whatever accomplishment might eventually play out.

418
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,280
Which I think continues to be a sense about genius.

419
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,880
That it has to have a kind of spontaneous bursting out from a person which obviously

420
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:57,080
puts a burden on somebody who has less access to education and all those things that might

421
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:02,040
actually be the foundation for this kind of accomplishment.

422
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:16,800
So is genius then completely related to the product of that person or is genius based

423
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,840
on the level of the IQ?

424
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:28,920
In other words if a person with an IQ of 110 makes a fantastic discovery he becomes a genius.

425
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,960
Well you know that's so interesting because I do think that that's part of the point

426
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,560
that not just so law makes but Stondal who very very gifted writers but Stondal also

427
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,560
has a moment of truth.

428
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:49,080
Though he's a genius but he's a moment of truth he says in his autobiography his memoir.

429
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:55,080
He says why did I you know 30 years older however years older and I've been waiting

430
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,320
for inspiration every day.

431
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,400
Why didn't somebody when I was 15 tell me just to get up in the morning and work for

432
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,440
three to five hours a day.

433
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:14,160
So I'm not fully answering your question but clearly actually doing the thing is important.

434
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,640
Maybe with a IQ of 110 or 140 I don't know.

435
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:26,240
I mean there's this whole kind of romantic idea of the undiscovered genius right.

436
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,040
But when genius becomes a category of research and it's Francis Galton who's the father of

437
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,800
eugenics who's the key figure here.

438
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,040
His first book is called Hereditary Genius and he tries to figure out why genius arises

439
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,680
at a certain point.

440
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:46,440
He just makes a distinction that creativity or production is the sole measure of genius

441
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,600
otherwise you don't have anything and so he says basically an undiscovered genius is

442
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,040
an oxymoron.

443
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,640
And a lot of people who study genius now follow that so Dean Keith Simon who was here last

444
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:05,280
time with us who as a psychologist emeritus at UC Davis practices what Galton called

445
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,240
historiometrics and basically you study achievement.

446
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,520
You study production right and a genius is in the goods.

447
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:18,000
The problem with that kind of analysis though is that and this is Dean's own figure that

448
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,680
something like only 3% of significant world production in the arts or in the sciences

449
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,320
is created by women right.

450
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,160
And you know in other words and so this was a problem for Galton.

451
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,560
Galton turned around and said you know who are the geniuses in 19th century England

452
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,360
and lo and behold they were all white men you know.

453
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,360
Why would that be the case?

454
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:46,640
Well because they've had access to education they've had the family backgrounds they run

455
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,160
the institutions that give the label out in the first place and so studying simply productivity

456
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,520
is a kind of way of finding what you're looking for in the first place.

457
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,520
Oh sure it's been used in a terrible way.

458
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,360
I mean in the world of mathematics in the world of philosophy I had a professor say

459
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:12,160
to me once that this is true how many female philosophers can you name?

460
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,160
Zero.

461
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,760
Or mathematicians or composers.

462
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,760
Don't bother.

463
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,760
Don't bother.

464
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,760
Don't bother.

465
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,760
Don't bother.

466
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,760
Don't bother.

467
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,760
Don't bother.

468
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,520
I was also struck by recent coverage of the I mean this is not a recent discovery but it

469
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:34,720
is a good reminder that whenever a profession for instance becomes more than 50% female

470
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,520
wages go down in that profession.

471
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:43,040
So obviously any category that really matters has men as a minority and this is expressed

472
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,920
in economic terms as well as the kind of cultural capital of the idea of genius.

473
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,720
On the other hand a little bit this story of Mendelssohn's sister I mean I suppose Mendelssohn

474
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,280
doesn't matter if it's called a genius or not but they came from the same family a very

475
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,760
rich banking family in Vienna and they were educated together their education was apparently

476
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,080
the wonder of all of Europe.

477
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:14,440
Mendelssohn went to their celloone concerts and Mendelssohn and Fannie Felix and Fannie

478
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,200
were educated together and they performed together at these celloins and everyone knew

479
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,120
they were both geniuses.

480
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:28,560
There was really no question and they were treated as such very well and when Fannie became

481
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:34,200
15 or 16 she received a letter from her father on her birthday and it said from now on you

482
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:42,160
must consider yourself an ornament and your joy must come from your brother's success

483
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:49,440
and it absolutely stopped her and she wasn't allowed to publish or to give concerts in

484
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,960
public only in her home etc etc.

485
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,360
So what happened was everyone forgot about her but she went on composing and playing

486
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,440
but she could only do it in small forms.

487
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,160
She couldn't hire an orchestra or a ride in or a torrier or anything like that to have

488
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:08,920
when her performed in her house she did trios and duets and songs and stuff like that and

489
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,920
she couldn't publish etc etc.

490
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,800
And finally when her father died her very nice husband encouraged her to go and because

491
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:24,520
other women were out for instance your son was out there doing things and Clara Schumann

492
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,520
was too.

493
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,560
It turns out that those were about class.

494
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:36,280
If you were an aristocrat or lower class you could do things like that but if you were

495
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:42,080
Jewish converted like the Mendelssohn's it was dangerous but anyway when she was about

496
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,640
40 and her father died she started to publish.

497
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:49,640
Everyone knew who she was and how gifted she was and she was beginning to have some success

498
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:55,560
and then she had a stroke and died and Mendelssohn collapsed when he heard about it and six months

499
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,120
later he was dead too.

500
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:02,920
So anyway I just wanted to say the obstacles that are put in women's paths still.

501
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,400
Why are they no women philosophers?

502
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,440
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard right?

503
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,640
That's really strange.

504
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,280
And I agree that these are terrible stories about the waste of human capital.

505
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:18,080
Yeah again and again and again and they really show us the very embedded way in which societies

506
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:23,400
have worked in terms of inequality but I still have the question why do we want women to

507
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,400
be geniuses?

508
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:32,320
What's achieved by having women fulfill that category or fit into that category that as

509
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,640
we've been identifying is insidious in all kinds of ways.

510
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,120
Agreed.

511
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:47,280
So yes I think that this can be a very important way of revealing how Western society has

512
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,440
achieved only so much by the 18th century or the 19th century or the 20th century but

513
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:58,680
with the resurgence of interest in genius now I guess I don't want to see that the way

514
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,200
in which women might be categorized as genius solves the problem because in sense I think

515
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:10,240
it's playing along with the game that has been really really again insidious about ranking

516
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,120
of different kinds of human beings for a very long period of time.

517
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,120
Agreed.

518
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:22,400
I just thought that since men have special status playing field out of the level that's

519
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,200
well I just think that we should probably question the special status and no longer

520
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,200
call Mendelssohn a genius.

521
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,200
I agree.

522
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,200
Absolutely.

523
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:35,400
The category would be the best thing I think but you say it's coming back.

524
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,480
No I'm just saying it's coming back as part of public discourse and fascination not that

525
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,280
there's a reality now that never existed before.

526
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:51,840
But it's that there's a real interest in trying to classify people in an era when we're trying

527
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:57,040
just the opposite or trying to promote women and if you're going to promote women if you're

528
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,240
going to have the category genius then you better damn well have some women in there.

529
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,640
But what do you use as a term or a category instead?

530
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:14,640
No I think of Virginia Woolf's to the lighthouse and I can't think of that book without thinking

531
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:22,600
of it as being almost a perfect thing which is one of the definitions of what geniuses

532
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,840
were a product of the genius.

533
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:33,320
It's something that appears perfect structurally that can hardly be chipped away at.

534
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:40,280
And so if we don't call that an active genius I wonder if we're calling it an active beauty

535
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,200
which could also work in the world of mathematics mathematicians talk about their things as

536
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,200
beauty.

537
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:52,000
Newton's do own discoveries I think that's part of one of the reasons why he's understood

538
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,080
in his age is poetic because the heavens are in some way poetic.

539
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:04,560
There's a sense of perfection that might even be innate might be at least intuitive that

540
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:12,840
we see but I can think of that novel as being something to my mind as perfect as it can

541
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:18,280
be structurally and that somehow we can recognize.

542
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,480
And so if it's not genius I wonder what it is.

543
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,360
Well I think the difficulty here is shifting from praise of the product to praise of the

544
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,360
producer.

545
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:31,880
I agree I think that's it as I said that I think it's it rather than Virginia Woolf being

546
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,040
the genius things are a work of genius and it would be liberating I think with respect

547
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,680
to gender itself.

548
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,960
Right because actually if we could identify a long list of all of the things that humanity

549
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:52,360
has done that are valuable and amazing inspiration I think we could very easily establish that

550
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,640
probably it's not just men who did that.

551
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:02,960
Right or even behind the stories of great men are often great women.

552
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,360
I think it is interesting though I said that 3% figure but the one way you can grow that

553
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,800
a little bit is in literature.

554
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:18,560
And literature doesn't have the same prohibition that sort of you don't need to hire orchestra.

555
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,640
So the startup costs are less.

556
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:27,440
So one can fairly easily compile a list of great women writers in the 19th century.

557
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,280
Right from Jane Austen Ford.

558
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,640
But the women who originated writing novels don't get acknowledged.

559
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:39,000
I'm not saying they're geniuses but the history got rewritten and just eliminated a whole

560
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
bunch of people.

561
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,040
And it became a male category and then you rediscover women.

562
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:53,440
But the other dimension here worth I think our interrogation is the idea of authorship

563
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,440
anyway.

564
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,440
That it is not necessarily only an individual thing.

565
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,440
Sure.

566
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,240
In the communities of production and creativity.

567
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:06,000
And very often the credit goes to one person and it's interesting that that happens anyway.

568
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,480
And it's of course especially interesting in terms of this discussion when it happens

569
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:15,240
for the male author who is perceived as the genius within the community.

570
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:20,600
But again if we're going to look at works that have benefited humanity who did that.

571
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,520
I think very often it's not that we're talking about men and women but a lot of people working

572
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,520
together.

573
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:32,040
Yeah and that's another side issue but it's centrally related.

574
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,840
The cult of genius emerges at the same time as the notion of copyright.

575
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:42,920
And so there's an interest in identifying a creator who owns his creation so therefore

576
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,440
can drive profit from it.

577
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,840
So the cult of the genius then is very convenient.

578
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:52,960
It's a convenient area also in a market society when you're trying to find ownership.

579
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,720
I think that's part of its resurgence today.

580
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,640
I mean that's quite real.

581
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,640
Yeah.

582
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,800
I mean just off the top of my head.

583
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,720
I mean there have been a whole slate of genius films of late.

584
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:13,880
So Alan Turing and the two Steve Jobs films.

585
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,880
The Beautiful Mind Before That.

586
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,880
The Facebook found.

587
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:23,880
And forgetting the great Cambridge physicist who's in the wheelchair.

588
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,880
He's mocking.

589
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,880
Right.

590
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:32,840
And then about four spasci and company.

591
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:39,200
So I mean in the Jobs case it's actually very interesting.

592
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:44,720
I mean clearly the man had marketing genius if you will.

593
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,480
But Jobs isn't a creator of anything.

594
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,240
And in fact one could argue that he's what he's really good at is taking other people's

595
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,840
ideas and giving them a kind of logic of their own.

596
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:02,240
And yet the brand, you know if you've seen that the first of the Jobs film the opening

597
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,240
shot you know as he comes down the stairs is that big picture of Einstein.

598
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,960
And this is a man that got Walter Isaacson who's written Biographies of Einstein and

599
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,640
Benjamin Franklin to write his biography.

600
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:19,600
So you know I mean he's setting out to kind of myth make in that way.

601
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,600
Yes.

602
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,760
Hence a lot of the popular interest.

603
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:27,640
It'd be fascinating to know how far Isaacson's books have been translated and then probably

604
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:32,080
that would help us identify who is talking about genius now because I think that's been

605
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,080
a very important prompt for everyone.

606
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:43,080
I think I like what the idea of eliminating the genius as the person but focusing on the

607
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,360
work as a work of genius.

608
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:52,360
Because it also takes care of the problem that you may be have a work that seems a work

609
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:58,480
of genius today but ten years from now it seems completely wrong.

610
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,200
So it allows you to be more flexible.

611
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:07,680
It's hard to say he was a genius ten years ago but he's no longer a genius now.

612
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,640
But you can say it seemed to us it was a work of genius then but now we've learned other

613
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,000
things and we no longer think that about it.

614
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
What may change in the future.

615
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,160
Again that's what's happening with Lamarck right.

616
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,360
Suddenly Lamarck is coming back.

617
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:32,480
I mean Kathleen you mentioned Julie Christeva a little while ago and I think you know they're

618
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:38,680
so coming out of this effort to deconstruct genius in the post World War II period then

619
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:45,480
was an emphasis to think about what women might bring to bear specifically as women.

620
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:51,320
And Christeva and then actually Derrida and one of his last works have things to say about

621
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,320
this.

622
00:58:52,320 --> 00:59:00,080
Christeva wants to argue that women's link to creation and procreation gives them special

623
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:07,440
insight into the creative process that women have a certain relationality that puts them

624
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,080
in touch with different people in a better way.

625
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:15,920
And again you get into kind of essentialist ideas of what genius is but I think that's

626
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,960
important to bring up that there's that's part of a discourse that there may be something

627
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:26,400
uniquely feminine about certain kinds of genius and that we should be in the business of cultivating

628
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,040
that right.

629
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:36,080
I see a push in a sense in a different direction on that question from animal studies which

630
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:41,400
every year those folks are getting better at trying to make a good case for animal intelligence

631
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,520
is comparable to human intelligence.

632
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:50,480
And I don't think it's there yet I mean I am the yet is implied will see that we can't

633
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,920
see into the future on that question.

634
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,920
But it is interesting a lot of that analysis does not pay any attention to gender it's

635
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:05,280
just how smart crows are right period what what kind of intelligence dolphins have and

636
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:11,000
so it's that's a really interesting way again like computer or machine intelligence where

637
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,240
it is for the moment neutral and I think pursuing a lot of the same questions but doing so

638
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,440
quite profitably differently.

639
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:23,840
There's some dumb male animals though.

640
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:28,760
There's some white dumb male animals.

641
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,760
So we blame it on him.

642
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:35,720
The computer intelligence is neutral because the programming has been done by men for the

643
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,880
most part and it has a very strong male cultural association.

644
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,800
I was only referring to that.

645
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,480
Now as we're getting more and more women into math and science and engineering that image

646
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:52,720
may change but you know probably not in my lifetime but it's happening.

647
01:00:52,720 --> 01:01:02,240
I think the response in with respect to animal studies could be that here again you could

648
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:08,440
see I mean you can see this argument being made that about the animals is very interesting

649
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:14,280
because it raises the question of the distinctiveness of humans with respect to other species.

650
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:21,200
One could say that genius could be held on to because it might be a special characteristic

651
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,840
of being human because we can't quite measure it in animals.

652
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,760
I'm not forwarding that but I'm suggesting that that might be something else that could

653
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,600
be going on with respect to thinking about genius.

654
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:41,520
What makes humans distinct in a world in which we're understanding ourselves in such a real

655
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:47,880
web that has to do with machines and that has to do with other species?

656
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:53,440
What is it particularly about being human that tells us that we're human and not something

657
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,840
else?

658
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,200
So once we find the genius dolphin that will be the question.

659
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,200
The question.

660
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:08,200
Yes and that is going back to what problems do we think genius is going to solve?

661
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:13,960
If for instance it's climate change that's a way of thinking about ourselves in which

662
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:19,360
we are comparing ourselves to other animals that we are just other animals we need natural

663
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:25,720
resources and if we don't have them we are going to suffer but it is hypothetical whether

664
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:30,720
we're going to be unlike other animals in terms of solving that problem.

665
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:37,320
I'm laughing to myself because I'm remembering a French anthropologist who was there was

666
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:42,080
a whole movement brain studies and not just studying brains but collecting them.

667
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:46,360
There were massive museums all over the world and in the 19th century and one of the biggest

668
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,200
was at the Museums de laum in Paris.

669
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,240
8,000 brains and skulls and of course the dominant notion of the time was that the bigger the

670
01:02:54,240 --> 01:03:01,320
brain the smarter you were and somebody pointed out that by that calculus the whale is the

671
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,720
smartest creature of them all clearly.

672
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,520
It's going to be a good hypothesis.

673
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,520
How dumb scientists can be right?

674
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:13,400
I mean they hadn't thought in those terms for the longest time that of course brain size

675
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,760
varies with body mass.

676
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,920
Bigger people have bigger brains.

677
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,760
It doesn't mean they're smarter.

678
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:26,080
Yeah but it's still an issue that people are fighting.

679
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:31,880
I'm not entirely comfortable with genius as product.

680
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:39,760
I'm not comfortable with genius but I think especially having written the biography of

681
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:48,160
Cora de Bois and thinking about her and the life spans of other prominent women who managed

682
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:54,760
to accomplish things in a world that was very male dominated and where it was very difficult

683
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,080
for them.

684
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:03,640
You have to look at the whole life to understand how special they were and I'm not saying

685
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:09,400
I want to throw her into the genius category necessarily but it wouldn't be just one product.

686
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:16,640
It would be the way she and others that I can think of managed to work through a whole

687
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:24,840
series of very male professions and get to the top.

688
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:28,080
So her life is the product.

689
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,360
It's not any one thing.

690
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:35,200
And I think of Gertrude Bell, somebody like that, the same thing.

691
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:44,520
Many different professional activities but just an amazing woman.

692
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:53,000
So for me it's the life and how they manage in under very difficult circumstances and

693
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,720
what the toll was on them to get to that level of achievement.

694
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:03,680
And I've often a very heavy toll.

695
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,960
I think you're right but I'm also thinking about Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict who

696
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:22,520
I think didn't have to deal with as much prejudice for some reason in anthropology in those

697
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,520
days.

698
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,520
Not true.

699
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,520
Not true.

700
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,520
Okay, tell.

701
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:40,520
Well, women, a small number of women were allowed to pursue PhDs but they never got positions.

702
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,240
Mead was with the museum.

703
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:49,720
Benedict did get a position because she worked closely with Boaz and he eventually got her

704
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:57,880
a position at Columbia but as soon as he retired they brought in a man to run the department.

705
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,600
And so she was the exception.

706
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,480
Du Boaz was the exception for her generation.

707
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,800
The only one.

708
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:12,040
So even though there were a lot of women invited into the field, they were kept at lowly positions.

709
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,040
Right.

710
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:17,520
I see the attraction of thinking about a person as a genius in the sense of thinking about

711
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:25,120
the whole life but I'm not sure whether, how would that not be a matter of determination

712
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:29,080
plus talent, plus resilience plus all these things though.

713
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:35,320
I wonder if it also does though speak to something in the history of genius.

714
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:43,520
I mean, when things of Napoleon is often described as not just a genius at the military or a

715
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:50,680
genius at people but he's a kind of charismatic genius person in this age of being that.

716
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:56,880
I mean, it just seems like that's a little bit more of a myth than looking at a creation.

717
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:05,400
I mean, I feel that we're on clear ground if we look at what has been accomplished.

718
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:10,480
But I think though the what has been accomplished could be something more than one particular

719
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,800
work of art or two.

720
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:17,120
I'm kind of thinking of, I was thinking of this with respect to the issue of climate

721
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:21,760
change and the meetings in Paris in December.

722
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:28,320
And if you followed them at all, you could see that one of the reasons why the COP21

723
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:32,920
meetings succeeded was because of French diplomacy, which one could only say was an

724
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,280
invention, a cultural invention of genius.

725
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,600
It allows people to get together.

726
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:44,920
The contrast was made between the talks in Copenhagen and the talks in Paris where

727
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:49,440
in Copenhagen people couldn't eat good food and the lighting was bad and stuff like that.

728
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,200
But the flexibility of the people in charge at Paris, Laurent Fabius and the woman whose

729
01:07:54,200 --> 01:08:03,680
name I forget and I totally apologize in charge, they mobilized the history of French diplomacy

730
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,760
in order to get everyone as it were around the table.

731
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:15,200
So what can I think of long term accomplishments as being accomplishments of genius that other

732
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:23,200
people can use or not and that exist in a kind of sense that's both beautiful and effective?

733
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:28,880
Shall we go to questions?

734
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:34,120
Sure, let's do that.

735
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:43,920
Just a quick comment as an avid Go player, a state of old night watching the matches,

736
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:50,280
the commentators, I was often referred to AlphaGo, the program as she.

737
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:54,040
I don't know if that was just a particular one person.

738
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,440
But that's what we did.

739
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,440
Thanks.

740
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,440
Just a quick.

741
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,960
Hi, thanks very much.

742
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:08,040
I'm not a professional in the place that you are, but I'm used to thinking of intelligence,

743
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:12,600
those seven categories of emotional intelligence and I'm wondering what if anything you think

744
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,680
about viewing genius in that way.

745
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:24,280
I mean there's almost no mathematical genius versus an artistic genius versus many other

746
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:33,200
different categories of musical genius, is it useful to get at the issue of gender by

747
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:41,600
segmenting achievement through the prism of major fields?

748
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,520
So you're referring to Howard Gardner's idea that there are multiple intelligence and

749
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,520
so forth.

750
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:52,920
Yeah, I mean of course there's a much disputed notion whether to me it makes a lot of sense.

751
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,880
I think the people on the other side of that argument would argue that there is something

752
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,320
that unites spatial intelligence and mathematical intelligence and musical intelligence and

753
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,960
that is the general intelligence factor G, right?

754
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,960
That you can do factor analysis on IQ exams and show correlations between these various

755
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,400
types.

756
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:17,960
I mean personally I think that we all know people who are really good at math and can't

757
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:25,320
talk to other human beings or people who can read out right and it makes intuitive sense

758
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:31,520
to me that there are different styles, intellectual styles and I think this is something that

759
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:37,800
Christabe was hinting at, that there may be something feminine about certain types of

760
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,800
thinking.

761
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:47,280
Again, I'm slightly uncomfortable with this but that was the way she was directed.

762
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:55,960
I think it was useful in rescuing music as a form of intelligence and athletic ability

763
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,680
as a form of intelligence.

764
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:02,520
I mean I would have never, they didn't have that standing before Howard Gardner.

765
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:10,360
Well, Gault actually writes about Rose and wrestlers in his literary genius, yeah.

766
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:15,440
And then there's the Robert Musil's famous line of a racehorse of genius and the man

767
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,680
without equality and so, but nonetheless I think you're right.

768
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,680
And clearly, right?

769
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:25,280
Well, in fact I was thinking just recently that Time magazine did a kind of special

770
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:32,520
issue on genius and Sabrina, thank you, yeah.

771
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,840
The African-American tennis star was on the cover as genius and clearly that kind of spatial

772
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:43,000
sense ability to kind of see the court, you know, this is something that is a kind of

773
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
genius, right?

774
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And I think that kind of superlative ability in a certain kind of culture.

775
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
But I think it worked.

776
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Was that celebrity?

777
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I mean, sorry?

778
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,840
Or was that a question of celebrity that she got on the cover of?

779
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,160
Well, she's won a lot of tournaments, you know.

780
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,160
I'm not saying it's not really good.

781
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:05,120
I mean, that's the difference between genius and saying in this re-emergence of talking

782
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:10,120
about people as geniuses, I'm delighted that she was, you know, they said that but I would

783
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,720
guess that a big part of it was celebrity.

784
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,200
Yeah, I don't know.

785
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,680
I see in a sense a kind of democratization of the categories.

786
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:22,640
Or maybe multiplying the areas in which people can make extraordinary accomplishments.

787
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,920
Which, you know, that might be a positive, African-American woman is major.

788
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,360
Which might be a positive development.

789
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:33,560
But the categorization of certain kinds of genius as more female and others as male,

790
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,560
I think that's a way of making sure that women don't get in some categories.

791
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,560
Okay.

792
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,560
Thank you very much.

793
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:47,440
I hear today a lot of interesting ideas.

794
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:52,120
But I have too many, too much to say.

795
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,320
I try to be very short.

796
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,080
But it's like comment and questions together.

797
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:07,560
First of all, I would like to ask why nobody talked about how destructive people who we

798
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,640
call geniuses could be.

799
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:17,800
For example, especially in art, Medelliani, who was a alcoholic, destroyed his girlfriend,

800
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,120
everything around him.

801
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:27,560
In Stein, who destroyed his first wife, wife with whom he probably started his probability

802
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,560
theory.

803
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:36,600
And a lot of other people who destroyed everything around them would, I would like to be that

804
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:43,560
kind of genius would I would like to drink for whole night to discover yellow color

805
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,560
as Medelliani.

806
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,880
I probably would not.

807
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,880
You see?

808
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:54,440
So it's very, it's one of the questions.

809
01:13:54,440 --> 01:14:04,400
Would it be possible that actually this hierarchical structures, when we put geniuses on the top,

810
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:12,160
would be actually the cause of today global warming today.

811
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:19,600
Catastric, you know, like we should not probably wait for geniuses to solve the trouble.

812
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:28,200
We should recycle and probably we should rebalance the situation and remove this hierarchical

813
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,200
structures.

814
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,920
And then we probably to survive.

815
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:38,440
And if we wait for this, probably we would not for solution.

816
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:45,880
And probably it's not good idea in a neutral artificial intelligence, probably it should

817
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:50,080
be absolutely, I don't know, not different sex.

818
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,840
It's not even connected to sex.

819
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:57,040
You see, it's kind of they don't have sex.

820
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,720
Computer don't have sex.

821
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,720
They are absolutely different.

822
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,320
It's something that absolutely separate from us.

823
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:09,840
I just should put them in this category.

824
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,640
And geniuses actually probably part of the problem.

825
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,600
And we have to rebalance this situation.

826
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,760
I had something else to say, but probably I don't remember maybe.

827
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,760
I completely agree with that.

828
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:28,440
Geniuses in some ways, the category is what gives people permission to misbehave.

829
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:32,600
I wouldn't say that there is something innately about geniuses that is evil.

830
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:37,840
But certainly I doubt that Napoleon questioned people who called him a genius and that was

831
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,800
if anything kind of encouragement for what he thought he was doing.

832
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:47,240
So absolutely the way in which it gives license to people to misbehave and more privileged

833
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:50,400
people even more licensed to misbehave, definitely.

834
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,240
And that's part of the mythology, so it's going way back.

835
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:59,120
And it's a diderot of rights in the Ramos nephew about the kind of relationship between genius

836
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,120
and crime.

837
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:04,560
And there's a famous line there where the genius is like a tall tree that chokes off

838
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,280
the sunlight and shade for the other trees around so you get stunted growth, right?

839
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:15,200
It might be the 19th century that allows people first to be geniuses of crime.

840
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,200
Yeah.

841
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,040
Look in the stories about the tribes.

842
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,040
Mori artes.

843
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,040
Napoleon of crime.

844
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,040
And Napoleon of crime.

845
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,040
Sure.

846
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:31,280
Speaking of geniuses who are misbehaving, there's a gentleman named Kanye West who's

847
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,040
declared himself as a genius.

848
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,040
But one of the ideas that's circling him is that he's not actually a genius, he's a

849
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,040
genius.

850
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,400
He's involved in a middle of a scene.

851
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,200
There's a lot of people that he's connecting with.

852
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,480
They've kind of allowed him to come up and he's become the spokesperson of a larger group

853
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:52,160
of people and you can see the same thing with Steve Jobs and other characters.

854
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:57,120
So I guess the idea is genius just a dumb old word that we don't really need to focus

855
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:02,040
on anymore and more focus on the sinuses because then you can take each individual who's speaking

856
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:08,240
today as their own seniors or as a member of a scene that's bringing something, bringing

857
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:13,560
enlightenment forward to humankind.

858
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,440
I hadn't heard that term as wonderful.

859
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:22,200
That's the idea of being the conductor, the band leader or the empressario or the master

860
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,520
of a studio.

861
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:29,720
So again, going back to the idea that communities actually make the greatest creative contributions

862
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,800
to society.

863
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:40,640
But the way in which that often has to intersect with or develop into an author, that one person

864
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:46,960
is more important in terms of creating that creative ferment, making the product that

865
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,680
is eventually a good viable.

866
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,960
And branding it, getting the copyright and so on.

867
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:59,560
So you're so connected with the culture today and how things are working in Google, et

868
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,840
cetera, et cetera.

869
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:06,400
It just seems like an echo of that and in a way to legitimize it.

870
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,440
But one could argue, I mean you mentioned Darwin before.

871
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:16,320
I think one of the reasons why Darwin wasn't categorized as a genius in the way that Einstein

872
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:20,160
leaders is that people could see clearly what was also true of Einstein.

873
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:27,440
And that is that Darwin was sort of first to the block but only just, right?

874
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,200
He hadn't Wallace and others there.

875
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,600
And if Darwin hadn't come up with a natural selection, it would have been discovered.

876
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,520
So Darwin kind of puts his finger on something that's in the air.

877
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,680
And that's what geniuses always do, right?

878
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,920
And the seniors in this respect does that as well.

879
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:48,680
It sort of becomes a focal point for cultural movement, right?

880
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:52,880
And then brands it individually because that's the way we like to do things in the West.

881
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:58,680
But really it's speaking for a collective or embodying collective movement.

882
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:09,320
The comment before about Hindu goddesses, it inspired me to wonder about the connection

883
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:17,680
between religious movements and secular, the rise of secularism and the emergence of the

884
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:22,920
cult of genius and the re-emergence of genius today.

885
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:33,240
And so far as I wonder if genius is not potentially sort of a replacement for God that, you know-

886
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,440
It's almost a genius.

887
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,520
That's the thesis of my book, Butter, I'd say.

888
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,880
Your first $20 bill is available.

889
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,080
It's going to pay you after.

890
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,080
Genius.

891
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,920
I hope you cited me in your book.

892
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,600
I will now.

893
01:19:49,600 --> 01:20:00,240
And also just in terms of, you know, in a climate of a rise of secularism, society still

894
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:07,760
looks to defer to some sort of authority that if someone is the pinnacle of something, that

895
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:13,560
therefore they are, you know, even if they might be hesitant to accept it, that they

896
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:18,880
acknowledge it, that they are sort of divinely inspired with that.

897
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:25,160
And also the extension of that is that in Western society that, you know, might be, you

898
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:30,080
know, it sort of implied in everything but this, you know, paternalistic, monotheistic

899
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:37,680
idea of God as referred to as a man, that that might be another sort of, you know, undercurrent

900
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:41,320
of why it's so difficult to accept women as genius.

901
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:46,040
But I'm interested to know about what you know of the connection of religion and secularism

902
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,040
in the Institute.

903
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,040
Yeah.

904
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,960
I mean, I wasn't kidding.

905
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:56,600
It's actually the main piece of my book that the cult of genius emerges in effect as a

906
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:03,520
replacement for not only God but for a whole kind of series of mediating beings that in

907
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:07,480
all of human history from the beginning of time had served as kind of intermediary areas

908
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:10,480
between the heavens and the earth, right?

909
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,040
So saints, prophets, apostles.

910
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,880
And this is very clear with somebody like Newton.

911
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:19,720
I mean, in the iconography of Newton, Newton is somebody who can see the mind of God, right?

912
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,600
And we talk about Einstein in this way too.

913
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,560
See into the fabric of the universe, right?

914
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:28,920
See in a prophetic way, in a way that ordinary mortals can't.

915
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,760
And then translate that and give voice to that.

916
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,360
Whereas Newton buried, you know, in Westminster Abbey, right?

917
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,560
So like a saint, literally cultivated like a saint.

918
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:45,280
In fact, there's a whole kind of traffic in the body parts of geniuses in the 19th century

919
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,800
as if they're relics of saints and so forth.

920
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:52,240
And so there are, I think, a lot of ways in which the genius serves or does religious

921
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,240
work.

922
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,320
And in fact, at the beginning of the 20th century, you have German and Austrian sociologists

923
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:01,640
writing about a religion of genius, and somebody was talking about the dark side of genius.

924
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:09,480
Actually, this is a whole nother kind of discussion, but it's very clear that the national socialist

925
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:16,280
and Nazis make use of this kind of genius cult in promoting Hitler as a genius, as,

926
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,360
you know, bizarre as that sounds to us today.

927
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,840
So there are all kinds of things.

928
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,000
And Hitler self-consciously uses this as well.

929
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:29,080
But it seems to be the dark side of this dimension of genius is the fact that it's so pessimistic

930
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,080
about human nature.

931
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:34,360
Because it basically says that humans cannot, are not capable of extraordinary achievement

932
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:38,360
unless there's this sort of weirdly inhuman capacity that they have.

933
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,360
Right, that's true.

934
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,440
That might be widely distributed.

935
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:46,440
And this seems to me kind of defeatist, that we assume that human beings cannot actually

936
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:53,080
be creative and extraordinarily devoted to certain kinds of tasks and problem solving.

937
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,480
And that has to belong to a tiny minority of people who are bizarre.

938
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,480
Right, monstrous.

939
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:00,480
Why do we have to think of humanity as being defined that way?

940
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,440
Why can't we think of achievement again in more collective terms?

941
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:08,440
And as being more evenly distributed through humanity, that would be, I think, a more optimistic

942
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,440
idea of the race.

943
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:16,400
And I just wonder also, though, it seems that we're sort of setting up the 19th century

944
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:24,800
and modern, you know, the 21st century, essentially, as two points in, you know, significant times

945
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,200
in genius.

946
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:32,960
And you referred to sort of, you know, the period which I assume is essentially the 20th

947
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,160
century, although you just cited the rise of Hitler.

948
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:44,160
So, but I wonder if, you know, when you talk about the, the retraction in the 20th century,

949
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:48,120
if you're referring mostly to the academic sphere, if you're referring to society at

950
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:53,760
large, and if so, you know, if you might speak to the religious sort of frame of what's going

951
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,960
on in the 20th century, by contrast to the 19th century.

952
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,360
Yeah, I mean, huge subject.

953
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:06,280
But I think the short answer would be the genius cult is extremely strong in Europe and

954
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,680
in this country until the Second World War.

955
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:12,920
And after the Second World War, for a whole variety of reasons, part of it's being linked

956
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:20,240
to the Nazi cult and also the kind of the cult around Stalin and Lenin as geniuses and

957
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:25,120
other totalitarian regimes used, linked to eugenics and so forth.

958
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,840
What I call the religion of genius loses its appeal.

959
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,520
In some ways Einstein is the last kind of figure who occupies this space.

960
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:38,080
And even to, I mean, Steve Jobs plays the part well enough.

961
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,200
I mean, he's eccentric and, you know, he's prone to outbursts and so forth.

962
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,920
But no one really thinks that he can kind of speak the voice of God, right?

963
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,840
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong about that.

964
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:49,840
Which God?

965
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,960
Yeah, exactly.

966
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,240
That he's sort of divinely enchanted and possessed.

967
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:01,120
And so I think that, you know, in that respect you see kind of falling off of the religion

968
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,600
of genius in the second part of the 20th century.

969
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,600
And I don't think that's back today.

970
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,120
I mean, what's going on today is different I think.

971
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:16,640
But you do, I'm sorry, you do almost see a homogenous mass of people with as few special

972
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:19,680
people on top which is a part of the issue.

973
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:26,600
And you know, it might be worthwhile to recuperate a kind of English sense of difference, that

974
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,120
sense of eccentricity.

975
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:35,640
And a more of a celebration of eccentricity is something that's valuable in a society.

976
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:41,040
John Stuart Mill makes a lot of this as a notion of the importance of tolerating people who

977
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,960
have behaviors that are not comfortable with ours.

978
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:44,960
It could be-

979
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:45,960
Not just tolerating people.

980
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,000
It's genius as he's worried about and on liberty.

981
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,720
I mean, that's why you have-

982
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,600
What do you mean worried about?

983
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:57,680
He sees modern democracy, you know, undermining the foundations for the creation of genius.

984
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,240
Those special people that make all of human history.

985
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:06,920
True, but he also argues in terms of the exact word eccentricity which I think is slightly

986
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,120
different than genius.

987
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:15,080
And he says that it's important to allow for eccentricity because we don't know what that

988
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:20,040
person's odd solution might be, we might need that in the future.

989
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,520
I see that in-

990
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:28,120
I'm seeing that in a greater cultural context of English eccentricity which allows for

991
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:32,960
difference but without sort of we all are this way.

992
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:39,640
It allows for meritocracy but also allows for democracy because the presumption isn't

993
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:41,800
that there's a few select and a-

994
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,720
And, you know, massive knocked.

995
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:47,800
I mean, we'll go back to the genius thing but eccentricity I think is an important concept

996
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,560
that might go back to that.

997
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,680
Which is closely linked to genius as well in tradition.

998
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,640
Yeah, yeah, but it isn't.

999
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,640
Go ahead.

1000
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:55,640
Okay.

1001
01:26:55,640 --> 01:27:04,640
So, I love the idea of allowing yourself to misbehave.

1002
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:11,080
And I think that's a key to genius because good girls have to-

1003
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:14,680
Good girls do which is not make- not make a mess.

1004
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,200
I mean, you can't collect stuff.

1005
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:22,000
You have to have- your brother has to have the bigger room and girls have to defer to

1006
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
guys.

1007
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:28,320
So, I think there's a gender called for bias against women being genius.

1008
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,240
You have an expectation.

1009
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:34,440
You mentioned- it's so funny when you were talking about Mendelssohn's-

1010
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:37,200
I couldn't remember her name.

1011
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,640
Yeah, of course.

1012
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,320
And I thought, I can't write Mendelssohn's sister.

1013
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:42,320
What's wrong with it?

1014
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,680
You have to say who she is.

1015
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:51,720
And I believe that genius and identity, self-identity, self-awareness, are basically culturally

1016
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:56,560
transmitted more, more, more, much more than genetically.

1017
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,120
And I love that idea going back to permission, permission.

1018
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,560
You have to give yourself permission to take yourself seriously.

1019
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:11,640
Also, skipping forward to the idea of the misfit and the holy fool, which is somebody

1020
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:17,520
who can say the truth to the king, like King Lear's holy fool stuff.

1021
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:24,160
I would love to see plays, classics where women are given the role of King Lear.

1022
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,800
So, let's see what she does with King Lear.

1023
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,120
You know, Meryl Streep?

1024
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:32,560
Instead of acting like the fool that she's going to be coming out with a new movie on

1025
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:38,440
this woman who couldn't sing, of course, Meryl Streep has a beautiful voice.

1026
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:41,320
But I want to see Meryl Streep and as King Lear.

1027
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:47,080
You know, let's put on different costumes and give ourselves permission to be just outrageously

1028
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,080
fantastic.

1029
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,080
Thank you.

1030
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,080
One more, yes.

1031
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,080
Okay.

1032
01:28:51,080 --> 01:29:02,360
So, I think this actually, from my point of view, the biggest problem is that we have

1033
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:12,240
to feed in male-dominated structures that was developed and created by male-dominated

1034
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,240
civilization.

1035
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:25,920
And even first group that established itself oppose male-dominated structures like feminists,

1036
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,840
they're extremely hierarchical.

1037
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:34,800
For example, when I came to United States, I discovered that I'm not enough feminist,

1038
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,080
although I'm a woman.

1039
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,080
You see?

1040
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:50,320
So, it's kind of these, the whole structure of society and lead to development of the

1041
01:29:50,320 --> 01:30:01,120
leaders and like something that we have, like houses that we have to direct ourselves.

1042
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:11,400
And would you think that without, without, we could solve our problems without changing

1043
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,760
all these structures because they're extremely powerful.

1044
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:17,560
You cannot, you cannot remove them.

1045
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:20,720
You see, you have to feed them.

1046
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,720
Right.

1047
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:27,120
Well, that's where, what, what greater good could we do?

1048
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:31,120
Would it be by making women geniuses equal to men?

1049
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:35,000
Would it be by getting rid of the category of genius altogether?

1050
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,920
I mean, which would accomplish the greatest good for society?

1051
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:42,360
I kind of think the latter, but that may be a minority opinion.

1052
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:48,400
I just think that doing away with that extremely hierarchical designation of some people at

1053
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:54,000
the expense of others, that's probably the bigger accomplishment than trying to get women

1054
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,400
equally into the ranks of the tiny minority at the top.

1055
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,480
I just question, what would be accomplished by doing that?

1056
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:04,200
In part because I think too, the way that geniuses function historically, you mentioned

1057
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:08,440
this earlier, Joyce, is that the dominant discourse that wins out in the 18th century

1058
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:11,120
is that geniuses is born not made.

1059
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:15,720
That you don't acquire genius, you can't learn genius, that learning genius is somehow

1060
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,360
inferior, right?

1061
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,160
That's talent, but not genius.

1062
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:23,280
And therefore, genius doesn't need institutions.

1063
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:28,720
Genius doesn't need good schools and early exposure to reading and so on and so forth,

1064
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:33,840
all the things that are necessary to cultivate human capital in a democratic way, because

1065
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,240
genius always transcends that, right?

1066
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:41,240
And so the discourse then takes our attention away from institutions.

1067
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,480
So we see that now.

1068
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,720
A kind of intellectual 1% will do everything for us in that.

1069
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:51,960
But we see that now in the disaster of the SAT tests, which were designed to find the

1070
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:59,520
geniuses or the talented people outside of a small, well-educated family elite.

1071
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:08,920
But in fact, of course, as we all know, to do well, one almost has to take a lesson,

1072
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:13,480
take a test, take a bat, unless you were two of my siblings who get eight hundreds without

1073
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,480
being tutored.

1074
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,000
There are some people, but it doesn't work.

1075
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,560
It doesn't work to have that test defined, you three geniuses or you three talented people,

1076
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:25,560
no matter what your upbringing is.

1077
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:26,560
We just know it doesn't.

1078
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:33,560
But McCartney, genius of work, is it responsible?

1079
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,560
It's interesting.

1080
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,560
You know, I think it's a historical discourse.

1081
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,560
Does it do good for gen divisions or for us collectively?

1082
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:41,560
Yeah, exactly.

1083
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:42,560
Yes, right.

1084
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,560
So we don't get enough questions.

1085
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,560
We think they're stupid and ridiculous.

1086
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:45,560
You have a question?

1087
01:32:45,560 --> 01:33:05,600
I think occasionally you've come close to this other category of genius, but no one seems

1088
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,560
to have mentioned it.

1089
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:16,120
Geniuses is an ontologically suspect notion.

1090
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:23,040
It's something that only exists in society.

1091
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,680
And that's where the definition really needs to be.

1092
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:30,200
We need to follow with through society.

1093
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:36,360
In other words, you're consciously that way.

1094
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:50,800
It seems to me that it's this need for a savior, which is really one of the foundations of

1095
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,400
that.

1096
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:59,000
And I think it potentially explains a lot about the notion.

1097
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,760
Certainly not everything.

1098
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:06,960
And I would like to share more about that.

1099
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:07,960
Religion is your department.

1100
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:08,960
Yeah, I know.

1101
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:09,960
But since it's understood.

1102
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:10,960
I don't think...

1103
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:17,920
Well, the savior aspect, I think, goes back to that divine sense that, again, someone

1104
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,760
who is superhuman does work that the rest of us cannot do.

1105
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,920
I want to be a little bit more specific.

1106
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:35,760
In other words, it has to do, in other words, a genius arises when we need someone to resolve

1107
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,400
a crisis.

1108
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:43,200
And it may be a real crisis, or it may be just a perceived crisis.

1109
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:50,680
It seems to me one of the most recent genius that I can think of is Andy Warhol, who saw...

1110
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,680
What crisis did he solve?

1111
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:59,480
Who solved a right, an artistic crisis.

1112
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:03,480
One of the second crises as well.

1113
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,480
True.

1114
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,320
He was a genius in that way.

1115
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:12,440
Yeah, I mean, there's no question that, I mean, from the early 19th century, geniuses

1116
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:20,840
are spoken of as redemptive figures who suffer and sacrifice for the whole.

1117
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:24,800
And this is part of the mythology of genius in the romantic period, and then going forward,

1118
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:34,280
that geniuses are often despised by society because they're so far ahead of the times

1119
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,800
that they can't be understood and appreciated.

1120
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:42,880
So they suffer in silence, and yet they're working for the redemption or the betterment

1121
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:43,880
of humanity.

1122
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:49,840
And so you get the call to figure like Tasso, the Renaissance poet, right, who's institutionalized

1123
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,800
as a mad man because society can't understand his genius.

1124
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:59,360
This is, you know, the Alan Turing film kind of plays on that idea too, of the genius

1125
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:07,080
who was literally persecuted, right, for his eccentricity, for his strangeness, his queerness

1126
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:11,320
in this case, right, being different, being literally being gay.

1127
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:15,760
But also because the society of the time cannot understand him.

1128
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:22,080
Also geniuses suffer become martyrs, la Martine, the French poet says that all genius is modern,

1129
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,840
as a martyr to Janier Martier.

1130
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:30,480
And there is no question that that's part of the discourse becomes very self-energious.

1131
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:37,360
But I think what's being said is that, if I understand you correctly, that in a sense,

1132
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:42,160
someone has to solve a problem before they're acknowledged kind of as the genius.

1133
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:46,640
I mean, we can even think of the 19th century there, Victor Hugo is a genius, but he has

1134
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:49,440
solved artistic problems.

1135
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,680
He's solved political problems.

1136
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:57,920
He's solved the problems of rallying a certain group of French people around a certain idea

1137
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:02,560
about democracy and Napoleon, about the nation itself.

1138
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,720
And he embodies a people, right?

1139
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:05,720
Yeah.

1140
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:06,720
And whom he's regenerating.

1141
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:13,080
So that's another, the person who has solved the problem, whatever it is, has that, is

1142
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:18,400
given the license of being the genius, as opposed to seven-year-old Victor Hugo.

1143
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,400
Sure.

1144
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:24,120
But there's also a historical mismatch that there are plenty of crises that never get

1145
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:25,120
solved.

1146
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:28,120
The genius or the savior never appears.

1147
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:32,640
Also I think, again, this scenario is very gendered.

1148
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:36,680
The suffering savior is the genius figure, tends to be male.

1149
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:40,640
Women are just supposed to suffer, so it doesn't necessarily play out in the same way.

1150
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:41,640
Yeah.

1151
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,880
No, there's no question.

1152
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:44,880
Okay.

1153
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,120
Thank you very much.

1154
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:47,120
Thank you.

1155
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:52,320
You want to end on that note?

1156
01:37:52,320 --> 01:38:05,320
Oops.

1157
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:10,320
Pardon?

1158
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:15,320
Yes.

1159
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:31,000
Is she speaking indistinctly?
