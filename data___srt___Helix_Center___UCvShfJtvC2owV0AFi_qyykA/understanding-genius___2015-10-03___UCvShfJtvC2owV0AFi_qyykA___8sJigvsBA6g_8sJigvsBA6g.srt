What is the, you're doing the Oxford Handbook as well, right?

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,800
Sort of the, I'm in the last box or a handbook.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Okay, we're going to get started.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,600

And now for today's program Understanding Genius, when I announce your name, please raise your

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,040
hand just so the audience will recognize you.

Davis.

37
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Unfortunately, Joanne Ruth Sats from Ohio State, who was scheduled to be here, was unable

38
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,760
to join us because of the inclement weather which canceled her flight.

39
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,040
So we'll begin now.

40
00:02:52,040 --> 00:03:00,040
How do we begin?

41
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,480
Genius just emerged just like that.

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,760
Well, that is a long-running theory that genius is spontaneous.

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,440
And I think that researchers here would probably argue that's not the case, that genius often

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
takes a lot of work.

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,220
That Edison, when he said that genius is 99 percent perspiration and 1 percent imping

46
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,120
inspiration was more on to truth.

47
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,200
And yet it's interesting that we seem to like that idea, the idea of the apple falling

48
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,800
and Newton just discovering the law of gravity like that even though we know he worked 18

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
hour a day.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,440
In fact, when Newton was asked, how do you come up with all these great ideas?

51
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,760
He just says, I ponder a lot.

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,040
And it's not just the amount of work they put in, thinking over and over and over again

53
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,640
about whatever obsesses them, but they make a tremendous amount of mistakes along the

54
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
way.

55
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,800
You know, there's all these fault starts because a lot of times you don't see it because either

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:12,800
it's not published or if it's art, it ends up in the basement in storage or some of the

57
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
kind of things.

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
So it's filtered.

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:21,720
But even in Albert Einstein, who's like a prototype, all these horrendous errors, particularly

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,560
in developing this unified, yeah, unified field theory.

61
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,960
There was a good book that was out a couple of years ago called Einstein's Mistakes.

62
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,880
And it's about just this, the creative errors that one makes on the way to truth.

63
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
And you have to do it.

64
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,080
And he even justified it.

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,240
He says mistakes and signs are okay as long as they're big enough.

66
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,840
I'll tell your students that.

67
00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:00,520
I think it's worth clarifying that humans like narrative and simple stories.

68
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,280
And so often we attach achievement or results to an individual when in fact there are quite

69
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,600
a few people who contributed.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,000
So it's, I think that is not to say that I don't believe that there are geniuses in

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the world.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There certainly are.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,800
But the true story is almost undoubtedly more complicated than the one that we're familiar

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
with.

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
All right.

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,240
And it's even true for someone like Albert Einstein.

77
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,760
At the very beginning, when he was a nobody, he used his first wife as kind of a sounding

78
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,920
board for a lot of his ideas.

79
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,440
And some people even say that she probably contributed more in particular to special

80
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,360
theory relativity than she got credit for.

81
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,400
They made a deal when they got divorced that he would get the award and she would get the

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
money.

83
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:50,200
And a lot of people realize that later on, he's like, oh, I'm sorry.

84
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,880
He got in over his head mathematically.

85
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,360
And so had to take on mathematical collaborators, he wouldn't have been able to develop his

86
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,520
later theories.

87
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,520
And later on when he was working on his general relativity, he got into a kind of a contest

88
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,240
with an distinguished mathematician, Pong Karate.

89
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,120
And it was really kind of close for a while because he didn't have the mathematical ability

90
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,280
to do what he needed to do.

91
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:26,020
And something we said about the differentiation between collaboration and inspiration and

92
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:33,880
and the subsequent aspiration of I'm thinking of, you know, fifth century Athens or Elizabethan

93
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:43,440
England, or Renaissance Florence where it didn't necessarily have, I mean, there were some

94
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,240
collaborations but the emergence of these geniuses on multiple fronts.

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,120
that there's something also about the inspiration?

96
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,040
I think there are special moments in history

97
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,120
where either the cultural background is particularly conducive

98
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,160
to some kind of breakthrough, or in the case of science,

99
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,280
what is often the case is you have theoreticians

100
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,560
who have ideas, but the experimental technology is not there

101
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,200
to test those ideas.

102
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,720
So for example, today we have a lot of people working

103
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,840
on things like string theory, which are,

104
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,040
to this moment, actually completely untested by experiment.

105
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,520
And it may turn out when we look back 1,000 years from now,

106
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,280
we may say, hey, these guys were geniuses,

107
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,680
and they developed a full theory of quantum gravity

108
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,600
with no experimental input.

109
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,520
Or it might be 1,000 years from now, people look back

110
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,880
and have completely forgotten about string theory.

111
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,160
Einstein was lucky because his theories were tested very soon

112
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,440
after he made them.

113
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,600
And they were both conceptually deep and broad breakthroughs,

114
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,000
but they were also verified as true very soon afterward.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,440
And that's why he has become such a singular history,

116
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,120
a singular figure in the history of genius.

117
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,320
They were verified and publicized too,

118
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,720
and I think that's critical.

119
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:59,480
It's in 1917, 12 years after the Anis Morabulous of 1905.

120
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Right, Stissen.

121
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,000
Why are there five of us?

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
It seems to me as we go down.

123
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
All right.

124
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Man.

125
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
Thank you.

126
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,440
And the voice.

127
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,920
OK.

128
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,360
It's 12 years after he's done his major work,

129
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,560
and yet it's publicly announced and verified.

130
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,440
And it's then in 1917 when he becomes this kind of world

131
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,960
saint, really, all over the world.

132
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,480
And he's the only genius that we really have access

133
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,160
to his brain.

134
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,280
So that's not true.

135
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,480
Well, we start harvesting brains in the 19th century,

136
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,440
and there are all kinds of bits and pieces of geniuses.

137
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,680
It's been bones and even a penises.

138
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,280
It's been studied very deliberately, I guess.

139
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,240
So we've had bits and pieces of Einstein's brain,

140
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,360
and people are very fascinated with it.

141
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
We have Lenin's brain, and other brains as well.

142
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,760
But it's been studied and made slowly accessible.

143
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,320
And people are fascinated by this brain.

144
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,360
What is in this head that makes this individual so remarkable?

145
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,480
And I was talking with a friend earlier,

146
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,880
when they looked into his brain, it

147
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,840
was rather unremarkable when they first looked at it.

148
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,280
It was somewhat smaller than the average human brain

149
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,240
even for a person his age until people started

150
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,800
remarking on it and finding these unusual bits and pieces

151
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,200
that were a bit different than other brains.

152
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,400
I would have had lateral, exceptional lateral connectivity

153
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,120
between left and right, or is that just, is that apocryphal?

154
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,160
It's a bit apocryphal.

155
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,400
I mean, they have one of the first studies

156
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,800
they looked at his angular gyrus.

157
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,760
And they started looking at the number of glial cells

158
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,440
versus neurons in his angular gyrus.

159
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,200
And Widdlson, I believe, found that there

160
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,320
hired glial ratio to neuron ratio.

161
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,520
They had a bit of his frontal lobe, his brain,

162
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,800
I don't know if people know this,

163
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,880
but his brain was cut up into little cubes.

164
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,640
Soon after his death, he died of aortyl aneurysm.

165
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,040
So his brain was relatively preserved from his untimely death

166
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,280
and cut up his brain in little cubes and sent them around.

167
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,920
He had a piece of his frontal cortex

168
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,840
and a piece of his parietal cortex.

169
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,960
And they took a look at it and they

170
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,240
found that his frontal cortex wasn't particularly

171
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,520
unusual in terms of neural-to-wheel ratio,

172
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,920
but part of his angular gyrus was unusual.

173
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,360
Parts of his corpus callosum are unusual in terms

174
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,200
of its connectivity.

175
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,520
People have looked at that.

176
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,440
His motor cortex has a knob on it,

177
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,320
which they have hypothesized is involved with his violin

178
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,440
playing.

179
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,160
But does this have anything to do with genius at all?

180
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,000
You know, it's worth, I always like to point out

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
that Einstein left explicit instructions in his will

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,880
that in no part of his body would be left behind.

183
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,640
And so it was taken without knowledge of that will,

184
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,400
but against his will, by this a very amusing man who

185
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,640
kept the brain in a beer cooler for a while and drove it

186
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,120
in the back of his Pontiac around the country.

187
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,200
But that kind of fascination with the body parts of genius

188
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,840
actually has a long history, as I say.

189
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,400
Or other saints for that matter, as you indicate.

190
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,920
Exactly.

191
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
And that in itself says something interesting

192
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,880
that we want to put our fingers on the genius part.

193
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,200
And frankly, I think it's a little silly.

194
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,000
I mean, I don't know about the brain science here,

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
but my understanding is that the effort

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,480
to locate Einstein's genius in his brain is kind of just silly.

197
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,000
Sometimes you end up with this thing

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,920
like happened with the phrenologists.

199
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,960
Because they were the, some people even say

200
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,800
that modern cognitive science is the neo-phrenology.

201
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,840
You're trying to find where and the brain genius is located

202
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,560
or inside of the book or whatever.

203
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,320
And way back in the early day of the phrenology,

204
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,360
they analyzed it.

205
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,840
Did Saint kind of postmortem.

206
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,280
OK.

207
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,000
Only it was easier.

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He didn't have to have the brain tissue.

209
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He just had to have the skull and the uro.

210
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,280
And this guy, I forget who it was,

211
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,120
the early phrenologists pointed out,

212
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,080
it might actually think all.

213
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,840
I don't know.

214
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,080
Pointed out that the area of the cranium

215
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,240
that is responsible for mathematical ability

216
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,000
in Descartes was actually depressed instead of bumped out.

217
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,520
And so they argued on the base of that negative evidence

218
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,040
that his mathematical ability must be tremendously

219
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,800
overestimated.

220
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,880
It's not clear that what purports to be Descartes skull

221
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
is even his skull that's returned to France

222
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,600
and different privileges.

223
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,720
So there is this fascination of trying to understand.

224
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,520
I mean, so your intelligence, your creativity,

225
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,800
all of these things arise in your brain, at least in part.

226
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,240
So trying to understand the complexity

227
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,280
of that relationship between brain and behavior

228
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,040
is certainly a worthy endeavor.

229
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,680
But looking at the corpus callosum or the motor strip

230
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,720
or the angular gyrus is going to be fraught

231
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,360
with a phrenological types of underpinnings.

232
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,720
You're not talking at all about IQ.

233
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,640
So you are separating genius from IQ?

234
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,000
We could talk about IQ.

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah.

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah.

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,720
Well, no, I just, I mean, one more

238
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
that thought you would say, well, somebody

239
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,240
who has an IQ of 100 and something or other

240
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,600
is considered the genius.

241
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,160
But you're not going there at all.

242
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
I'll talk about that.

243
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,660
Yeah.

244
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,360
We can all do it.

245
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
We can all do it.

246
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
What?

247
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
You might go, you might.

248
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,360
I suspect we're using the term to mean someone who

249
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,080
has achieved something great.

250
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,640
And so there are many people who have high IQs who do not

251
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,960
achieve great things.

252
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,240
However, the probability that someone

253
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,560
will achieve something great, I think,

254
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,760
is monotonically increasing with IQ.

255
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,080
And if you test eminent scientists, randomly selected

256
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,640
eminent scientists, you will find that they

257
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,240
tend to have very high IQs.

258
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,760
But of course, nothing in human life is deterministic.

259
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,040
So there are plenty of people who are seven feet tall

260
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,640
and are not going to play in the NBA.

261
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,880
But the fraction of seven footers in the US

262
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,160
who play in the NBA is exceptionally high.

263
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,520
I just say one thing.

264
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,600
I teach the history of psychology,

265
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,280
and I have a little section on this.

266
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,720
It's really kind of upsetting to me

267
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,280
what happened to the term genius.

268
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,440
I mean, it was originally designed

269
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,440
to refer to outstanding achievement.

270
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,920
And then there was this guy at Stanford University

271
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,960
named Lewis M. Turner, who decided

272
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,320
he was going to do this massive longitudinal study of high IQ

273
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,800
kids.

274
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,120
That's obviously these kids were little kids, boys and girls.

275
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,680
So you can't talk about outstanding achievement.

276
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,200
And follow him all the way through adulthood.

277
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,760
And he called this genetic studies of genius.

278
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,920
Genic by weight can also mean developmental, not a study.

279
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
You know, heredity.

280
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,560
And termites.

281
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,480
What?

282
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
It's termites.

283
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,000
It's termite.

284
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,160
Yeah, it's termite.

285
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,280
And the thing is, is that he had

286
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,200
to pick an arbitrary selection criteria.

287
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,640
So he picked 140.

288
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,920
And if you look at a lot of dictionaries,

289
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,960
like the Barrican Heritage Dictionary,

290
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,880
they say a genius of someone who has an IQ of 140 or above.

291
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,000
That was a totally arbitrary decision.

292
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,960
It could have been 136 or 152 at 0.1.

293
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,600
And in fact, none of the kids who

294
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,800
passed the threshold of 141, the Nobel Prize,

295
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,360
there were two physicists who just missed qualifying

296
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,200
Shockley and Lewis Alvarez, who did win the Nobel Prize.

297
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,760
Now, there's some claim that the test that was used

298
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,240
was primarily verbally loaded.

299
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
And these two were much stronger mathematically.

300
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,400
And probably would have qualified had

301
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,920
to use a slightly different kind of IQ test.

302
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,720
But so a lot of people will use the fact

303
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,960
that none of the termites won the Nobel Prize

304
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,840
as evidence that IQ has nothing to do with achievement.

305
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,320
But that is completely wrong, actually.

306
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,000
It's also interesting that two of the termites grew up

307
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,680
and ended up being professors at Stanford University.

308
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,920
And they took over this longitudinal study

309
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,040
that was still continuing.

310
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,280
So they became subjects in their own.

311
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,480
It reflects full interpretation.

312
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,680
And Terman's study, I mean, it was incredibly flawed.

313
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,600
He got involved with the two.

314
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,200
He wrote letters for them.

315
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,320
Yeah, he wrote letters of recommendation for them.

316
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,640
So I mean, it was a horribly flawed study

317
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,880
from that perspective as well.

318
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,120
There's incredibly biased, experimental bias.

319
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,960
There's a more modern variance of the Terman's study,

320
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,920
which is still ongoing, called, there's

321
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,360
two variants of it, SMPY and SVPY,

322
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,000
study of mathematically or verbally precocious youth.

323
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,520
And probably some of the children of people

324
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,600
in this room are in the study.

325
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,960
But if you score above a certain level by the age of 13,

326
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,560
you're admitted to this study.

327
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,160
And the oldest people in the study now,

328
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,960
I think, are in their 50s.

329
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,440
And so you can ask, well, as the IQ gets higher and higher,

330
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,200
does the probability of some level of achievement increase?

331
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,800
And so you can, for example, show

332
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,880
that someone who's at the 1 in 10,000 level of ability

333
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,440
is many times more likely to have a patent at age of 45

334
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,920
than someone who was only in the top 1%.

335
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,440
So there's no diminishing returns to intelligence,

336
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,280
even as you get to the 1 in 10,000 level of ability.

337
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,000
Probability being tenured at a major research university,

338
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,440
also monotonically increasing.

339
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,120
So even within what we would consider already very high

340
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,720
scores, top 1%, as you go from top 1% to top 1 in 10,000,

341
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,120
there are significant differences in those populations.

342
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,800
And the major thing about that study,

343
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,520
unlike what happened in the terming one,

344
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,400
is they actually got people who we would consider geniuses.

345
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,040
For example, they have field's medalists.

346
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,560
I don't think they have medalists.

347
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,640
Terence Tau is in it.

348
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,040
Yeah, good example of that.

349
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,800
Absolutely outstanding.

350
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,160
And also interesting, because one of the issues

351
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,120
that sometimes arises when you talk about geniuses,

352
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,440
mad geniuses, and Terence Tau is just totally normal guy.

353
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,400
Well, if you met Terence, you would say he clearly is not

354
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,000
a, he's a little bit on the aspect of his side.

355
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,040
But for someone that smart, he is very normal.

356
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,120
Yeah, I would put it that way.

357
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
I should have called about it.

358
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Yeah.

359
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:12,560
You know, you said we're talking about Q,

360
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,600
but just to link up what we were talking about earlier,

361
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
brain studies, cranial studies, IQ.

362
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,760
When the IQ exam is developed in the 1890s in France by a man

363
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,480
by the name of Paul B. A.

364
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,560
And it's Lewis Turman, who takes that research

365
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,640
and sort of instrumentalizes it.

366
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,080
B. A was actually a very interested in cranial studies

367
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,280
as well.

368
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,480
And I see that IQ exam is kind of growing out

369
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,560
of this long 90th century attempt to locate genius.

370
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,920
And some of that research, I think, should give us real pause.

371
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,040
It's not coincidental that Turman was an anti-Semite

372
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,800
that he had unsaved reviews about race.

373
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,000
He was an acolyte of Francis Galton,

374
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,160
who was an important scientist, the nephew of Charles Darwin.

375
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,400
His first book is entitled, Hereditary Genius,

376
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,320
and who's very interested in how to identify genius

377
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,680
in population pools, but who's also the father of eugenics

378
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,120
as people in the room will know.

379
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,880
So it's sort of just worth pointing out

380
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,840
those connections, those long-fhelial connections.

381
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,360
That's not to cast IQ out of the discussion by any means,

382
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,880
but there's a dark history there, too.

383
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Yeah.

384
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,200
Yeah.

385
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,840
And even manifest in the Turman's study,

386
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,240
because you mentioned Shockley.

387
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,280
He really resented that he didn't have an IQ higher now.

388
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,640
He spent the rest of his life resenting it.

389
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,760
And basically stealing the transistor idea for some colleagues.

390
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,920
I mean, I'm not sure he stole it, but he took more credit

391
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,120
than with his teacher.

392
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,480
But he got one up in the end, because he contributed

393
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,640
to sperm to the Nobel Prize sperm bank.

394
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,840
Right, right.

395
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,360
Right.

396
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,680
He'll have more more to say later.

397
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,160
And he ended up doing in line with the tradition,

398
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,720
going back to Galton, started arguing about superior

399
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
and inferior races as well.

400
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,240
Yeah.

401
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,240
But I would say to some extent, we live in Galton and Turman's

402
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,400
world today, even though we don't think about it anymore.

403
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,000
So long ago, we would not have thought

404
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,640
that we could use standardized tests to filter talent

405
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,600
or to allow access to valuable educational resources.

406
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,680
But this is exactly what we do in our society.

407
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,040
So if you want to get into MIT, you

408
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,280
have to do quite well in the standardized test,

409
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,880
which are essentially IQ tests.

410
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,200
And so American society is quite ordered, in some sense,

411
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,440
along achievement lines on these exams.

412
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,560
And if you go to places like Japan or China

413
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,520
where admission to college is based on a single exam,

414
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,720
again, you have a society that's actually filtering based

415
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,360
on brain power and then allowing those people who

416
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,000
have, above average, ability more access

417
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,080
to educational resources.

418
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,680
It's going to lead us meritocracy.

419
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Well, yeah.

420
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,200
And it is interesting that the United States adopted

421
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,280
use of these kind of standardized exams very quickly

422
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,520
and took to it much more aggressively than other countries.

423
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,960
In the front of Europe, say, that's

424
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,440
something that American society has to say,

425
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,680
a kind of elitist meritocracy.

426
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
I don't disagree with you.

427
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,600
But if you look at how admission to a cold normal superior

428
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,440
or a cold polytechnic in France, it's even more elitist

429
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,040
than what we have here.

430
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,360
It's much more elitist.

431
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,640
It's much more elitist.

432
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,520
So in fact, it's not fair to tar Americans only

433
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,240
with this brush.

434
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,280
In Japan and China and Korea, same thing.

435
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,880
There is a Gao Kao or high exam that you take when you leave

436
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,400
high school.

437
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,560
And if you do well in it, you go to Beijing University.

438
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
And if you don't, then.

439
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,520
Well, China has had the civil service.

440
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,560
1,000 years, 1,000 years.

441
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,640
I'm talking about the type of exam.

442
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,200
I mean, to get into the cold normal superior,

443
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,400
you do the cany and you do a whole set of exams.

444
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,240
It's not an exam that like IQ at all.

445
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,600
It's based on content.

446
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,120
All right.

447
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,080
And that's a different method.

448
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,040
And there's another interesting thing that happened to IQ

449
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,560
is that the original conception of intelligence

450
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,200
when Benet was working on it was actually much broader.

451
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,640
He was looking at mental retardation.

452
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,560
Yeah, exactly.

453
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,200
He actually started looking at the lower end for special education.

454
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,200
He was interested in artificial education.

455
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,080
And also, the items were much broader.

456
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,760
He was just looking at what are the kind of things

457
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,920
that kids are able to do as they mature intellectually.

458
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,720
And so I'm hoping who might need additional help

459
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,560
to succeed in an educational environment.

460
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,360
And then it got kind of inverted.

461
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,720
It was actually term inverted because he went from studying

462
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,000
people who were on a lower end to people on the upper end.

463
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,720
And part of that also was narrowed

464
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,920
because of the emphasis on increased reliability of the test.

465
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,440
So what you do is to increase the reliability,

466
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,120
you have to throw out the items to have lower correlations

467
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,360
with the overall score.

468
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:49,880
And guess what?

469
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,440
When you throw out those items, they

470
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,400
have to do with things like creativity

471
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,800
and moral decision making or things that

472
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,440
aren't part of intelligence, obviously.

473
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,160
I think that's a very important point.

474
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,800
So when you're measuring analytic ability

475
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,600
or some kind of very well-defined intelligence,

476
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,960
then it can roughly, crudely, be measured by these IQ tests.

477
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,480
Things like creativity, ability to work well with other people,

478
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,320
ability to inspire other people.

479
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,600
Those have never been things that we've

480
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,680
been able to measure to operationalize in a reliable way

481
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,200
in tests.

482
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,960
And therefore, they get de-emphasized in ours.

483
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,480
I always disagree.

484
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,160
So they're getting better with measures of creativity,

485
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,840
creative achievement questionnaires, reliable and validated

486
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,680
measure, and personality is getting much, much better

487
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,920
at measuring particular personality variables.

488
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,960
So IQ is the gold standard that they can measure better

489
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,720
than height in the doctor's office, believe it or not.

490
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,400
But it is an incredibly reliable and validated standard

491
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,040
to shoot for, but creativity measures and personality

492
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,800
measures are getting better.

493
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,040
The problem with personality, so it

494
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,160
is very difficult to cheat on an IQ test.

495
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,280
Because to cheat, you'd have to be smart.

496
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
But you can cheat on a personality test.

497
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,320
Because I can imagine my sociopathic friend

498
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,400
and say, I'll answer the way he would answer.

499
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,160
I'll answer it right.

500
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,360
I'll answer it pro-social ways so that I can get this job.

501
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,000
So that's the problem with personality tests.

502
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,240
Although I agree, they do have validity and reliability

503
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,520
as well.

504
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
If I can tell you how to cheat right now,

505
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,560
the personality variable that correlates most strongly

506
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,320
with creativity in a wide range of areas

507
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,040
is the openness to experience.

508
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,480
OK, so you already know how to answer all the questions.

509
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,080
That's the time to ask you.

510
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,720
Are you interested in trying to see

511
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,440
all these people in this room are open to new experience,

512
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,680
because they're here by definition.

513
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,480
Guaranteed.

514
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,440
Yeah, I want to go to poetry readings.

515
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,920
Do I want to go see art?

516
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,040
Do I want to try new food?

517
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,360
That's the openness to experience.

518
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,200
And yeah, it's easy to cheat on.

519
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,760
But dig this, reinforce on it.

520
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,040
IQ is a goal standard that I think will never be met,

521
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,200
because it has been homogenized into what is measured.

522
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,640
And it's interesting how a gardener came up with it.

523
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,000
Well, initially, seven intelligence,

524
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,080
but he's added some additional ones.

525
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,640
And he's sometimes been criticized,

526
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,680
because he says some of those intelligences

527
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,800
don't really have measures for them.

528
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,920
It's because they're creativity and personality.

529
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,120
Yeah, like interpersonal intelligence.

530
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,200
Intrapersonal intelligence.

531
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,800
What's it, the somatic?

532
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,320
Kneesthetic.

533
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,200
Kneesthetic intelligence.

534
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,760
Right.

535
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,800
And they can't do it.

536
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,200
Have something to do a layup and then give them a score.

537
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,800
I mean, there's no.

538
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,400
So is that really a criticism?

539
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,880
But I think the criticism of gardener

540
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,400
is usually not that his constructs exist.

541
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,480
People agree that his constructs exist.

542
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,120
The question is, can you operationalize it?

543
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,640
Can you actually measure it in a reliable way?

544
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,840
And on that question, the answer is no.

545
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
You can't.

546
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,320
And that's why you ended up going from kind of looking

547
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,320
at it in the general population to focusing on genius.

548
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,800
Yes.

549
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,880
I create a achievement in creating minds.

550
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,520
And then there's no question.

551
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,240
So you started out with the question about intelligence

552
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,720
and genius.

553
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,600
But do you think creativity and personality

554
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,320
variables are critical to the manifestation of genius?

555
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,600
Well, yeah, that's the whole point.

556
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,160
It's to me, it's not a single dimension.

557
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,640
We can talk about g, you know, intelligence.

558
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,520
It's been well demonstrated.

559
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,960
It's very hard to get rid of it.

560
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,320
So intelligence is likely necessary, but not

561
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,760
sufficient to achieve genius.

562
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,240
Yes.

563
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,920
And that's why you talk about, yes.

564
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,040
You have a monotonic line.

565
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,800
But it's huge scatter right now.

566
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,360
Exactly.

567
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,960
These are all noisy predictors.

568
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,880
And the reasoning why they're scattered

569
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,960
is this person has a high openness experience.

570
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,720
And this person has low openness experience.

571
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,600
The person who has a highest recorded IQ,

572
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,920
she took the Stanford Bine, when she was a little girl,

573
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,480
and got her perfect score.

574
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,400
She writes Marilyn Vosseva.

575
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,800
Yeah, Marilyn Vosseva.

576
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,920
Sure, it's an advice call.

577
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,360
I mean, 226 is a really good IQ.

578
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,000
No, no, no.

579
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,360
She has book of records.

580
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,920
But what is she doing?

581
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,480
I hope she's not here.

582
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,240
But it's a really good achievement

583
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,360
that she's doing very well.

584
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,440
She's drawing a column for a Sunday supplement.

585
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,400
In which people ask dumb questions,

586
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
that she answers.

587
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,600
That she answers.

588
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,160
I mean, a lot of them are really dumb.

589
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,200
Like, why in winter should you wear dark clothing?

590
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Yeah.

591
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,720
Yeah.

592
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,680
Yeah.

593
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,160
And she gives a very interesting number.

594
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,000
That's not a dumb question.

595
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You look up by googling.

596
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,600
So to me, she's sort of the prime example of having

597
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,880
supreme IQ.

598
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,160
She's basically a specialist in taking IQ tests.

599
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,640
Sure.

600
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,720
She's taking every IQ test you can possibly imagine,

601
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,680
including one further.

602
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,400
There's one for the four Sigma society.

603
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,080
That's four standard deviations above of me.

604
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,960
And I've seen some of the questions.

605
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,440
And I'll admit it.

606
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,280
I couldn't understand what they were asking.

607
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,160
Dean, don't feel bad.

608
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,600
I don't even look at those questions.

609
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,960
I know.

610
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,720
You know, it's like, maybe that's the test.

611
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Are you smart enough to realize these questions don't

612
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,120
actually ask any way?

613
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,880
These questions are nonsense.

614
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,120
So genius requires intelligence, but then there's

615
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,960
something else.

616
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,480
Yes.

617
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,440
And there's a secret sauce.

618
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:21,440
Right.

619
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,960
They be sort of X factor.

620
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,200
And that's Cicero called it the quidum de winum, the kind

621
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,240
of divine something that somebody like Socrates had.

622
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,480
Socrates thought he had a dimonion, a little sort of

623
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,920
spirit that followed him around and whispered in his ears.

624
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,920
In fact, that's the Greek term dimonion, the dominion of

625
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,360
diamond, gives us our word demon.

626
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,040
But in Latin, that's called agenius, which is just

627
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,920
like the word genius.

628
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,680
And originally the idea was that that

629
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,640
extra something was breathed into you by a god or a muse, or

630
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,040
implanted in you by the gods.

631
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,120
But it was a divine special something that ordinary

632
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,080
human beings didn't have.

633
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,640
Are you saying that's a genetically induced?

634
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,120
What?

635
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,640
I'm not saying anything about genetics.

636
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,080
So we mentioned fascination with measuring the brains of

637
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,120
these deceased geniuses.

638
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,840
Well, I think the next step, which will be realized as

639
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,000
technology improves, is of course measuring the genome.

640
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's happening as we speak.

641
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,800
So I just hosted a meeting of the International Society for

642
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,360
Intelligence Research in Robert Ploeman.

643
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,480
Yes, that's Robert Ploeman.

644
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,600
Yes.

645
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,960
Did you go to James Lee's talk?

646
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,520
I did.

647
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,320
Yeah, very, very impressive talk.

648
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,560
And so they're searching for the genes of genius, or high

649
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,160
intelligence anyway, and having a hell of a time finding

650
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,680
them.

651
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,080
A lot of them, right?

652
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,520
Well, yeah.

653
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,560
A lot of them in multiplying dramatically.

654
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,560
So Robert Ploeman has made his life mission finding this

655
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,320
gene for genius.

656
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,560
And it turns out that there's not a gene, and there's not a

657
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,000
hundred gene, and genes, and there's not a thousand

658
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,320
genes.

659
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,760
But there's probably thousands and thousands.

660
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,920
And they're kind of interchangeable.

661
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,360
So it's like the same genes get a peer and every single.

662
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,800
And it's not for every single person.

663
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,200
It's really a complex story.

664
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,080
And the takeaway for me was twofold.

665
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,160
So you have this bell shaped curve.

666
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,600
Now we're all very interested at this high end of the curve,

667
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,560
because we're all smart people.

668
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,800
And we're here at this talk, and we're talking about genius.

669
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,080
But evolution is selecting for the middle of the curve.

670
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,800
That is where the sweet spot is for replication, natural

671
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,360
selection to occur.

672
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,080
And that's where the action is at the gene.

673
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,840
So Robert Ploeman is looking for booster genes when actually

674
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,480
there's suppressor genes.

675
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,680
And the lack of suppressor genes that decrease your

676
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,320
intelligence is actually the big story.

677
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,080
And Dr. Lee and Dr. Ploeman are finding these stories that

678
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,440
the lack of these suppressor genes are really more

679
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,000
interesting than these booster genes for high IQ.

680
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,640
There is one area where there's been, I think, more

681
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,960
success to look at the genetic basis of genius.

682
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,200
And that is not the focus on IQ, but the focus on

683
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,560
personality.

684
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,760
Because we know that most major personality traits have

685
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,840
very strong genetic component, usually about 50% on the

686
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,640
average credibility.

687
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,680
And what's also interesting about this research is that it's

688
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,480
helped us understand a little bit more a very important

689
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,680
issue that has gone, well, it goes all the way back to Plato

690
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,160
and Aristotle, the mad genius issue.

691
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,440
What's the relationship between genius and mad stuff?

692
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,760
I mean, Aristotle says that all geniuses are, even in

693
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,880
politics, he said, you know, suffer from melancholic, which

694
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,840
is just his word for depression and depression.

695
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,640
And he was probably a depressed guy.

696
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,440
Because he listed philosophy as one of characteristic.

697
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,640
And what's interesting to me is that there is evidence that

698
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,960
there are shared genetic basis between certain kinds of

699
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,320
mental illness and certain kinds of creative achievement.

700
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,600
It's not that highly creative people are mentally ill.

701
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,520
It's just that there's certain things that allow them to be

702
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,520
creative that are shared with people for mentally ill.

703
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,480
Because they don't have whatever the moderating

704
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,680
variables are.

705
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,000
For example, reduced-laden ambition.

706
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,680
I was going to say, what do you think those cognitive

707
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,200
variables, the cognitive variables?

708
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
They just can't.

709
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,240
They have less ability to filter out irrelevant

710
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,960
information.

711
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,600
Well, guess what?

712
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,000
That actually is useful sometimes.

713
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,960
Because when you filter out something that's irrelevant,

714
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,040
it actually may be something that, well, like serendipity,

715
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,240
all serendipity by definition is irrelevant.

716
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,520
And so you have spotted.

717
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,720
Then that's domain specific though, right?

718
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,200
In other words, one can imagine a correlation between

719
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,440
poetic genius and a form of mental instability.

720
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,640
Because making metaphor is drawing connections between

721
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,520
dissimilar things.

722
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,880
And you move that a little bit over and you got schizophrenia.

723
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,720
And you can see how that might be.

724
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,040
But presumably, in other domains, maybe not that.

725
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,400
He's going to tell you something different.

726
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,360
No, OK.

727
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,080
Well, I mean, this is obviously very complicated.

728
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,560
But if you look at scientific genius, their leanings are

729
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,080
towards the autism spectrum.

730
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,580
OK.

731
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,080
And mathematics, for example, yes.

732
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,000
And so in a sense, it's the opposite.

733
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,080
Because they're so incredibly focused.

734
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,920
I mean, when you figure out Albert Einstein, when he

735
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,400
worked out his theories, well, if you don't realize, they're

736
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,880
like, oh, you just come up with equals m c square, and you're

737
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,200
done.

738
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm afraid he had to do calculation after calculation.

739
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,080
He would often get those calculations wrong and would

740
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,320
have to redo them.

741
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,720
He worked, he published three papers on the size of a

742
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,040
molecule, kind of a dumb thing.

743
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,960
That's what he did his doctoral dissertation on.

744
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,440
He got Avogadro's number wrong.

745
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,840
He got wrong again.

746
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,800
And he finally, on only a third calculation, he finally got

747
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,480
it right, predicting it on the basis of his observation

748
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,720
of the theory.

749
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,240
So you have to be very, very focused in science.

750
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,480
You're obsessed with Avogadro's domain.

751
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,160
I think you're absolutely right.

752
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,520
But I would make one observation, which is that the

753
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,600
enormous powers of concentration that are required if you

754
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,920
want to do high level mathematics or theoretical

755
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,840
physics, those are developed.

756
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,600
So when I was a kid growing up, my father, who was an

757
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,040
engineering professor, I always thought of him as absent

758
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,360
mind, and I used to joke with him.

759
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,200
And I used to say, and I was kind of a normal kid, I thought,

760
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,880
at least I think.

761
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,600
And I used to say to my dad, hey, I'm never going to be as

762
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,640
absent mind as you, dad.

763
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,920
I think I'm different than you.

764
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,080
And he said, well, just wait, because if you want to do

765
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,360
the work that I do, you have to think.

766
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,040
And when you're thinking, people will think you're

767
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,280
absent-minded.

768
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,600
And so what's actually happened is that as a kid, I could not

769
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,280
hold some really complicated mathematical thing in my head

770
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,920
and manipulate it.

771
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,000
But now I can.

772
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It's developed.

773
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,640
And so now my kids look at me, and I'm doing something, but

774
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,200
they don't realize I'm doing something.

775
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,960
They think I'm ignoring them or absent-minded.

776
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,080
So it's a little bit more complicated than you think.

777
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,320
They may actually be doing their work when they appear to be

778
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
a kid.

779
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,240
Sometimes I mean, Einstein would be talking with some gas.

780
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,600
And all of a sudden, his mind would be elsewhere.

781
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,960
He'd get up and go out of the room.

782
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,280
And what if there's two main things that our brain does

783
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,840
that's analogous to evolutionary processes, blind

784
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,920
variation and selective retention?

785
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,800
And so this is the mechanism of evolutionary processes.

786
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,120
And this is kind of what you're describing.

787
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,080
This variation process where you're thinking up lots of

788
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,600
different ideas, and you can do mental simulations.

789
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,680
But then you have to selectively retain, and you have to

790
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,640
drill down.

791
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,000
And at one extreme, and I wrote a paper on this that I

792
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,280
think you reviewed as well, wrote a paper on this that at

793
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,520
one extreme, blind variation can devolve into psychosis where

794
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,680
everything is related to everything else.

795
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,800
At the other end of the continuum, with selective

796
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,400
retention, things get so narrow that there's only one

797
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,160
solution become very rigid in your thinking.

798
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,360
And autism is at the end of the psychopathological

799
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,280
perspective.

800
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,600
And the brain is designed to be, again, in the middle of

801
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,320
the golden mean where blind variation and selective

802
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,480
retention work hand in hand so that you can be most

803
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,000
adaptive for problems that are well known, that you have to

804
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,840
solve problems rapidly and accurately.

805
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,640
That's kind of an intelligence thing.

806
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,520
And problems are unknown where you have to come up with a

807
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,800
new solution to a problem.

808
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,280
That seems like the sweet spot.

809
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,960
A good example of this is John Nash who recently died.

810
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,400
He was the subject of this book, a movie, a beautiful

811
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,160
mind.

812
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,920
And he had a schizophrenic phase where he was really

813
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,440
lost.

814
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,960
And there were periods of time when he would wander around

815
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,840
Princeton and just fill blackboards with just nonsense

816
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,760
and crazy things.

817
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,200
But then when he regained his sanity a little bit, people

818
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,960
asked him, what were you doing all those years, John?

819
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,560
And he said, well, these arguments that God is acting

820
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,480
with Joseph Stalin to do something with Martians, those

821
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,640
ideas came to me from the same places that the

822
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,960
mathematical ideas came from.

823
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,480
And so I didn't just treat them the same way.

824
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,120
So it's very, I think it supports what your model.

825
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,800
And from a neurological perspective, that's how we're

826
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,600
starting to appreciate it.

827
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,880
With networks in the brain that are involved with this

828
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,360
variation process, the default mode network, and networks

829
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,640
that are involved with the selection process, cognitive

830
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,320
control networks, and how they have to work in tandem

831
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
with each other.

832
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,120
It's not just a place in the brain, but it's these networks

833
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,320
working hand in hand that allows us to be uniquely human

834
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,520
and successful as humans.

835
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,320
This is relevant to another issue.

836
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,760
If you look over at the program, they have all these

837
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,520
really interesting issues.

838
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,920
And some of my, I think we didn't touch upon because we're

839
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,920
missing a person who's an expert in that area.

840
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,760
But one of them is why not all child apologies grow up to

841
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,840
become adult geniuses.

842
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,960
And it's a very complex issue.

843
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,720
It has to do with social development, a lot of other

844
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,120
things.

845
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,720
But one of them is, I guess this kind of blind version

846
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,320
selective retention thing.

847
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,440
When you see a lot of child apologies, they're usually in

848
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,000
areas where you have to acquire incredible expertise,

849
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,160
incredible expertise in chess, incredible expertise in

850
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,520
mathematics, incredible expertise in music, performance,

851
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,880
playing the violin, piano, whatever.

852
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,560
And at the beginning, it's really helpful to just focus

853
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,520
and focus and focus.

854
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,920
It's very narrow, and we everything out beat towards

855
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,520
the artistic end of the spectrum.

856
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:21,120
But as you mature, that only works for certain kinds of

857
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
things.

858
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,760
You can keep on doing that for chess.

859
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,200
You can keep on doing that for some kind of mathematics.

860
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,480
But there's other areas where all of a sudden you have the

861
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,600
openness to experience.

862
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,640
You're still composing music.

863
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
Most of those are a good example.

864
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,840
He was a phenomenal child prodigy.

865
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,000
The greatest child prodigy in music the world has ever seen.

866
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,960
He was actually studied.

867
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,000
A lot of people don't know this.

868
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,200
There was actually an article where they studied him.

869
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,960
The Royal Academy.

870
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,040
At the Royal Academy.

871
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah.

872
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And published in the transactions.

873
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,560
I just read that.

874
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
We read that recently.

875
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,400
It's fascinating.

876
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,880
I mean, it's obviously not that he would go chase around a

877
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,760
cat.

878
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,840
Yeah, he was still.

879
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,440
That was used as a proof that he really was his

880
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,240
angel.

881
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,880
Yeah, it really was a child.

882
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,000
But what was interesting is that a lot of people

883
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,760
realized that he was actually slow to mature as a

884
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,800
composer.

885
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,120
Some of you may have heard this 10-year rule.

886
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,600
It takes about 10-year.

887
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,720
It took him longer than 10-years.

888
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,560
He was composing at six.

889
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,840
And it wasn't until roughly he was 29 that he started

890
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,840
composing his first masterpieces.

891
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,880
And what happened is all of his stuff beginning, the

892
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,640
really great music.

893
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,000
But it's just kind of music that everybody else was

894
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,560
composing.

895
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,120
And there's no there there.

896
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,640
He had to go through his death of his mother.

897
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,720
He had to go through an unfortunate love affair and

898
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,000
a marrying the sister.

899
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,800
And all these other kinds of things.

900
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,240
He had experience in life.

901
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,320
And it broadened him so that all of a sudden he could put

902
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,120
meaning into his music that he didn't have before.

903
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,080
He just had the technique.

904
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,120
And then when he puts it there, the Viennese Society

905
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,960
can understand it.

906
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,120
And he starts losing his contrast.

907
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,640
Right, right.

908
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,400
And dies, you know, proper.

909
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,480
Yeah, he paid the consequence for it.

910
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,200
He became less popular.

911
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,920
No, no, please.

912
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,120
I was just going to say, Dean mentioned that this

913
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,360
nexus between madness and genius goes all the way

914
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,160
back to Aristotle and Plato.

915
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,120
But in the 19th century, there's quite a developed

916
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,240
medical theory that genius is a sort of positive side

917
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,840
effect of mental degeneration.

918
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,400
And you know, there's a lot of literature on this.

919
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,640
But the story I love to tell is that the great French

920
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,200
novelist, Emil Zola, suspects that he's a genius.

921
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,160
But he's also an acolyte of this theory.

922
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,160
So he knows he has to be somewhat mad.

923
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,000
So he hasn't sort of analyzed by a group of 12 French

924
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,040
psychologists who come to the conclusion that he's mildly

925
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,680
neurotic, just neurotic enough to be a genius.

926
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,120
But I function it.

927
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,040
You're in a sweet spot.

928
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,640
There you go.

929
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:02,200
But when you talk about Mozart, or you could talk about

930
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:08,920
Matisse or Botticelli, is IQ relevant there?

931
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,640
I suspect that if you took the greatest,

932
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,200
we in this room made a list of who we thought were the

933
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,040
greatest novelists.

934
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,600
And you gave them all IQ tests.

935
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,160
They would all score above average.

936
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,280
But I think very few of them would score really off the

937
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,640
charts the way that astrophysicists would score or

938
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,240
something like that.

939
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,840
The average, the bill-shaped curve, would center around

940
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,480
120, around the Wexler scales.

941
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,440
I think the issue here is you have to, and the same thing

942
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,240
is true for the madness thing, that's like a pathology

943
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,240
thing, you have to break it down by domain.

944
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,040
And you can't do these big cuts even of artists versus

945
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,160
scientists, because you've got to break it down much more

946
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,800
fine.

947
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,680
For example, you look at arts, and there's actually some

948
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,400
research done on this, for example, where this guy

949
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,720
compared highly formal abstract arts that are very

950
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,560
logical, like a Mondrian, for example, with highly

951
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,800
expressive emotive arts, like Jackson Pollock, for

952
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,840
example, or abstract expressionism in general.

953
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,600
And guess where all the psychopathology is?

954
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,440
It's on the highly emotional expressive, and the highly

955
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,800
abstract form, it's like mathematics.

956
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,360
It doesn't require that kind of openness and craziness.

957
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,880
But it's seen for physics, as you've shown too.

958
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,800
Revolutionaries are more likely to show psychopathology

959
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,280
than our theoretical physicists versus garden varieties.

960
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,680
So you really have to cut it fine.

961
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,760
And then again, just like it is for intelligence, or

962
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,720
scatter around.

963
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,720
So you don't have to be crazy.

964
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,280
Einstein, maybe he was a little bit autistic, but he

965
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,640
himself wasn't crazy.

966
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,000
But he may have been carrying a gene for it because his

967
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,640
science, and it's schizophrenic.

968
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,160
Wonderful.

969
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,240
I'm still not clear.

970
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,920
Are you saying that the correlation between

971
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,280
intelligence and genius applies primarily to fields like

972
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,680
science, mathematics?

973
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,320
Or is that applicable across the board to everything, whether

974
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,000
it's painting, music?

975
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,920
I think if you use the word intelligence, you have to be

976
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,280
very careful of what you mean by that.

977
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,440
So because there is an operationalizable version of

978
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,800
it called G or IQ, that's the one we tend to focus on.

979
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,000
That one tends to show a higher correlation with certain

980
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,960
types of works, symbolic manipulation, mathematics,

981
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,840
things like that, computer programming.

982
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,960
But writing a novel I think has so many other

983
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,320
ingredients in it that the loading on that particular

984
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,760
kind of intelligence has decreased.

985
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,240
But not absent.

986
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
But not absent.

987
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,880
It's like you said, 120 or something like that.

988
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,840
Certainly not absent.

989
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,200
These aren't dumb people.

990
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,680
No.

991
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,000
But they're spending more of their time thinking more

992
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
concretely about things that happen in life.

993
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,880
I think feeling 120 is not the genius.

994
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,400
No.

995
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,600
It's gifted level.

996
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
It can't be.

997
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,400
120.

998
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,440
It's all relative.

999
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,200
It depends on who the 120 person is with.

1000
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,520
So yeah.

1001
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,480
I think if you ask, well, what is it that makes

1002
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,560
somebody a great novelist, they have to be able to read

1003
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,040
and write.

1004
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,960
But they have to think about humans and have insight into

1005
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,120
human psychology and life.

1006
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,240
And those are things which are not measured by these tests.

1007
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,200
So someone may be very, very off scale in their insight

1008
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,640
into human psychology.

1009
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,800
They may be off scale in their ability to write beautiful

1010
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,560
prose.

1011
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,640
But that's not measured by these little tests.

1012
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,440
And so they may come out as 120 on the little test, but

1013
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,160
they're one in a million in these other areas which we just

1014
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,280
are not very good at measuring.

1015
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,000
Right.

1016
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:57,200
So why isn't then the measurement made in terms of

1017
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,920
what knew did the person bring that didn't exist before?

1018
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,800
So let's say Manet in terms of painting bring something

1019
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,920
at a point.

1020
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,920
Yeah.

1021
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,000
That's the measurement that society gives in calling them

1022
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,280
the genius, the one in the million.

1023
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:21,520
Society then gives the acclimation or the collective

1024
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,160
approval that this person is, has produced something so

1025
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,920
unusual that that is the measure.

1026
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,480
I would say that's a much deeper way of classifying genius

1027
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,880
than just giving somebody a little test.

1028
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,560
This is saying, well, in the test, you're a genius as

1029
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,200
opposed to you contributed something really original.

1030
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,360
By definition, you can't standardize it.

1031
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,360
No.

1032
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,120
If you're going to score them on how original they are, then

1033
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,960
how do you standardize something like that?

1034
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,960
But I would say there is one problem here to capture.

1035
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
The societal level.

1036
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,440
I thought they're doing a whole set of genetic studies on it.

1037
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,040
So they are trying to standardize it, but are they

1038
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,120
standardizing it just for scientists or are they standard?

1039
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,960
No.

1040
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,560
All the genetic studies would use as the phenotype variable, a

1041
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,240
score on a test, like an intelligence test.

1042
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,680
Or a personality test.

1043
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,160
Any trait, that quantitative trait that you want to measure,

1044
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,040
you can calculate, for example, the correlation between a

1045
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,720
particular gene variant and that phenotype.

1046
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,920
And that's what's being done.

1047
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,120
But there is not a good phenotype as in made original

1048
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,280
contribution to society.

1049
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,080
That's quite difficult to standardize and measure.

1050
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,800
I just want to say one thing, though, back to the very first

1051
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,200
comment I made this evening, I think a lot of times we give

1052
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,520
someone credit for some huge original contribution to society.

1053
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,200
But that's a manufactured story.

1054
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,240
That person may actually not deserve the credit that we

1055
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:38,640
give them.

1056
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,600
And so I think you have to be quite careful about that.

1057
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,240
Or the person didn't get it in their lifetime.

1058
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,280
And much later they get it.

1059
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,880
Bend off.

1060
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,240
Most genes are dead.

1061
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,240
Yeah.

1062
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,040
Most people are dead too.

1063
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:51,640
Yeah.

1064
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,240
And there's a huge number.

1065
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,040
We could all name examples of Emily Dickinson.

1066
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,000
And Sprito Kahlo sometimes mentioned.

1067
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,920
But she was actually pretty famous during her lifetime.

1068
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,200
She had went her pain.

1069
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,320
Was Melville not, I guess, Moby Dick was not.

1070
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,640
Yeah, I think he was underappreciative.

1071
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,640
I don't know if he was neglected.

1072
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,000
You got published.

1073
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,520
And then there's the other example of somebody we think

1074
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,120
of Edison and the light bulb.

1075
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,400
I mean, the light bulb would have been invented many times

1076
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,200
prior to that.

1077
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,760
And he seizes the moment at the right time.

1078
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,800
There's myth making.

1079
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,200
Any of our big, whether it's Steve Jobs or people

1080
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,440
who are big figures today, there's

1081
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,800
a tremendous amount of determined, intentional myth

1082
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,200
making around all these people.

1083
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:33,520
Yeah.

1084
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,120
You have to be quite careful about that.

1085
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,200
By the way, I also have to say a lot of neglected geniuses

1086
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,640
are really honest to good, neglected geniuses that

1087
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,720
deserve to be neglected.

1088
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,440
I had this weird experience.

1089
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,160
I published a little tiny commentary in Nature.

1090
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,200
Oh, yeah.

1091
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,280
And I just raised this issue of whether or not

1092
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,080
geniuses extinct now in the natural sciences.

1093
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,920
I'm talking about physics and chemistry.

1094
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,160
You still want to be trouble for that.

1095
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,680
That's become such, you know, so expertise driven

1096
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,160
and group oriented and, you know, big research teams

1097
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,080
and big grants.

1098
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,960
And all of a sudden, I found out.

1099
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,400
By the way, they changed the title on me.

1100
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,000
So they said, is Einstein extinct, which

1101
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,280
is much more dramatic and sells lots of copy,

1102
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,320
but it wasn't what I intended.

1103
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,280
And there's all these people came out of the woodwork,

1104
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,880
you know, and they started saying, wait a second.

1105
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,720
I'm alive.

1106
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,120
And I said, well, what do you do?

1107
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,720
And he says, I've revolutionized theoretical physicists.

1108
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,200
You should appreciate that.

1109
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,480
They've actually proved that Einstein was wrong.

1110
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,440
So I said, can you send me a PDF of anything?

1111
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,240
Well, I haven't got accepted yet, but I have a YouTube.

1112
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,240
LAUGHTER

1113
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,840
Can I comment on your article?

1114
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,240
Because you read it.

1115
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:53,720
OK.

1116
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,560
Well, I think it raises an very important point.

1117
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,720
So in the era of Einstein.

1118
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,040
You didn't send them a YouTube, did you?

1119
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,040
I didn't.

1120
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,040
LAUGHTER

1121
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,040
We have to clarify that first.

1122
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,040
LAUGHTER

1123
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,880
In the era of Einstein, the top minds

1124
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,080
were drawn from a relatively small population.

1125
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,720
So if you think of the number of people today

1126
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,960
who have access to first-rate university education,

1127
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,600
it might be in India, it might be in China,

1128
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,600
and then access to first-rate graduate school,

1129
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,520
our talent pool is enormously larger

1130
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,800
than in the time of Einstein.

1131
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,040
So there is no doubt that in some sense of,

1132
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,720
if you just measure IQ scores, there

1133
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,200
are plenty of people around who are as smart as Einstein

1134
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,880
on that particular metric.

1135
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,880
But it is much more difficult to stand out today.

1136
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,240
Because every area of science, in particular,

1137
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,320
say physics, which I know well, is being worked on

1138
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,800
by very, very smart people competing against each other

1139
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,080
and pushing things forward a little bit at a time,

1140
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,160
working in big teams.

1141
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,720
So you just don't stand out.

1142
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,760
If you took an NBA guard today, and you had him play against NBA

1143
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,160
guards in 1950, he would embarrass those people.

1144
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,400
Maybe not Oscar Robinson, whatever he's in his favor.

1145
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,320
But he would embarrass almost all the other players in 1950.

1146
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,560
Because he would just be off scale for that era.

1147
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,760
But today, every game he goes to, he's evenly matched

1148
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,600
against some other players.

1149
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,840
So you don't think of that guy as a basketball genius.

1150
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,120
But he is a basketball genius.

1151
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,240
The talent pool has come from the pool.

1152
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,240
Yeah, the talent pool is just so tremendous now.

1153
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,480
And the set of frontiers that are being pushed forward

1154
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,040
in science, whether it's in biology or physics or chemistry,

1155
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,360
is so vast that we have a lot of geniuses.

1156
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,720
But they're totally unrecognized geniuses.

1157
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,840
Like a super-string theory.

1158
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,560
I mean, you have to be a genius to contribute to that.

1159
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,960
For example, for example, really impressive people

1160
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,680
are doing that work in that area.

1161
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,840
But no one's really stood out.

1162
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,320
And part of it is the problem that you said earlier.

1163
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,160
You can't verify which of these.

1164
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,880
And this one assumes 15 dimensions.

1165
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,880
And this one's 18.

1166
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,080
So which one do you pick?

1167
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,360
Well, they both give the same prediction.

1168
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,400
So this was more parsimonious, I guess.

1169
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,640
But to your point, does that mean that there's still

1170
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,400
geniuses out there?

1171
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,000
Or how do you define it?

1172
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,560
Because they're not achieving.

1173
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,040
They're not able to achieve.

1174
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,160
I mean, are there geniuses?

1175
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,280
But they can't achieve.

1176
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,800
There's not the opportunity to make those achievements.

1177
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,480
Because they're just the talent pools to offer.

1178
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,000
There's an issue of something we call low-hanging fruit.

1179
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,800
So how long have humans been doing science per se?

1180
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,160
A couple hundred years.

1181
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,560
So there are a lot of pretty easy things that got done early.

1182
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,840
And now there are a lot of things

1183
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,600
which are going to require teams of very, very, very

1184
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,480
smart people to filling in the details.

1185
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,600
So yeah.

1186
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,720
Well, it's not just filling in the details.

1187
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,040
So we don't know how to unify quantum mechanics and gravity.

1188
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,360
And maybe each string theory does.

1189
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,560
That's not filling in the details.

1190
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,800
That's a very fundamental thing.

1191
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,040
But it's going to take 1,000 Einstein-level people working

1192
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:42,960
on it to make it.

1193
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,440
Thank goodness the brain is completely unknown.

1194
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,680
And the brain, we still know almost nothing about the brain.

1195
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,280
So yeah, fantastic.

1196
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:50,760
Oh, God.

1197
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,000
I think this was mentioned in your little flyer as well.

1198
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,520
Has my favorite definition of genius.

1199
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,360
And it kind of fits in here.

1200
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,760
Because he puts the originality as the first requirement.

1201
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,000
But the second requirement is that the idea be exemplary.

1202
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,680
And what he means by that is that it

1203
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,680
forms a model for other people to follow and imitate

1204
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,480
or emulate or whatever.

1205
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,960
And I think that in the case of like Albert Einstein,

1206
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,880
like we were saying in that period,

1207
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,040
or in case of Niels Bohr or whatever,

1208
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,360
these people would come up with these ideas that people

1209
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,880
would immediately have to pick up on.

1210
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,840
I mean, you couldn't do quantum physics

1211
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,320
that ignore Niels Bohr and Heisenberg and the rest.

1212
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,880
So they reset the mark.

1213
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,400
But it's hard to know who's doing that now.

1214
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,800
Where everybody has to follow this guy or that guy.

1215
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,680
It's impossible for even a really great scientist in area A

1216
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,360
to actually follow what's going on in area C or D or E.

1217
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,400
So you could think of each one as a little microcosm

1218
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,240
where some genius work is being done.

1219
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,440
But it's so specialized now that it's very difficult for anybody

1220
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,320
to know what other people are doing.

1221
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,160
I want to ask you about what the thing you said

1222
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,920
about the basketball player.

1223
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,160
So you are saying a basketball player today

1224
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,280
is significantly superior in his abilities

1225
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,560
to a basketball player from the 50s.

1226
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,080
Yes.

1227
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,000
What does that say exactly?

1228
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,680
It's just that the pool from which the talent is drawn

1229
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,000
is much larger.

1230
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
So presenting.

1231
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,640
And the training and the techniques.

1232
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,280
But let me just say the pool.

1233
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,440
So that then wouldn't apply to genius because in genius,

1234
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,760
the idea is that there is something

1235
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,840
the person has given that makes them so.

1236
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,160
If you were a very, very smart kid

1237
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,280
and you grew up in Calcutta in the 1900s.

1238
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,280
Yeah, or even 1920, your chances of getting

1239
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,760
a decent education would be quite low.

1240
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,440
Whereas today with the Indian Institute of Technology,

1241
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,960
they're quite good at filtering the top young kids in India

1242
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,640
and bringing them.

1243
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,960
I mean, they're not fully efficient.

1244
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,720
But finding an early cultivating and then making sure

1245
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,360
that one could argue that in the time of Einstein,

1246
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,320
the actual population base from which the geniuses are

1247
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,520
drawn is more than 100 million people.

1248
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,960
Whereas now we're probably drawing

1249
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,080
from a pool of three or four billion people now.

1250
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,920
So.

1251
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,240
But the idea is that if you were basing it on an IQ test

1252
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:25,480
and if IQ tests existed in 16th century,

1253
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,760
that the numbers would be the same as the numbers

1254
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,760
that are now.

1255
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,600
So you are popping.

1256
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:37,000
So you are saying that the IQ, let's say,

1257
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,720
for the genius level is now higher than it was

1258
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,800
in the 16th century.

1259
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,200
And in the IQ has risen.

1260
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,840
Yeah, in the Flint Effect.

1261
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,160
Yeah, 100 or 150 years ago in the richest countries

1262
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,160
in the world, like the United States,

1263
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,400
the average years of education for an adult male

1264
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,920
would be something like six years or seven years.

1265
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,080
Well, IQ should be running into the education.

1266
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,080
Well, you did.

1267
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:01,520
No, no.

1268
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:06,560
I mean, unless you have some good environmental basis

1269
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,040
to build on, you're not going to achieve your full IQ.

1270
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,200
So actual raw scores on IQ tests.

1271
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,720
So, for example, the Swiss Army, sorry, the Swedish Army,

1272
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,240
there are various entities that have been testing IQ

1273
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,000
for over 100 years.

1274
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,160
And so they have scores on the same problems

1275
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,360
that have been given over a long period of time.

1276
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,920
And so there's been a gradual increase in scores.

1277
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,400
More people are getting them right over time.

1278
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,520
Because they have to make the tests harder, right?

1279
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,720
So they came off the farm and Sweden

1280
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,240
and they had four years of formal education.

1281
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,080
They weren't going to do very well in these tests.

1282
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,120
The average kid does much better.

1283
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,960
So in some sense, the environment

1284
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,480
has gotten much better for development of intelligence

1285
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,640
for the average person.

1286
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,120
And we're not quite sure if it's a combination

1287
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,720
or dietary factors.

1288
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,400
Nutrition.

1289
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,440
And people are reading and using their brain

1290
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,920
in a very complex way.

1291
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,200
So literacy has increased over the last century.

1292
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,200
Visual spatial development.

1293
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,080
People are using their brains in very complex ways.

1294
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,720
Visual spatially, this could be related.

1295
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,760
But the secular increase in IQ is a real thing.

1296
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,320
So when you go, I think it's when you go to first grade

1297
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,120
or kindergarten, I think to kindergarten,

1298
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,720
there is a test they give kids.

1299
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:27,360
And then some of these kids also have IQ tests.

1300
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,440
So you would.

1301
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,760
We just took naps in first grade when I'm.

1302
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,760
But look, in this sandbox, if I understand this.

1303
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,680
It's really changed over here in New York, it's different.

1304
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,960
If I understand you, when I went to nursery school,

1305
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,400
it was obligatory to take one hour nap.

1306
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,240
Yes, yes.

1307
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,720
It was.

1308
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:53,800
But so are you saying that the IQ of a five-year-old

1309
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,760
or a six-year-old when those tests applicable to that age

1310
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,640
are taken has the potential of developing and becoming

1311
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,760
a higher number?

1312
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,280
It has.

1313
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,760
Yeah, it already has.

1314
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,600
And that's why they have to rescale it.

1315
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,320
Yes.

1316
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,160
It's like what happened with the math portion of the SAT.

1317
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,360
People gain 800s and 800s and they try to rescale it.

1318
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,040
And they still start getting 800s and 800s.

1319
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,120
But you think of your genes as kind of a variance

1320
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,840
that you can be within.

1321
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,520
And you can either, if you eat a lot of lead paint

1322
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,160
and have a very restricted environment,

1323
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,160
you'll end up at the low end of that genetic variance.

1324
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,080
But if you have a very enriched environment

1325
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,160
and have parents that read to you and you

1326
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,240
have early education programs, you'll end up

1327
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,240
at the high end of that variance.

1328
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,760
And so the farmer in Sweden that never had an education

1329
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,760
will end up at the lower end of that variance

1330
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,920
and have a lower IQ versus the farmer that has

1331
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,320
educational opportunities.

1332
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,400
And as you mentioned, it's not just the education.

1333
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:49,920
It's the nutrition.

1334
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,280
How many of those farmers kids had had an orange at the turn

1335
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,880
of this century or had an orange during the winter?

1336
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,760
I understand.

1337
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,320
So what you are saying, if you said to me,

1338
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:05,040
it's in terms of that good parenting and reaching

1339
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,560
environment, good education, et cetera,

1340
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,440
will contribute to a smarter kid.

1341
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,040
And we've got a secular increase at all.

1342
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,960
If we are talking about genius, we

1343
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,160
are adding something on top of that.

1344
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:19,840
Yes.

1345
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,880
And are you saying that something on top of it

1346
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,120
is moving higher and higher?

1347
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,960
Not necessarily, but I want to say the following.

1348
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,400
So suppose you have many components that contribute

1349
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,920
to genius.

1350
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,000
So one is your raw IQ.

1351
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,520
One is your originality, creativity.

1352
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,160
Those are all things that are distributed within populations.

1353
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:40,000
And if I just give you a bigger pool of people to pick from,

1354
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,360
the person who's maximal on all of those qualities,

1355
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,520
or any particular sum of those qualities,

1356
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,720
will just be better because you were

1357
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,080
able to choose from a bigger pool.

1358
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,580
OK.

1359
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,760
And that's what's happening today.

1360
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,360
Good example is the chess genius,

1361
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,160
or interesting study of why are so many chess geniuses

1362
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,400
Russians or Hungarians or whatever?

1363
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,600
I mean, yes.

1364
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:56,940
What?

1365
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,440
Or a comedian?

1366
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,440
Or a comedian.

1367
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,960
Yeah.

1368
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,280
And it's a very simple answer, because there's

1369
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,080
so many of them playing.

1370
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:03,960
You know.

1371
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,000
It's an enriched environment.

1372
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,600
It's very competitive.

1373
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,200
They have very beginning.

1374
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,360
They have the chess clubs that are at very, very high level.

1375
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,360
Like at their ELO rating, at a very young age.

1376
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,560
I mean, you'd have this per capita kind of.

1377
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,440
There is a base population that you're

1378
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,320
drawing the champion from.

1379
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,280
And the bigger that base population,

1380
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,800
whatever the thing you're selecting for,

1381
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,360
you're going to get better champions.

1382
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,720
But one of the things you said is there's

1383
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,200
fewer problems to solve, too.

1384
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,000
So you have this incredible secular increase in intelligence,

1385
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,080
but you don't have an increase in genius,

1386
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,240
because there might be fewer problems.

1387
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,440
Or the problem, if you put us off a few problems,

1388
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,360
there are some of them.

1389
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,360
Maybe you didn't say that.

1390
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,120
No, I would say there are few problems

1391
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,280
that people readily identify as genius problems.

1392
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,880
But let me just mention that one in a million problems.

1393
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,320
Let me just mention that this thing

1394
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,000
is a million times more powerful than the computers

1395
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,320
that we had 20 years ago.

1396
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,640
Now, how did that happen?

1397
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,880
So this thing called Moore's Law

1398
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,120
is a doubling of our computer power

1399
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,240
every couple of years or so.

1400
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,160
How does that happen?

1401
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,360
The way it happens is there are thousands and thousands

1402
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,160
of electrical engineers and applied physicists

1403
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,600
who are not chopped liver, who are working on this problem.

1404
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,680
Consulate.

1405
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,960
They're working on this problem constantly

1406
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,360
with billion dollar budgets.

1407
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,480
And you're not aware of anything that they do, are you?

1408
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,240
But are they geniuses?

1409
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,680
Because I don't know why they're not geniuses,

1410
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,400
but you're not aware of them.

1411
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,960
And of course, another component of this,

1412
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,280
as you mentioned already, is that genius

1413
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,200
is a cultural label that we apply.

1414
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,000
And that is historically specific.

1415
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,720
People don't refer to individuals as geniuses prior

1416
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,080
to the latter part of the 17th century.

1417
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,520
The cult of genius emerges in the 18th century.

1418
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,880
And I'm always the token historian at these gatherings.

1419
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,960
So I will spare you a lecture, but there

1420
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,440
are culturally specific reasons why the cult of genius

1421
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,400
emerges in the 18th century.

1422
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,760
And one of them has to do with the new emphasis

1423
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,080
is placed on originality.

1424
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,640
I like to point out that if you look up the word

1425
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:59,760
to invent or to discover, if you look at those roots,

1426
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,240
the German for invent is effinden.

1427
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,200
And it literally means to find, to come upon.

1428
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,880
And that's reflective of a cultural mindset,

1429
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,760
same with the discovery.

1430
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,560
You're uncovering something of a cultural mindset that says,

1431
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,200
every truth in the world has already been discovered.

1432
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,640
God knows everything.

1433
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,400
What we do as artists, as thinkers,

1434
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,320
is recreate God's perfection.

1435
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:25,840
So in that world, you don't produce anything original.

1436
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,320
And there's a cultural impetus, rather, to imitate.

1437
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,840
Imitate is not to do anything bad.

1438
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,800
It's just to recreate, to perform the maces, which

1439
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,480
is the dominant kind of mode of aesthetics

1440
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,760
prior to the 18th century.

1441
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,640
Well, in the 18th century, you start

1442
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,240
to get a new emphasis placed on originality,

1443
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,200
both in the market.

1444
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,720
And I think it's not actually on coincidental

1445
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:50,320
that the cult of genius emerges at the same time

1446
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,920
as commercial society, when there's

1447
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,480
a kind of emphasis on bringing a new product to the market,

1448
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,520
tweaking a little bit on the neighbor's product

1449
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,960
so that you can get something new.

1450
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,760
Copyright law merges at the same time.

1451
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,680
An emphasis on the individual.

1452
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,360
Exactly.

1453
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:05,920
Exactly.

1454
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,960
And so that's all by way of saying that I think

1455
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:14,000
our need for geniuses has changed over the years.

1456
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,680
And we don't need the kind of geniuses that we once needed.

1457
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,120
Because the flip side of this is we

1458
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,760
have geniuses all over the place now.

1459
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,040
You can learn how to be a genius.

1460
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,360
You just go to Amazon.

1461
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,120
You get a self-fulfilled congenius.

1462
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:25,760
I'm not kidding.

1463
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,040
There are hundreds of titles.

1464
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,800
You two can think like Leonardo.

1465
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,400
Well, do you think that secular change is happening

1466
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,200
to bring us back to more of a democratization of genius?

1467
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,720
And that so we don't need this.

1468
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,320
Why do you think this is happening?

1469
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,120
That we don't need this individual genius

1470
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,360
and this kind of democratization is happening again?

1471
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,920
The cult of genius plays a religious role.

1472
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,720
The geniuses become secular saints.

1473
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,160
And that's a long story.

1474
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,680
And so about atheists.

1475
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,920
Well, there's that.

1476
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,200
But there's also, at the heart of democracy,

1477
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,240
there's a kind of discomfort with genius.

1478
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,360
Because geniuses are people who are naturally different

1479
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,440
and better than others.

1480
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,760
And we don't really like that.

1481
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,800
We're not really comfortable with that.

1482
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,400
Exactly.

1483
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,400
And so I think that there's always been a discomfort.

1484
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,000
And that sort of dialectic has worked its way out

1485
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,880
over the centuries.

1486
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,640
And we're at a place now where we live in Lake Wobagon.

1487
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,440
We're all above average.

1488
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,080
I mean, that's why there's such a hostility towards life.

1489
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,520
You have to do an education program.

1490
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,840
Because there seem to be elitists.

1491
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:28,920
Why spend money on these elite people who don't need any help?

1492
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,240
They've already got a lego.

1493
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,600
They already got it made.

1494
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,760
They already got the brain.

1495
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,120
So that's focused on the money in where it can be used.

1496
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,760
It used to hold.

1497
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,520
Like egalitarianism.

1498
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,760
That's make everybody equal.

1499
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,840
I think that's exactly how Americans feel.

1500
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,760
But I would say that the true secret of the world

1501
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,360
is technological and economic advancement

1502
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,920
are basically driven by some small percentage.

1503
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,320
A very small percentage in terms of cognitive ability

1504
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,800
of our population.

1505
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,440
And so to give you an example, quantum mechanics, which

1506
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,320
was invented in the early part of the 20th century,

1507
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:06,600
is now in roughly 10% of our GDP.

1508
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,360
So if you ask about telecommunications equipment

1509
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,240
or fancy chemicals, applied materials,

1510
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,160
all these things require some understanding of quantum

1511
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,360
mechanics to build and develop.

1512
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,040
But maybe 0.1% of our population actually

1513
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,200
understands quantum mechanics.

1514
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,760
And this is the other thing about the IQ thing,

1515
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,600
because I don't like to turn on IQ.

1516
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,560
General intelligence.

1517
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,040
And it relates to different areas of achievement.

1518
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,480
There are some areas where the knowledge base

1519
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:41,160
has become so complex that you need a very high IQ just

1520
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,440
to master it.

1521
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:48,720
I mean, physicists have an average IQ of about 140,

1522
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,360
which is the genius level according to the dictionary

1523
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,440
of the heart of the term.

1524
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,960
So that means the average physicist is genius.

1525
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,600
Psychologist?

1526
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,520
I hate to tell you.

1527
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,680
120.

1528
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,920
It's much lower than that.

1529
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,280
But they're still creative.

1530
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,720
But they're still creative.

1531
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,920
And it's probably quite high for psychometricians, though.

1532
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,480
Yeah, but psychometricians.

1533
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:22,400
And so it takes a certain amount of, gee, general intelligence

1534
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,680
to master complex abstract knowledge bases.

1535
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,800
And physics, if any of you have taken physics courses,

1536
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,360
that is definitely a complex, act-back knowledge base.

1537
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,840
Oh, it took one physics course.

1538
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:39,480
I mean, just learning the math to be able to do physics.

1539
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:44,240
So I guess my day job is as an administrator

1540
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,400
at a big university with 50,000 students, and one

1541
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,960
can't really even speak those words in today's environment.

1542
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,120
So we cannot say, the provost will look at me and say,

1543
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,560
how come our students are having so much trouble

1544
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,040
with freshman chemistry or organic chemistry?

1545
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,520
Surely there is a way that everybody on our campus

1546
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:10,120
can pass organic chemistry or second-year calculus

1547
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,120
or multivariable calculus.

1548
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,440
Can't say they're not smart enough.

1549
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,640
Yeah, so it's kind of amazing that we've

1550
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,400
been talking a little bit about this IQ construct

1551
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,240
and all those others.

1552
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,200
But in higher ed, you're not supposed to say those things.

1553
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,240
It's the fault of the chemists that they don't know

1554
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,380
how to teach their stuff, because surely everybody

1555
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,520
can understand if they really want to.

1556
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,240
And so I think there's still this tension

1557
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:34,120
in American society between understanding

1558
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:37,560
that certain truths are true and living

1559
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:43,680
in some world of magical thinking.

1560
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,000
I can show the spell.

1561
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Right?

1562
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,520
I want to say something to what you said,

1563
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:54,960
because it's one thing to say that the word genius,

1564
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,920
as it's currently used now, we're discussing it

1565
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,160
as a relatively new thing.

1566
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,080
But a lot of times, different cultures

1567
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,520
and different times and places will

1568
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:08,840
have sort of semantic equivalence to genius.

1569
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,920
Like, for example, in Chinese civilization,

1570
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,880
there's a certain poet, Libo, for example,

1571
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,440
who has had a term for it.

1572
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,080
It's like a fallen angel.

1573
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,320
Oh, Tiananzai.

1574
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:20,720
What?

1575
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,240
Tiananzai.

1576
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,680
Well, it means somebody who comes from heaven.

1577
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,960
Oh, yeah, someone comes from heaven.

1578
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:24,480
Yeah.

1579
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,000
And we also see that in, it means genius, basically.

1580
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,320
Yeah, I mean, basically it's a translation

1581
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:33,960
of each or defined Michelangelo's, what Vasari called Michelangelo.

1582
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,280
Because it was just like, where does it come from?

1583
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,000
Yeah.

1584
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,880
You know, it's just out of the blue, literally out of the blue.

1585
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,760
And so that's like genius.

1586
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,240
In the case of, I mean, it is like genius.

1587
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,040
And of course, every culture has heroes of the mind.

1588
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,000
But the Michelangelo case is interesting.

1589
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,600
I mean, Vasari uses, in the first edition,

1590
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,080
the lives of the painters, he calls Michelangelo divine,

1591
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,720
like 35 times, and it's like 50 something times

1592
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:58,680
in the second edition.

1593
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,000
The word do we know, right, the Latin.

1594
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,760
And prior to that point, been almost used exclusively

1595
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,680
for religious figures.

1596
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,360
And you get Brunelleschi's, you get described

1597
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,080
as a divine architect and so forth.

1598
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,760
And that in itself is a kind of shift

1599
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,160
from thinking about religious figures, especially

1600
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,720
touched to secular artists, right?

1601
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,040
I mean, Michael, he's still of the angels, right?

1602
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:19,840
He's angelic.

1603
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,000
I mean, he says the same thing.

1604
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,240
He said, and of course, that is an old way

1605
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,840
of thinking about genius that goes all the way back to Plato

1606
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,760
with his idea of divine fury of genius.

1607
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:29,640
But it carries on.

1608
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,040
I mean, there's a whole sociology that develops

1609
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,280
in Austrian Germany in the early part of the 20th century

1610
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:38,720
that refers to the Geni-Grelydion, sort of religion

1611
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,720
of genius, the modern kind of cult of genius.

1612
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:44,280
And this idea that geniuses are specially touched, yeah,

1613
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:49,160
that they have a kind of religious aura.

1614
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,640
You see this in the cult of Einstein.

1615
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,120
I mean, Einstein can see into the heavens, right?

1616
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,680
He can read the mind of God.

1617
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,120
He's called a Jewish saint.

1618
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,880
And even the interest in his brain,

1619
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,760
it's like he's different from everyone else, you know?

1620
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,080
It is like relics almost.

1621
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,920
People are getting little bits of his fingers or something.

1622
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:05,400
Yeah.

1623
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,520
You had that quote from Schopenhauer.

1624
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,000
It illustrates that talent hits a target

1625
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,040
that no one else can hit.

1626
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,240
Genius hits a target that no one else can see.

1627
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,720
Yeah.

1628
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,320
So just out of the blue, again.

1629
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,320
Yeah.

1630
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:17,760
Yeah.

1631
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,520
And of course, that has always existed, right?

1632
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,920
But it's the question becomes for a historian.

1633
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,400
Well, why at certain moments does this cult emerge?

1634
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,520
And what does that say about the culture, right?

1635
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,680
And how is it shifting back?

1636
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:28,960
Because it appears to be shifting back

1637
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,320
to a more secular conception of genius.

1638
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,120
Yeah.

1639
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,440
Yeah.

1640
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,280
By the way, this idea we talked on earlier about, you know,

1641
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,360
the relationship in native ability, you know,

1642
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,480
native intelligence, you know, the genetic component.

1643
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,720
And, you know, we didn't actually call it Flynn's law,

1644
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,400
but we were talking about for a while,

1645
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,680
I think they increased intelligence over time.

1646
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,080
One of my favorite examples, there are examples

1647
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:59,800
of cultures that came out of a nation that was relatively

1648
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,880
nondescript, and then in a very short time period,

1649
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,160
became the center of creativity for the world.

1650
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:07,840
OK.

1651
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,920
And one of my favorite examples is Islamic civilization.

1652
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,840
Except for poetry, the Arabs in Arabia

1653
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,360
had very little that was very distinctive in their culture

1654
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,440
in terms of contributing to world civilization.

1655
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,600
They are converted to a new world faith.

1656
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,720
They launch a campaign, a conquest.

1657
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:33,520
And they are all of a sudden forced to assimilate

1658
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:39,880
all these great ideas from India and Persia and Greece.

1659
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,480
And they not only assimilated it,

1660
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,080
but they integrated it to a new culture, a new civilization.

1661
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,680
And all of a sudden, they're making phenomenal contributions,

1662
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,760
leaving in the dust all the rest of human civilization,

1663
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,400
like in particular, certain areas like mathematics,

1664
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,480
for example, and medicine.

1665
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,920
Just out there to the hospital.

1666
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,680
Because of that openness.

1667
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,120
Because they were phenomenally open.

1668
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,880
Because they were so naive.

1669
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,440
You know, they come out and they have the Quran and their armies.

1670
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,760
And all of a sudden, there's all these books and experts

1671
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,640
on things.

1672
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,240
And there was a great caliph who set up

1673
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,440
what's called the House of Wisdom, where he deliberately

1674
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,040
said, there's a lot of things we don't know.

1675
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,720
And it's not an Arabic.

1676
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,120
So we brought all these people in.

1677
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,320
And they were not necessarily Muslims.

1678
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,120
They were Christians.

1679
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,600
They were medicans.

1680
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,320
They were Zoroastrians.

1681
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,280
And it says, translate everything into Arabic.

1682
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,640
So we don't miss out on anything.

1683
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:40,400
And the Ashkenazi Jews are a good example of this too.

1684
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,480
And the fact that you're getting out of your and being

1685
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:46,120
driven out of your home is another example.

1686
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:50,840
You are forced to invent new ways of solving problems.

1687
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,920
You're living in different through your exposure

1688
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,360
to new cultures and new ideas.

1689
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,080
Well, there's a lot of actually empirical research

1690
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:01,080
on multicultural experiences as conducive to creativity.

1691
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,040
And the Ashkenazi Jews definitely

1692
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,600
had that as part of a way of life.

1693
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,600
You're not advocating warfare, though.

1694
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,080
No, no, no, no.

1695
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,920
And the same thing happened with the old and old age

1696
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,600
of Islamic civilization.

1697
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,200
It was horrendously multicultural.

1698
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,240
And by the way, a lot they don't realize this.

1699
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,160
But even in the periods of conquest,

1700
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:23,880
most of the people in Islamic countries under the caliphate,

1701
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,600
in particular, were not Muslim.

1702
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,760
They belonged to some other faith,

1703
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,960
usually Christian or in the case of Persia,

1704
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,200
the Zoroastrians, and so forth.

1705
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,280
So it was a very, very multicultural society.

1706
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,720
So I've been confused about something

1707
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,600
I was talking with a friend earlier.

1708
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,600
We have this explosion of human creativity

1709
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,640
around 30 or 40,000 years ago.

1710
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,000
And why did this happen?

1711
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,080
And one of the things you start looking at,

1712
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,200
the Shulian hand-acts was the pinnacle

1713
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:58,200
of modern, hominid experience for 1.5 million years.

1714
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,240
And it was so stable for so long.

1715
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:03,720
And then 30 or 40,000 years ago, boom,

1716
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,040
you have agriculture, you have written language,

1717
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,720
you have culture, you have buildings,

1718
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,320
you have things that led to this.

1719
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:12,280
And in evolutionary time, this 30, 40,000 years

1720
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,040
is minuscule for this to happen.

1721
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,880
So one of the things that you read about

1722
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,440
is that people were coming out of Africa,

1723
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,840
and people were going into glaciers

1724
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,560
were retreating and encroaching on Northern Europe,

1725
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,960
and environments were changing in South Africa.

1726
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:35,560
I mean, was this of a theme that we're starting to see

1727
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,920
that this massive expansion of territory

1728
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,960
through warfare or through distribution of populations

1729
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,960
is the secret sauce of human creativity and innovation.

1730
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,280
It's also possible that on relatively short time scales,

1731
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,000
if selection pressures change just a little bit,

1732
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,640
you can have a secular increase in the average intelligence

1733
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,360
of early hominids.

1734
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,880
Dines off of the successful ones.

1735
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,560
Well, so for example, we've replaced

1736
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,480
the Neanderthals very quickly, actually.

1737
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,120
They were around for about a million years

1738
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,880
and didn't really accomplish very much.

1739
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:08,920
And so it's quite possible.

1740
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,200
We incorporated some of their DNA.

1741
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,360
And incorporated some also.

1742
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,920
They've also been an interesting addition to it.

1743
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:16,320
But I think as we get closer to the genetic basis

1744
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,080
for variations in human intelligence,

1745
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,440
we'll be able to look back, because we're getting quite good

1746
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,840
now at extracting DNA from dead creatures.

1747
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,200
We'll be able to look back at humans who lived 10,000 years

1748
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,600
ago, 20,000, 40, 50, and actually see how smart they were.

1749
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,080
Mm-hmm.

1750
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:37,600
It's interesting that I'm trying to remember who it was.

1751
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,080
I'm having problems, because I know this guy primarily

1752
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:45,280
by reviewing manuscripts that he submitted for publication.

1753
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,000
Not a week, really.

1754
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:46,480
No, no.

1755
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,080
And of course, it's anonymous.

1756
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,640
So by both ends, you know, double blind.

1757
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,240
So I can't draw into blank.

1758
01:14:54,240 --> 01:15:00,200
But anyway, who's argued that general intelligence

1759
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,280
was actually a lot of people in cognitive psychology

1760
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,280
talk about modules.

1761
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,200
There's a module for this and a module for that,

1762
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,000
that evolution involved developing

1763
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,040
as various kind of module for language.

1764
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:14,200
And the magic of mathematics, or really arithmetic.

1765
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,680
And this person argued, I think he's

1766
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,640
at the Lenin School of Economics,

1767
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,640
he argued that general intelligence

1768
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,400
is a specialized module.

1769
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,800
Very interesting concept.

1770
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:31,360
It's a specialized module that appeared when human beings

1771
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:35,280
started exploiting new niches in the environment.

1772
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,600
Because it was the.

1773
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,680
Khonazawa?

1774
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,720
Yeah, that's it.

1775
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,240
That's it.

1776
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,240
You know, thank you very much.

1777
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:43,960
Eureka.

1778
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,640
Eureka.

1779
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,880
And that's an interesting concept,

1780
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:51,440
because how do you adapt to totally new environments that

1781
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,000
have never been seen before?

1782
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,760
Well, you have this module that's very plastic,

1783
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,960
and it can absorb a lot of information,

1784
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,560
a lot of new information, and form new adaptations,

1785
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,360
and so forth.

1786
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,480
And so it's kind of something ironic twist to it,

1787
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:10,400
that generalized intelligence may be a specialized module

1788
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,200
for adapting to new environments.

1789
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,720
And he's done that interesting research,

1790
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:17,000
where he shows that general intelligence correlates

1791
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,680
with people's preference for novel behaviors.

1792
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,720
Like, for example, one of the things I find really interesting

1793
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:28,320
is that highly intelligent people

1794
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,280
are more likely to like instrumental music,

1795
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,200
whereas less intelligent people are more likely to like

1796
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,280
vocal music.

1797
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:40,280
I think you better be careful.

1798
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,040
Tread it into a dangerous.

1799
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,760
Because, instrumental music is a little bit

1800
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:44,560
of a real trouble.

1801
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,720
It's for the dumb.

1802
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,040
I actually like both, you know?

1803
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,520
So I don't know how I feel about it.

1804
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,480
So Khonazawa is very controversial.

1805
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,800
And Khonazawa, these in Tubi, talk about two different modules

1806
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,760
in the brain, one that's a specialized problem solving,

1807
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,760
and one's more general improvisation module.

1808
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,440
And this is more analogous to my thinking

1809
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:07,440
that we have these two competing neural networks,

1810
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,480
not competing, but cooperating neural networks.

1811
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:13,880
One designed to do this intelligent hypothesis testing,

1812
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:17,600
which is rapid, accurate problem solving in the environment.

1813
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,800
And one, to do hypothesis generation

1814
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,800
when we don't know what to do next.

1815
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,880
And I think Cosmades and Tubi were probably

1816
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:29,000
a little more accurate in their conceptualization of these,

1817
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,560
maybe not modules in the brain, but networks in the brain

1818
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,240
that we're now coming to appreciate.

1819
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:38,240
And Khonazawa is misappropriating creative problem solving

1820
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,120
for intelligent problem solving.

1821
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:43,920
But we can argue about this for.

1822
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,440
One development that I think is really absolutely mind-boggling

1823
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:47,880
for me.

1824
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:52,400
And you kind of hinted at it when you talked about the Swedish

1825
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,360
things.

1826
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,120
In a lot of Scandinavian countries,

1827
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:59,080
they're doing these studies that are the whole population.

1828
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,080
They don't have samples.

1829
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,280
They have the whole population.

1830
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:06,280
I just reviewed a book that was on the relationship

1831
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:11,400
between psychopathology and male illness about Kyaga.

1832
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,840
And he's in Sweden.

1833
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,800
And his original study for his doctoral dissertation,

1834
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:22,040
he had something like 700,000.

1835
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:25,360
But now he's expanded a sample to over a million.

1836
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,840
Yeah, he's right.

1837
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,840
It's not uncommon to have sample sizes of order millions

1838
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,280
now for a lot of these studies.

1839
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:36,080
And so he can do these fine distinctions that you just

1840
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,920
can't do with small samples.

1841
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:42,560
Because he's breaking down creativity, for example,

1842
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,560
in all these sub areas and different kinds of achievement.

1843
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,120
Are you in a creative profession or not

1844
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,720
in the arts versus the sciences and that kind of thing?

1845
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,280
And then also breaking down the gene side of it.

1846
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:58,760
So what specific kinds of genetic disorders

1847
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,080
are associated with which kinds?

1848
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,400
And these are studies with typical ends

1849
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,520
that most psychologists work with.

1850
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:10,080
You couldn't do because you'd have one case in each cell.

1851
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,880
At the ISIR conference, they started

1852
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:15,000
to brag about this by saying, we're

1853
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,920
using scientific notations for our end, 10 to the fifth.

1854
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:21,560
I was that new.

1855
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,640
I didn't realize that.

1856
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,040
Because psychologists, it's like we had a neuroimaging.

1857
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,080
It's like we had a sample of 50 or 60 or maybe 100

1858
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:30,920
is a big sample.

1859
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,560
But they kept going back and forth at this conference.

1860
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,720
Proaching 10 to the sixth.

1861
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:41,200
Yeah, 10 to the fifth, 7 to the log guys.

1862
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,520
The talk gets bigger than yours, my sample size.

1863
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,520
The talk that you mentioned at ISIR, which just happened,

1864
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,360
I guess it was a couple of weeks ago.

1865
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,880
This guy James Lee is a plumb in an eye,

1866
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,400
and James Lee are all collaborators.

1867
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,280
Yeah, Lee gave a very impressive talk.

1868
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,120
So the talk that James Lee gave was

1869
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,720
the result of a big collaboration

1870
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:03,680
called Social Science Genetic Association Consortium,

1871
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,120
which is an international consortium.

1872
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,400
They're probably something like 50 or maybe even 100

1873
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,800
universities involved.

1874
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,120
And they have a pool of about 300,000 people

1875
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,320
for whom they have some kind of cognitive measure,

1876
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,640
and then they have the genotype.

1877
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,320
32 of them.

1878
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,960
And they've reported at something

1879
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,600
called genome-wide significance, which

1880
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,120
is a statistical criterion.

1881
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:28,560
About 80 hits on specific gene variants

1882
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,320
that are associated with either slightly higher

1883
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,360
or slightly lower IQ.

1884
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,000
And so probably the way this field is going to evolve

1885
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,080
is that as we get bigger and bigger sample sizes,

1886
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,360
we will eventually get to the point

1887
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,160
where we've identified the probably of order

1888
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:45,200
10,000 places in the genome, which

1889
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,680
are directly associated with either slightly enhanced

1890
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,960
or slightly decreased cognitive ability.

1891
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,400
And at that point, we'll be able to make predictions.

1892
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:57,000
So if you give me the genotype of a person, site unseen,

1893
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,120
run it through the algorithm, it will predict

1894
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,880
this person's IQ is 120 plus or minus 10.

1895
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,600
We can already almost do that for height.

1896
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,280
So we already almost understand the genetic architecture

1897
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,320
of height such that if you give me from, say, a crime scene,

1898
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,560
the DNA from a person, I can say something

1899
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,080
about the height of that person.

1900
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:18,200
I can say something very definitive about eye color,

1901
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,760
skin color, things like that.

1902
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,920
But these complex traits, which are influenced

1903
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,880
by thousands of genetic variations,

1904
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,600
are going to be the last ones to be cracked.

1905
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,920
But they're going to be cracked probably

1906
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,120
in the next five years, I would say.

1907
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,640
Which is scary to me because we might have, well,

1908
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:35,600
we already see this, this neo-ugenics movement

1909
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,600
where you find out the genetics of your infant

1910
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,280
before it's even born and decide this person can't

1911
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,720
be an NBA basketball player or this person can't be a scientist.

1912
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,560
It's quite what I want.

1913
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,240
Not quite what I want.

1914
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:50,240
And I think this is really worth thinking hard about

1915
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,840
because it's right around the corner.

1916
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,720
And we may.

1917
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,120
Also modification.

1918
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:55,800
Well, exactly.

1919
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,960
That's what I mean.

1920
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,520
And so we will say, we're not going

1921
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,960
to do that in this country for more reason, but somebody will.

1922
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,480
And then people from New York with money

1923
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,240
will start flying to the places of the world they will.

1924
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,320
So their children can have an IQ of 15, 20 points higher

1925
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,040
than the rest.

1926
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,360
And so again, I would say this is a time

1927
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,080
to study the history of this kind of stuff too because,

1928
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:23,200
get dark for the million or so couples in the world each year

1929
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:26,600
that go through in vitro fertilization or IVF.

1930
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,680
In almost every case, they are producing multiple embryos.

1931
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,640
And there is already a decision process

1932
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,600
that is made of which embryo should

1933
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,840
be implanted to become the child and which one

1934
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,560
should be frozen or disposed of.

1935
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,760
Now that decision process right now is quite primitive.

1936
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:46,280
So the doctor may eyeball the growing blastocyst

1937
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,520
and say, this one has good symmetry.

1938
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,560
I bet it's healthy.

1939
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,360
The next step is to actually take a cell

1940
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:55,320
from one of the blastocysts and sequence the DNA.

1941
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,440
So you know the genotype.

1942
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:00,560
And then you can exclude certain severe diseases.

1943
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,560
You may be able to say certain things about phenotypes

1944
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,480
like height or IQ.

1945
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,720
So that's where we're heading.

1946
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,440
And it's really all existing technology.

1947
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,640
The only last step is just the ability

1948
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,680
actually with the algorithm to predict the phenotype

1949
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:13,880
from the genotype.

1950
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,560
Well, cost and Moore's laws we're bringing down the cost.

1951
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,360
It's inexpensive.

1952
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,440
I mean, if you're not in the US, it's quite expensive

1953
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:19,940
in the US.

1954
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:21,960
But if you go to Asia where the success rates are actually

1955
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:25,160
quite high, a cycle of IVF is a few thousand dollars.

1956
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,080
It's not very expensive.

1957
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,560
Oh, I was talking about genotyping.

1958
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,720
Oh, the genotyping is, yeah, we still need to accumulate

1959
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:30,360
all that data.

1960
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,800
It's getting closer to $1,000.

1961
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,300
Correct.

1962
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:32,640
Correct.

1963
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,360
Closer to $100, which will be in the next.

1964
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,760
So my prediction actually is that if you define genius

1965
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:41,080
as having a particular IQ score, not having

1966
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,080
some outstanding unique contribution,

1967
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,160
but just the IQ part of it, humans

1968
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:45,960
are going to be much.

1969
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,240
There are going to be many more geniuses of that type

1970
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,520
on this planet 50 years from now than there are today.

1971
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,400
Because I think there's going to be an incredible increase

1972
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,080
in human intelligence.

1973
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,120
Because it's a bit of a place to live.

1974
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:58,640
Yeah.

1975
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:02,320
We'll need them to fight the rise of the machines.

1976
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,280
Well, that'll be the big fight.

1977
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,760
I hope Schwarzenegger is still alive.

1978
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,760
General intelligence.

1979
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,000
I'm sure this is on that note.

1980
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,500
Yeah.

1981
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:15,440
And that is what I'm sure this has stimulated a lot

1982
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,440
of interesting questions from the audience.

1983
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,760
So we'd like to open it up to people

1984
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,000
if you would line up at the microphone.

1985
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,640
And please speak in the form of a brief question.

1986
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:36,960
My takeaway from what you said is in terms

1987
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:42,200
of the title of the roundtable, Understanding Genius,

1988
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,840
is that we don't.

1989
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:50,640
That there is no objective reality of genius.

1990
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:57,040
The very many variants that high IQ alone is not good.

1991
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,040
If you have a high IQ and sit in a room

1992
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,800
and don't achieve something, not necessarily a genius.

1993
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:12,080
So I'm unclear about what understanding genius does

1994
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,240
unless it's to ultimately, scientifically,

1995
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:20,280
manipulate wherever the criteria you want

1996
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:23,000
to use to call genius.

1997
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,860
Because a great warfare, we've had

1998
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:27,120
authors that are genius, but they're

1999
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,880
not capable of being reproduced or tested.

2000
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:36,520
So that's what my takeaway is.

2001
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:42,160
Am I being too narrow in my understanding of what you said?

2002
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,880
I think your characterization is fair.

2003
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,320
I mean, you're talking about a very complex aspect

2004
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,520
of human achievement.

2005
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,880
And it's not going to be something we can just bottle

2006
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,680
and or define very precisely in a few sentences.

2007
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,800
So yeah, we're studying.

2008
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,480
We have a historian and a psychologist.

2009
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,480
I brought a thermos hoping that you could bottle it.

2010
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,080
I'm going to take it back.

2011
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,840
But I'm very much a joyous.

2012
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,680
I hope he didn't pay to get in here.

2013
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,240
Pardon me?

2014
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:06,120
I hope he didn't pay to get in.

2015
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:12,320
I'm hearing a genius scholarship.

2016
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,280
But I can't say that we're making progress in two areas,

2017
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:21,680
identifying talents that can become future geniuses,

2018
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,400
and then developing environments that encourage

2019
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,600
the development of those talents.

2020
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,040
But have you ever find it?

2021
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,040
Is there some objective?

2022
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,160
We're identifying genius.

2023
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,200
How do you define it?

2024
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:33,800
Well, talents.

2025
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,240
I mean, individual talents, mathability,

2026
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,440
the study of automatically precocious youth

2027
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:42,920
is a very good example with Benbo and Lubinsky.

2028
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:46,360
But it is a label that you put on after you think this

2029
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,560
is something that's a genius.

2030
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,720
Well, it's even worthy of labeling genius.

2031
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,600
But don't be a little labeling.

2032
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,920
Because a lot of the people be conscientious once they've

2033
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,240
been identified as a genius.

2034
01:26:56,240 --> 01:27:00,000
Yeah, and it's a particularly important label,

2035
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,920
mathematically, mathematically, precocity.

2036
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,360
And now they're looking at visual spatial precocity.

2037
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,120
Some of these particular talents, I think,

2038
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,480
are very important for life outcomes.

2039
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,480
And whether they become geniuses or not,

2040
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:15,000
we need this human capital, which is another term

2041
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,240
that they use in future generations.

2042
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,960
This human capital, whether it becomes genius or not,

2043
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,720
is incredibly important and cultivate.

2044
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:27,000
The variables, the components of achievement, are worthy.

2045
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,560
But the label genius.

2046
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,600
Two people could look at these variables

2047
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,280
and one say that's a genius and the other say that's a fun thing.

2048
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,120
You know what they say about pornography, right?

2049
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,120
Yeah.

2050
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,040
You know what we see it?

2051
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,920
You know what the Supreme Court says about it.

2052
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,720
So I think we could make a list of 100 candidates

2053
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,320
for genius category.

2054
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,160
And probably we'd agree on 90% of it.

2055
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,200
There might be 10% that we wouldn't.

2056
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,240
So if that's enough to stop you from wanting to proceed further,

2057
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,520
then fine, we can work further on the definition.

2058
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,520
But I think we have a kind of definition

2059
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,640
that I think is largely agreed upon here.

2060
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,640
I think you can talk about, well, is there an IQ threshold?

2061
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,280
How do we identify these people early?

2062
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,960
Is there a way to measure their creativity when they're 14?

2063
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,400
Those are all things that people work on quite a bit.

2064
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,920
And so I think there is progress, but it's certainly not

2065
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:12,920
an answered.

2066
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,320
There are no concrete answers to all these things.

2067
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:16,320
Isn't that okay?

2068
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,320
Yeah.

2069
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:18,280
Yeah, I think you were accurate.

2070
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:18,840
Thank you.

2071
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,840
Yeah.

2072
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:21,840
Yes.

2073
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,800
I'm wondering how much of what we attribute to geniuses

2074
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,320
is due to the time and the environment they live in,

2075
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,160
as opposed to what they've actually done.

2076
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:34,720
If Einstein wasn't around 100 years ago,

2077
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:37,160
would somebody else have come up with the theory?

2078
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:40,600
And also if Einstein lived now, would he come up with a theory

2079
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,520
that explains what we can't do now?

2080
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,920
There's a very interesting phenomenon

2081
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,920
which we haven't talked about in science

2082
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:50,440
called multiple discovery in a dimension, where two of my people

2083
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,720
come up with the same idea totally independently

2084
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,720
of one another.

2085
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,840
And that's often taken.

2086
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,640
And I've actually done some research on that,

2087
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,440
and empirical research on that, and fit

2088
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,920
some mathematical models to explain it.

2089
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,640
One of the things that's interesting about it,

2090
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:05,160
if you look at it very carefully, though,

2091
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:09,000
is that you can go ahead and say, well, yeah,

2092
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,240
both Newton and Leidenitz came up with the calculus,

2093
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:15,200
for example, or both Wallace and Darwin

2094
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:18,440
came up with a theory of evolution by natural selection.

2095
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:21,360
But if you look at the theories very carefully,

2096
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,760
or the inventions very carefully, they're not the same.

2097
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:28,760
Newton's calculus and Leidenitz's calculus

2098
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,960
is very, very different, not just notationally,

2099
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,920
but in the general philosophical orientation.

2100
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,160
And in fact, a number of historians of mathematics

2101
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:39,920
argued that the commitment of British mathematics

2102
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,760
to Newton's version of calculus set back mathematics

2103
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,160
in Britain relative to the continent,

2104
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:49,120
where they were using Leidenitzian form of it.

2105
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:52,640
And you can see the same thing with Darwin and Wallace.

2106
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:56,360
They actually had a different version of evolutionary theory.

2107
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:59,440
Darwin thought that human beings could be included

2108
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:04,040
in natural and sexual selection, and Wallace did not.

2109
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,800
So what that means is that you would have gotten

2110
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,600
a different history of mathematics,

2111
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,160
or different history of evolutionary theory,

2112
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:16,560
if one of those had died in the crib.

2113
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,920
So because each one has something unique

2114
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,840
that they're contributing.

2115
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,560
Do you think we'd be in a different place now?

2116
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:27,040
I think we would be in it.

2117
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,560
I mean, this is all hypothetical, right?

2118
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,280
But you're talking about multiple universes.

2119
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:31,960
There may have been another universe out there.

2120
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,560
There was a Wallace universe.

2121
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:34,080
What?

2122
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,120
We're in the Darwin universe.

2123
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:35,620
Right.

2124
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:36,720
There's another one with the Wallace.

2125
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:37,680
Wallace published first.

2126
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:38,680
Yeah, right.

2127
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:39,200
Right.

2128
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,320
Exactly.

2129
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,480
My answer to your question is that these things

2130
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,520
are very contingent.

2131
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,640
Any great achievement is very contingent.

2132
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:48,000
So if Einstein had been born at a different time,

2133
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
a different place, he would probably

2134
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,240
be recognized as a very insightful smart guy.

2135
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:52,840
But he certainly wouldn't, almost certainly,

2136
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,200
wouldn't have this reputation that he has in our world.

2137
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,400
Right.

2138
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,280
Another point I'd like to make is that,

2139
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,600
what was the other point I was going to make?

2140
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,560
Oh, Einstein actually, technically,

2141
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,760
in terms of his mathematical ability, was not that strong.

2142
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:06,800
And so if he were today trying to do string theory,

2143
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,200
I think he would have quite a difficult time.

2144
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:13,040
So the great Harvard biologist Stephen J. Gould

2145
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,480
had a line where he said, I'm less

2146
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,600
interested in the shape of Einstein's brain

2147
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,880
and more interested in the people of his skills who

2148
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,640
died working in rice fields or what have you.

2149
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:28,400
And that does point to the role that context plays.

2150
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,840
And we can all do this.

2151
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,640
You can cluster genius.

2152
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:35,400
4th century BC Athens, 15th century Florence, New York

2153
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:39,560
in the 1950s, when you've got these really highly creative

2154
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:42,200
minds all working around common problems,

2155
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:45,000
that does something, Silicon Valley in the 1980s.

2156
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,480
No, yeah.

2157
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,200
But there's a really interesting example.

2158
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,200
If you've mentioned the Einstein example,

2159
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:53,120
when the Nazis took over Germany,

2160
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,080
they started rewriting the history of physics,

2161
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,880
because they didn't like the fact that there

2162
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,920
were too many high quality Jewish physics.

2163
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:01,920
Jewish physics.

2164
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,280
Yeah, that was right.

2165
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:06,920
And so it was actually one guy named Stark, notorious,

2166
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,800
not see theoretical physicists.

2167
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,800
And so he wrote a book on famous physicists.

2168
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,840
And it's very interesting, because most of the names

2169
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:18,200
look very, very familiar until you get to the 1930s.

2170
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:21,720
And all of a sudden, where you would expect a biography

2171
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:26,240
of Einstein to be, there's a biography of Hasenro.

2172
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,800
How many of you have heard of Hasenro?

2173
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:32,280
I've heard of Hasenro.

2174
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:37,280
Hasenro actually came up with all the things in Einstein's theory

2175
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,880
that was important, which means non-Jewish.

2176
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,280
The non-Jewish portion of it.

2177
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:46,080
And then everything else, of course, could be dismissed.

2178
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,360
And there were some things.

2179
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:51,320
Hasenro did work on the early stages of relativity theory

2180
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,480
and what have you.

2181
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,600
But he wasn't on Einstein.

2182
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:58,560
But it's an illustration of how the cultural context,

2183
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,400
of course, unfortunately, that was a temporary one.

2184
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,920
But what if the Nazis had won?

2185
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,840
There you go.

2186
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,320
Then we wouldn't be talking about Einstein.

2187
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:07,240
We'd be talking about Hasenro.

2188
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:10,080
Well, I think even the history that we have is not reliable.

2189
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,720
So I think if you looked carefully,

2190
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,760
you would find grotesque distortions

2191
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:14,760
in some of our histories.

2192
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:15,280
Exactly.

2193
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,280
Yeah.

2194
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:22,440
Is there any evidence that Jesus are happy?

2195
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,320
Oh.

2196
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,760
Well, I think life satisfaction is actually,

2197
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,880
correct me if I'm wrong, somewhat positively correlated

2198
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,240
with IQ, right?

2199
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,160
So that vague sense.

2200
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:35,960
I don't know that geniuses are necessarily tortured people.

2201
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,560
I knew Richard Feynman.

2202
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:38,640
He was quite happy.

2203
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:40,320
Terry Tao seems quite happy.

2204
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,160
So that's anecdotal.

2205
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,360
It's anecdotal.

2206
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,960
Well, I gave you the statistical result, which is pretty dry.

2207
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,360
This is just positive correlation.

2208
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,680
But there is a problem that, again,

2209
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:51,280
we have to talk about different domains.

2210
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:54,200
Because one of the nice things about working in the sciences

2211
01:33:54,200 --> 01:34:00,480
of mathematics is you know when you're doing good stuff.

2212
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:03,240
You can go ahead and work out the equations, double check.

2213
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,520
You're math to make sure.

2214
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:09,200
But if you get the answer, you've got the answer.

2215
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,200
But what?

2216
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:13,520
And I've done research, too, and showing that the consensus,

2217
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,960
like, for example, in the hard sciences,

2218
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:19,760
they recognize up and coming stars very, very quickly.

2219
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,120
Because they know what's good and what's not.

2220
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:24,800
But if you're in the arts, you know,

2221
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,320
that struggling artist in the attic, it often happens.

2222
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,120
You're not immediately recognized.

2223
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,080
So is it the recognition that makes them happy?

2224
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,320
Or is it the higher?

2225
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:37,160
Well, sometimes it's a two-inch sword.

2226
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,960
You know, you have someone like Truman Capote.

2227
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,800
Yeah, it's really great, you know, to get recognized very early.

2228
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:44,240
But then all of a sudden, there's more pressure on you

2229
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:45,480
if you're a next novel.

2230
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,840
You're the one hit wonder, yeah.

2231
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:49,200
Yeah, and you're just going to parties and getting drunk.

2232
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:53,320
And people were asking about your next novel.

2233
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:56,520
So I wrote a history of happiness before I worked on genius.

2234
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,440
So I've thought about this a little bit.

2235
01:34:58,440 --> 01:34:59,920
And the thing that I would say is

2236
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,680
that there's clearly a myth associated

2237
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:06,000
with genius that correlates with unhappiness,

2238
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,760
with mental instability, and so forth.

2239
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:11,560
So we talked about Aristotle's theory

2240
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:14,120
of that people of eminent achievement

2241
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:17,200
have a superabundance of black bile, of melan, ochre,

2242
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,160
and the Greek, they're melan

2243
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:22,560
and that idea gets kind of reinvented in the Renaissance

2244
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,800
and then again in romanticism.

2245
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:26,640
And you get this idea, which I think is still part of our culture,

2246
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:30,960
that sadness is profound and happiness is sort of superficial,

2247
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,440
that to think and think deeply, you know,

2248
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,760
is like Walter Benjamin says, you know,

2249
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:38,920
every document of Western civilization is a document of barbarism, right?

2250
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,360
That truth is somehow dark.

2251
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,280
Now there may be something to that.

2252
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:47,600
But I think it's also a kind of stylization in a myth.

2253
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,960
And that, as you say, you know, Richard Feimand,

2254
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:51,640
Einstein was comparatively happy.

2255
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:53,960
You know, in Silicon Valley, they're all really happy.

2256
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:54,960
Yeah.

2257
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:55,960
Yeah.

2258
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:56,960
Rich, serious.

2259
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,760
Money does buy.

2260
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,560
So this isn't exactly a question, but sort of an observation.

2261
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:07,200
So I think what the public typically recognizes as genius,

2262
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,640
finding, hitting the target that no one even saw before.

2263
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:13,520
So it's highly specialized in a particular niche.

2264
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,320
So if you think about Mozart, was Mozart also

2265
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,760
a great mathematician?

2266
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:18,760
Probably not.

2267
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:21,520
So that in itself is some kind of a clue

2268
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,680
that it isn't a general brain mechanism.

2269
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:27,680
Just maybe you can comment on that.

2270
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:31,080
Well, why wouldn't it be a general brain?

2271
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,680
So you can have domain specificity.

2272
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,840
And you can have, but I think, you know,

2273
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,840
to, again, to have these modules of the brain,

2274
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,480
there's a module for art and there's a module for math

2275
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:42,600
and there's a module for basketball

2276
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,240
and there's a module for this.

2277
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,400
I mean, it doesn't make it.

2278
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:48,080
It doesn't make sense, right?

2279
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,840
So there has to be some general characteristics

2280
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,640
of brain functioning that come to play.

2281
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,880
It's up in math and not in art or the philosophy.

2282
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:57,160
Well, I don't know.

2283
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:00,040
I mean, you know, historically, actually,

2284
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:04,040
the idea has been that genius is a, you're born with it.

2285
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:04,920
It has to be original.

2286
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:05,920
It can't be learned.

2287
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:08,280
Talent can be learned and acquired, but not genius.

2288
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,120
And it's applicable to multiple domains, right?

2289
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:14,080
So that Mozart made a choice early on,

2290
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:15,840
but he could have gone another way.

2291
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,160
And then you get examples of people

2292
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:20,200
who have genius level capacity in multiple domains,

2293
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,480
like Goethe, right, who is a kind of genius in poetry

2294
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:25,320
and playwriting, good scientist to boot and so forth.

2295
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,360
But I suspect that there's this general module

2296
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,320
wherever you went.

2297
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,880
There's this general brain module or general network

2298
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,120
that comes to play, regardless of the individual domain

2299
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:35,000
that you practice.

2300
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
What it might be that genius is more recognized

2301
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,800
in the sciences and in literature

2302
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:44,320
and that there are genius capabilities that go less

2303
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:48,320
recognized, but this human capacity

2304
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,840
is quite general capability.

2305
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,800
I'd like to just tell us how it's an approach to,

2306
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:00,000
like, intelligence that's kind of emerging now

2307
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,080
because until 50 years ago, very few educators

2308
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:05,400
even knew what a brain was.

2309
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,080
Like, they thought your brain was actually

2310
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,240
a storage place in your body for sperm.

2311
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:12,360
I mean, that's just true.

2312
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:15,320
But I have a little video just to put what I'm going to say

2313
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:16,320
in context.

2314
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,040
It's called, where I have five-year-olds

2315
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,240
who talk about life with more than most adults

2316
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:21,480
and the five-year-olds from New York,

2317
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:25,320
and they say, no adults left behind.

2318
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:27,320
But I've asked over 30 professors

2319
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:28,800
just to put this in context.

2320
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,720
If they knew the etymology, the word intelligence,

2321
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:34,080
which has been brought up today, none of them have known.

2322
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,480
I'm just curious if any of you know

2323
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,600
the etymology of intelligence, which you might have known

2324
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,040
in the second grade.

2325
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,640
Do any of you know?

2326
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:43,560
OK, if you just cut the word in half,

2327
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:45,640
intelli means between the other half of the word is

2328
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:47,880
legary, which means to choose.

2329
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,640
Intelligence literally means to choose between,

2330
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,440
that you're not using your brain supposedly

2331
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,760
until you're making a choice.

2332
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:55,560
OK.

2333
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,640
But the point where I'm coming from

2334
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,400
is that basically the way the brain

2335
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:03,880
works with the new research and brain research now,

2336
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:06,920
basically the way your eyes work is the way your brain works.

2337
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:10,000
That's why you say, I see what you mean.

2338
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,480
I use my imagination.

2339
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,840
But ironically, you cannot see, as you know,

2340
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:16,040
without moving your eyes.

2341
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:18,280
You have a fovea, narrow point.

2342
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:21,720
So you have to be moving your eyes very.

2343
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,320
So they say in a state of nature,

2344
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:26,080
when a human being, like I said, we all live in the Amazon

2345
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,960
rainforest, we've been moving our eyes

2346
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,280
left, right, up, down all the time,

2347
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,280
and our brains evolved that way.

2348
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,920
So in the state of nature, a human brain

2349
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:38,000
evolved to be aware of seven streams of awareness simultaneously.

2350
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,760
That's why seven is the sacred number.

2351
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:43,000
When we lock up our eyes on static letters we read and write,

2352
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,680
we actually atrophy the way our brain operates,

2353
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,960
and we go from seven, like, to one.

2354
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,000
So when you hear that a human brain is naturally,

2355
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,400
and maybe these people in these genius states,

2356
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:57,000
are more open that they're not locked in to just doing

2357
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,760
what they've been told.

2358
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,320
So they're moving their eyes.

2359
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,400
Their brain is open, and they have access

2360
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:05,800
to that seven, the natural sacred number.

2361
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,160
And because they do, they maybe have taken a stroll

2362
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:12,640
at a Plato's cave with the shadows or letters on the...

2363
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:16,040
But what about, you know, when you hear about the seven point

2364
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:21,120
natural awareness and the craziness that we're going down,

2365
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,960
we're dumbing ourselves down, atrophying the way our brain

2366
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:27,520
works from seven to one, because we're locking up our eyes

2367
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,560
on letters, and a letter in a name is actually just a name

2368
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:31,640
for an object or an image.

2369
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,560
It's a sound that doesn't mean anything.

2370
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:36,040
Can you do me a favor and ask the question?

2371
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:39,080
Because you keep going around, and we're the best ones.

2372
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:42,520
It's the seven point awareness that is a natural part of us

2373
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:44,600
that's been covered up.

2374
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,280
And now that it could be opened up,

2375
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,720
and people could have access to it,

2376
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:51,080
and you say maybe genius comes from having access to that.

2377
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:53,160
What do you think about that is the new research

2378
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:54,520
that's taking us in that direction?

2379
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:55,520
I can address that.

2380
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:59,600
That's bunk.

2381
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,600
So...

2382
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,600
That's what?

2383
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:03,600
Bunk.

2384
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,600
According to who?

2385
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,600
Me.

2386
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,600
So...

2387
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:09,600
So you said so many things that I could disagree with,

2388
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,600
but I don't want to spend a whole bunch of time.

2389
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,600
So we know very little about how the brain actually functions

2390
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:15,600
as neuroscientists.

2391
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,600
So a lot of the assertions that you make are fundamentally flawed.

2392
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:27,600
I think that the basis of your question is that you're getting

2393
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,600
to a point where you think that people are using their brain

2394
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:33,600
in a different way that you think is flawed, correct?

2395
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,600
No, it's not me.

2396
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:36,600
It's like...

2397
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,600
And just...

2398
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:40,600
All this stuff is coming out of behavioral obtitration training.

2399
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,600
Here's what I'd like to say about that.

2400
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,600
People are using their brain in a different way,

2401
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:47,600
and it's being optimized to their environment.

2402
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:51,600
So that optimization to the environment just reflects a new environment.

2403
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,600
It's a different environment, but it's a new environment

2404
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,600
that that brain's being optimized for.

2405
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,600
I think we should get to the next question.

2406
01:41:58,600 --> 01:41:59,600
Okay.

2407
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:00,600
Thank you.

2408
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:01,600
Thank you.

2409
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,600
Thank you.

2410
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:03,600
Hello.

2411
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,600
Hi.

2412
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:05,600
Good afternoon.

2413
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:10,600
I came in towards the latter part, but I have a question regarding

2414
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:15,600
inheritance of genetic genius, so to speak.

2415
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,600
I don't know how you would put that in factor.

2416
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:22,600
I'm one of a multiple birth of triplets, two boys and a girl.

2417
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:27,600
And basically, a lot of the factors that I noticed in the geniuses

2418
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,600
in the family is that literally we can master things at a early age,

2419
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,600
since like seven, eight, nine, ten years old, and we're everyone.

2420
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:35,600
This is from the 60s and 70s.

2421
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,600
I'm last at a baby boomers.

2422
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,600
So, yes.

2423
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:39,600
You and me both.

2424
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:40,600
Yeah.

2425
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:41,600
I'm 51.

2426
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,600
It feels great.

2427
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,600
But it doesn't feel so great to me, but...

2428
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,600
I'm doing yum.

2429
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:47,600
I'm doing yum.

2430
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:51,600
The factor is that my brothers, I'm the only girl.

2431
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:57,600
So, the two identical boys, I'm wondering if this is a factor.

2432
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,600
The first boy was born.

2433
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:03,600
I had my own embryonic sac, which I call my condo.

2434
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,600
I came between the second.

2435
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:06,600
I came as the second.

2436
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:10,600
And then the third one, the two identical boys were separated.

2437
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:15,600
I came between, and I didn't understand if that was a factor of what happened

2438
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:20,600
to the oldest boy, because things started happening.

2439
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:23,600
Ten, psychologically.

2440
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:28,600
And I wanted me coming between the two births of the two boys.

2441
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:30,600
It became...

2442
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:33,600
You know, only God knows, but the family always said, it was you.

2443
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,600
You came between the two identical boys.

2444
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:37,600
He separated them.

2445
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:38,600
And, you know, I know what he says.

2446
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:39,600
He said, talk.

2447
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,600
I think you answered your own question.

2448
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:41,600
Only God knows that.

2449
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:42,600
Yeah.

2450
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,600
And trust me, that's been my sanity.

2451
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,600
But the fact of my question is, again, is...

2452
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:55,600
They were geniuses way before I considered myself a genius,

2453
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,600
because where they mastered technology in old school days,

2454
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:03,600
there was always a motherboard hanging around the technology,

2455
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,600
the big zen of TV tubes.

2456
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,600
I'm seven years old.

2457
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,600
Everyone's sitting in the living room.

2458
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:11,600
I know how to go on the back and fix the zen of tubes.

2459
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:16,600
Take the ones that's in the kitchen cabinet and fix the TV in the back

2460
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,600
and just sit back down and look again at the TV.

2461
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:21,600
And everybody's like, what did you just do?

2462
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,600
How did you just do that?

2463
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:24,600
There's a lot of things I've done in my life.

2464
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,600
I could never explain on 51.

2465
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,600
I still can't explain.

2466
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:31,600
But it can come to me with numbers, even visions.

2467
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:35,600
And I can master it, where it takes someone to go to school for eight years,

2468
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,600
even to get a master's degree.

2469
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:43,600
So on that factor, it's kind of coming to me later now than earlier.

2470
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:46,600
And I was trying to figure out the geniality of it, you know,

2471
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,600
the inheritance.

2472
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:52,600
But, yeah, techs, doctors, lawyers, easy age.

2473
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,600
Like, we can master it.

2474
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:56,600
I studied neurosurgery since it's great.

2475
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:57,600
Can I actually say something?

2476
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,600
Okay.

2477
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:01,600
So you raised an issue that we actually didn't talk about.

2478
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,600
Actually, a couple issues that we didn't talk about.

2479
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:04,600
Oh, okay.

2480
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:05,600
I thought I missed it.

2481
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,600
Yeah.

2482
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,600
There's so many things that you could talk about in this topic.

2483
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,600
Okay.

2484
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:14,600
And one thing that is really interesting to me is there is some work

2485
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:22,600
on the intrauterine environment as a factor in the emergence of at least certain kinds

2486
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:24,600
of genius.

2487
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:27,600
And like, there's something called a, I mean, it's not completely established.

2488
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,600
Here's another good notion, right?

2489
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:36,600
That the interuterine environment can influence brain growth at a very early age

2490
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:42,600
that has lifelong consequences, particularly for developing certain kinds of

2491
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:48,600
exceptional abilities like in mathematics or music, for example.

2492
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:51,600
But we still don't understand it.

2493
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:55,600
But we do know, I mean, obviously brain chemists is being influenced by that which

2494
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,600
ambiotic society you happen to be in, right?

2495
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,600
If it's a different one than others.

2496
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:01,600
Yeah, we just...

2497
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,600
Another issue thanks to your prompt is birth order.

2498
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,600
It was actually Francis Galton who did the first study of birth order.

2499
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:13,600
And of course, you have two brothers.

2500
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:19,600
Birth order interacts with gender as well.

2501
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,600
I mean, I did a study, really interesting study.

2502
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:25,600
Well, we researchers always think we do really interesting studies.

2503
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,600
You may disagree.

2504
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,600
You actually do interesting studies.

2505
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:34,600
But I did a study of eminent women in psychology, eminent scientists in psychology.

2506
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:42,600
And women, and comparing them to comparably eminent men, looking at birth order.

2507
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:47,600
And I found that there's a tendency for...

2508
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,600
And this is just a scenario.

2509
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:56,600
A tendency for not only for women to be firstborns, firstborns are overrepresented

2510
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,600
among scientists, okay?

2511
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:02,600
But they're even more likely to be firstborns than melisar.

2512
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:05,600
And they're even more likely to come from smaller families.

2513
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:10,600
And they're extremely unlikely to have older brothers, which is spoil things.

2514
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:14,600
Development of talented female scientists.

2515
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:16,600
So there's all these other factors.

2516
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:20,600
You know, it's a whimsical thing like birth order.

2517
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,600
Yeah.

2518
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:26,600
Or, you know, the chemistry of your intrauterine environment can have...

2519
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,600
Let me just get you another arbitrary thing.

2520
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:31,600
It's sort of like birth order, but even more arbitrary than birth order.

2521
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:35,600
There was a study done of music competitions.

2522
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,600
You know, these big things like the...

2523
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,600
You know, clivering kind of competition.

2524
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:40,600
People come in.

2525
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:42,600
They play a piece of music.

2526
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:49,600
And they deliberately have a piece of music that nobody knows, including the judges,

2527
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,600
to equalize things.

2528
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:54,600
So they're all doing the rock, mononoth, third or something.

2529
01:47:54,600 --> 01:48:00,600
And what's interesting is that they find that the people are more likely to win the prize

2530
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,600
or the people will perform later in the competition,

2531
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:08,600
because by then everybody's more familiar with this new piece of music.

2532
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:10,600
They've heard all the little glitches.

2533
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:12,600
And it's, by the way, it's random assignment.

2534
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:13,600
It's random assignment.

2535
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,600
What order you perform?

2536
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:16,600
Okay.

2537
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,600
Just to...

2538
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,600
Okay.

2539
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:24,600
I mostly among creative people, spent among creative people.

2540
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:30,600
Artists, poets, and writers.

2541
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:40,600
And I could say that among artists, it's very few really intelligent people.

2542
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:44,600
And...

2543
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:47,600
Better you said that than him.

2544
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:55,600
So much more among poets and more among writers.

2545
01:48:55,600 --> 01:49:03,600
And they try to suppress their intelligence with the legal drugs very often.

2546
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:16,600
So my first question about how you can comment that people deliberately try to suppress

2547
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:21,600
their intelligence with the legal drugs to be more creative.

2548
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:33,600
And second question is, it's several years ago I read about several women who took sperm

2549
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:41,600
from noble lawyers and give blood to kids.

2550
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:52,600
And then when these kids start to grow, they encounter very big problems how to raise them.

2551
01:49:52,600 --> 01:50:03,600
And now they fighting for ability to learn who really drew their parents and how they can connect with these kids.

2552
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:10,600
Because it was like manipulation of genetics.

2553
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:20,600
And it seems like you have at least two loved person who give blood to your child that understands what is going on.

2554
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:24,600
Because they just don't understand.

2555
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:32,600
And they are autistic with problems and they don't get also suffering.

2556
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,600
They don't know what to do.

2557
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:41,600
So if we manipulate genetics of our kids we won't know how to deal with it.

2558
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:53,600
So that's two questions, the legal drugs and if we manipulate genetics would be recognizing and going to raise our kids.

2559
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:57,600
Can I address the first question if I understood it correctly?

2560
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:00,600
About suppressing intelligence in the...

2561
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:03,600
Because it won't go for artists in musicians.

2562
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:08,600
Since we're at the Sacramento-Liddick Institute I should bring in Freud at least somewhere.

2563
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:14,600
Freud actually addressed this issue and one of his essays he was dealing with the question,

2564
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:20,600
why is it that critics aren't very creative?

2565
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:27,600
They know everything about films, they know everything about novels, everything about poetry.

2566
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:30,600
They can't create one themselves.

2567
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:32,600
And he specifically said...

2568
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:33,600
And they know that, right?

2569
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:37,600
And it's because they're 100% secondary process.

2570
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:41,600
They never allow the primary process any latitude.

2571
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:47,600
The second the primary process is coming with some kind of crazy idea, it's merely squelch.

2572
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:48,600
By the super eager...

2573
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:49,600
That would make a lousy movie.

2574
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:56,600
I mean Dean's theory seems very plausible to me because I think if you want to be open to the creative process

2575
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:59,600
you maybe want to suspend judgment.

2576
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:04,600
And the kind of thing we call intelligence is a kind of analytical judgment that maybe you're trying to suppress

2577
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:06,600
when you try to get new influences.

2578
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:13,600
As far as your second question, so I think there's been at least one book written about the Nobel Prize sperm bank.

2579
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:20,600
And oftentimes when people review that book, because they don't think statistically they just think anecdotally,

2580
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:23,600
they try to portray it as a huge failure or something.

2581
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:28,600
But if you just made a prediction based on genetics of what would happen if you took sperm from a bunch of Nobel laureates

2582
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:33,600
and you gave it to a bunch of recipients, you'd probably say that the kids will be somewhat higher in IQ

2583
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:38,600
on average because they're getting genes from a high IQ, at least one of their parents is high IQ

2584
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:40,600
and probably the other one maybe as well.

2585
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:45,600
Secondly, maybe some eccentricities like things like autism might be more prevalent in that population.

2586
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:48,600
And I think that's roughly what was found.

2587
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:54,600
So I don't think it's more or less conforms with what just on the basis of genetic theory you would predict would have happened

2588
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,600
with this sperm bank.

2589
01:52:56,600 --> 01:53:01,600
Now some people who wrote the books on this would say, oh well it's awful that it didn't produce another Nobel Prize winner.

2590
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:04,600
It should have definitely produced a Nobel Prize winner otherwise it's a failure.

2591
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:06,600
But I think that's going way too far.

2592
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:12,600
No, I'm thinking about how today as a child that you don't have any connection.

2593
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:14,600
That's the point of what is the beginning?

2594
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:19,600
Is it just little kids?

2595
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:22,600
These women don't know how to raise them.

2596
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:28,600
They have very big difficulties with these kids because they cannot connect with them at all.

2597
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:29,600
I see.

2598
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:35,600
Is it different than the problem they say a parent of an autistic child would have?

2599
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:37,600
Similar?

2600
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:38,600
No, maybe similar.

2601
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:39,600
I don't know.

2602
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:40,600
I'm not a human.

2603
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:45,600
I don't know.

2604
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:49,600
I don't know.

2605
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:53,600
But there must be also, I would predict some similarities between the child and the mother.

2606
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:58,600
And you would think the maternal love is still there and everything.

2607
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:03,600
I wouldn't expect it to be as quite as bad as you described it.

2608
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:04,600
Okay.

2609
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:05,600
Okay.

2610
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:13,600
Well, I have some problems with the language you've been using and I have a problem with

2611
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:16,600
the concept of IQ test.

2612
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:21,600
First of all, genius, maybe the word is been overused.

2613
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:28,600
Maybe we should say creativity because genius has so many problems connected to it.

2614
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:34,600
The other aspect of things, the IQ test.

2615
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:38,600
Well, I find it a very problematic thing.

2616
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:47,600
And I always see the creative individual as having a mode of thinking maybe with different

2617
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,600
synapses, different ways of approaching something.

2618
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:53,600
And an IQ test is too standardized.

2619
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:59,600
And I remember taking when I was so bored that I decided I couldn't bother with it.

2620
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:02,600
And I looked at my neighbor and I said, I'll just copy that.

2621
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:06,600
And they told me, oh, you're a wonderful, you're an average person.

2622
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,600
I said, oh, thank you.

2623
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:14,600
But I think we have to find a different way to define intelligence.

2624
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:20,600
And I think it's a very complex, the way creative people think.

2625
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:23,600
There is some form of deviancy even.

2626
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:26,600
Maybe they can't even deal with the normal situations of things.

2627
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:31,600
Sometimes I think of it as the pearl that has an irritant and they have to find a way around

2628
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:32,600
a problem.

2629
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:36,600
So I think the problem in the brain is not going to be very standardized.

2630
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:39,600
It's going to be a very common, I'm an artist.

2631
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:48,600
But it's a very complex aspect of how different synapses connect different things.

2632
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:54,600
And creativity lies in this strange way of organizing and assimilating the world.

2633
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:57,600
And we have so much knowledge now that it's true.

2634
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:03,600
One of the problems you brought up is for true creativity, it's very difficult because there's

2635
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:08,600
so much more of a branch of knowledge than even Leonardo da Vinci had to have.

2636
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:11,600
And I know they're not questions, but I can try.

2637
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:13,600
And what question?

2638
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:14,600
You want questions?

2639
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:15,600
All right.

2640
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:18,600
Well, the question is the structure of the brain.

2641
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:20,600
Can it be measured by an IQ test?

2642
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:23,600
Are we really speaking about the true measurement?

2643
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:30,600
And the other thing is the conflict between individual intelligence and collective intelligence

2644
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:33,600
where a group of individuals are working out a problem together.

2645
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:35,600
Then we're into another problem.

2646
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:39,600
But I'll just keep the structural problem of the brain.

2647
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:44,600
Do we really know what intelligence is or how it operates?

2648
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:47,600
That's your question, Guy.

2649
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:52,600
So we've correlated intelligence tests with the structure of the brain.

2650
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:57,600
Many researchers have done this and found the correlations to be low, but significant

2651
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:58,600
across studies.

2652
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:05,600
So I wrote a paper in 2007 in behavioral and brain sciences where I reviewed all the

2653
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:09,600
studies looking at the correlations between the structure of the brain and these various

2654
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:10,600
measures of intelligence.

2655
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:14,600
And that's called the parietal frontal integration theory of intelligence.

2656
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:21,600
So it summarizes kind of a network in the brain that underlies the ability of humans

2657
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:28,600
anyway to express intelligent behavior as manifested on these particular kinds of tests.

2658
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:35,600
So there is a significant correlate between the structure of the brain and performance

2659
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:36,600
on these tests.

2660
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:42,600
As you would expect, whether it's creativity, personality, intelligence, just about anything

2661
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:49,600
our brain does, motor behavior, there's going to be some correlates that are found in the

2662
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:52,600
brain and certainly we found that with intelligence.

2663
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:57,600
I would have addressed the collective intelligence idea because this gets back to what we talked

2664
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:02,600
about earlier about collaboration being very important in certain fields, picking the

2665
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:03,600
sciences.

2666
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:11,600
And one thing I think is fascinating is that there's a kind of isomorphism between how

2667
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:18,600
creativity operates in a group and how creativity operates within a single individual who's

2668
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:19,600
highly creative.

2669
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:24,600
What I mean by that is we mentioned earlier that highly creative people tend to score

2670
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:28,600
very high on openness to experience and they have multicultural experiences.

2671
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:31,600
They have lots of very wide interests.

2672
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:35,600
They're just very, very open to a lot of different possibilities.

2673
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:37,600
They have a lot of different hobbies.

2674
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:42,600
There's one interesting study for example that stratified scientists from the elite of

2675
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:48,600
Nobel laureates to only members of the National Academy of Sciences.

2676
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:55,600
And then people who didn't even get that high and looked at their their educational interests.

2677
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:58,600
And it was beautiful.

2678
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:02,600
More artistic interests as you go higher up.

2679
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:05,600
So diversity is really interesting.

2680
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:06,600
They're complexity.

2681
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:11,600
They're heterogeneity of their minds, their interests, and their even their expertise.

2682
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:13,600
I think I could play the piano.

2683
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:14,600
I can also sell a book.

2684
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:17,600
I don't know how much expertise is involved in that.

2685
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:24,600
If you look at groups, when the main predictors are creativity in a group is how heterogeneous

2686
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:27,600
the group membership is.

2687
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:29,600
Do they differ in their training?

2688
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:30,600
Do they differ in gender?

2689
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:33,600
Do they differ in ethnicity?

2690
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:37,600
It's an amazing phenomenon that really diverse groups.

2691
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:41,600
So in a sense what you do, you're having is instead of having all that diversity in a

2692
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:48,600
single brain, you're having a division of labor, of diversity is distributed within the group

2693
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:49,600
membership working on a problem.

2694
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:51,600
It becomes a neural net that solves problems.

2695
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:52,600
Yeah, neural net work.

2696
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:57,600
You have to have lots of different abilities to be able to solve that problem well.

2697
01:59:57,600 --> 01:59:58,600
Okay.

2698
01:59:58,600 --> 01:59:59,600
Hi.

2699
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:00,600
Dr.

2700
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:03,600
I have like two five second questions.

2701
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:07,600
Yeah, it's okay.

2702
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,600
In the forms of question.

2703
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:10,600
Yeah.

2704
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:11,600
Wow.

2705
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:17,600
The first one is working hand in hand was mentioned in lateral conductivity.

2706
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:21,600
I was wondering if there's anything left and right brain balancing.

2707
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:24,600
There are brain balancing centers.

2708
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:26,600
Yeah, I can answer that very quickly.

2709
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:31,600
So this left brain right thing is considered to be neuro mythology at this point.

2710
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:37,600
And certainly you need all of your brain to do creative tasks as you do intelligent tasks.

2711
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:44,600
So this comes from work by Spery and Gazanica in the 1970s who did corpus callosodemies on

2712
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:46,600
patients with epilepsy is a long story.

2713
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:49,600
But they found that the hemisphere's function rather differently.

2714
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:54,600
Language tends to be in the left hemisphere and nonverbal stuff tends to be in the right hemisphere.

2715
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:57,600
It's got taken up by the popular press like wildfire.

2716
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:01,600
The one is intensely active, the other one is not nearly as active.

2717
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:02,600
No.

2718
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:05,600
This is working on activating the other one with certain activities.

2719
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:11,600
So during creative activity the activation pattern is moving around during in these different

2720
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:15,600
networks and there's probably suppression of different parts of the brain, activation of

2721
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:19,600
the other different parts of the brain, but that moves around from place to place.

2722
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:20,600
It's not isolated.

2723
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:21,600
It's not isolated.

2724
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:29,600
The other question is, any research on proactively cultivating EQ and the correlation with a rise

2725
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:31,600
in IQ as a result?

2726
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:36,600
This is an easy question because I don't know hardly anything about EQ.

2727
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:42,600
I would expect, I think, you might know something a little bit about EQ that is probably a little,

2728
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:53,600
it is emotional intelligence or emotional intelligence is going to be somewhat positively related to

2729
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:56,600
intelligence because of the general factor of intelligence.

2730
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:59,600
I would guess, but I don't know anything beyond that.

2731
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:04,600
The problem is that the psychometric properties have emotional intelligence.

2732
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:07,600
It's not at the same level.

2733
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:11,600
It turns out to be a very heterogeneous construct.

2734
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:15,600
It's just sort of like creativity in comparison to general intelligence.

2735
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:17,600
So it's a real mess.

2736
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:19,600
You know what's going on?

2737
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:24,600
There's no correlation study as far as, oh, you work hard on raising your kids EQ that would

2738
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,600
really be a good question.

2739
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:26,600
I don't know if any of these.

2740
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:28,600
I mean, there may be, I wouldn't know.

2741
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:30,600
But I would like to answer that.

2742
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:34,600
I don't know if this is valid or not, but I've never seen some study where, at the point of this,

2743
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:39,600
you know, this mythology of, you know, writers of left hemisphere, it was very interesting

2744
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:43,600
that my dad was, maybe his hope or something like the HOPPE.

2745
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:44,600
Yeah.

2746
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:45,600
Yeah.

2747
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:46,600
Yeah.

2748
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:52,600
And it was something about that they can't understand metaphor because they have to put

2749
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:57,600
things together from both sides of the brain.

2750
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:00,600
Like, you might like a neurological study of patients.

2751
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:07,600
And, yeah, and one of the experiments I thought was really brilliant is that you show people

2752
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:15,600
a film clip where there's a kid playing on a swing and then a ball goes out in the street

2753
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:21,600
and the kid definitely runs out in the street and then all of a sudden you just see this

2754
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:22,600
empty swing.

2755
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:24,600
Yeah, what happens next?

2756
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:25,600
Yeah.

2757
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:26,600
Or what happened?

2758
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:27,600
Right.

2759
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:28,600
What happened?

2760
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:33,600
And people who have normal intact corpus callosis figure that out and people who have split

2761
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:35,600
brains can't figure out what happened.

2762
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:37,600
No, it gets weirder than that.

2763
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:41,600
You have patients that will be, you know, buttoning their shirt with one hand and unbuttoning

2764
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:43,600
it with the other.

2765
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:47,600
The two hemispheres function independently right after the surgery.

2766
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:50,600
So, yeah, friends like that.

2767
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:57,600
And if the hemispheres can't communicate from a neuropsychologist by training, from a neuropsychological

2768
02:03:57,600 --> 02:04:03,600
perspective, it gets really interesting if you can show someone a key only in their right

2769
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:09,600
hemisphere, for example, and you can do this with tekistoscopic presentation on the retina

2770
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:14,600
and they can't access it, they can feel it, they can touch it, but they can't name it.

2771
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:18,600
They don't have access to the language module, they can't name the key.

2772
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:25,100
It's really fascinating to see the modularity then of the brain functioning when you can

2773
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:26,100
split the corpus callosis.

2774
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:28,600
So, if you want to increase your creativity, do not get a split brain.

2775
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:29,600
No, no.

2776
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:34,600
You need both halves of your brain to be creative or intelligent.

2777
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:35,600
Or have personal...

2778
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:37,600
Last three questions.

2779
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:42,600
First of all, thank you for having the discussion and thank you for steaming it live.

2780
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:47,600
My friend is watching it right now and he has the question, can you comment on the current

2781
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:50,600
state of research on enhancing fluid intelligence?

2782
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:54,600
Do we know of any methods just enhancing that part?

2783
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:55,600
Enhancing, oh, yes.

2784
02:04:55,600 --> 02:05:06,600
Yes, so Dr. Yege from California, UC Irvine, I believe she is at now, did some working

2785
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:11,600
memory training to increase intelligence and the theory is that you can do this dual

2786
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:17,600
and back type of, which is a very difficult task to do where you're keeping streams of

2787
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:18,600
information going.

2788
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:20,600
Yeah, it's very unpleasant actually.

2789
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:26,600
You want to shoot yourself after you do this type of task, which is the best decision you

2790
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:27,600
could make.

2791
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:32,600
But the theory was that you did this working memory task and because the working memory

2792
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:37,600
networks are parietal frontal distribution, overlap the intelligence networks, you could

2793
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:39,600
increase your intelligence.

2794
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:47,600
So she published this in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science and many

2795
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:50,600
people have attempted to replicate this in different ways.

2796
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:57,600
She's replicated it and it's very equivocal about whether this actually does and the

2797
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:58,600
research.

2798
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:03,600
The best digestion of the research that I can give you is that there's near transfer and

2799
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,600
far transfer.

2800
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:09,600
And if you do a working memory task, you are likely to increase working memory, but the

2801
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:13,600
likelihood of increasing intelligence, which is kind of far away, is rather low.

2802
02:06:13,600 --> 02:06:16,600
If you do an attention task, you're likely to increase attention.

2803
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:20,600
If you do a visual spatial task, you're likely to increase visual spatial ability.

2804
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:27,600
But to have that transfer to other tasks is not been well demonstrated through replication.

2805
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:33,600
We used to have that belief that brain exercise is good for you.

2806
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:35,600
It's like exercising your muscles.

2807
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:40,600
It doesn't matter if you're lifting a dumbbell or whatever, you know, lifting up is lifting

2808
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:41,600
up.

2809
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:46,600
It doesn't seem to be that case, you know, so...

2810
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:47,600
Or that easy.

2811
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:51,600
Yeah, so that you say learn Latin and make sure it's smarter.

2812
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:52,600
Well, no.

2813
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:54,600
I'd rather do the dual end back task.

2814
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:56,600
Yeah, you're right.

2815
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:57,600
No.

2816
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:58,600
Thank you.

2817
02:06:58,600 --> 02:06:59,600
Next question.

2818
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:01,600
No, we had three.

2819
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:03,600
You're going to be the fourth.

2820
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:04,600
No.

2821
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:06,600
I have two there.

2822
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:07,600
Okay.

2823
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:08,600
All right.

2824
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:09,600
Go ahead.

2825
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:14,600
But many years ago, I wrote a song called I Used to Think I Am a Genius.

2826
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:17,600
My great fun singing that to roomfuls of genius.

2827
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:19,600
I just want to quote the last line.

2828
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:21,600
I used to think I'm a genius.

2829
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,600
Please don't ask me why.

2830
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:24,600
But now I know I'm not a genius.

2831
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:26,600
I'm just a wonderful guy.

2832
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:27,600
All right.

2833
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:28,600
Next.

2834
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:29,600
Perfect.

2835
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:39,600
I guess.

2836
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:46,600
Is there a corollary for genius being attached to ineptitude in other areas such that people

2837
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:51,600
like Einstein might not have been able to wash his clothes or set the table while he was,

2838
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:56,600
you know, fastnesses of physics and so forth.

2839
02:07:56,600 --> 02:08:01,600
I have noticed very, very intelligent people often don't manage without something to do

2840
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:05,600
their washing or clothing or set the table or something like that.

2841
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:06,600
Thank you.

2842
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:08,600
I think that's a very interesting question.

2843
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:14,100
So there's a stereotype that we all know about, right, that the great genius can't handle

2844
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:16,600
everyday things, can't tie their shoes, they're clumsy.

2845
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:21,600
And I'm guessing that if you're really careful, carefully study this issue, it's not true.

2846
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:26,600
But I think that if you were intensely interested in your work and you just wanted to achieve

2847
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:31,600
in that narrow sphere as much as possible, it would be great if you could outsource your

2848
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:36,600
daily task to someone else to help you free up.

2849
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:39,600
I really, I would love to see a study actually.

2850
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:43,600
I mean, if you just look at the sort of not focused on genius, but just focused on sort

2851
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:48,600
of the broader population and sort of IQ, you find that people who have IQs, they tend to

2852
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:52,600
also be good at lots of things, so they're not necessarily incapable.

2853
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:58,600
And Terman actually found this, I think, in his group that they were quite healthy, physically

2854
02:08:58,600 --> 02:09:03,600
strong, healthy group of people and they didn't seem to have particular handicaps.

2855
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:08,600
But you mentioned, I mean, I think what it is, you do have these obviously strong cases,

2856
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:13,600
conspicuous cases like Albert Einstein, but even Hannah, you have to be very careful,

2857
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:15,600
because a lot of times he was very smart.

2858
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:18,600
I mean, yeah, he's got his priorities and he wants to work.

2859
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:23,600
So like, yeah, he didn't wear socks, okay?

2860
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:26,600
But he had a very good reason for not wearing the socks.

2861
02:09:26,600 --> 02:09:29,600
It's because he always got holes in them and he says, it's ridiculous.

2862
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:32,600
Always wear something that you wear out.

2863
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:33,600
So he stopped wearing a sock.

2864
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:38,600
He was once asked for his phone number and he said, well, okay, let me just see if I can find it.

2865
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:41,600
And he said, you don't know your phone number?

2866
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:46,600
And he says, I can always look it up.

2867
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:48,600
So I think that's actually smart.

2868
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:52,600
He's got his priorities kind of organized in the right way.

2869
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:58,600
And Carler with that is an outsized appetite, I think, goes with high intelligence such

2870
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:03,600
that I know Einstein was very sexual with many women.

2871
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:04,600
Many men are, of course.

2872
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:06,600
But I think...

2873
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:09,600
Or would like to see many women are...

2874
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:12,600
That's part of the openness to experience.

2875
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:17,600
That's part of the human experience.

2876
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:26,600
But I make a connection between an outsized brain with an outside need for food, perhaps

2877
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:31,600
sexual appetites as well as other inputs that feed the creativity.

2878
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:34,600
And I don't think it's ridiculous to hypothesize that.

2879
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:39,600
I mean, Newton never had a lover, another Emmanuel Kant.

2880
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:42,600
But that connection between sexuality and genius is a long history.

2881
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:46,600
In fact, the word genius that I mentioned before, Latin, comes from the Latin verb,

2882
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:48,600
genogeneré, which means to generate.

2883
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:50,600
It gives us genes and genitals.

2884
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:55,600
And there's an association drawn very early on that productivity is somehow sexual.

2885
02:10:55,600 --> 02:11:03,600
If you've ever seen the famous statue by Rodin of Balzac that's in the sixth hour when he's more of Paris,

2886
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:05,600
you know, he's in...

2887
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:08,600
He always rode at night and he would wear these great overcoats.

2888
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:11,600
And there's a kind of conspicuous bulge there in one part.

2889
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:15,600
Well, in his studio afterwards, they found there are all these studies of Rodin holding his phallus.

2890
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:21,600
And so this is this kind of myth of the pro-dian artist who is sexual, but I think that's largely a myth.

2891
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:23,600
But nonetheless.

2892
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:31,600
It also touches upon perhaps something that we've not quite talked about.

2893
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:34,600
I mean, it's been a very cortical-centric discussion.

2894
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:41,600
But if somebody like Pang stuff is correct in terms of the seven areas of the brain stem,

2895
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:51,600
seeking rage, lust, play, et cetera, then what contribution does this have to what we consider to be

2896
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:54,600
hiding at higher levels of creativity, genius?

2897
02:11:54,600 --> 02:11:55,600
Certainly.

2898
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:56,600
Yeah.

2899
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:57,600
I mean, it must be there somewhere.

2900
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:03,600
These very basic type of instinctual types of responses either have to be kept at bay

2901
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:09,600
while we're doing those higher meaningful things or incorporated somehow.

2902
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:14,600
So they're open area of research and we must understand how they play.

2903
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:17,600
And they may play out in these sexual appetites.

2904
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:20,600
They may play out in addictive appetites and other,

2905
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:24,600
a pettitive type of behavior in very important ways that we don't understand.

2906
02:12:24,600 --> 02:12:26,600
I think that's fascinating.

2907
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:28,600
The last question is the...

2908
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:30,600
The last question.

2909
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:31,600
The last question.

2910
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:32,600
The last question.

2911
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:34,600
Yours will be the last.

2912
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:40,600
About intelligence testing at the idea of stage before pre-implantation?

2913
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:45,600
Whatever is possible right now, how much would that cost?

2914
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:51,600
And if there's an equivalent of a more law, what we can expect that to cost in five or ten years?

2915
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:58,600
Yeah, so the main issue now is the availability of large amount of data so you can build the predictive model.

2916
02:12:58,600 --> 02:13:02,600
So we just don't have good predictive models for cognitive ability based on genotype now.

2917
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:07,600
We do for things like height and other things, but not for IQ yet.

2918
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:10,600
The cost is actually not very high.

2919
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:17,600
So the cost to do the genotype being is on the order of a few hundred dollars actually for that embryo.

2920
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:20,600
And so I don't think the cost is the real barrier.

2921
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:25,600
The barrier is just getting enough data so that you can build the predictive models.

2922
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:28,600
Do you think the open source or the data will be able to...

2923
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:35,600
I think that these predictive models, whether they are predictive of disease conditions,

2924
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:38,600
disease susceptibility or physical proportion, whatever it is,

2925
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:43,600
they will be among the most valuable pieces of intellectual property

2926
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:48,600
because they basically deal with the internal blueprints of the human species.

2927
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:53,600
And so whether they'll be open sourced, I don't know.

2928
02:13:53,600 --> 02:13:57,600
Okay, last question.

2929
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:03,600
Edison, Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Steve Jobs, Branson, Newton.

2930
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:07,600
They say they would dyslexic, right, and a lot of others.

2931
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:13,600
Is dyslexia a really a learning disability or is it something to do with the genius?

2932
02:14:13,600 --> 02:14:19,600
And also the visual and verbal, right?

2933
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:22,600
A lot of these people had visual thoughts.

2934
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:24,600
They didn't think verbally, right?

2935
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:31,600
So again, is dyslexia really a learning disability or is just a different way of thinking?

2936
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:37,600
And people with dyslexia are being dictated by the people in the bell curve in the middle?

2937
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:39,600
With the learning side.

2938
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:44,600
Well, from a neuropsychological perspective, dyslexia, reading is a relatively new human behavior

2939
02:14:44,600 --> 02:14:48,600
that's rather unusual for the brain to do, but the brain can do it.

2940
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:52,600
And the brain of most people can do it, but the brain of some people cannot.

2941
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:56,600
So dyslexia is an interesting neuropsychological phenomenon,

2942
02:14:56,600 --> 02:15:00,600
and people who are dyslexic use their brains in different ways,

2943
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:07,600
and so they develop other strengths to compensate for this lack of reading ability.

2944
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:10,600
And that may have something to do with their creative ability.

2945
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:17,600
And you do see some studies support an over-flight, over-representation of dyslexia and creative endeavors,

2946
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:24,600
but I think there's something interesting there, but like the mad genius,

2947
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:25,600
I think we could...

2948
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:26,600
We have a mad genius, too.

2949
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:27,600
We wouldn't want to put too much in it.

2950
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:32,600
There's something interesting there worth exploring, but we wouldn't want to have an equivalence.

2951
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:38,600
Because your dyslexic means that you're more likely to become a genius.

2952
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:40,600
The fact that you have a really high...

2953
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:41,600
I wouldn't say that.

2954
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:42,600
Well, though...

2955
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:46,600
The fact that you have a really high IQ means that you're inevitably going to become a genius.

2956
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:52,600
It makes things more interesting as these things coalesce and come together in the individual brain

2957
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:55,600
that you have a high IQ, and that you might be dyslexic,

2958
02:15:55,600 --> 02:15:59,600
and that the conditions were right that genius may emerge,

2959
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:05,600
but we don't have the recipe that gives you that inevitable.

2960
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:12,600
It may not even be a recipe, because it could be that we have several alternative ways of attaining the same end.

2961
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:20,600
In fact, I had worked with a graduate student, and we published earlier this year a study we did in African Americans,

2962
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:23,600
and the testis hypothesis.

2963
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:27,600
And this hypothesis is something we call diversifying experiences,

2964
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:35,600
and that somehow we got to break a person away from the path of conventional thinking, conventional learning,

2965
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:39,600
towing a line, conforming to what everybody else believes.

2966
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:41,600
If you're going to become a major innovator.

2967
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:46,600
The thing is, though, there's no one way you need to do that.

2968
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:48,600
There are multiple ways you can do that.

2969
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:53,600
So there's a large inventory of childhood experiences,

2970
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:59,600
and things like both physical and cognitive disabilities are in that list,

2971
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:04,600
that seem to have higher frequencies, but they're not high enough to say,

2972
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:07,600
well, that's essential.

2973
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:10,600
It's just one of several different options.

2974
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:12,600
A parent dying is another one.

2975
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:13,600
Yeah, a parent dying, orphanhood.

2976
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:15,600
Another thing.

2977
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:22,600
Some kind of trauma in early childhood often is associated with later creative achievement,

2978
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:23,600
but you can have too much.

2979
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:25,600
We talk about a sweet spot.

2980
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:30,600
So all these things you can collect, it can be one of those things, you know?

2981
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:34,600
And then you find a sweet spot, and that sweet spot will vary according to other things.

2982
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:39,600
So the reason why we're focused on African Americans is they obviously have a lot of diversifying experiences

2983
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:43,600
beyond what majority culture Americans have to deal with,

2984
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:50,600
and we actually looked at things like major episode discrimination and things like that in their lives.

2985
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:53,600
These are all very eminent people.

2986
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:57,600
Like Maya Angelou was in the sample.

2987
02:17:57,600 --> 02:18:01,600
In fact, we published a study just before she died.

2988
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:08,600
But anyway, and what we found, of course, is that for African Americans, the sweet spot is lower.

2989
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:12,600
So you can have too much of these diversifying experiences.

2990
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:16,600
Whereas if you're in the majority culture,

2991
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:22,600
you're the threat of just doing everything the way everybody else is doing it as much greater,

2992
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:25,600
then you need a bigger push of these things.

2993
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:29,600
But the point, to get back to the original question, is that all these things are involved,

2994
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:33,600
and if you have too many of them, then you're going to be over the sweet spot.

2995
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:38,600
So if that dyslexia plus your lost your mom, or whatever it happens to be,

2996
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:40,600
that may be too much for you to handle.

2997
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:45,600
And of course, there's also a resiliency factor that may be in your own constitution.

2998
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:49,600
So people have more resiliency than others as well.

2999
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:51,600
Thank you.

3000
02:18:51,600 --> 02:19:20,600
Thank you.

3001
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:34,600
Thank you.
