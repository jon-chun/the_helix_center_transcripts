1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Okay, so I should just speak.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
I can, okay.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,480
All right, so we're gonna get started.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,720
My name is David Pollins.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,200
I'm head of the Poetry Committee here at Helix.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,520
And I wanna welcome you to the first poetry event in our tradition series, a series which

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,840
will be devoted to the appreciation of literary traditions that are less familiar to a general

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,200
audience.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,360
For future events in this series, we have begun preparations to organize programs on the Palestinian

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:42,200
poet Mahoud Darwish, on Native American poetry, on modern Yiddish poetry, and the literary

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,320
beauty of the Koran.

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,280
I wanted to make a general announcement too that we wanted to apologize for the cancellation

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,160
of the roundtable last week on Love, which has been rescheduled for next Saturday, and

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,440
upcoming in the Helix series is the topology of fear.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,160
What's the date on that?

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,400
March 9th.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,780
On March 16th, we'll have the first event in our Legacy series in poetry, a series that's

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,200
dedicated to the work of English language poets.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,840
Our first event is a discussion of the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop and includes Bonnie Costello,

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,160
Alice Quinn, Lloyd Schwartz, and Jean Valentine.

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,800
We're currently planning an event for the fall on John Dunn and his influence on contemporary

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,760
poetry, and that's being co-sponsored with Fordham University and the New York Public

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,520
Library.

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,560
I wanna thank the members of the Poetry Committee, the likes who are helping to prepare our events.

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:52,640
They are Heather Dubrow, Rachel Haddis, Anne-Ree Levine, Patrick Rosal, and Polly Rosenweke.

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,760
Today, we're very fortunate to have Francis Pritchett and Mustafa Menai with us to talk

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:05,760
about the poetry of Gala, the great 19th century poet of the Urdu and Persian literary traditions.

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,400
He was a preeminent master of the poetic form that I used to call gazelle, but now no better

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,840
and pronounced guzzle.

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,720
Mustafa Menai is lecturer of Urdu at the University of Pennsylvania, South Asia Studies.

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,600
Francis Pritchett is professor of modern Indian languages in the Department of Middle Eastern,

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,240
South Asian, and African Studies at Columbia University.

33
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,560
She presides over a wonderful website devoted largely to the poetry of Mir and Gala, which

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,760
we will have the opportunity to view today as our two presenters guide us into the world

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,360
of Gala.

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,840
Before turning the floor over to our presenters, I'd like to draw your attention to a charitable

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:54,360
foundation that is special to them, the Hoshar Foundation, which is dedicated to providing

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,680
opportunities for education and empowerment to the girls of Pakistan.

39
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,800
I'll distribute some information about the foundation and the hope that you will find

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,160
it worthy of your support.

41
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,800
I now turn the presentation over to Mustafa and Francis.

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,400
Well thank you very much, David.

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,080
It's a really nice introduction and we appreciate your coming out on such a very pretty Saturday

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,480
afternoon because I know for most of you this is an intellectual adventure and not something

45
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,520
that you're already familiar with or interested in, so that deserves more credit and more

46
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,840
admiration for your intellectual curiosity and outreach.

47
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,520
So we'll try to make life interesting as best we can for the next hour and a half.

48
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,560
I would like to begin by just reading a brief little historical and analytical presentation

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,960
about the guzzle just to touch on a number of points that will help you sort of feel

50
00:03:51,960 --> 00:04:00,120
oriented about it and then we can move on and discuss any of the particulars in detail

51
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,920
and look at one verse.

52
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,520
I know the viewing angle isn't ideal but on our screen back there we have the one photograph

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,200
ever taken of Mirza Akalib, the great poet that we're going to talk about today.

54
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:22,480
This was done in 1868 and he died in 1869 and in 1868 photography was just coming to

55
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,920
Delhi where he lived and in his letters you can see there are references that he makes

56
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,400
to how oh his friends had urged him to go to have a photograph made but the photographer

57
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
hadn't come.

58
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,280
He didn't expect him to come to his house not to go to a studio and it was too much

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,880
trouble and who who minded but then there was another occasion and so finally the photographer

60
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,960
did come and it's very moving because we have all sorts of miniature paintings of this

61
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,440
man.

62
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,120
Let's just take a brief look.

63
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,840
And you see it's a different world.

64
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:08,200
When you move into the world of miniature paintings you are at one more remove from our world

65
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,680
and you have to imagine the background and imagine the kind of poetic and painting and

66
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,440
artistic conventions that are being used.

67
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,240
These are all just interesting bits and pieces from my website.

68
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,760
I'm just showing them for fun but these early photographs were pasted onto like visiting

69
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,200
cards and you would give them as mementos to your friends.

70
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,960
So this is a visiting card that had been preserved in the family of a friend of mine for a long

71
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,080
time and it's very faded but this is the best access we'll ever have to what Khaleb

72
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
actually looked like.

73
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,560
Then we have of course the later visions by modern Pakistani writers of what they think

74
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,320
about Khaleb or the impressions that they have.

75
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:59,280
And here is an art student whom I know has imagined that Khaleb would appear on a Pakistani

76
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,120
rupee note although that actually hasn't happened but he's just experimenting with the view

77
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,040
in a sort of free ranging way.

78
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:17,360
But let me just give you a little background about the genre and the poet.

79
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,640
The word guzzle means something like conversations with women.

80
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,960
Like the genre itself it originated in 6th century Arabic verse.

81
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,720
Early Arabic guzzle revolved around two broad themes.

82
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,320
The rakish celebration of wine, women and song and the elegiac lament over lost love.

83
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,280
By the time the guzzle passed into Persian from the early 11th century onward the second

84
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,200
theme had come to have mystical overtones.

85
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,440
Separation and suffering were at the heart of love and the faithful longing lover was

86
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,960
even a kind of martyr.

87
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,040
Through Persian the medieval guzzle also came to develop major traditions in Turkish and

88
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Urdu.

89
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,760
Nowadays among these languages the guzzle remains alive only in Urdu.

90
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,440
If we focus on the classical that is 18th and 19th century guzzle in Urdu the two greatest

91
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:24,280
poets of this tradition were Mir Muhammad Thape Mir 1722 to 1810 and Mirza Asadul al-Achan

92
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,720
Ralib 1797 to 1869.

93
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,660
Formally speaking a guzzle is a set of two line verses.

94
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,040
They aren't technically couplets since in most of them the two lines don't rhyme and

95
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,480
in a couplet usually the two lines rhyme.

96
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,760
Ideally there are to be an odd number of them and ideally the number is to be something

97
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,680
like seven or nine.

98
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,200
Could we make the sound louder would that help would that make it easier sir?

99
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Is it okay?

100
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Okay.

101
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:03,360
They these verses share a strictly defined Arabic derived quantitative meter and at the

102
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,920
end of each verse they also share a common rhyme syllable and after it usually a common

103
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,280
repeated refrain word or words as well.

104
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,320
Beyond this the verses of a guzzle share only the larger guzzle universe of stylized

105
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,840
characters scenes actions and images.

106
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,520
A guzzle in short is a series of semantically independent two line mini poems that have

107
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,280
a strong formal unity but usually no particular unity beyond that.

108
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:43,200
Thus in performance oral recidors and singers freely rearrange the verses of a guzzle and

109
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,280
almost always omit a good number of them.

110
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,080
The first verse of a guzzle commonly incorporates the rhyme and refrain at the end of both lines

111
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,120
instead of only at the end of the second line.

112
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,440
If it does this it's called an opening verse there's a special name for it matla.

113
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,320
Under oral performance conditions this feature enables the listeners to perceive the formal

114
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,760
structure of the guzzle more quickly and we'll illustrate this when we look at an example

115
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
later on.

116
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,800
The last verse commonly includes the poet's chosen pen name.

117
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,480
If it does this it's called a closing verse a monk the both these features reflect the

118
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,600
guzzle's expectation of oral performance.

119
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,680
The traditional venue for oral performance was the mushyra, the poetry place.

120
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
Shared is poetry.

121
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,040
Shyra is the poet.

122
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,680
Mushyra is the performance of poetry.

123
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,160
The mushyra consisted of a smallish group of patrons connoisseurs, master poets called

124
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,760
wastads and apprentices shoggards.

125
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,720
Most mushyra's were based on a well-known pattern line announced in advance so that

126
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,560
everybody's guzzles composed in this pattern were formally identical, sharing meter, rhyme

127
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,000
and refrain.

128
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,560
This formal identity made them extremely comparable to each other so that individual achievement

129
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,640
stood out very strikingly.

130
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,280
Resitation of the first line of a verse was always followed by a long pause full of praise

131
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,280
and carbon from the audience after which the first line was repeated and then finally followed

132
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,240
by the second line.

133
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,480
This style of presentation created a time period when the audience had access to the

134
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:33,800
first line but not the second with possibilities for creating suspense, misdirection, surprise

135
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:41,080
and so on that became major factors along with complex word play in the development of

136
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,200
the guzzle's poetics.

137
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,760
This recited in order of increasing seniority because the emphasis on apprenticeship over

138
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:58,320
time and the required mastery of technical skills made it apparent to the organizers

139
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,200
of Mushyra's that the senior most poets must be politely assumed to be the finest.

140
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,000
Of course sometimes they weren't so their tensions were created there.

141
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,840
Many had a small notebook in which he, and we have to say he because women very rarely

142
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,840
attended Mushyra's, a small notebook in which he quickly jotted down verses that struck

143
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,560
his fancy for later discussion with friends.

144
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,040
Famous poets were often the rock stars of their day.

145
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Bands of their apprentices were even known to riot when they encountered each other in

146
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,200
the streets of Lucknow.

147
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:41,040
Though the majority of guzzle poets were upper or middle class Muslim men, guzzles by women,

148
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,120
by people of other religions including Hindus, Sikhs and Christians and by people of working

149
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,520
class backgrounds are amply documented.

150
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,840
All poetry is made out of other poetry but not all poetry is glad of it.

151
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,880
The guzzle however delights in its huge treasury of earlier verses.

152
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:08,000
The very origins of Urdu poetry included macaroni or mixed Persian Urdu lines and verses.

153
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,560
The classical training for a poet included memorizing literally thousands of verses by

154
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,880
earlier Persian and Urdu-ostads.

155
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,360
There were various technical terms for the deliberate or inadvertent use of another poet's

156
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,800
line or idea or image.

157
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,960
If deliberate it was either a tribute or a challenge or usually both.

158
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:33,560
If inadvertent was it a creative coincidence, an innovative development or a vulgar imitation

159
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:40,120
and was every usage of the early masters sacred or should modern idiom have legitimacy as well.

160
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,360
Mushyra's functioned as technical workshops in which issues like these could be publicly

161
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,600
debated.

162
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,800
At the most basic level the guzzle is the first person voice of a passionate lover who

163
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,280
laments his lack of access to his beloved.

164
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,680
This lover is always construed as masculine.

165
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,480
In some verses the beloved is very clearly feminine as for example when women's clothing,

166
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,840
veiling, etc. is mentioned.

167
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,080
She is then either a courtesan or an inaccessible lady in Parda.

168
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,720
In other verses the beloved is very clearly masculine as when the beginnings of the coquettish

169
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,000
adolescent boy's beard are said to appear, destroying his androgynous charm.

170
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,920
In most verses the gender of the beloved can't be decided for sure.

171
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,320
This undecidability is partly due to the brevity of the verses and to the emphasis on the lover's

172
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,680
feelings rather than the descriptions of the beloved.

173
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,560
In Persian it's also due to the nature of the grammar.

174
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,800
Verb endings don't vary with gender.

175
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,560
In Urdu the beloved is always treated as grammatically masculine.

176
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,520
And ultimately this abstractly masculine gender is also due to the desire to keep open a mystical

177
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:01,560
sufistic reading in which the supremely powerful and irresistibly beautiful divine beloved is

178
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,520
the real object of desire.

179
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:11,560
Since an erotic pursuit of God, especially by a male lover, is not only supremely transgressive

180
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,440
but also bound to end badly, the lover knows from the beginning that his passion is doomed

181
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,280
and will destroy him.

182
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,840
God he doesn't care since it's so much more powerful and beautiful than anything on offer

183
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,760
in this flimsy, transitory, real life.

184
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:35,200
Thus the great metaphors of the lover's condition are the universal mystical ones of helplessness

185
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,080
and or transcendence.

186
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,400
And the four biggest are, not surprisingly, you'll recognize them if you know anything

187
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,960
about mystical poetry, drunkenness, sex, madness, and death.

188
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,440
Here's where we connect with no doubt psychoanalytic interests too.

189
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,680
The stylized settings of the guzzle world, the garden, the desert, the wine house, the

190
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,960
prison, and so on, and its supporting cast of characters, the rival, the messenger, the

191
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:08,640
doorkeeper, the advisor, the ascetic, etc., are all carefully calibrated to accompany this

192
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,920
passion play.

193
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,120
Some modern readers in South Asia have worried over the depiction of the beloved as a beautiful

194
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,640
boy, the implications of Pederasty distress them.

195
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:27,240
But if the beloved can be envisioned as a beautiful boy or a courtesan, he can also be God,

196
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,800
and plainly the guzzle lives in a world of its own, and thus is the very reverse of

197
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,880
autobiographical.

198
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,040
For if the beloved is a denizen of that guzzle world, so too is the lover, who can speak

199
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,960
as a caged bird, a hunted animal, a naked madman, a drunkard, or as himself after his

200
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
own death.

201
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,320
This is one of the enjoyable parts of the guzzle.

202
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,600
The lover is doomed, he dies, but it never stops him.

203
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:59,760
He doesn't shut up, he keeps right on composing poetry about what happens after his death.

204
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:06,160
The point is the transgressiveness, the liminality, the rush to break out of this flawed, doomed,

205
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,600
limited, worldly life into a larger, truer universe of passion.

206
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,640
The moth lying into the candle flame is thus one of the guzzles' emblematic images.

207
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,400
The burning, melting, self-consuming candle itself is another.

208
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:30,320
And the blossoming rose, whose smile is also her death warrant, as she blooms, is a third.

209
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,160
The classical guzzle world with its aristocratic patronage and its famous ostads was killed

210
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,440
off in the aftermath of the rebellion of 1857.

211
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,920
Guzzles nowadays in Urdu are often either obscure and elite, printed in small poetry

212
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:53,840
journals, or else popular and personally expressive, or even filmy, composed for Bollywood movies.

213
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,200
Modern Musharas too, though they still exist and though they happen all over North America,

214
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
including quite a number in our town.

215
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,360
Modern Musharas are greatly changed.

216
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:10,280
They are public performances, like concerts, presided over by popular MCs who adjust the

217
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,200
performances to the mood of the audience.

218
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,080
To some extent, these Musharas constitute a middle ground for the guzzle between the

219
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,080
elite and the popular in which it can continue to survive.

220
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,440
There is also now English guzzle to add to the picture.

221
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:35,760
It's become a popular genre in recent decades and a very influential and fascinating book

222
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:44,400
called Ravishing Disunities by the late Agashahid Ali is a very good point of entry for the

223
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,840
English guzzle.

224
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:53,960
So I've studied the guzzle for most of my scholarly career, but otherwise I'm an outsider.

225
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,880
I'm from Arkansas.

226
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,400
My started studying Hindi at 20 and Urdu at 22.

227
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:09,400
So it's very nice that we also have here a very extreme insider, my friend Mustafa Minayi,

228
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,920
who is of course not only an insider as a South Asian, but also he is an insider as

229
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:23,480
a direct descendant of a well-known Urdu poet called Amir Minayi, who was a junior contemporary

230
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:30,560
of Gollibs, and in Gollibs old age, the young man Amir Minayi often helped him write his

231
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,440
letters and acted as a secretary to him.

232
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,120
And so we have actually a sort of blood connection here.

233
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,920
So I'd like to ask Mustafa what he would add to this description or what he would change.

234
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Sure.

235
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Thanks a lot, friend.

236
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:54,240
First of all, just as Urdu has the ability to really absorb so many different words and

237
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,120
philosophies and styles from all over the world, I would say that you're not at all

238
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,760
an outsider because Urdu has embraced you with open arms just as you have embraced Urdu

239
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,440
as well.

240
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,120
And thanks a lot for your introduction.

241
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:19,340
And I would just say that, yes, just as Fran made the point that she's had a scholarly

242
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:26,600
connection to Urdu and its study, which of course is very deep and very expansive.

243
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:33,800
I had an experiential connection to it before I had a scholarly connection.

244
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,360
So I was, when I was coming off age and really understanding poetry, I was reacting to it

245
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,080
on an emotional level, which of course is the experience that most people have of poetry

246
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,280
rather than studying it to begin with.

247
00:19:50,280 --> 00:20:01,920
And so the experience of Ralib and poetry in general is at a very deep emotional level

248
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
as well.

249
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:10,280
And so an emotional understanding based on one's life experiences, on personality, on

250
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,960
one's psychology, personality, et cetera, comes first.

251
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,320
And then after that, because the gazal can be, and gazal poetry can be interpreted in

252
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:29,880
so many levels, when you start studying it, more meanings, et cetera, come to light.

253
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,560
And just because I was experiencing it in the modern times, so I would say that, yes,

254
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:43,000
the gazal definitely had growing pains, was battered by the outrageous slings and arrows

255
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,040
of fortune, et cetera.

256
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,880
But it does survive.

257
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,560
It has changed quite a bit, although the formal structure of the rhyme and meter still

258
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
remains as well.

259
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,960
But a lot of new themes have been infused into it.

260
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,160
And I believe that that process would not have been as robust of innovation if it were

261
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,120
not for Ralib.

262
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,720
Because Ralib, I feel, was a major innovator in terms of using the same kind of classical

263
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:22,360
metaphors and vocabulary, but infusing new themes, which were coming from his personality,

264
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,320
as well as his times as well.

265
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:35,480
Just a small point about what Fran had mentioned, that the first verse is called a matlā.

266
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:44,360
And in true Urdu literary tradition, even that is a beautiful wordplay, because matlā

267
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,920
also means the sky.

268
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:53,080
And so figuratively, the first share of a gazal, when you call it the matlā, you can

269
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,000
poetically think of it as the sky, the rest of the shares, the rest of the couplets are

270
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,840
descending from it after that.

271
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,480
And so that sets up a whole range of poetic images as well.

272
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,560
And even one thing that has also changed is the grammatically masculine reference in Urdu

273
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,440
poetry has also evolved and changed as well.

274
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:27,240
So now in these days and times you find a lot of women poets, and they use the feminine

275
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:36,120
gender as well as the masculine gender according to however they prefer to apply it as well.

276
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,880
And yes, without further ado, I think we can get more into Ralib then.

277
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,480
Are there any special questions?

278
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,000
I think we're basically planning to have a question period afterwards, but is there

279
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,720
anything anybody would like to raise or to ask at this point, since we're a small group

280
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,680
it seems that we should be informal.

281
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,480
Did you have a question?

282
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,560
The actual translation of the words that are conversations with women.

283
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,280
With women, that's what I'm talking about.

284
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:12,960
Now there's another etymology that attributes the word to the dying cry of a gazelle, but

285
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
I think that's a sort of folk etymology.

286
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:23,600
Right, there's the word gazala as well, which I think a friend you might know better.

287
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,120
Does that refer to a deer?

288
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,680
Well there is, gazelle has a cognate for a gazelle in Urdu, but I think that the etymology

289
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,280
is a folk etymology.

290
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:47,200
The true comment on the role of sukism in this form and also used to be written in the

291
00:23:47,200 --> 00:24:02,720
form of a gazelle.

292
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Absolutely.

293
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,480
Actually it's interesting about Omar Chayam because we think of him through Fitzgerald,

294
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
right?

295
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,040
We read the rubayat, the Fitzgerald the quatrains translated from Omar Chayam, but it's one

296
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,760
of those very free translations that we nowadays would call trans creations.

297
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,560
So actually Fitzgerald wrote an original poem in English that was very loosely based on

298
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:32,920
Omar Chayam and it was far more successful in English than Omar Chayam ever was in Persian.

299
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,280
And in fact I think Penguin has, one of the publishers has put out literal translation

300
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:43,240
of Omar Chayam and you can barely recognize the Fitzgerald approach.

301
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,520
You can really see that he's taken a lot of liberties.

302
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,640
As has happened with the rubay, by some measures, the rubay is now said to be the most popular

303
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,240
poet in America, but he's popular in the translations of Coleman Barks.

304
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:02,240
And of course if you actually look at the rubay in Persian, the difficulties, I mean

305
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:09,760
many difficulties are smoothed out and many things are ignored or altered in getting into

306
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,400
what makes Americans feel good in terms of modern poetry.

307
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,040
Let's, oh, any question?

308
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:24,280
I recently learned that Sufism may have originated among followers of rubay.

309
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:34,520
And at what point did these religious prohibitions begin to become, I'm not used to associating

310
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:45,280
drunkenness and such with spiritual, Muslim, or trade, anything because of statements,

311
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
most of statements.

312
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,280
So it meant to be here at all with history.

313
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,680
It goes back very far in the tradition.

314
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,480
And there is also a very nice back and forth sort of, you can always flip the coin and

315
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,800
look at the other side effect because you find that the lover is transgressive because

316
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,840
he loves his own beloved more than God.

317
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,360
He calls his beloved an idol and he worships his beloved and uses very explicitly religious

318
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,880
terminology for his beloved and he gets drunk and he runs out into the desert and carries

319
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,560
on like a crazy mad lover.

320
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,920
But of course his beloved may be God.

321
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,480
And so we have the picture of the lover with his clothes all ripped up, drunk, lying by

322
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,720
the side of the road.

323
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,560
And the pious shake goes past him on the way to the mosque and sneers at him and averts

324
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:43,680
his eyes because he thinks of this reprobate as a very unsatisfactory, badly behaving person.

325
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,120
But of course, in the guzzle world, the lover knows the real inward joy of the presence

326
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,440
of God and the pious person is just observing the letter of the law but not the spirit of

327
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
the law.

328
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,360
And so when we see the lover madly drunk and carrying on in a sacrilegious way, it can

329
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:09,920
be both sacrilegious and it could be a sign of real absorption in God and of having the

330
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,000
fuses of your mind and heart blown by contact with God.

331
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,920
Because after all, everybody, this goes to mysticism and sufism in general.

332
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,420
Every claim or attempt that you can comprehend or feel in your heart and your mind, the presence

333
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:30,600
of the power that made the universe, is obviously, it's inexpressible and it's also impossible,

334
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,800
you're going to blow up.

335
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:38,360
And so the imagery always comes from out of control areas of human life, drunkenness,

336
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,880
madness, sex and death.

337
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,040
And this is true in almost every mystical poetry that you can think of, that it fries

338
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,040
your brain and it blows up your heart to try to encounter God.

339
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,480
But of course, that doesn't stop people.

340
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:59,920
So the poetry is always balanced on that tension of doom and ecstasy and suffering.

341
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,200
So it's a remarkable and all this in little poems two lines long.

342
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,200
So it's a very powerful genre.

343
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
What would you add to that, most of all?

344
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Right.

345
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:17,600
And I would say that just going back to the chronology of Sufism, that the earliest known

346
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:26,560
Sufism, I feel, would be around a couple of centuries even before Rumi, the tradition

347
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,800
I think had started.

348
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,920
It may not have come to be known as Sufism itself, but it had started.

349
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:42,760
And the in Sufism actions can lead to philosophies and philosophies can lead to actions as well.

350
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:51,880
So the physical manifestation of drunkenness and sex and death can be the result of certain

351
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:58,960
philosophies, et cetera, or they can then compel a person to think a certain way.

352
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:07,040
So on the philosophical plain, there were very established and still evolving philosophies

353
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:17,000
such as Vahadatul Vajud and Vahadul Shahud and stages of mysticism called Fana and Baka.

354
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,320
And so these are all Vahadul Vajud for instance, the unity of existence Vahadul Shahud holds

355
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:32,160
that God's existence is separate and man's existence is separate as well.

356
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:41,120
And Fana is sort of the last stage or the second last stage, I should say, of a wonder

357
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,880
with the divine and sort of Nirvana, if you would.

358
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,000
Where things began to change as going to your question about how when the prohibitions,

359
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:05,680
et cetera, came in and what we see today in the media and in the public eye in general,

360
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:12,480
this brand of Islam that may be called Vahab-yism for instance, a very strict orthodox fundamentalist

361
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,080
kind of strain.

362
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:23,560
So the strain I feel was always there, but yes, it was not as powerful or dominant or

363
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:33,240
as a gallib, excuse the pun, as it is now, gallib also means dominant and sometimes overwhelming

364
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,800
as well.

365
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,280
And so, but these things also seem to go in historical cycles.

366
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,040
So there were throughout the centuries, over a thousand years, various time periods, various

367
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:52,280
areas, where yes, the current practice of Islam as put forth by the Taliban for instance,

368
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:59,560
was dominant, but there are large, large pockets of Muslims.

369
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:08,040
I would say who are still in the majority, who still heart back to the more poetic and

370
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,080
romanticized form of Islam than the orthodox form that we see today.

371
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:20,920
Let's stop for a minute with our general discussions and just take a look at the specifics of

372
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,960
one guzzle, just if you bear with me, I think it will be worth it for examples.

373
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:32,280
So I maintain a website here and you can look up any of any of gallib's guzzles, there's

374
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:42,120
234 of them and they contain 1,459 little two line verses and this is guzzle one and it

375
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,800
has all sorts of extra things that go with it that most of the guzzles don't have.

376
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,200
It also has, as all the guzzles do have, the power for you to decide whether you want to

377
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:02,920
look at the website in Urdu script or in the Hindi script because many people nowadays

378
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:09,200
in India don't know the Urdu script but they're able to read the same content very nicely in

379
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,680
the Devanagri script.

380
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,160
So thanks to one of my really good graduate students who knows how to do these things

381
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,640
with Java script.

382
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,600
You have your viewing choices.

383
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,880
So this is diacritic such as is convenient for most of us.

384
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:31,720
And this is the first guzzle in Gallib's Devan, it has five verses and you can see that every

385
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,240
verse ends in ka, right?

386
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,480
So that's the refrain, it means of.

387
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:46,840
And every syllable before the ka is ir, has the form of ir, shir ka, sham shir ka, etc.,

388
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,000
and that's the rhyme syllable which is compulsory, the refrain is optional but the rhyme syllable

389
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,280
is compulsory.

390
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,000
And then you can see that the first verse has the rhyming elements at the end of each line

391
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,920
that makes it a muttla and that means that in an oral performance once you'd heard the

392
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:09,840
rhyming elements twice you could tell how much was rhyme and how much was refrain.

393
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,880
And until you'd heard them twice you couldn't.

394
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,440
So this is a preparation for oral performance.

395
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,400
And then the last verse very commonly contains the pen name of the poet.

396
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,640
And so here it is.

397
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,040
And it's a way of signing an oral poem.

398
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,440
You work your pen name right into the last verse.

399
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,000
In the Pukti tradition in medieval Hinduism we have exactly the same sorts of devices including

400
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,960
the pen name at the end of the verse to be able to sign an oral poem.

401
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,800
And the first verse of the first guzzle is particularly interesting.

402
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,160
And the reason I chose it for today's talk because I knew we wouldn't have time to look

403
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,320
at much.

404
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,520
And in a way it's the most interesting guzzle in any poet's divan.

405
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,280
The divan is the full volume of his poetry because it's the only one for which there

406
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:09,080
are extra expectations because it begins the divan and so many works by traditional Muslims

407
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,200
always begin with some sort of humb, some sort of praise of God.

408
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:21,160
And so it's very, very strong expectation that when you prepare your divan for copying,

409
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:27,840
and copying by a scribe or for publication, and Garle got his poetry published, he was

410
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,280
right at the first decades when it was possible for a poet to get his own divan published.

411
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,320
So he did.

412
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:41,760
And he knew that the expectation was that the first verse of the first guzzle had better

413
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,440
be in praise of God.

414
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,800
Everybody expects that.

415
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,840
It's just how it's supposed to be.

416
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:56,480
So he himself created a very clever way of not quite fulfilling those expectations but

417
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,920
not too conspicuously flouting them either.

418
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,600
I'm just hesitating on this because I just want you to think that if you go home and

419
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,160
are interested in this, you can look at these.

420
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,360
They're completely open to the public.

421
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,560
And every verse has its own commentary page.

422
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,440
And this one has a particularly long bunch because the commentators have argued about

423
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,920
it a great deal.

424
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,440
But every verse has a lot of, some of them have pictures just because I like pictures.

425
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,080
But this is the kind of thing I provided for him.

426
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,240
And it's a study site for my work.

427
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,440
And it also aims to provide lots of materials and resources for the guzzles, for people

428
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,040
to study them, even if they don't have a university library at hand.

429
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,680
So here is a very close, a very close study of this one verse.

430
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,720
So nux here's the definition, right?

431
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,840
Nux means a shape of painting, a picture, a form, etc., etc.

432
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,880
The nux.

433
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,280
And then furiadhi.

434
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,600
Furiad means complaint.

435
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,920
And a furiadhi means one who has a complaint.

436
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,120
And in legal terms, it's like plaintiff in English, which also means one who has a plaintiff

437
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,720
or a complaint.

438
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:21,960
So the picture or the form is a complainer, a plaintiff, of whose mischievousness of writing.

439
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,360
So that's our first line.

440
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,280
And of course writing, the word for writing, has the meaning also of setting at liberty,

441
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,400
which is why we talk about the Harrier Square when we talk about the Arab Spring.

442
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,800
It's not about writing, it's about liberty.

443
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,560
So you can see the multiple possibilities here.

444
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,920
And Adam O'Shire, I remember, you only get the first line and then you have to wait.

445
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,480
And you can't look ahead.

446
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,400
You have to, there's a narrative, students call this the authoritarian narrator, that

447
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,320
you're stuck, you can't look ahead.

448
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:02,520
So the shape is a plaintiff of whose mischievousness of writing.

449
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,760
Why don't you go ahead and recite it nicely?

450
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,240
Well, yeah, lots of stuff.

451
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:25,120
of paper.

452
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,740
Cara's is the paper.

453
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:37,880
Of paper is the garment of every form, face, countenance, shape, of or in the picture.

454
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,720
So obviously people ask, Galleb, about that.

455
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,960
What is this paper business?

456
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,560
What are paper garments?

457
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,520
And he had to reply in a letter.

458
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,800
So here is his reply, which is my translation from the Urdu.

459
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,080
And you can see that he's used to being asked questions like this, because he says,

460
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,640
bele mani a bhiate bemani suniye.

461
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,600
First, listen to the meaning of the meaningless verses, meaning at the beginning of his letter

462
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,920
to someone, he's going to answer someone's complaint that several of his verses were meaningless.

463
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
And he does.

464
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,320
He answers it for several verses, but one of them is this.

465
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,840
As for Nakhshvariadi, that's this verse that he's going to explain, in Iran there is the

466
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:24,240
custom that the seeker of justice, putting on paper garments, goes before the ruler.

467
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:32,920
As in the case of lighting a torch in the day, or carrying a blood-soaked cloth on a bamboo

468
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:40,000
pole to protest an injustice, thus the poet reflects of whose mischievousness of writing

469
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,480
is the image a plaintiff, since the aspect of a picture is that its garment is of paper.

470
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,360
That is to say, although existence may be like that of pictures, merely notional, it

471
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,400
is a cause of grief and sorrow and suffering.

472
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,320
And the commentators have complained, the early and authoritative commentator famously

473
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,520
said that's a meaningless verse, that's very bad, and the other commentators disagree,

474
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
and so forth.

475
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,800
But you can see how cleverly framed it is, because it doesn't attack God, but you would

476
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,400
certainly not call it a praise of God either.

477
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,160
It presents itself as a naive question.

478
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,640
Gee, I'm looking at a picture, and I notice that all the shapes and forms in the picture

479
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,880
are wearing robes of paper.

480
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,440
So they must be plaintiffs.

481
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,400
They must be seeking recourse against injustice.

482
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,320
And so against whom are they seeking recourse?

483
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:41,000
So after you hear the second misra, you realize the base, sorry, misra means line.

484
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,400
After you hear the second line, you realize the basis of the first line, that once you

485
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,760
have seen a picture and thought about all those paper garments that those poor, static,

486
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:58,000
helpless people in the picture are wearing, then you realize that you may wonder whose mischievousness

487
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,120
of writing are they complaining of that they were drawn badly, because obviously a figure

488
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,120
in a picture has no power of movement.

489
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,320
It can't control its looks or its appearance.

490
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,520
It has no volition.

491
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,640
It looks like it looks as though it's moving.

492
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,240
It looks as though it has human attributes, but it actually doesn't.

493
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,320
Someone has mischievously drawn it, or mischievously drawn it badly.

494
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,480
It's very hard to tell about that.

495
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:29,720
So there's a lot of word play here of words for writing and drawing and paper and such.

496
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,120
But this is an extremely famous verse.

497
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,320
It was used.

498
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:43,000
Nokchferiadi was used as a slightly transformed form within Azafat as the title of a collection

499
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,760
by Faz Emmeth Faz, who is a very popular modern Urdu poet, kind of the favorite poet of a

500
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,720
lot of Pakistanis along with it all.

501
00:40:53,720 --> 00:41:00,240
So everybody has been a GALIB fan, or the literature ever since, kind of officially a

502
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,600
GALIB fan, and almost everybody.

503
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,160
There's Yoganna who hasn't, but most everybody has.

504
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,640
And this verse is known to everybody who knows anything about GALIB.

505
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,920
So it's a good verse for us to look at, and just to see how what tiny little poems these

506
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:25,800
are, and how they have to make use of lots of resources to make a powerful effect on

507
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,360
us, even though they're only like 15 or 20 words long.

508
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,680
So this is our first look at.

509
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,920
Our first look at the verse, which is sort of raw material for discussion.

510
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,040
So what would you add, Mustafa?

511
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
Sure.

512
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:51,120
I'd say that the Indo-Persian languages tradition, you could call it, is that a lot of words

513
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:59,600
have multiple meanings and shades of meaning as well, which lends such a beautiful complexity

514
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:05,800
and multilayeredness to Urdu and Indo-Persian and Arabic poetry.

515
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,000
As you can see from Fran's website that just, you get, that there are so many different

516
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:19,720
words for just one word, and you can literally take each word and plug in a different meaning

517
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,600
and shade of meaning and come up with a different interpretation or a slightly different shade

518
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,400
of meaning and experience as well.

519
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:37,000
So that's there, and I would say especially on the point of G-alib choosing this as the

520
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,240
opening verse of his divan.

521
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:46,520
So we know of G-alib's personality and his through his life as well that he was a very

522
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,360
self-assured person.

523
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:57,320
And you can see his personal as well as poetic conceit, as it were, to choose this couplet

524
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:05,880
over there, and ironically we can interpret it in terms of irony as well because as he's

525
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:15,320
asking the question of whose mischievousness is this naksh creation of, he himself is the

526
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,960
person who is actually writing, he is creating the naksh himself.

527
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:27,000
So in a very tongue and cheek way he is referring to himself as divine, as God as well.

528
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,320
And especially if you take the meaning, a shade of meaning of shokhi as not just mischievousness

529
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:44,040
but wantonness and the meaning of tahri as setting free, by the act of creating something,

530
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:49,640
you are actually setting it free or creating it, you are actually freeing it from your own

531
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,760
mind.

532
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,440
You can also see a lot of shades of meaning coming in there.

533
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:08,000
So he could be referring to himself as well and it reminds me of that line from King

534
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,120
Lear as flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods, they kill us for their sport.

535
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,560
And so you can see that in there as well.

536
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,600
And France's right, this particular couple it has been debated endlessly as well.

537
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,160
But you should notice that of course the first line is a question.

538
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:34,280
And so it does not say it's perhaps a naive question, gee who has done this mischievous

539
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,040
or bad writing or drawing, I don't know.

540
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,680
And so if anybody says it's God, it's we who say it's God, it's not the speaker.

541
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,480
The speaker simply asks a question.

542
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:52,120
And in fact, there's a lovely rhetorical feature of the guzzle that's a common trait, especially

543
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,640
in Raleigh and Meer, the two greatest masters.

544
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,120
The preference for inshaia over habariya speech.

545
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:06,600
And this is a sort of rhetorical distinction that exists in Persian poetic theory also.

546
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,320
Habariya gives you habari, it gives you information.

547
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,680
Like the sky is blue is a habariya statement.

548
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,040
And inshaia statement would be, is the sky blue?

549
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,360
How blue the sky is.

550
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,080
I wish the sky were blue.

551
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,440
Perhaps the sky might be blue.

552
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,040
If the sky were blue, et cetera, et cetera.

553
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:34,920
So almost anything that's not a falsifiable informative statement is called inshaia.

554
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,400
And it opens so many possibilities because a first line like that, it could be an exclamation

555
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,400
also.

556
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,200
Oh my, how extraordinary.

557
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,080
Why are all these figures in the picture wearing paper robes?

558
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,520
Or it could be an innocent question of someone who really has no idea.

559
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,920
Or it could be a cynical question.

560
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,720
Yeah, who are they complaining about?

561
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,200
You and I know who they're complaining about, don't we?

562
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,920
So in a lot of these little two line verses, the tone is everything.

563
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,400
But you have to provide the tone because nothing in the verse tells you the tone in

564
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,280
which it is to be recited.

565
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,240
So you may hear it recited if a very small number of people would ever have heard, gala,

566
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,800
recite that verse.

567
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:21,520
So when you read it on paper, which is how most people encountered it, every time someone

568
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,880
recites it, you have to recite it in a tone.

569
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,000
And that guides the interpretation too.

570
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,520
You inevitably help to create the verse yourself.

571
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,920
And that's part of the fascination and enjoyment of these tiny little, tiny little poems that

572
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,640
are partly do it yourself.

573
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,560
And so you have to work extra hard on them.

574
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,240
And that enhances their meaning.

575
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,240
Did you have a question?

576
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:49,320
Is he concerned with someone, this to me by the way seems almost like a one, one,

577
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,280
floating down on the face of whatever reader-like cake events or not?

578
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,760
But is he concerned about where the parents slipred his without language and so many

579
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,520
poets in the book about it?

580
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:08,520
And so you have to be aware of the fact that you're saying, one word, you go to hell,

581
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,520
and you say, one word, you go to hell as fast as an arrow.

582
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,520
So is that something about the reader?

583
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,320
He's talking about language itself.

584
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,920
He wasn't worried about going to hell because all the guzzle poets knew that the themes

585
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,680
or the musmoons of these verses were given by the tradition.

586
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:30,040
So if he wrote a verse that said, oh, I tear my clothes off and run around in the desert

587
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,280
getting drunk.

588
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,840
No one would think that was an autobiographical statement.

589
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,160
Everybody would realize that was just an expression of the themes of the guzzle world.

590
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:44,000
And he was speaking in the voice of the mad lover, who essentially is the inhabitant of

591
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,520
the guzzle world.

592
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,920
So there are lots and lots of verbal devices he used, and he certainly cared about them,

593
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,680
and people have tried to analyze them and figure them out ever since.

594
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,800
But there's no indication that he had a lot of anxiety about them.

595
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:07,080
Even in his generation, he was controversial because a lot of times earlier guzzle poets

596
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:14,400
had gone in for straightforward love poetry, lyrical, romantic, sweet, adorable, nice.

597
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,520
And then he brings in, sort of like John Dunn, the metaphysical poet.

598
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,360
He brings in the flea and writes about the flea that bites his beloved, John Dunn does,

599
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,520
I mean, or the drawing compass image that are not smooth and romantic.

600
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,720
They're kind of lumpy and cerebral and metaphysical.

601
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:34,040
So I think that Galleb is more like Dunn than like any other English poet.

602
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:41,960
And he delighted in using awkward, edgy, unheard of kinds of word and image play.

603
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,840
And he had many detractors, but he also had many great admirers.

604
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:54,400
He was very famous for his poetry and his letters also in his ordew and Persian ones

605
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,560
both.

606
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,280
So there's a lot to be said on this subject.

607
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,120
And God knows any of you who are interested can probably find more information than you

608
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:11,480
want on my website.

609
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,480
Did you have anything to add?

610
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,480
Oh, sorry.

611
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,480
Oh, sorry.

612
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,480
Sorry.

613
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,480
If you could answer it briefly, it's a big question.

614
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:25,200
What are the origins of the bazelle?

615
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,480
The deer or the poem?

616
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,920
Well, it started in Arabic.

617
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,960
I'm not so good on this because I do not know Arabic.

618
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,840
So it grew out of longer forms of poetry.

619
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:48,880
It was one part of an introductory part of a kind of longer genre in Arabic shortly before

620
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,360
the coming of Islam.

621
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:58,600
So like the sixth century, and it really was a minor genre in Arabic.

622
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:04,240
But when it came into Persian, then it exploded and became extremely important and became

623
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:13,000
a major form of literary, romantic and mystical expression in Persian and then in Turkish

624
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,680
and ordew also.

625
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,160
So it's never been a big deal in Arabic, but it did begin in Arabic.

626
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,160
Yeah.

627
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:28,400
I was surprised to hear you say that there was no performances of bazelle.

628
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:38,280
There were no longer than popular because there was a woman and there was an international

629
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,600
re as a puzzle of a singer.

630
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:48,880
I think she was Egyptian, I was where the guy some years ago, he was 70.

631
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,680
Oh, ohm kalsum, right?

632
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,680
Yeah.

633
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,680
Yes.

634
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,680
And there was a national deal.

635
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,680
There was a great passion for that for you, the beef and all.

636
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:06,600
And I had the impression that bazelle and singer were sort of like rock stars.

637
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,840
Well now in ordew, this can be the case.

638
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:15,520
But I believe om kalsum sang modern poems that were not guzzles or older poems that were

639
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,520
guzzles.

640
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,520
I really don't know.

641
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,280
Does anybody know Arabic and know what om kalsum used to sing?

642
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:28,280
I don't know Arabic, but I had a mention of the tradition of what was the great, great

643
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,280
minor of the poem.

644
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:37,520
We also had political, not only one thing in front of the left, but my impression was

645
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:44,520
that she was singing about popular things and not anything to do with this book.

646
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,520
She talked a lot about broken violinist lovers.

647
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,520
I don't think of any religious, but she was providing it.

648
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,360
She made a lot of it, she made a lot of it, and she wrote it all.

649
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:07,360
I'd say that the kind of ground that violin broke and set up, then gave, it was a very

650
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:15,200
great way to a lot of evolution in the way that Mosheirazah held, their frequencies,

651
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:21,960
the way that Urdu poetry has sung, how it's read, how it's practiced, the whole range

652
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,480
of experiences.

653
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:31,800
So I agree with Fran when she says that yes, Mosheirazah are not as popular today as they

654
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:38,640
used to be, and Mosheirazah are the gathering of poets who are going to be reciting their

655
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,840
own work primarily.

656
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:47,760
So there's that performance, and yes, their frequency, at least in Pakistan and India,

657
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,520
from what I know and have experienced, has gone down.

658
00:52:51,520 --> 00:53:00,680
And I would say to a large degree, it's because of the times and the pace of life now and

659
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:06,960
the modernization process, et cetera, that's going on in these, in Urdu-speaking societies.

660
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,560
There's also, of course, the big question in Pakistan, the big issue of security, as

661
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:19,800
well things have not been very stable for the past two decades or so.

662
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:27,080
So there's a certain risk to having large gatherings and having people be in one place

663
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:32,800
and Mosheirazah were usually held during the evening and night hours, et cetera.

664
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,080
So that's one reason for that as well.

665
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,840
Performance-wise, there are singing performances of poetry as well.

666
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:48,560
So more along the lines of Ummikul-Sum and individual singers who became famous for singing

667
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:56,880
Urdu poetry, they have found outlets and survival through modern media.

668
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:03,360
So through the intervention of radio and TV and now the internet, you find that the

669
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:10,400
razal singing performance of the razal live on as you witness the opening razal that we

670
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,480
had that was playing when you were walking in by a singer called Talat Mehmud, who was

671
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:23,880
singing it a good 30, 40 years ago, if not earlier than that, but because of YouTube,

672
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,920
we have those as well.

673
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:34,720
But yes, even on that side of performance, things are getting tougher in terms of the

674
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,800
sheer number of people who are now practicing the classical art of razal singing, which

675
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:48,880
is also, and razal would then be fused with the whole science and art of Indian classical

676
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,400
music, which has its own, which is a whole science on its own.

677
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:01,360
And interest and patience in acquiring that art is also going down.

678
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:05,320
But now with the intervention, again, evolution keeps happening.

679
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:13,240
So now you have this mixing of pop genres coming into contact with classical Indian music and

680
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:21,480
modern Urdu poetry coming into contact with classical and sort of a mishmash occurring

681
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,560
and something new coming out of it.

682
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:33,600
So if you ask members of the younger generation, especially in Pakistan, if Urdu music, they

683
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:39,960
would call it Urdu music, is alive and well there, you would definitely get a very affirmative

684
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,840
answer, even if they do not listen to it much.

685
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,720
And there's of course also the regional folk influences.

686
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,600
In the regions of India and Pakistan, Urdu is of course just one of the languages that

687
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,600
is spoken.

688
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:59,160
It's the official language of Pakistan and the official language of five states in India,

689
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,480
but then there's a myriad number of other languages that are spoken.

690
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:09,080
And they all sort of interact with each other, flow in and out of each other, and new things

691
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,120
come out of those as well.

692
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:19,000
People have said a lot and perhaps you folks know something about the Hindi Urdu split.

693
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,400
Are they two languages or one?

694
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,200
Are they kind of a Siamese twin compound or what?

695
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,760
And there's been a lot of tension of course because Hindi is the official language of India

696
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:35,240
and Urdu is the official language of Pakistan and yet they share a common grammar and a large

697
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,720
amount of common basic vocabulary and then they have two different sources for their

698
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,760
fancy vocabulary and two different scripts.

699
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,920
But the real threat to both of them in my view is English now.

700
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,600
South Asians are picking up English at an astonishing pace.

701
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,480
And the really sad thing is there is as most of us said there's a long and strong tradition

702
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,080
of being multilingual in South Asia, not in a pretentious way but perhaps you would speak

703
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,800
one language in your village.

704
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,080
And if you want to mark it in a neighboring town there would be a different dialect there.

705
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,240
And if you were a highly educated man of an upper class you might have a separate language

706
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:16,880
that you would use for diplomatic or literary purposes.

707
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:24,080
But so you would think that English could be sustained along with at least one South

708
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,520
Asian language but in my observation this is not happening.

709
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,200
My friends who are Urdu, or the Ualas or Hindi Ualas who are really interested in these languages

710
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,080
and literatures, their kids have all been sent to English medium schools.

711
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,120
Meaning the medium of instruction is in English.

712
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:43,880
And they have tried very hard to make their kids fluent in Hindi or Urdu with varying

713
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,080
success.

714
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,720
But if you go to the kids' rooms and look at what they're choosing to read you know

715
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,920
it's English.

716
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,120
And if you put two of those kids in a room together you know they're going to be speaking

717
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,120
English to each other.

718
00:57:54,120 --> 00:58:02,160
I mean it's a big problem for the future of this language at an elite level.

719
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:07,560
Because of course they may know Urdu for speaking to servants or something like that.

720
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:13,360
But their fancy education, their literary and artistic vocabulary and thinking often

721
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,120
happens in English.

722
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:22,240
And so this is the high end side of Urdu where if you don't have a good background in grammar

723
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,800
and the sense of the meter and the poetry and the Persianized vocabulary it's very hard

724
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
for you.

725
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:34,080
In fact the most heartfelt letters of thanks I get are from South Asians living in the

726
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,160
West who say thank you for your website.

727
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:42,400
I always wanted to understand the poetry of Gollib and I never could but you've explained

728
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,800
it all in English so now I can't.

729
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:50,240
And it's just something that's happening and then the migration of the Gazal into English

730
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,800
is kind of fascinating too.

731
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,640
Because of course what is it in English?

732
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,120
It doesn't have the meter or so is it the Gazal or not?

733
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,760
A whole set of questions but new things are happening all over the place.

734
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,880
And so we might as well celebrate and enjoy them.

735
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:10,080
But the definitely English in South Asia is just becoming, with every generation it's

736
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:15,680
absolutely taking over and I don't know what the future will hold but this is a very very

737
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,680
strong trend.

738
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:20,680
And I don't see any retreat from it or any counter trends do you?

739
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:27,960
No I wouldn't say that there's a retreat from it I would say that again there is a process

740
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,520
of sort of or doising it or Englishising it.

741
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,520
Yeah new hybrids.

742
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:42,080
As it were new new hybrids are coming out and slowly so I think even if every person in

743
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:49,480
South Asia became an English speaker exclusively that English would differ markedly from the

744
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:55,840
English spoken in England or the US because it would still have that flavour because of

745
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:01,720
course as we although that language is more than just the words in that language it's

746
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:09,400
a whole set of historical and cultural experiences and values that come with it as well.

747
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,400
Yes.

748
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:20,400
I mean one thing for us whether we just poetry you know the end of youth's name culture

749
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,400
and what percentage of the population did that audience represent?

750
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,400
Was it widespread or was it just a particular echelon?

751
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:34,400
How many women read it or who were they people that were reading it?

752
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,400
Who was he talking to?

753
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,400
Well.

754
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:50,400
Who had the word it's a lame dollar so that the thing could be so that it could be either

755
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,400
presented with a bad problem or was it a political problem?

756
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:00,400
If there were the characters of political problems to get it to be heard then did someone show

757
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:07,400
it to me?

758
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:14,520
Well remember most of them were not reading it because most people were illiterate for

759
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:19,520
one thing but certainly in Gollib's deli and in Agra where he was born and lived before

760
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,960
he moved to Delhi this kind of language the Hindustani or what we now call Urdu was a

761
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:31,960
lingua franca increasingly Persian had been the elite language of the local court but by

762
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:37,200
the time Gollib was living there the British were in charge and gradually the balance was

763
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:43,720
shifting away from Persian toward the local languages and so many people would understand

764
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:48,520
this poetry and in fact there are anecdotes in Tazkura's about how it would disseminate

765
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:53,360
because there would be Mushyra's where poets would recite their latest verses and of course

766
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:59,040
that those Mushyra's would be servants serving the food and drinks and taking care of people

767
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:03,800
and so instantly the servants would pass the word on because these things are so short

768
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,600
and if you know the meter system and the language they're very memorizable and very

769
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,800
recordable so the dancing girls would know them immediately and have them memorized and

770
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:16,280
the dancing girls and the musicians would want to have the latest verses and they would

771
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:22,400
arrange for disseminating them and there doesn't seem to have been a problem because

772
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,080
remember most poets were not as complicated as Gollib so most of the time people were

773
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:32,920
doing more straightforward love and longing poetry or perhaps mystical mystical poetry

774
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:40,120
but it wasn't exceedingly difficult or complex or in your face hard the way Gollib's verses

775
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,960
often were.

776
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:48,920
And there was also the aspect of being very alive to the preferences of one's patron

777
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:55,720
as well although Gollib was exceptional in that as well that he was a very self assured

778
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:04,840
person and he could get away with a lot that other poets could not because again in 18th

779
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:11,720
century India you could be only way that you could be earning your living by our pen was

780
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:17,560
if you had patronage from a wealthy noble or an emperor and were associated with their

781
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:26,600
court and so even if you were not writing something for the court you still had to you

782
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:32,160
it carried a little bit of risk if you wrote something that would not be well received

783
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:39,680
by our patron then yes you were really writing yourself out of a livelihood kind of thing

784
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:46,560
and but Ralev of course because of his stature etc was would be given a lot more leeway than

785
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:53,440
anyone else would have read and he had troubles right he got into some troubles as well so

786
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,640
yes so the short answer to your question would be that yes they were writing primarily for

787
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:06,200
the courts and people who of socio-economic and educational status who are associated

788
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:12,000
with the courts but that does not mean that their their poetry was not understood by people

789
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,600
outside of that circle.

790
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,680
I have a question.

791
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,680
Yes.

792
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:28,040
I'm fascinated by the whole city of meetings in the building and I am the depth or the

793
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,440
layers of interpretation that allows for it.

794
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,280
Do you think that's a fundamental factor in the formation of this form of poetry that

795
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:44,280
can be read but very resonant at the same time would it have worked as well with another

796
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,280
type of language?

797
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,160
That's such an interesting question I'm glad you asked that.

798
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,520
In the strong sense since Urdu Gazal comes right out of Persian Gazal.

799
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:58,960
In fact the birth of Urdu Gazal was part of the death of Persian in India.

800
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:04,200
People kind of took all the devices and the structures and the meters and the technical

801
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:09,080
and genre features that they loved in Persian and started doing them in Urdu and then they

802
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,880
didn't need Persian anymore.

803
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,080
At that point people were starting to feel that Persian was an alien language in a way

804
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:18,040
that they hadn't before for a lot of reasons.

805
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,120
In the strong sense it came right out of Persian but there are so many things that you can

806
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:32,320
do in Urdu because of constraints that you don't have, that we do have in English, that

807
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,000
it's quite striking.

808
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,760
For example you don't have capital letters and the kind of punctuation.

809
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:43,480
If you see punctuation in modern dewans of galle which you do it's imposed by a modern

810
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,480
editor.

811
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,440
They put English style punctuation into Galle's poetry which is of course quite ridiculous

812
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,320
because he certainly would never have done that or have wanted that to be done.

813
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:59,840
But there is also a lot of things like in English we have to make a distinction between

814
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,200
the sky is blue and is the sky blue.

815
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,000
It's because of the inversion.

816
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,120
In Urdu you have Asman Nilahe and there's a kya, yes or no question marker in front.

817
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:15,080
Kya Asman Nilahe but it can also be colloquially omitted.

818
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:21,200
So Asman Nilahe can register as a question or an exclamation if you wish as well as a

819
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,480
statement.

820
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,520
So there's a lot of features that are very well mobilized by Galle and Mih and other

821
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:34,280
poets but especially by Galle and Mih to create multiple meanings in these little tiny poems.

822
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,800
And I don't think you could do it as well in certainly you couldn't do it as well in

823
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:42,800
English and that's why translations of Galle as a rule just fail.

824
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,880
I have a couple of guzzles with anthologies of translations so that anybody who wishes

825
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,920
can compare and see what the translators have achieved.

826
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:56,320
You have to honor them because they're bound to fail but it can't be done but you can see

827
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:01,080
my translations are totally lousy and clunky and they're just meant to help push you back

828
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,800
to the Urdu with more understanding.

829
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:07,040
They're not remotely meant to be literary.

830
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:12,080
And no doubt there are things we can do in English that you can't do in Urdu but there's

831
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:17,920
a lot of things that you can do in Urdu partly because you have a different word, instead

832
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,400
of prepositions you have postpositions.

833
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,400
So instead of saying in the house you say house in.

834
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:29,040
And so at the ends of sentences and at the end of lines you also have your verbs there.

835
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:34,440
So it's easier to rhyme in Urdu than it is in English because your verbs often have common

836
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,240
endings that make all verbs in a certain tense, easy to rhyme with each other.

837
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,800
And postpositions end and can end the line.

838
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,080
That postposition, that means of.

839
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:49,240
And so it can be of this and of that, you know, of writing, of a picture.

840
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:53,280
But since the of comes at the end in rhymes and in English you'd have to say of the picture,

841
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,280
of the writing.

842
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,640
And so you can't get the same facility there.

843
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:03,600
But of course, you know, it's hard to make any meaningful comparison because really nobody

844
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,760
has tried to do what Gollib did exactly in English.

845
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,240
But we do have other effects.

846
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:16,160
I think a fascinating analysis to your question might be to compare Urdu with the Native American

847
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,160
languages.

848
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:27,040
For instance, the Hopi language spoken by the Hopi Indians also did not have had a very

849
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:35,440
loosely constructed sense of time which you see in Urdu is also very different from the

850
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,480
concept of time in English.

851
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:45,240
So once in Urdu we have the same word, one word for yesterday as well as tomorrow.

852
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,080
And it would be a fascinating line of inquiry.

853
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,800
I haven't done this and I don't know if anyone else has done it or not.

854
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:59,840
But I wonder if someone like Native American poetry as it was written, would that remind

855
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:06,280
one of Urdu poetry or not simply because of the way that the words were constructed,

856
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,280
etc.

857
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:14,760
And Urdu as well, it's a syllable time language as well in the sense that the syllables are

858
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:22,000
approximately of the same length and so they occur at approximately regular intervals as

859
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,800
well as well.

860
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:29,720
So you don't find one very short syllable but with one very long syllable as well which

861
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:36,880
also adds a lot to the rhythm of the poetry as well.

862
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:47,280
There were stresses right because when you were reciting the spoken verse I could hear

863
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,280
the stresses.

864
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,280
Right, I was introduced, right.

865
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:54,920
Because it was my own sort of bias and internalization of my own experience as I was growing up.

866
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:00,360
It was, I was reading it the way that I had heard it recited and the traditional way of

867
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,440
reciting it as well.

868
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:27,600
And the meter has the feet are there as well so a lot of people would recite it as, so

869
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,960
I was actually adding those.

870
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:33,120
I can add an interesting little highlight here.

871
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:40,960
My friend Ralph Russell, a very well-known writer in the field of Urdu literature and

872
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,280
the author of the best book on Gollib's life.

873
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:49,600
It's called Gollib Life and Letters by Ralph Russell and his collaborator Khushidul Islam.

874
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,560
But he also was interested in meter and I've made a little handbook to teach people meter

875
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,040
and put it on my website.

876
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:00,840
He also made a handbook to teach his students meter but he had a slightly different approach.

877
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:06,800
But for this particular meter he had an English folk song that he thought corresponded to

878
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,800
it.

879
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:12,320
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine.

880
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:17,680
And this meter is, dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum.

881
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:23,640
Nok chafur ya di hechiski shou rieta hirikah.

882
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:28,840
But of course the difference is we have stress meter in English of a very flexible and disputable

883
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,840
kind.

884
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:35,040
Whereas the meter here is strictly speaking, it's supposed to be quantitative.

885
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:40,600
So that a long syllable is supposed to take twice as long to say as a short syllable.

886
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,800
Not to go higher or lower or more or less stress.

887
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,920
So that you have the opportunity to do as you like with your voice provided you're keeping

888
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,920
to the time structure of it.

889
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:56,760
And some people extend that privilege very far of my two main listads, one of them recites

890
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:03,840
very elaborately nok chafur ya di hechiski shou rieta hirikah.

891
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,080
Carras is the words and my other listad snorts when he hears that performance and he considers

892
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:14,280
it improper and one should just recite plainly and let the words do the work.

893
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,680
But of course we don't know how Calleb recited so.

894
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:21,680
Oh please.

895
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:26,680
So especially in this, there are many instances, especially in the body sport, when you go

896
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:31,680
in the week of the month line then the month you go back to the month line you would read

897
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,680
it differently.

898
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,680
And I have almost parented for this particular lesson that when you read the month of the

899
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:41,680
last chair you will come back to this and you would read it and then you would interpret

900
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:47,680
the stress on the different words that you could be at knowing what the rest of the shot

901
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,680
were.

902
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:53,320
And much more than that I would say there are great many verses of Calleb because the real

903
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:58,520
poetic unit is the verse and not the guzzle that after you had heard the second line you

904
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:03,600
would go back and reread or re-understand in your mind the first line which is really

905
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,560
a way of making a two line verse feel like a three or four line verse because you have

906
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:12,560
to go back in your head and reinterpret the first line which is quite spectacular.

907
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,560
I'm going to do this at the best.

908
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,560
Oh.

909
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,560
Sorry.

910
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,560
Sorry.

911
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,560
This is a little interdisciplinary.

912
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:26,560
First I just was thinking of the bar in the ancient Persia, the kind of same song way of

913
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,560
speaking when they told the story about Alexander the Great or what it looked.

914
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,560
But I'm also being a painter.

915
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:39,560
I'm also thinking of the Persian miniatures and the Indian miniatures and the compartmentalization

916
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:44,560
of little images and the way they interact with one another and the very tight structure

917
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:49,560
there involved with and the metaphors that are involved between a cloud and a dragon

918
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,560
and the water.

919
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,560
There are certain signs for it.

920
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:58,560
And I wondered what interaction did the painters or I guess it's the whole culture but what

921
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,560
I mean it's an interesting analogy that there are these interactions that take place.

922
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:08,560
Do you have any, do they relationship between the miniatures or anything?

923
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,560
Do you know anything in that area?

924
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:15,560
Anne Marie Schimmel actually used a very nice image.

925
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:22,560
When people used to complain that oh the guzzles themes were too hack need and boring and we

926
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:27,560
needed to give up the guzzle and start writing much freer forms of poetry and Urdu.

927
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:34,560
She compared classical guzzle and its themes to paintings of Majunun in the desert.

928
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,560
You know the lovers Leila and Majunun ran off into the desert and became a naked man

929
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,560
man cared for by the animals when he couldn't get his beloved Leila.

930
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:49,560
And so painter after painter has painted Majunun, scrawny and naked hanging out in the desert

931
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,560
being taken care of by the wild animals.

932
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:58,560
But every painter as Anne Marie Schimmel said would show his individuality by small touches.

933
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:03,560
So everybody painted the same scene but the great painter painted it differently, had some

934
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:09,560
extra thing or some trick of the light or some new way of framing the figure of Majununun

935
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:14,560
that made it all the more memorable because then it stood out from the similar paintings

936
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,560
of everybody else.

937
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,560
And I think something like that happens when you all use the same musmoons.

938
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:26,560
The same themes that your treatment of the theme becomes much more striking if you've got

939
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:32,560
something original out of it against a background of sort of well established tradition.

940
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,560
But there's also something inherent in the structure of the language and the structure of the images

941
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:42,560
because they're so highly terse and tight and...

942
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,560
They're miniatures.

943
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,560
They're miniatures.

944
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,560
Yeah.

945
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:49,560
And each little image has a universe within it and yet also the whole as a learn.

946
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:57,560
So I wondered something in the Philasonic tradition or where this concept of structure is so deep

947
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:04,560
in that middle, you know, in the Southeast Asia.

948
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:10,560
Do you have a sense of where this could go?

949
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:18,560
I'd say that yes, it's a great observation and honestly I haven't thought too much about it.

950
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:28,560
But again, just yes, thinking of the poetry and the art and the visual art as it was occurring.

951
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:38,560
Then yes, there are, you could say that the art is very poetic and the poetry is very, very visual as well.

952
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:50,560
And I really... But can we say that, for instance, if we look at Western art and Western poetry,

953
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:58,560
that the same kind of that are the images and the language structure or the political structure much more

954
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,560
much looser, like what would be an example of that?

955
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:08,560
It's not as the, I mean, romantic painting maybe in romantic poetry you could make some analogies, but this is so tight.

956
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:16,560
Being within the structural, the very thing, the building blocks or so have such an interaction with one another.

957
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:25,560
Because I mean, I've always been struck by the Persian miniatures by their telling stories that unfold and unfold

958
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:34,560
and then go off the borders, but they're still so, but they're still so enclosed and at the same time escape the border.

959
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:40,560
I don't think this happens in the poetry, does anything ever escape the structure go off?

960
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,560
I mean, will you leave the structure?

961
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:51,560
Yes, occasionally it does and now you find it happening more and more as the razelle structure itself becomes looser

962
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:57,560
or poetry is written in other formal structures other than the razelle.

963
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:07,560
So yes, especially for instance in postmodernist or the literature, yes, you find multiplicity of images that may not be connected

964
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:13,560
with any kind of deliberate intent on the writer's part as well.

965
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:22,560
At the time, we'll go to the very good song. I think that that poem is on the ministry itself.

966
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,560
Oh, is he meaning their connected, their writing and yes?

967
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,560
Yes, many of them.

968
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,560
A good part of the song.

969
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,560
She's not much familiar with this poem, she's not familiar with this poem.

970
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,560
Absolutely.

971
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:40,560
Well, think about how English poets now complain because up until recently English poets could assume that everybody knew the King James Bible

972
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:47,560
and the imagery from the Bible and they had a common set of stories that everybody knew and names they could refer to

973
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:51,560
and comparisons they could make and that was also informed European painting.

974
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:58,560
Of course, there were so many paintings of biblical scenes and such poems or poems from the Iliad and the Odyssey

975
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:04,560
and the classical tradition, but now an English poet, where does he or she go to get common imagery?

976
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:12,560
It's much harder in the culture now because we just don't have that same body of guaranteed known material.

977
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:18,560
I mean, what do we have Star Wars? I mean, it's a touchy subject.

978
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,560
Right, we did it on the subject of Star Wars.

979
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:31,560
And you mentioned Shanaama, for instance, so there were these, there's a long tradition of epics and epic prose

980
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:37,560
in Indo-Persian literature as well, just as there is an investor in the literature, so you have King Arthur's,

981
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:45,560
Stills, etc. and for the way you have the Dostania, Mirhamza, which Franek actually has done a lot of extensive work on.

982
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:59,560
And it's funny you mentioned visual arts and poetry because the Emperor Akbar in 1600s in India had commissioned a whole panel of paintings

983
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:05,560
that are just depictions of scenes from the Dostania, Mirhamza as well.

984
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:14,560
And so, yes, in a way, the written word sort of dictates as well what will be painted and how it will be painted as well.

985
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:20,560
And now I wonder if the reverse can happen as well.

986
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:28,560
I know a lot of literary works which have been painted, but I don't know about a lot of paintings

987
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:37,560
which have actually been then written about in terms of, has there been a poem written on a certain picture or not in India?

988
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:58,560
Which Japanese language sometimes will, in a way, they're always putting this kind of like an experimentation, so a lot of years have these.

989
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:12,560
And so, I think the literary or older experiments with language itself, this language would be modified from an artistic point of view or a form of each other.

990
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:19,560
Sure, actually, and I believe Fran is probably looking for the link to the calligraphy side that you have.

991
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:32,560
So, I'm going to look for the Shah Qarang Rupi-Bessar Osama because, in that case, Gollib commented about painting.

992
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,560
It's the one case that I know of. Give me a minute to find this.

993
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:45,560
And yes, calligraphy definitely, there's a long tradition of calligraphy in Indo-Persian Indian culture as well.

994
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:59,560
And yes, there were different styles as well. I'm not sure if the styles themselves were influenced by the particular language or not.

995
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:04,560
But yes, that is a question worth an answer to.

996
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:16,560
Here's a present for you and any other art history fans. Here is the one verse about which Gollib explicitly commented in painting terms.

997
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:21,560
Just look at what he said and then we'll look at the verse. He says, Rakhib, of course, has the meaning of opponent.

998
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:30,560
That is to say, Alder is the enemy of proper possession. The proof is that Kries, which Kries is the real name of the lover Majnun.

999
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:42,560
Therefore, he was called Majnun, which means possessed by gins. So, Bess is the mad lover who in life wandered around naked, remained naked even within the veil of a picture.

1000
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:48,560
The pleasure of it is that Majnun is always pictured with his body naked whenever he is pictured.

1001
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:56,560
But of course, this is atypical. This is the only case I know where he actually interpreted his own verse in terms of painting.

1002
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:01,560
This is a neat case because remember you'd only get the first line.

1003
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:12,560
Rakhib, Surosama, Nikla, Alder in every color mood mode aspect. It literally means color, but of course it has related meanings of all sorts.

1004
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:24,560
Turned out to be a rival or enemy or opponent of Surosama, which means something like dignity, proper possession, being a bourgeois kind of thing.

1005
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:31,560
And when you hear that line, you have no idea what's going on. It's a very abstract statement and it's incomprehensible. It's uninterpretable.

1006
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:37,560
So then you have to wait at the Mushyra after the poet has read the first line, and then everybody says,

1007
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:42,560
Vava, Subhan the law and starts praising him. And maybe they make him repeat the first line.

1008
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,560
And there's a big interval when you're trying to think of what the second line would be.

1009
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:53,560
Only when you hear the second line, Kries is Majnun. There's that same word, Tassvere, that we saw in the earlier verse.

1010
01:23:53,560 --> 01:24:03,560
We were looking at. Tassvere, part of that may be, part of that means veil. It's like the word people use in English, P-U-R-D-A-H, which they pronounce poor dust sometimes,

1011
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:08,560
but it's part of that means being in a curtain or being behind a curtain.

1012
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:21,560
Kries, even, this is even, in the curtain of a painting, turned out to be naked or emerged naked.

1013
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:30,560
So, in other words, Kries, or the figure of Mad Majnun who ran off and lived nakedly with the animals in the desert,

1014
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:39,560
was so opposed to all civilized bourgeois, urbane existence that even in the part of a picture,

1015
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:47,560
which ought to veil him or cover him like a paper garment as we saw in the other verse we were looking at,

1016
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:53,560
even in the part of a picture which ought to make for modesty, he turned out to be naked.

1017
01:24:53,560 --> 01:25:03,560
And Gaulib is very pleased because he's created that nice little effect that he feels is very enjoyable, and that surely the Mushyra,

1018
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:12,560
here is probably, probably enjoyed it as well because Nick La can mean turned out to be, but it also can mean literally emerged.

1019
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:26,560
So, it can actually mean even in the part of a picture as emerged naked as though he was so much breaking, so much concerned to break down the dignity and pompousness of bourgeois life,

1020
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:35,560
that his incisiveness just cut through all the pomp and circumstance that surrounds him even in a picture.

1021
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:41,560
So, it's a lovely verse, and it's anchored to the depiction of Christ and the wilderness.

1022
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,560
Let me interpret the verse.

1023
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,560
I'm sorry, I don't need to.

1024
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:52,560
We only got five minutes left, and I'd like to pass around this material on the Hoshar Foundation for people to take a look at as we're finished.

1025
01:25:52,560 --> 01:26:02,560
Oh, that's lovely of you. It's a wonderful foundation, and we know the people who are running it, and every penny goes right to women's education in Pakistan.

1026
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:11,560
It's not a big organization buying range rovers for a lot of outside experts coming in. It's people working with local schools.

1027
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,560
So, people can make a note of their website if they want to.

1028
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:25,560
It's interesting. My initial question was just answered very rapidly, and then who talked about this one, and also the question of the vocabulary, sex, death, madness, and nakedness.

1029
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:38,560
In a way, it seems as if this type of culture was a breakthrough in terms of committing people to talk about things that weren't really supposed to talk about.

1030
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:45,560
And using the proper language to talk about stuff that was not proper.

1031
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:52,560
So, I'm suggesting that this kind of was a barrier, as I said, a breakthrough in the language.

1032
01:26:52,560 --> 01:27:11,560
First of all, being able to talk to in a valid manner, is that it was that sort of controversial thing in and of itself talking about, talking about the effect of women on a death station, being protected, and all that sort of.

1033
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:26,560
Right, and yes, with the caveat that, yes, it was many times within the veil of the masculine gender, but everyone knew who to interpret it as both as well.

1034
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:37,560
And yes, I completely agree. They did use their poetic license to very good and very intense effect to talk about these things.

1035
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:46,560
And to really link them as Fran was mentioning earlier that these were mystical themes.

1036
01:27:46,560 --> 01:28:06,560
And even in this couple of over here, the interplay of Parda and Orya of nakedness and hidden, it's always the native speaker or reader will automates almost subconsciously be drawn into the contradiction between the two.

1037
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:16,560
And the contradiction between the hidden, what we really know, do we really know anything going to decartian philosophy, etc.

1038
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:33,560
But yes, I do feel that they did use their poetic license as a thing to talk about things that weren't the topics of everyday conversation in prose, for instance,

1039
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:39,560
between a couple of people who were just chatting in the marketplace, for instance.

1040
01:28:39,560 --> 01:29:03,560
But I think what you do say is not my impression, it's not my impression that I don't think the, for example, the most reference to my thinking is from Parda and many of the others, and in person poetry.

1041
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:13,560
And the idea is never really the one that I own that is kind of expressing what couldn't be expressed because of society within the other.

1042
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:19,560
So it's never being put in the symbolic, everything the right, the symbolic is not literal.

1043
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:31,560
Drinking, there's nothing to do with actually drinking, it's a symbolic of a change of level of consciousness.

1044
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,560
Right.

1045
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:37,560
Is there anything you would like to listen to that is safe room in all of this?

1046
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:45,560
I mean, I'm just thinking now that Greeks couldn't have something come true.

1047
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:58,560
Sure, yes, it could have because in the middle ages, there was a whole flowering of Andalusian and South, Southern, Spanish, Moorish culture.

1048
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:09,560
And the Arabs are famously supposed to have a rescued Greek science and philosophy from oblivion, while Europe was going through its dark ages.

1049
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:13,560
I mean, these are of course very loose time periods and categorizations.

1050
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:25,560
You know, the Queen of Shiva, the song of Solomon, and the biblical, you know, it was supposedly for the love of God, but also, you know, both human love, physical, but beyond his love.

1051
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:38,560
Yes, definitely. Right, definitely. So there's hardly any poetry in the classical period which talks just about sex or drunkenness or death just on their own as phenomenon.

1052
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:51,560
It's always tight, it's always a road, a metaphor for a broader achievement of consciousness or dissipation of oneself into the divine whole.

1053
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:55,560
Well, I'm afraid we're going to have to stop.

1054
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:56,560
Thank you very much.

1055
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:01,560
I feel like a door has opened into a wonderful mansion.

1056
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,560
Thank you so much.

1057
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:23,560
Thank you.
