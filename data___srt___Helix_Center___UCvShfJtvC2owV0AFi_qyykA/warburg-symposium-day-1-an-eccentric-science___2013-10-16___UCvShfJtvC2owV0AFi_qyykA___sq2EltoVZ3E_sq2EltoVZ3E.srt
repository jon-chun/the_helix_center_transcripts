1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
I have the pleasure to present you, George L. Ebermann.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,680
I don't know exactly how I will do that.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,920
I saw that in the program of Hans-Wakie-Wiege,

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,400
it was your book in the middle of the program

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,640
in an excellent position, the surviving image.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,560
I don't know exactly how to say in English about Nachlebahn.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,440
It's an excellent book of George L. Ebermann,

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,120
which is not yet translated in English, perhaps no.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,160
We are waiting for that because it is an important book

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,160
about Abi-Barbog and this unnamed science,

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,200
which include and extended beyond the limit

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,360
of different sciences.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,160
And I think we are in the same dispositive

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,480
at Nachlebahn created the same frame of thinking.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,360
We are with history, philosophy, anthropology,

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,960
ethnology, perhaps metrology, psychology, and also biology,

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,480
looking for another science which is beyond the limit

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,120
of these different sciences.

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,400
And I think it is the experience that we will do

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,800
during these two days.

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,960
And the purpose of our own table is to revisit

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,120
the important concept of Abi-Barbog, like Nachlebahn,

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,040
Patos Formal, Memosin, and it is important

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,800
to have now a discussion with you.

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,080
And you have to use the podium.

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,400
Thank you very much, Francois.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,280
I'm so happy to be posted.

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,000
How is the type of knowledge inaugurated

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,040
by Warbog useful as today, useful for us today?

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,680
Shouldn't we say simply that it is useful

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,280
for opening the territory of that major science,

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,080
this royal science has to use the vocabulary of gildolos

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,320
and phillics gateri from their essay

34
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,680
on the cartography of knowledge, mil plato?

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,920
That is history as such.

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:36,640
Notice, opening can be understood in two senses at least.

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,240
To open is to enlarge, but it's also to wound.

38
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,160
Now, this is not the same thing for the science of history,

39
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,560
which is my interlocutor here.

40
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,080
To accept its opening to images under the angle of enlargement

41
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,240
as it is under the angle of perforation.

42
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,280
To enlarge its domain to images means

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,120
to accept certainly new objects, but it is also

44
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,920
to capture them, to enclose them,

45
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,720
under a common administration that pre-exists them.

46
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,400
This is to envisage interdisciplinarity

47
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,080
from the perspective of territorial relations,

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,800
so that opening itself to images reduces, more or less,

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,360
reduces the extending of its empire,

50
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,960
its authority over new landscapes and objects.

51
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,600
Totally different is the opening that wounds perforate

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,640
traverses the territory that hosts the operation.

53
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,760
This opening alone possesses a critical dimension,

54
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,920
dimension, I think, an extraterritorial capacity

55
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,680
to cross the frontiers, to create

56
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,960
unsuspected paths and to modify the plane of consistency

57
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,000
of the territory traversed.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,480
The work of Vabog has long been recognized

59
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,120
for its capacity to enlarge the territory of the historian

60
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,280
and also art history.

61
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,480
But it seems more difficult today, even as yesterday,

62
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,800
to recognize its capacity to wound,

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,600
to critique this territory itself.

64
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,600
It is not by chance that the importance

65
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,600
of this critical aspect of Vabog's work has been recognized

66
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,600
before everyone else by historians of art who were careful

67
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
to construct their arguments philosophically,

68
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,600
like at Garvinte in the 30s, and by philosophers who are aware

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,600
of cultural history as, for instance,

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,200
Georgiou Agamben, because your quotation of the La Chienza

71
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,600
sensea no me is an expression taken by Georgiou Agamben

72
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,600
from the art historian Robert Clam.

73
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:34,600
This meant that we are in this discipline, like in a battlefield,

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,600
a field of battle.

75
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,600
It's a perpetual replenaging into the game of clashing theories

76
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,600
where certain objects are studied against others

77
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,600
in order that certain models of historicity are meaning,

78
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,600
and meaning, excuse me, are made to emerge against others.

79
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:03,600
It is thus that confronting the iconographic sign

80
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,600
that Erwin Panowski enlarged into an iconological symbol,

81
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
a Vabog will in advance,

82
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,600
construct the hypothesis of a regime of images

83
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,600
based on a paradoxical economy, a visual, a temporal,

84
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
a signifying economy of what I would call,

85
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,600
and here in this house, it's significant, the symptom,

86
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,600
that third at the same time was elaborating into

87
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,600
illuminating new shocking theory.

88
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,600
It's impossible for me to go into the details here,

89
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,600
concerning the complexity of these epistemologic debates.

90
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Perhaps it will be enough to recall certain lines of divisions.

91
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,600
There where Panowski was thinking of the symbol.

92
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,600
By way of the logical development of a theme,

93
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,600
as was shown, for instance, in his brilliant deduction

94
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,600
of the iconography of DÃ¼rer's Melancholy

95
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,600
as deriving from ancient and medieval premises

96
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,600
synthesized for the occasion,

97
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Vabog was exposing figurative symptoms

98
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,600
through the paradoxical not the deuxion,

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,600
eruption of a memory of unconscious movement.

100
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,600
That entered into conflict with the common sense

101
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,600
given of a shared culture.

102
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,600
In short, when the symbol unites,

103
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,600
the symptom divides.

104
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,600
There where the symbol brings into accord

105
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,600
in a common cultural territory,

106
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,600
the symptom mobilizes a disturbing transversal

107
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
across that territory.

108
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,600
There where the symbol is handed down by a tradition,

109
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
for instance, humanism, the symptom

110
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
migrates and perforates the traditional evidence

111
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
of common sense by what I call an

112
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,600
anachronistic accident, for instance,

113
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,600
the unexpected eruption of a Arab astrologer

114
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,600
at the heart of a cycle of Renaissance frescoes.

115
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,600
There where the symbol speaks of a conformity

116
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,600
of images and of discourses, the symptoms reveals

117
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
as many of their differences,

118
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
their failures to communicate,

119
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
their conflicts, their incommensorabilities.

120
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
There where the world of symbols

121
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,600
appear in the coherence of its unity,

122
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,600
that of symptoms puts into play

123
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,600
an unexpected diversity of montage, montages,

124
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
heterogeneity.

125
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,600
There where the symbol includes us

126
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,600
in the encompassing world of a great

127
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,600
cultural infrastructure where everyone

128
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,600
needs to recognize, the symptom brings to the surface,

129
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,600
as though pulling it up from below,

130
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,600
perforating elements that, in their local space,

131
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,600
booby traps, such an identification.

132
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Therefore, the symbol cementizes

133
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,600
the present from a prolonged past,

134
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,600
the symptom de cementizes the present

135
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
from an instance of forgetting that

136
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
explodes as a repetition,

137
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,600
nachthaglicate, return of the repressed, etc.

138
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
One should understand that

139
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
it's the entire psychic, temporal, and visual economy

140
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
which finds itself here, divided,

141
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,600
in this way between the encompassing territory of symbols

142
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
and the traversing movements of the

143
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,600
critical movements of symptoms.

144
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,600
One example, will perfectly, I suppose,

145
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
illustrate this economy.

146
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,600
We could even think of it as a kind of a lagerie.

147
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,600
It is Abi-Vabo's gradiva.

148
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,600
The name of her is NINFA.

149
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Singled out by Vabo in Florence during the period

150
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,600
between 1888 and 1893

151
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
when he was preparing his thesis

152
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,600
on the mythological paintings of Botticelli.

153
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Vabo was attempting to make an archaeology

154
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,600
of the first Italian Renaissance

155
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,600
based on a new object that was first assigned

156
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
to representation and then generalized

157
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
to all forms of cultural life,

158
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,600
symbolic lives, therefore.

159
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
This object, that object, was the

160
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,600
living motion for which

161
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Befobaticelli, Donatello, for example,

162
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Montenier II, especially Donatello,

163
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
went in search of models from

164
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,600
paradoxically living motion,

165
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,600
but the models were found on the sides

166
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,600
of Roman sarcophagi, death,

167
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
where they found impassioned poses

168
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
of lamentations, but also erotic

169
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
pursuits, dramatic scenes of war, etc.

170
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
What fascinated Vabo as he stood

171
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
in front of Botticelli's paintings,

172
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,600
or similarly reading the poem of Politiano,

173
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,600
the theoretical press question of Alberti, etc.

174
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
was thus, I quote,

175
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
the remarkable attempt to delineate

176
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,600
transitory movement, basing his research

177
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
on such a common evidence,

178
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,600
therefore I repeat, symbolic form.

179
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Vabo wanted to focalize his gaze

180
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
on a figure-out, a particularity,

181
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
which in the art of Renaissance Florence

182
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,600
repeated itself from place to place,

183
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,600
never finding itself thematized as such,

184
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,600
but breaking the surface and insisting

185
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
like a symptomatic form,

186
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,600
modifying in-depth the economy of images.

187
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Whether they were employed as

188
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
corporal resemblances,

189
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
perspectival constructions,

190
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
likeness of Vabo,

191
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Alberti's Historia.

192
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Thus, this symptomatic form

193
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,600
modifies the representation of motion,

194
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,600
for example, of a character who walks or runs

195
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
transversely to the supplement

196
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,600
of two fundamental processes,

197
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,600
firstly, as a question of a displacement

198
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,600
of intensity, which marks itself

199
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,600
notably in an unexpected contrast

200
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,600
between the sculptural impenetrability

201
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
of Venus in Botticelli,

202
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,600
and the impassioned dance of the

203
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
bevectors by Vek, the accessory in movement,

204
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
unbound hair, draperies,

205
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
the wind.

206
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
The second process, fundamental,

207
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,600
is insufferable from the first.

208
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Here, it's a matter of something that one could name

209
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,600
an eccentric,

210
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
transversal symptomatic forces at play,

211
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,600
and of their capacity to sweep the representation

212
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
like a breath of air,

213
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,600
be it a breeze or a high wind,

214
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,600
to sweep the space where it's superviness,

215
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,600
where it passes, where it occurs

216
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
in French,

217
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
passÃ©, and ilse passquÃ©,

218
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,600
que chor.

219
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,600
A lot of troubling things outside of the center

220
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
of Renaissance paintings,

221
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
as for instance, in the primavera.

222
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Look at the right, the right border.

223
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
ZÃ©fir is fecundating the nymph Clarisse,

224
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,600
and the latter already vomiting her children

225
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
in the form of a bracelet of flowers

226
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
escaping from her mouth.

227
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,600
One must define these weird scenes

228
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
as transversal,

229
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,600
since they modify from one border to the other,

230
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,600
the totality of the image is affected by those motions,

231
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
be it on this chromatic level,

232
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
but photographs of the verbal thesis,

233
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,600
so the chromatic level is,

234
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
I'm sorry, it's not here,

235
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,600
the level of the dynamism of forms

236
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,600
or of their significance, of course, finally.

237
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,600
It is equally necessary to qualify them as eccentric

238
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
in so far as especially their emerged,

239
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
most often along the borders of the painting,

240
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
and metaphorically they denote what Verbo wanted to call

241
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,600
the external cause of the image,

242
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,600
external cause of which he sought to theorize

243
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,600
the psychic tenor from the side of Fantasia

244
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
and dream images, images of memory,

245
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
images of desire at the same time,

246
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
images tied to passion, that is to say,

247
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,600
to a regime situated below that of consciousness,

248
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,600
just as a wind is eccentric by definition,

249
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,600
to the place it sweeps, of course,

250
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,600
the id to the ego that is upset,

251
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,600
and the symptom to the symbolic world

252
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,600
where we have taken our bearings and habits

253
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,600
so to the ninja that figure in movement

254
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,600
who seems in Renaissance images

255
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
to have emerged from the backstage

256
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
and come to modify the total economy of the representation

257
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
in making something impassioned,

258
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,600
something of the memory of the desire,

259
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
which passes here.

260
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Verbo recognized innumerable instances,

261
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
but it's a leaf, leaf, peep, peep,

262
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
in turic, manteÃ±a, Leonardo, perugino,

263
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
rafero, et cetera, et cetera,

264
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,600
but when they, looking at the border

265
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
of one of Girlandaio's frescoes

266
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,600
in the Santa Maria novella in Florence,

267
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,600
he discovered something like the contestants of this phenomenon,

268
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,600
and yet it was only a serving girl,

269
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,600
modest, humble, carrying a plate of fruit on her head.

270
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,600
But it was a photograph of this gracious figure

271
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,600
that came to be carefully framed and glued

272
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,600
on the cover of a new notebook from 1900,

273
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
entitled, Ninfa Fiorentina.

274
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,600
The manuscript presents us with a collection of fragments

275
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,600
for what Verbo envisioned as his noon-fenn project.

276
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,600
At first, it takes the form of a friendly correspondence

277
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:07,600
between the historian and the linguist Andrei Yales.

278
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
On the question of Girlandaio's female figure

279
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
that we see enter, so to speak,

280
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,600
from the right handboarder of the fresco,

281
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
which is depicting the birth of Saint John the Baptist

282
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,600
in the Tona Boni Chapel in Santa Maria novella.

283
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,600
There's no doubt that Yales, in his text,

284
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,600
has already integrated all the aesthetic

285
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
and theoretical observations contained

286
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
in the preceding analysis of Verbo

287
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,600
on the representation of living motion.

288
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Thus, what Verbo had revealed under the iconographic angle

289
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:52,600
of the erotic pursuit, Zeffi, Chlorix, Apollo Daphne,

290
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Yales had maliciously displaced as a virtual play

291
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,600
between the spectator himself and the Ninfa,

292
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
like the le Porcivir,

293
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600
which so's it grace in the works of Girlandaio.

294
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,600
In the manuscript, there is this phrase by Yales,

295
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,600
ChÃ©chilapham, mine Lieber.

296
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,600
He wrote this in order to make clear

297
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,600
that it's a matter of desire,

298
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,600
like an inadmissible symptom

299
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,600
in the midst of the religious sin depicted

300
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
in the Tona Boni Chapel.

301
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,600
He evokes the ethereal grace of her steps,

302
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
making of her a cosy pagan goddess,

303
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,600
a practically extraterrestrial, he says,

304
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:02,600
creature, just as the air seems equally animated,

305
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,600
just for her, this is a close space,

306
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,600
with a local wind that swells her antique dress,

307
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
swells her antique dress, in short.

308
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,600
This young Ninfa seems to be something like a phantom

309
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
of feminine grace, who traverses the scene

310
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
with her light footsteps,

311
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,600
and almost high aerial creature,

312
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,600
an apparition that even provokes in Yales

313
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
a sentiment of imma-repressible unheimly,

314
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,600
something between a nightmare and a tale for children, he says.

315
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,600
So new questions present themselves,

316
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,600
questions that VÃ¡burgi was really asking himself,

317
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,600
this question especially,

318
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,600
where have I already seen

319
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,600
her, which is very psycho-analytical, of course.

320
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,600
This was a wave of VÃ¡burg to dialogue not only with Yales

321
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,600
but with himself, through the most radical prism

322
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
of his conceptual scheme,

323
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
namely that of Naftleben,

324
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,600
as the symptomatic model of the temporality of images.

325
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Not only did Gerlandaio not respect

326
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,600
the dogmatic iconography of the religious order

327
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,600
that owned the church, but he even in accordance

328
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,600
with Tarnabroni instructions, probably,

329
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,600
sprinkling that figure of the Ninfa,

330
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,600
all over the place, which soon provoked

331
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,600
the anger of Savonarola, by the way.

332
00:21:50,600 --> 00:22:00,600
This is presentation of the Virgin in the same channel.

333
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,600
You see these two charming children

334
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,600
who emerged from the two borders of the Marriag of the Virgin,

335
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,600
here on their female dancers,

336
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,600
traversing the nomination of John the Baptist,

337
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,600
of course, Salome,

338
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,600
in the operation of the angel to the Carriers.

339
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,600
There is a representation in Barriagliaef

340
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,600
and also this angel, a young, effeminate,

341
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,600
winged man, clothed, alantica.

342
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,600
And in the ultraviolet massacre of the innocence,

343
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,600
there are some quasi-menads transformed into furies,

344
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,600
avatars of media.

345
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Finally, there is this young woman

346
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,600
who is a wonderful young woman,

347
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,600
carrying fruits as in the birth of John the Baptist,

348
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,600
and she emerges in Grisail, like a phantom,

349
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,600
from the background, the background of the visitation.

350
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,600
We are thus put confronted with a truly figurative strategy,

351
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,600
a strategy of nomadic apparitions,

352
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,600
eruptions, interruptions.

353
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Ninfas do appear here and there

354
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,600
as this symptomatic figure coming from who knows where.

355
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Again, antiquity surely, but which one?

356
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Under what name?

357
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,600
The nymph, graciously,

358
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,600
opens the symbolic conventions of the space

359
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,600
which she traverses and modifies

360
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,600
with the kind of perverse innocence, if I may say so.

361
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,600
In reality, two territorial logics

362
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,600
are attacked, critic,

363
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,600
that is to say, put into crisis by this nomadic figure.

364
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,600
The first territory is that of church itself,

365
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,600
in its role as a sacred place,

366
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,600
and also in its role as a community of believers,

367
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,600
values, taboos, of course.

368
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
From this point of view,

369
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,600
it's almost indecent in such a context

370
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,600
to see the emergence of a figure as clearly sensual as this,

371
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
on whose drapery accentuates the contours

372
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,600
at the anterior level of the arms,

373
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
the thighs, the breasts,

374
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,600
with that gravity-defying body

375
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,600
from the bare feet to the denser's pace.

376
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Doesn't the Atlantic address by itself

377
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,600
impose already an image of a pagan goddess or nymph

378
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,600
in this scene consecrated to the chaste,

379
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,600
precursor of Christ?

380
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,600
The second territory that is attacked

381
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,600
and perturbed by the emergence of the nympha

382
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,600
is none other than the solemn bourgeois one

383
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,600
of the Tonaboni family, the church, the family.

384
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,600
George O'Vazari has well described the birth of St. John the Baptist

385
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,600
as a scene of a kind directly referring

386
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,600
to the rights of maternity in Quattrochante Florence.

387
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,600
He says there is a beautiful woman

388
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
who carries following the Florentine custom,

389
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,600
fruits and flasks of wine from the country.

390
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,600
We can see then,

391
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,600
with this precise example, how far the cycle of GÃ©ralandayo,

392
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,600
in spite of his religious iconography,

393
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,600
is inscribed with the lay cymbals of the Florentine bourgeoisie,

394
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,600
whom Christian Clapiers-Yubeyer has dedicated

395
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,600
a wonderful and tropical study,

396
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,600
and of whom Joseph Schmidt has analyzed the issues

397
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,600
in work on the Tonaboni chapel itself.

398
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,600
In the symbolic economy, I say symbolic,

399
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
of the birth of St. John the Baptist,

400
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,600
the younger who emerges from the right-hand side

401
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,600
of the image is thus only a simple servant.

402
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,600
According to a long-established custom in Florence,

403
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,600
she carries from the country, from Villa,

404
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,600
outside to Palazzo in the city.

405
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Fresh fruits and wine, which will give force

406
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,600
to the mother, lying in bed after the birth

407
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,600
within the walls of her Palazzo.

408
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,600
But the symptomatic economy of the Ninefa

409
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,600
appears when we discover in that very conformity

410
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,600
the critical effect resulting from differences

411
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,600
that are incarnated by the young serving girl in her stride.

412
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,600
We observe, for instance, how much she differs

413
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,600
from the other serving girl, the one who, in the background

414
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,600
of the scene, carries also the same flasks

415
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,600
to her mistress, and we catch ourselves,

416
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,600
imagining that the two figures are perhaps

417
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,600
two versions, two fashions, to see the same serving girl.

418
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Why not? Just an hypothesis.

419
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,600
The effect of strangeness is found in any case,

420
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,600
doubled. On one side, the young serving girl

421
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,600
with no name. In the economy of the portraits,

422
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,600
the young lady in the center, she has a name,

423
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,600
a prosopography, artistry, history of portraits,

424
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,600
okay, names.

425
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,600
This serving girl with no name in the economy of the portraits,

426
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,600
which are besides those

427
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,600
of the great family, sorry.

428
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,600
And the young lady has also two servants,

429
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,600
with her. On the other side,

430
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,600
the young serving girl comes from

431
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,600
elsewhere, from another

432
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,600
symbolic space, from another time,

433
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,600
the past epoch of paganism,

434
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,600
and another time than that of the bourgeois ceremony,

435
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,600
the now of Florentine customs, or the

436
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,600
evangelical event, the past of sacred history.

437
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,600
They are all means, these are

438
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,600
all means, to denote the extraterritorial

439
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,600
ity, the eccentric and perturbin,

440
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,600
and in short, what I would call critical character of the

441
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,600
NINFA. Why does this figure travel not only the figurative

442
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,600
production of the Renaissance, but as well, the entire

443
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,600
body of Abba Vabo's work? Because

444
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,600
she crystallizes, and up to a point

445
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,600
of view, and she realizes, just like

446
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Graziva for FjÃ¶d, a goodly portion

447
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,600
of his theoretical choices, his objects of interpretation,

448
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,600
and his models of historicity. We are hardly surprised

449
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,600
that a panel of Mne Mosine atlas has been

450
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,600
dedicated to her. The NINFA,

451
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,600
the idea of the idealandios, a legurized first,

452
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,600
naphleben, the survival, the afterlife, constructed

453
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,600
by Abba Vabo as a model of temporality, necessary to understand the

454
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,600
economy of a recollection of images

455
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,600
that was reducible neither to the

456
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,600
idealistic principles of the imitation of the engines,

457
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,600
nor to the positivistic recourse to an iconographic

458
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,600
tradition. NINFA, consequently,

459
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,600
offers us the complexity of a trans- iconographic

460
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,600
and trans-historical model in the context

461
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,600
of a representation that refers to the classics.

462
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,600
The NINFA is still only

463
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,600
an adequate sitation. Iconographic

464
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,600
sign, perfectly consistent with the symbolic universe

465
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,600
that stages it. Classics,

466
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Roman, Greek. But in a context of

467
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,600
Christian representation as

468
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,600
the case here in the nerve center of the largest

469
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,600
Dominican church in Florence, with

470
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,600
the, it's the same in the case of St. Mary Magdalene

471
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,600
being represented at the foot of the cross

472
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,600
with the features of a minute, a hair

473
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,600
unbound, stripped of clothing, violent,

474
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,600
such as with unbound hair, violent, and

475
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,600
stripped of clothings, which is how Donatello,

476
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,600
or here, Bertoldo de Giovanni, present her, for instance.

477
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Therefore, the NINFA becomes a critical

478
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,600
sitation. It's a sitation, but a critical one. She makes

479
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,600
something surface as a counter motif, an unconscious

480
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,600
of representation. In short, it's a symptom.

481
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,600
It's a fleeting, fossil, traversing figurative space

482
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,600
like an accident or an unbidded phantom.

483
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Moreover, the NINFA incarnates and allegorizes

484
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,600
the economy of that Patos formel

485
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,600
that Abba Abbivarborg tried to describe

486
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,600
the lateral transmissions and the missing links

487
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,600
in the long du dure of occidental art.

488
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,600
It's not simply a matter of opposing static representation

489
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,600
of medieval to the living motion in Renaissance,

490
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,600
but it's also necessary to understand the phenomena of

491
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,600
intensification of movement. This problem is crucial

492
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,600
in which Italian art from Polayolo to Michelangelo

493
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,600
experimented with all the possibilities.

494
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,600
In the fresco of Guillen Dio, the NINFA opposes

495
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,600
her dynamism against the immobility of

496
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,600
all the other figures, but she's not satisfied

497
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,600
with merely working graciously

498
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,600
as everything converges in intensifying her motion.

499
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,600
The position of her body, her left foot

500
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,600
is slightly lifted up, the robes streaming in the wind

501
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,600
and therefore enlarging her gesture

502
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,600
and propagating it around her.

503
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,600
We rediscover here a characteristic of Renaissance visual culture

504
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,600
the importance of which has been shown,

505
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,600
of course, by Michael Betsendall and also Charon Fermour.

506
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,600
That is the strictly choreographic fashion of envisioning

507
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,600
the human gesture in representation.

508
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,600
There is no doubt besides that the recognition of these

509
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,600
processes of intensification responded in

510
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,600
VÃ¡bog's work with a theoretical awareness of

511
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,600
intensified forms in the total epistemic

512
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,600
of his own time, aesthetic of intensity

513
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
Nietzsche,

514
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,600
and the passion of attitudes Charon Fert.

515
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Let's also recall that VÃ¡bog in order to

516
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,600
explicate the patos formel in terms of

517
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,600
superlatives of the language of gestures

518
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Utilizai utilized as an

519
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,600
anthropological argument the analogy with

520
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,600
this famous separation function,

521
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,600
in the Indo-European languages studied by the linguist

522
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Herman Ostov, doesn't

523
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,600
the intensification of bonus

524
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,600
into malia and the intensification of malia

525
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,600
into optimus, so three different radicals

526
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,600
suppose a change in the linguistic route

527
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,600
therefore the graceful serving girl

528
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,600
with the light footstep who is an expectedly

529
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,600
invited into the iconography of John the Baptist

530
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,600
would thus be fundamentally

531
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,600
deracinate, a strange woman,

532
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,600
a stranger, an extraterritorial

533
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,600
no green card

534
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,600
anthropologically speaking

535
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,600
the serving girls anonymity

536
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,600
reminds us of one of Abbivabog's first intuition

537
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,600
when reading the work of Edward B. Tyler

538
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,600
concerning the survival observed in Mexico around

539
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,600
1860, he understood that the

540
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,600
survival only appeared contrary to the assumed

541
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,600
traditions as transversal symptoms, phenomena

542
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,600
where unfit to use Tyler's own

543
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,600
expression unfit, that is to say

544
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,600
in adapted, obsolete and congruced, ephemeral

545
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,600
and acronistic, thus in 1895

546
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,600
and 6, when Abbivog visited

547
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,600
the Indians of New Mexico, he would be interested

548
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,600
in impersonal rituals and

549
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,600
anonymous persons, stubborn symptoms like that

550
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Pueblo woman on the right,

551
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,600
that he photographed at the moment that she promptly

552
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,600
regained the back hole of her quarters, fleeing

553
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,600
the eye of the black chamber of the camera or

554
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,600
fleeing the reach of the accidental

555
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,600
logos. The figures and the paradigm of the

556
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,600
human being that helps us finally to better understand

557
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,600
where the history of images must find

558
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,600
its efficacious end to appear

559
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,600
and act as a knowledge that is a repeat against

560
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,600
transversal to those disciplines

561
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,600
constituted in the social sciences

562
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,600
the question is in you for me, the

563
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,600
neurology,

564
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,600
the psychology, but in the social sciences

565
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,600
according to the limits of more or less

566
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,600
defined territories, in photographing himself

567
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,600
a lady, peasant lady

568
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,600
in Setignano here.

569
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Vabog made evident the temporal

570
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:22,600
transversality of his

571
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,600
concept of Naftleben, setting an image

572
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,600
of a gold star.

573
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Between coins of antiquity and representations of

574
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,600
media, he also made evident the social

575
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,600
transversality of his notion of Patos Formel, but

576
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,600
chiefly he made evident the critical

577
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,600
and finally in the last plates of

578
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Naemozune, political dimension of this transversal

579
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,600
especially when he spoke about Geistus

580
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,600
politics, for example, which remain inherent of all

581
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,600
his analysis, which remain agonistic, generally

582
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,600
as they were to the point of madness

583
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,600
with the devastation of the First World War

584
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,600
to, in general, the tragedy of western culture

585
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,600
which is an expression he used as well as

586
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Georzimel, for example. Perhaps we should

587
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,600
read the Vabogian transversals today in the light of

588
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Michel Foucault's writing in which eccentric

589
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,600
transversals fall under the term heterotopias

590
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,600
all of Gildolous and Felix Guattari,

591
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,600
I come back to Dulous because we learn in

592
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,600
a thousand plateau this, which is a major

593
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,600
point that nomadic knowledge

594
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,600
nomadic knowledges, however

595
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,600
dismissively they are ranked, however

596
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,600
light are the footsteps, can act

597
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,600
in spite of everything like a real what

598
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Dulous

599
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,600
says is a machine of war against

600
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,600
the territorial instrument of

601
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Royal Sciences, so to speak, always

602
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,600
monastÃ©, monast, by their self-sufficient

603
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Thank you.
