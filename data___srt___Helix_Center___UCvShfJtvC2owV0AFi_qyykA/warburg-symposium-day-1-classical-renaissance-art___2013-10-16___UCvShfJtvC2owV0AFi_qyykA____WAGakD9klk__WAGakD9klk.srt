1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
Good afternoon. We are ready for this afternoon's panel, which will be on classical and Renaissance art

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,880
essentially. We have several participants. The first one we already heard this morning,

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,080
Georges D. Ubermann, who is a philosopher and art historian and he teaches at the Echol

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,680
de Zoudde to the South Social, is the author of several books, just to mention a few images

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,160
in spite of all, for photographs from Auschwitz confronting images, questioning the ends of

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,360
certain history of art. And this is just a sampler. You have more in the description.

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:48,520
The next member of this panel is Thomas Dacosta Kaufmann. And Dr. Kaufmann is Frederick Markman,

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,400
professor of art and archaeology at Princeton University. He's authored several books also

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,840
and again the list is in the leaflet, but I can just mention a couple, Archimbaldo, visual jokes,

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,120
natural history and still life paintings, painterly enlightenment, the art of France, Anton Malbert.

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:17,440
The next member of the panel is Francois Quivizier. And he is actually curator of digital resources

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,600
and librarian and researcher at the Warburg Institute in London. And we owe to him the nice

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:30,160
iconography that we have for the current workshop. He has written recently a book on the sensory world

14
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:38,680
of Italian Renaissance art. The other member of the panel is Dorothea Rockburn. She's an artist

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,800
who works with both industrial and natural materials, paintings and she cuts, draws, falls and calculates

16
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:52,560
to create complex works of art built upon mathematical foundations. She has been, she has had several

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:01,120
exhibits and actually currently she has an exhibit at the MoMA until January 20th on drawing which makes

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:10,960
itself. And the last member of the panel is Christopher Wood who is a professor at Yale since 1992.

19
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:18,000
He is currently visiting professor in the German department of NYU. He has taught as a visiting scholar

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,640
at different universities and he's author of several books including Albrecht R. Dolfer and the

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,840
Origins of Landscape, Forgery, Replica, Fiction, Temporalities of German Renaissance Art among other

22
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:43,120
books. So I just have another announcement to make that actually Ed mentioned. There is here as a

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:52,320
participant to the workshop Eric Breitbart and he has actually made a documentary on Abi Warburg

24
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:01,600
entitled Abi Warburg Archives of Memory. It lasts I think 27 minutes if I to be precise and so those

25
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,160
of you are interested in watching it we could actually have it after the round table have a look at this

26
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:17,120
documentary so I actually think it's a good idea to stay on for another half hour. So have the panel

27
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,360
and I don't know who will start. Ed, are you on the back of the ceremony? I can stand by asking

28
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:31,760
what I can ask you. Perhaps, well I'm listening to this this morning someone told me that not much

29
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:39,600
has been spoken about Warburg but really about what he opened and his method and when I open my

30
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:48,000
computer now I see hundreds and thousands of images and the problem is how to make sense of these images.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,920
So really my first question would be to Jor did you bear man what is the relevance of Warburg to

32
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,680
the current practice of iconography because indeed in this time Warburg was accumulating his collection

33
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,320
for his own purpose. Now we can log into an image database like art store to take a very obvious

34
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:16,880
example which has 1.5 million images and it's really a sign of the internet this kind of overwhelming

35
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,760
quantity of images which increasingly demand for most scholars an ability to make sense of that

36
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:31,920
mass of data. So Jor maybe you like to start by pointing out what would be the kind of relevance

37
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,400
of Warburg's method to the current state of the practice of looking at images.

38
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:50,320
It's a big question. Let us say first that in the beloved Warburg Institute there are two

39
00:04:50,320 --> 00:05:04,800
two things. One is the photo library which is very big and the other is Nemozinian class.

40
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,840
You spoke about hundreds of thousands of images and in the Nemozinian class there is only

41
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:25,440
1000 image so to speak. Therefore I think that the question of databases the hundreds of millions

42
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:33,440
of billions of images you are dealing with as a librarian as an archivist is one thing. The other

43
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,480
thing is to make a night-class. I mean there is a crucial and conceptual difference between

44
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:51,360
an archive and atlas. Archive is a tool. Atlas is a work. It's a decision. It's an act of

45
00:05:51,360 --> 00:06:03,600
interpretation and I would say that I am more interested I use thanks to you and other. I use

46
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:12,240
archives but my aim my work is directed towards atlas. That is to say to make a decision

47
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:21,760
to make a montage an editing a proper editing to make sense with the relation of two images three

48
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:34,240
four fourteen one thousand why not more but this is a complete difference very big difference that

49
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,200
to organize an archive a database and to make a night-class. Absolutely so the question really

50
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:50,640
is how to make an atlas out of that proliferation of images. What kind of

51
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:57,200
methods for instance this morning there was a discussion about aesthetic art etc if you look

52
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,280
at the way 16th century people look at images they don't think of art if you look for instance

53
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:10,320
at records of iconoclasm people attack images in general whether they're on their painting

54
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:17,360
whether they're on liturgical utensile etc so I was wondering whether precisely that proliferation

55
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:25,280
of images that accessibility force us to think outside these categories of aesthetic experience

56
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:34,720
and think rather in terms of of response to two images. You want to say something?

57
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
On that?

58
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,720
What is the question? What is the question? What do you do when you're trying to make a point

59
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,320
about the Renaissance and instead of I think you know 100 small reproduction you have 10,000

60
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,880
images when you're looking for mercury instead of I think you know six photocopies and three

61
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,720
books do you have? How does the quantity affect the art non-art distinction? It seemed to me that

62
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,200
in the 19th century with a much smaller database and this was what George was saying,

63
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,040
Varbour and many others he wasn't the only one we're perfectly capable of a distinguish between

64
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,000
works that have been or let's say images that have been institutionalized as art works and functioned

65
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,560
within some kind of art system and those that weren't so are you suggesting somehow that it's

66
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,360
the quantity of images today that's available that blurs the distinction? Or perhaps that calls

67
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:49,600
for different approaches to two images. For instance if I search for mercury in the Varbour

68
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:58,800
guy demographic data I won't only find images by femme spencers. I would find mercury in the

69
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:06,080
view of beer mugs and stuff. If you search on Google you might do better. Yeah possibly but what I mean

70
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,480
is that with these instruments you can see images in a far broader context than you could earlier

71
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,600
and perhaps think more in terms of responses to images than in the kind of rather basic symbology

72
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:32,160
that is implicit in the iconographic method. Fucu said to know is to cut. So I didn't answer

73
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,360
exactly your questions because your question was what do you do now which by the way is not

74
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:46,960
a round table about renaissance it's about now but why not? Okay now I can just speak of an

75
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:54,000
experience I did. I organized an exhibition at Reina Sofia Museum about atlases of images.

76
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:08,880
So for my own stake I did on my own personal scanner 20,000 scans and of course the exhibition

77
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:17,520
was cut in this. It was a choice but what is interesting is the choice. It's not my archive

78
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:27,200
which is 20,000 images is today nothing but this is important this is it is the choice.

79
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,640
You're making a natural class rather than a straightforward paper and perhaps that would

80
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,680
be an approach. Well I just want to pick up on what you said because I want to ask a more general

81
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,680
question. This idea of knowing is cutting which is related I think to what you were saying about

82
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,840
Ponce de Tuaveres, some idea like that. Well and I think it picks up from what I heard what David

83
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:05,280
was suggesting about how interest in Warburg had changed and you know if one thinks as Christopher

84
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:11,200
said quite well that this was an esoteric interest. Warburg was very esoteric and now as you put quite

85
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:19,520
nicely it's become exoteric and why we're all here hearing about this person when in a way you

86
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:27,120
would have had to have been a kind of fair dank. Kind of. A fair danker as the Germans say or the

87
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,920
Austrian say that you in order to as you were I mean you were interested in this and Warburg

88
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:41,360
as 30 years ago but not everybody was and unless you had been at the Warburg Institute or thought

89
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,560
about the history of the classical tradition this would not have had the kind of broad resonance

90
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,880
that does. Now you gave a good explanation about why this you know why this particular person cuts

91
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,360
across many fields and why there are many ideas but why my question is even related to going to

92
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,000
talk about now why independent of Renaissance or classical whatever we're supposed to be talking

93
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,960
about directly here does this have four four panels that could have many more I mean why why is

94
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:18,320
Warburg suddenly resonating as it just that he's been translated into this lecture or is there more

95
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,400
to it I don't know if it's a huge question yeah maybe we could could could I yeah I'm sorry to go

96
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,880
head but I'm yes try to frame the an answer in terms of the Renaissance actually because I mean

97
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:38,080
it does seem to me that it's significant in the late 19th century and he's not alone in this regard

98
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:45,520
he's he's following in Warburg's path but that he's framing the self-understanding of modernity

99
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,920
Warburg is attempting to frame the self-understanding of modernity in terms of the Renaissance and

100
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,880
the question here that I'm trying to put forward is what what was his theory of history what did he

101
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:07,200
think the role of modernity was and there's an there's an alternative to framing the modern

102
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,560
experience or let's say dating the initiation of the modern experience to the Renaissance and that's

103
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,600
and that's focusing on romanticism that was the that was the alternative that's the absent in

104
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:28,000
Warburg he was he was not a romantic thinker he and this is related I think to his unwillingness

105
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,040
to engage with the problem of the subject subjectivity it's romanticism right I'm talking about the

106
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,240
heart of German romanticism 1800 that puts the subject right at the center and proposes the subject

107
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:48,640
as the kind of you know irreplaceable foundation for for for private and collective experience and

108
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:55,760
he's rejecting that and instead re-embracing an older theory of history which proposes that it's

109
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,000
the dialogue with the past with the ancient past an anguished dialogue with the ancient past which

110
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:10,800
essentially guides our path and he sees I think and Pernofsky and Cassieur and others who followed

111
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:18,880
him agree with this they see the period from the Quattro cento to 1800 so let's say the 15th century

112
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:28,320
to the 18th century as essentially a kind of well this was a kind of a period without significant

113
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:35,920
internal development it was it was a period when the humanistic project kind of found its bearings

114
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,840
maintained its bearings and then it was disrupted again by romanticism and it's that disruption that

115
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,520
he's contesting he's he's trying to re-establish against I would say that the all the currents of

116
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:52,880
his time re-establish the the the what we now call the early modern period as as the matrix let's

117
00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:01,040
say of so what I would want to ask even those who framed the conference is what is what aspects of

118
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:16,960
Varborg's concept of modernity and modern experience are presumably being found attractive again

119
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:32,160
well if I can give perhaps immediate reaction in my view one of the interesting things of

120
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:39,760
Varborg is its use of neuroscience and when I when I studied the 16th century I found looking at

121
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,840
art you have to look at how the brain works and if you start to look at the 16th century discourse

122
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,440
on the brain that's essentially Aristotle and it's it's kind of naive and anachronistic to

123
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,400
to think that because this thought very startle you have to read Aristotle to understand their

124
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,720
their thinking so at least from my point of view what Varborg would point towards is to use to

125
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,720
take the responsibility of the present and to understand the brain function in a certain way

126
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,720
and then to look out for manifestation of this functioning outside the realm of science which

127
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:22,080
in the 16th century doesn't really encompass as much brain activity as neuroscience does I mean

128
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:30,400
you can see that at the very very obvious basic level if you open a university manual for doctors

129
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,560
the concept of five sensors has stopped existing for a long time so you have to think perhaps in

130
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:44,960
terms of of postural sensors of a hallucetron etc etc so what I find is that it really opens

131
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:51,280
art history or the history of images to the full function of the brain and the brain has

132
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:58,720
produced producing or productive of culture I mean from my point of view that that would be the

133
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:08,880
most interesting interesting side perhaps it could be also said that it's remarkable how

134
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:21,040
there is a kind of mirror between the object and the method I mean many of great art historians

135
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:34,000
were reborn as art historian because they studied Renaissance

136
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:53,520
so you really defined your own practice as an art historian finding in a Renaissance

137
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:08,320
which is so rich so a new way of damage of course and it's this correspondence between the object

138
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:24,800
you study and the process as a as a researcher think historian is also in the study of images

139
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,680
what Vabberg said mostly about images is that they were

140
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:44,080
subject to processes of van derungen migrations like a stamp it's wonderful a stamp because it's an

141
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:53,120
image which can go from a country with the enemy country crossing the border you can write to your

142
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:03,120
friend from Germany to Italy during the first world war this is the magic of images and it involved

143
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,560
the thinking of images as possibility of crossing the borders it's the reason I was interested in

144
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:17,440
this topic I agree with you about the importance of the notion of von derungen and I would say

145
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,920
to answer your question about the modernity here that is certainly something in which Warburg was

146
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,960
responding to his own time I mean not only posted stamps but also the other metaphors I mean just

147
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,960
like we're reusing these metaphors of territoriality which of course just territoriality crossing

148
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,720
borders the border guards this kind of thing but also he does write about he pays attention to

149
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:57,760
submarines and airplanes and he refers to tapestries as the vehicles or the well Farsawiga which could

150
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:06,240
be cars automobiles by which images images pass from one place to another so it's not only

151
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:14,160
the that images wander it's also the the vehicles or the means by which or the media and as we say

152
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:20,480
now by which they wander including prints and so he talks about the importance of prints and also

153
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,720
so-called decorative arts I mean small objects which were passed and which also carry images on them

154
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,880
so there's something about that which is very modern in that sense or would point to the notion

155
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,440
of modernity being also the invention of newer media or newer vehicles for the transmission

156
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,560
of images not just that they are transmitted or that they exist or that there's some psychic

157
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,320
reason why they're picked up but how they are and that would be I mean that is one reason why it

158
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,520
would be of interest you know to be I mean where one goes from that rather than recognize ah you

159
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,200
already thought about these things of course it goes back to what I you know to the question

160
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:11,200
that I was asking initially which is why you know why is he now of interest and why wasn't he of

161
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,640
interest because with all of this the history of the classical tradition and one thing that one

162
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,240
must say and that you would be very well aware as you mentioned Shastel and all the rest that the

163
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,800
history of when talks about the Renaissance that the history of the classical tradition and his

164
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,400
interest in it was something that was passed on and was regarded as important but all of these

165
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:40,240
other kinds of notions of how one would develop a broader conception not only in terms of opening

166
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,280
up to other disciplines opening up to neuroscience or whatever it might be but thinking about notions

167
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,160
of the Renaissance or cultural transmission as being something that was broader than in one place

168
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,040
broader than Italy than Florence's was something that was you could almost say or you were to

169
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:04,160
experience it suppressed in France or whatever so I mean that so that's interesting that that

170
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,000
comes back so maybe as a model it's important and certainly the modernity I don't know if Christopher

171
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,880
agrees with this or not it's part of that aspect of things and that's something that's also just

172
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,920
makes him a person in the 20th century at least as late 19th as opposed to for the early 19th

173
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:28,640
except that today it would be hard to find voices among his more progressive adherents

174
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,680
who still consider the engagement with antiquity to be the fundamental so there's a sense of there's

175
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,920
been a translation involved there's been a translation involved right that that that that

176
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,120
vobber didn't think anything in the middle ages you know he said it again and again he said that

177
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,240
they were you know he had it would would now be unacceptable he had it would now be an unacceptable

178
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:57,200
view of the middle ages namely that it was a period of kind of obscurantism you know limitation

179
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,720
spiritual blindness that was waiting its emancipation he speaks openly in those terms and the renaissance

180
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,040
for him was a heroic liberation of the human will Cassieira will pick up on this later remember

181
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:17,440
this is completely I mean it's relatively new it's I mean the term renaissance was coined only by

182
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,480
Michlé you know only you know less than 20 years really about 10 years before voborg was born

183
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,480
okay before then no one talked about the renaissance and then bork arts you know just a few years

184
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,080
after that produces his book this interest it launches the concept of the renaissance which by now is a

185
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,960
is a cliche so voborg it still feels fresh I think in the late 1880s to go to Florence and to identify

186
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,960
the quadricento as the matrix of the modern of the modern experience but that had to do with this

187
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:56,000
relationship to antiquity right and then as George was saying eloquently how it's striking how art

188
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,680
history as a discipline has allowed itself to be guided by the project of the renaissance itself

189
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,000
Panoschi said this explicitly he just said that's what it means to be a historian is to

190
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,080
is to inhabit two time frames at once and to and to and then to have them doubled so that when he

191
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,680
says the humanists already the the humanists in reviving antiquity already already predicting

192
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,880
panoschi who then studies the renaissance which so this is kind of recursive process this kind of

193
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:35,040
infinite regress where by each generation identifies a revivalist moment in a previous generation so

194
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,000
forth on and on backwards and this this sense of a kind of specular notion of history always

195
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,160
reflecting itself repeating itself maybe this is close to your transversals this I mean you know

196
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,920
this is this is this is voborg's renaissance to what extent is that still alive today I would say

197
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:58,640
that the voborg literature is split you know on the whole it's split between those who for whom

198
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,200
voborg the anachronist the survivalist the voborg the teller of ghost stories and so forth is still

199
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,880
the fundamental one and those who think that it's about neuroscience so to that extent I see this

200
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:20,160
panel as potentially a kind of space of um I don't know what resistance is too strong but

201
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,760
let's say a pause in the what seems to be the overall agenda of the conference but maybe I'm

202
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,240
wrong about that but one thing that you don't really bring up is that the renaissance artists

203
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,920
themselves were involved in antiquity they were involved in breeding ancient writings there was a

204
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:44,480
sort of a flow from ancient Greece to Italy it was kind of underground at that time but it was big

205
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:53,040
and it shows up in this greeny chapel the the jatto small corner or small figures in the corner that

206
00:25:53,040 --> 00:26:00,240
are black and white or figures from antiquity and so on absolutely yeah

207
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:14,080
I apologize because I was late this morning so I missed some of the discussions but I had a

208
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:23,600
fascinating lunch with my friends of a genebra and one thing I can say is

209
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:33,600
something we as art historians we share with sacroanellists is both

210
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,400
the fact that for a psychoanalyst an image is not here or there it passes through

211
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:53,120
the second thing is about the uses of past past is not somewhere past is depends on the use we have

212
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:03,200
of the past so in um it's interesting that the renaissance is precisely a period in which two

213
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:11,040
models of the uses of the past were developed one is the nationalist one so to speak Vasari

214
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:23,560
Renaissance equals Tuscany that's all then there is the alternative the movement van der

215
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:33,920
ungen the work of Thomas for example so it's about the uses of the past some weeks ago I was in

216
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:43,440
Athens in Greece I went to the musical musical museum there was a bowl of eight century

217
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:57,280
before Christ with a beautiful swastika okay it's a motif it's linked to the motif we call Greek

218
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:11,040
okay now what happens I went out of the museum and I was able to observe the work of I don't know

219
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:20,880
in English L'ob d'Oré this nadzi party which is extremely efficient now in Greece and which uses

220
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:28,000
the swastika and the Greek motif and the swastika as a nationalist

221
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:47,920
discourse and I met some poets or filmmakers very very modern who use the past in a completely

222
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:56,240
different way so this is a question of use value it's not a question of uh uh renaissance is not

223
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:04,240
the renaissance is exactly what we do with this no it's very simple because I believe

224
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,760
Barbara thought that the past bore down on us that the past uh yeah governed us in a way we were

225
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:20,960
not there were limits on our freedom to use yeah but uh vabog is not the gods we can also read

226
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:29,920
Valter Benier along with vabog and make something which works too you agree I agree I don't

227
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:59,840
know the last I think Barbara gets god but I mean around here he's got a little bit uh certainly not god in London but one aspect that has that has been it tends to be referred in this premise as an art historian but I believe he defined himself as what he called a psycho historian or historian of the psychology of humanity so would you would you see that one aspect of art history would be precisely to diagnose the tensions of

228
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:10,160
humanity as recorded by by images of course I mean that's why I'm not sure whether the historical

229
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:21,440
sense is well developed in in the disciplines of the body I was fascinated by the fact that in the

230
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:31,680
before the second world war there is a kind of constellation of thinkers namely Kal Einstein

231
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:46,160
a bit barborg Valter Benier me so who plays the image at the center of the question of history

232
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:55,760
or even time at the same moment they placed the question of time at the center of the notion of

233
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:08,000
image just before the second world war what happened before after it's quite different but I am extremely

234
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:18,480
impressed that at this moment there was a kind of urgent emergency to think images through time and

235
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:27,600
to think time through images no but don't you think that the in order for the image to become a time traveler in the way

236
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,560
barborg describes it and you describe it doesn't the image have to be desycollegized it has to it has to

237
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:42,080
leave the body essentially it has to be externalized and and and become a formula so that it can move

238
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:48,320
freely right and to that extent it makes it a historical instrument but it also puts it beyond

239
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:56,000
the reach of the of the sciences of the body it seems to me therefore the interest to to look to

240
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:07,200
have a look to psychoanalysis I mean metastatic psychology as a way of desycologize the the the

241
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:14,480
structures of the yeah yeah psychoanalysis is a human eudic that's of course that's of course but

242
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:24,000
you speak of science you are laughing oh yeah as an artist this is simply not how it works

243
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,400
you know it's overly intellectualized it's a it's intellectual certainly being an artist as an

244
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:39,920
intellectual pursuit and historical pursuit it's also visceral and sexual and you're not

245
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,560
you're not talking about the juices you're like refining it into language and I'm missing

246
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,200
you know the guts of it because barborg wasn't interested in art he was interested in images

247
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,000
and in history but art for him had no meaning he never spoke about it I didn't know that no in fact

248
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,560
every time he always did it disparagingly he said oh that's that's that's that's aesthetics that's

249
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:10,240
for you s-thetes I'm interested in images and I'm interested in time and and and the past and so

250
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:18,480
forth if you're speaking about images though and the quetricental how can you separate art from images

251
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,160
doesn't exist he did he separated images from art he said I'm going to look at these as images

252
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:30,080
and whether they're works of art or or or or material culture that doesn't interest me the the

253
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:37,200
initial the initial question that is asked is a historical question but it's the answer given

254
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,280
is a psychological one and that may also affect the making of things in other words looking at

255
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:50,160
things abstractly he would say well what is the reason for the development of this style which is

256
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:56,560
he said that's what he says this station is and the psychology of the style why is there a change

257
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:02,320
not that there is a change which we could recognize by looking at images or looking not involved in

258
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,320
the process of making but looking to sequence of images saying this is different from that we see

259
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,920
the nymph here and there and then he looks and knows the nymph being there and he gives an explanation

260
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,840
which is and then that leads that can lead into other directions it doesn't necessarily so it's

261
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:25,120
not as a whether it's art or not it's it's the phenomenon that he's still trying to describe

262
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:32,320
which he's which is responding of course perhaps to a particular moment which described as being

263
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,720
style if you go something else with your doing but renaissance art i mean yes culturally but

264
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:48,000
i mean there are only there is only art to take images from and if you look if you spend any time

265
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:59,920
in seano or sec or uh florants you cannot help but observe how the work is made because they layered

266
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:08,480
pigment and with time sometimes some pigment has peeled off and some has come through it you know

267
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,760
a green has come through a white or whatever and all of that there's something about the making of

268
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:23,760
the work which the actual making makes the image the image isn't there before the making you're

269
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,480
completely right but that's not what vardard believed he wasn't interested in fabrication and he wasn't

270
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:39,600
interested in creativity it does contemporary art historian who inherit from the past what what to

271
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,920
do with with this would be the the question and if if i may just make quick observation you mentioned

272
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,240
sciences of the body i think referring to neuroscience the little i've read of neuroscientific literature

273
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,000
i find it very exciting because it's a literature that points out what the orientals knew very well

274
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,360
long before the 20th century and what the west knew before they came out that is body and mind

275
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:10,160
they're they're not two different entities they're constantly interconnected but i could name objects

276
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:19,840
of me of of study which are neither body nor mind namely texts or images they're not body or mind

277
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:26,640
they're external and i would propose that that's those are the entities that i deal with

278
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:35,120
not mind not mind's or body but it depends what you call psychology usually there is a big

279
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:44,000
distinction between uh wirthing and verbal from a formalist i cannot i think and i look at uh

280
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,360
andreopinote who knows very well these things that the difference is not so big i mean when

281
00:36:52,080 --> 00:37:02,880
wirthing speaks about psychology it's not at all a question of ego what time my my choices what i

282
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:12,960
love my feelings no not at all it's fundamental it's a kind of anthropological psychology

283
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:22,160
it was the reason i i was recalling the meter psychology the Freudian one so this is very important

284
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:30,720
to make the distinction and just an quick answer to your question to your difference between

285
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:44,240
the intellectuals and the creative or i don't know i would say that verbo was as everybody it was

286
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:54,880
not only verbal verbo did very well he was working all the day and he was transforming things he was

287
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:07,360
constructing something a library writing organization of images making the work of art yes at the end

288
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:17,600
at the end one of the greatest painters of the 20th century Gerhard Hichter took the the the model

289
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:33,680
from verbo to make his own atlas so there is no no even better even better

290
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,280
of course he knows i agree i mean there is no there is a consistency

291
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:52,800
which begins in the 20th moholynaji did atlases lokorbusier did atlases everybody

292
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:00,640
so all the members are meant that it's true no it's not a question no no i don't mean maps

293
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:16,400
atlas the kind of professional like a death by thing in in in verbal atlas there is a temporary to start

294
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:23,600
very important thing i mean that is never about text the text be important because it brings to mind

295
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:31,680
it brings to our kind of body and mind something otherwise the text is so many and the images for

296
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:41,840
for vowels and by all is in the absence of collective in the absence of religion don't forget that he

297
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:52,320
was because i already mentioned by our friend from los angeles he was in a simulated family that

298
00:39:52,320 --> 00:40:00,640
kept Judaism at home he refused to participate in it i must say that i was also very good friend of his

299
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:09,040
niece of her in the battle in Rome for four years and i know this detail is very intimately

300
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:19,200
and his attempt to his fantasy was to reconstruct the co-activity human justice correct to cultural

301
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:28,400
cultivated way and he believed in you simply you can say naively then by coming to town with the

302
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:38,000
longest possible path you can reconstruct the co-act form for human life in the absence of religion

303
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:46,720
in the absence of collective identity with which you could identify it that for me there was no

304
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,840
co-activity got any further and that is the grand purpose of this art history very different

305
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:01,360
fundamentally different from both are very very great you're right you better be on psychology

306
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:13,120
of style so thank you for if i appreciate your comments and i consider that the discussion has

307
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:20,000
been stimulating enough and you've been stimulated by it but what i would prefer is you wait until

308
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,600
the round table finishes their discussion and then we open for comments and questions otherwise if

309
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:33,200
everybody start jumping in we'll have a problem i also wanted to just remind you that this is about

310
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:40,960
classical and renaissance art i wanted to come back to one thing that you were saying yes that is

311
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:48,400
that is if and indeed i can't recall the exact places where he was taking things from but if

312
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:56,800
if we were to go with him to with warberg to florants we would have not only been looking at you know

313
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,960
the parucio bardi chapels of the cajada we would also be going to the bargello but not to look at

314
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,960
the paintings in the bargello but at the door knockers and the locks and that kind of thing and the

315
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,840
and the and the those are you bring up my very point yeah now as an artist you know um i didn't

316
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:24,640
grow up in america i grew up in um i i grew back in montreal and life was as much uh juicier in a

317
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,680
certain way the butter was real the bread was real my family they talked about what they had eaten

318
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,360
yesterday what they were going to eat today and what they would eat tomorrow and it was very it had a

319
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:47,600
reality to it a real reality and when i'm in italy or an aspect of france as well i can sense the

320
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:57,440
same thing that they were they were the images they're making are a living they're part of their life

321
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:06,960
and of course there's a journals of pran tormel talk the way my family talked exactly and uh and

322
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,520
they're very concerned with of a food is medicine in the way that to eat healthily was to live longer

323
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:21,280
and um i think it's very important to talk about this in relation to the images

324
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:30,000
i also speaking a little bit out of turd i i think that rickter when he built his

325
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:38,480
complex of buildings was i think we should stick to the renaissance and well i did but it is i'm

326
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,280
talking about warberg you know i think it it was a warberg associated the buildings that people

327
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,600
the same idea as the library

328
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:59,280
i mean we you were mentioning a verbose notion of the renaissance which is quite outdated now

329
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,040
or not not followed by by current scholarship and indeed if you if you study the renaissance

330
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:11,040
you realize that so many texts written in the middle ages were still published were still active

331
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:18,560
if you look at the at the reception of classical art one way of looking at the ways in which

332
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,280
renaissance artists receive classical classical artists to look at the demand of religious

333
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,360
art which the amount increasing realism increasing physical presence to convey the image of a suffering

334
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:36,960
god etc so basically what is what does remain of our work stuff and the renaissance for the present

335
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:52,480
for the present um i live in paris and so in paris now there is a wonderful

336
00:44:52,480 --> 00:45:01,360
exhibition about renaissance which comes from Florence so here there is everything i love

337
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:16,080
donatello it's wonderful really wonderful um kind of uh focus is done about

338
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:28,320
the model of roman republic in a 15th century uh florantin renaissance and it is shown through

339
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:39,440
some manuscripts and uh okay good perfect yeah at the end there is the so-called nicolo daudzano

340
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:46,560
now attributed to deziderio de cetinho and not donatello

341
00:45:50,640 --> 00:46:00,400
i mentioned that nowhere in the very big catalogue in the discourse of curators nowhere

342
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:11,120
there is a mention to what verbogin produced in 1902 namely the famous boate the ex-voto's

343
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:22,640
of la santissima anunceta which were a kind of artisanal religious vulgar

344
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:33,120
kitch oful in deziderio of madam tussos but it was it was an hyper realism the kind of which

345
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:42,640
um Alessandro Baronqui spoke about about the realism of the first renaissance uh already in 14th

346
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:54,800
century so verbog introduced the fact that confronting the actual images which you can see in museums

347
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:03,040
which were kept through the curatorial work of of viserie and the museum etc so you have

348
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:10,640
masterpieces but all these objects ex-voto's were destroyed in 17th century and the

349
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:21,280
the the the big work of verbog was to interpret the actual objects which are masterpieces along with

350
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:33,440
vulgar objects which all disappeared this is a masterpiece of anthropology but now in a big

351
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:40,800
exhibition on renaissance there is no mention of this despite the fact that to understand the

352
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:50,080
nickele of the odes anor you need these ex-voto which themselves are linked to the famous roman

353
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:58,000
republican model of the imaginess so there is something which does not work today these

354
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,920
exhibitions are just the entertainment industry they have nothing to do with uh yes but sexuality

355
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,920
but okay you're just making a comment i just make a because but there is a very big catalog of

356
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:19,040
specialies and so on but this is a critical point i would say but why verbog today but to speak

357
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:26,320
again about the ex-voto's you know there's another part of the exhibition which i saw in

358
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:32,560
Florence which also involves making but also this question of transmission of images not only the

359
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:39,360
images where they're repeated a memorable room in which there are all the terracadas and casts

360
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,600
so that um suggesting how uh and very interesting also from point of view of art and making things

361
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:54,960
how the same image is repeated x number of times and then i think it's something that you definitely

362
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,960
um you know we're much more conscious of that as a result perhaps of a long tradition but again

363
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:08,080
not not going back to this whole why this was done in the first place however uh seeing

364
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,600
seeing the renaissance as warberg might have done that is to say for the transmission of images

365
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,920
in a different way in terms of materiality in terms of making which is what you might have

366
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:24,880
been interested in which you uh as Christopher says wasn't uh so uh was so concerned concerned

367
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:35,200
with the question of um making things i mean actually going back to your point that is also of

368
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:42,240
course how we are much different i mean you know now than than then uh one thing i quite right

369
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:50,880
about uh making objects in the past sculpture painting whatever took a long time you know you

370
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,320
had to grind your pigments still does well you well particularly if you had to grind your pigments

371
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,040
and you had to find your pigments and you had to find your pigments and you had to find your

372
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,400
pigments and you had to mix them with the medium etc and you had to prime your canvas and all that

373
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:12,880
or if you have to make paper and making paper and preparing paper and making the drawing

374
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,920
implements or whatever that's why drawing old drawings are small they couldn't make big paper

375
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:24,560
well paper is valuable too yeah but uh so i mean there's all all of that which is also

376
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:30,800
uh an experience that we don't have although he would have had it and been more related to it

377
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:38,320
that's the the shocking thing now of course is uh as we're aware is the older crafts have gone

378
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,680
or the number of places that are gone so that it's increasingly difficult even to repair objects

379
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,080
not just talking with somebody who is a store there and very few places that even exist in the

380
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:56,800
place like Florence where you know you where if you remember what it was like in the past where you

381
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:03,680
know you can wear furniture is made where a frame was repaired or can be made relatively speaking

382
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,960
to what you know one over experience a hundred years ago or 150 years ago it's so interesting

383
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:15,920
in my studio when I hire assistants it used to be that they knew how to stretch canvas and

384
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:24,080
jesso and now they know how to make websites things just to elaborate on what you're saying

385
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:34,160
but when I started wandering around Florence was uh the first time was in 66 and a lot of the old

386
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:41,440
Florence was still there there was a place where you could buy pigment ground pigment and it

387
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:50,240
didn't it burned down in about 1974 but for a long time I bought pigments there and and

388
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:57,600
there were there was a wonderful color I mean this isn't a side of Renaissance color

389
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:06,080
called capuchin yellow which is really pink which was made by the capuchin monks it's just an

390
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:13,600
incredible material but when I started wandering around I did I actually did a mural that's in

391
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:21,040
um a bun fresco that's in um main and it's based on the virtues of good government

392
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:28,960
and so I was studying sienna up and down and spending a lot of time there and I was interested

393
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:35,440
in the fact that the bank of the sienna was the first bank in Europe and that that tradition had

394
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:42,320
actually in a certain way come from Egypt via Greece I mean that's the I'm making a lot of shortcuts

395
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:51,120
to Italy when when the Medici brought the Greeks over to teach the Italians how to paint because

396
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:59,600
they had lost that skill through invasions and uh all of that I find you know that that whole legacy

397
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:06,480
uh what happened in Egypt and how it went to Greece and how was brought to Florence and how those

398
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:15,120
images that we all adore came about that way if I made I think that's an extremely important

399
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:21,200
comment and coupled with with with with with Thomas remarks about uh transmission and uh and

400
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,960
George on the transversals and the traveling images and so forth we're probably all arrived at a sense

401
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:35,520
today of a kind of permanent multiplex flow of ideas and images that knit culture together and

402
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:42,800
therefore we would probably I would think be willing to relativize the epochal significance of the

403
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:51,920
Renaissance it is to say uh maybe be unwilling to join VAR board in his celebration of the Renaissance

404
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:58,480
as a as as a fundamental emancipation right because the ex-vodos after all continue straight through

405
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,640
from antiquity straight through the Middle Ages to the Renaissance the forms that you were referring

406
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,520
to travel straight through they're constantly being imported and transmitted and translated and so

407
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,720
forth so then why privilege the Renaissance as he did and that would be that would be the question

408
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:19,840
I would ask again I mean who who's willing to allow that um perception of an elective affinity

409
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,640
that the Renaissance felt with antiquity classical antiquity you want us to talk about the classical

410
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:31,840
and I think we should because um who's willing to let that elective affinity between the Renaissance

411
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:37,840
that is to say European modernity and classical antiquity be a guiding principle and use a rhetoric

412
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:42,960
of emancipation liberation and so forth though human will human freedom and so forth it seems

413
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,280
very important because not everybody's willing to give up on the idea of human freedom psychoanalysis

414
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:58,720
is about freedom it seems to me well I'd like to sort of dive in uh I think that the idea of the

415
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:05,040
Renaissance is is an art historians idea actually I think what artists were living was a continuum

416
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,560
from Egypt through Greece to through Rome through classical Rome

417
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,560
yeah I'm reading a book forever which is because it's very hard to read

418
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:24,400
calm it's about drawing and it's about a different kind of perspective

419
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:33,360
than Renaissance perspective and so clearly there was a whole different field of perspective going on

420
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:40,640
before three point perspective and afterwards so and this is coming from Egypt Greece Renaissance

421
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:47,520
so I think you know the idea that you know these bunch of English men suddenly discovered the

422
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:57,120
Renaissance you know is because probably England was really dull and you know and here's this juicy

423
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:04,880
painting going on and especially when you I mean the whole idea of calling the Mannerous Mannerous

424
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:11,920
as as Nied Remark and sort of like the Big Bang kind remark is you know they were shocked by the

425
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:19,520
homosexuality in in Mannerous painting which you know is a very English thing to be shocked at since

426
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,800
there was a high frequency of homosexuality in England well there's something highly

427
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,840
suspect about the whole late 19th century cult of the Renaissance centered in Florence and you

428
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:35,040
know you might ask what is the isn't it significant that Varbog is an intellectual gravitate towards

429
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:41,840
Florence in the 1890s and not Paris right Paris is was the center of the intellectual world for

430
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:48,320
for any for any intellectual and and and Varbog is Paris ophobic right instead it's Florence where

431
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:53,040
he's in the meteor of Walter Pader Berenson he wasn't friends with Berenson but and many many

432
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:59,120
others who are all taking refuge from modernity basically taking refuge from technological modernity

433
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:05,520
taking refuge from the vulgarity of America taking refuge from also German romanticism I believe

434
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:12,160
so there's a triple threat there I'm talking about Henry James and Sargent and all the rest of it

435
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:18,160
so the rest they invented the Renaissance yeah but I don't think artists thought about that

436
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:25,920
you know I think you know they were living art and living I mean artists no matter where they

437
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:32,320
they're using videotapes they're involved in art history and they know what's going on and they're

438
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:38,480
you know absorbing it some are more knowledgeable than others but it's always it's always a threat

439
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:44,560
through everything perhaps there's one problem with Renaissance artists when you read the artistic

440
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:49,760
literature of the Renaissance is that they never talk about making and they really conceal the

441
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:57,520
aspect of making and technique from from the literature that they produce but Leonardo is never

442
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:03,360
published is not published until the late 17th century and these are his personal notes if you

443
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:11,120
look at the published literature it's about invention disposition by subject by Alberti by

444
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:16,800
Paul Opino by a lot of the literature he's talking about perspective he's talking about perspective

445
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:22,960
but that's an intellectual thing that's automatic that's optics perspective and in fact what what

446
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:29,280
strikes me in that discussion one of the contribution of our works precisely in perspective was optics

447
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:36,080
Renaissance is also connected but it is connected to optics if you read the beginning of the La

448
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:42,400
Pittura Alberti explained the visual rays as something optic that goes from the eye and it's based on

449
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,280
but anyway that's an academic discussion what I just would like to emphasize is that it seems

450
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:53,520
that the verbal doesn't take for granted the message of Renaissance artists who are responsible for

451
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:00,160
that distinction between so-called decorative art and fine arts and precisely that that's one of the

452
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,760
use of a verbal to take the image as a matter of well if neither as a body nor as a mind but I'm

453
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:12,800
not quite sure as what but certainly at something that travels across media and that should be studied

454
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:23,920
through its traveling across media it recalls me a discussion about the the question why

455
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:46,800
the Natello didn't have a foundry studio of its own a gibberti had the Natello no so you can

456
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:53,840
interpret it and especially the one of the most the Natello's masterpiece the Judith

457
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:10,240
is made by various studios of foundry bronze how do you say found so you can interpret in

458
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:20,800
two different manners you can say the Natello is now a Renaissance artist in this sense he is an

459
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:30,880
intellectual so he does not touch the bronze foundry the material and he lives he conceived and

460
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:40,640
the artisans are his assistants and he's the intellectual artist why not it's it's a good

461
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:47,680
interpretation but insufficient the other interpretation to complete this one is to say

462
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:59,600
he was so interested in the material because if you look at the Judith the face is completely

463
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:12,000
classic classic but there is a mold there is elements of gothic there is elements of hyperrealism

464
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:20,160
there in the same sculpture so he needed various ways to deal with the material

465
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:30,560
so this is wonderful this is the Renaissance for me and by the way has to do with money then

466
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:37,120
just as it is now is it the person with their own money had their own money money money money

467
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:41,920
and money in space i mean because if you think about money in space yeah money money in space

468
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,800
because you think about what was happening in the in the 16th century some people had foundries

469
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:55,280
in their own studio and others and the ship not and money is not a sufficient explanation no money

470
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:02,080
okay but if you look at the Natellos in general it's not by chance that in the diacrony the

471
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:08,960
differences of style you find the same in the single Judith so it's not only a question of money

472
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:16,640
oh money money can i say something about the classical i don't know whether this how

473
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:21,840
you know how this will strike you but how would it change things if i made the proposition and

474
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:27,040
and you agreed with this the viborgh scholars agreed with this that viborgh didn't actually

475
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:32,960
know much about classical antiquity that his classical antiquity for him was a known a known

476
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,840
quantity a fixed quantity he knew what every cultivated person knows i'm not sure he knew much

477
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:42,560
more about classical antiquity than say Freud did and it would i think would be instructive to

478
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:50,560
compare their images of antiquity that essentially his he was able to construct the system of

479
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:57,200
world's psychohistory of art that he did because antiquity remained a stable quantity he didn't

480
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:08,000
go too deeply into it he used only cliched images i would say that for vabor classic art classic was

481
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:15,760
the contrary that classic was for vincalmon for vincalmon classic was a norm a normatability

482
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:26,800
for vabor classic meant a way of instability classic means instability for him

483
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:36,320
this is the instability of greek tragic for vaborgh i i a mistake oh sorry sorry for vaborgh

484
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:46,640
it's instability so um once away once again it's about what do you do with the past

485
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:59,520
it's not about a news better i agree with you it for him classic is is kind of matrix it's a matrix

486
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:05,760
if i may just bring there's another element of metric which is in the classification of the

487
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:11,200
library and it begins with primitive art and then it's followed by pre-story card and then

488
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:16,960
classical art so there's this sense that primitive art even if it's something made in australia in

489
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:23,040
the 19th century should be put in a section before the historical section which are arranged

490
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:30,160
chronologically rather than alphabetically yes you you you're saying that this is the

491
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:36,080
doctrine of survival like the british folklorists right whom he was very influenced by that that

492
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:44,000
modern folkloric customs in rural england counted as archaic art archaic customs right yeah yeah

493
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:51,600
it might not be correct but that's certainly a starting point right that makes a classification

494
01:04:51,600 --> 01:05:01,600
of knowledge so it right indeed that's right and yet that that notion is overlaid upon a in fact

495
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:08,400
a rather conventional bourgeois conception of what classical art was which included all the

496
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:16,000
the agitated and tragic features yeah but they're also in vinkleman's canon i mean the you know the

497
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,080
lachlan is he for for for vibor right it's right in the 1905 duress he ends it by talking about the

498
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:27,440
lachlan and the main ads and the and and all of these figures they're they're all in vinkleman's

499
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,600
canon it's not as if he's expanding the canon of ancient art he's just flipping through

500
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,400
illustrated books about ancient art and picking the images he likes which happens to be the

501
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:42,720
agitated ones but but there is a very thorough so to speak reception of antiquity in the 19th

502
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:48,800
century if you look at flobere salambo and the temptation of centantony it's not at all a calm

503
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:56,240
and our monious antiquity on the contrary it's a delirium for emotion color violence blood i mean

504
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:02,240
everything in donatello it is like in flobere it is completely chaotic this is the point i

505
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:08,320
like to throw a little bit of a wrench into what you're saying uh that's my role here

506
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:16,400
uh i think the way in which museums to this day categorize so-called primitive art

507
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:22,960
is they don't quite know what to do with it and since you know we are the white imperialists

508
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:29,200
right and we know everything right why are these funny yellow people black people

509
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:36,000
red people making work that you can recognize as art i mean the metropolitan is put together

510
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,160
that way and it sounds like the warburg museum was put together that way too i mean there's no

511
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:51,040
sense of equality between different kinds of people none well we're already as concerned that's

512
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:56,720
there there's a point that touches on to the whole problem of an also an older idea of anthropology

513
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,560
which may be one of the reasons of course why warburg has regained some interest because it's

514
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:09,840
supposedly owns onto anthropology as uh we're becoming increasingly sensitive the notion that

515
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:16,240
the others are those who don't have history that's uh you know they do have history of course

516
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,400
some of course of course of course of course but what i'm saying is that that older

517
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:28,080
anthropological idea that ethnology or ethnography was a study of other peoples because those people

518
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:34,960
showed us what we were like when we were in the past and therefore history has stopped in those

519
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:42,880
parts of the world where supposedly uh progress has not come and others who don't have machines

520
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:48,880
or whatever it might be but it's always artists that would pick up so-called primitive art like

521
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:57,280
pakaso and and treat it as contemporary art and i i wonder if that's another actually a sort of a

522
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:05,200
problem behind some of the assumptions of warburg's work you know i think so going to going to New

523
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:17,840
Mexico and so forth but and and and actually brings up a question i wanted to ask to this group

524
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:26,240
because one of the ways in which why would have answered is the question of why warburg's of

525
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,880
generally of interest but i'll bring it back to the renaissance question and relate it to what we

526
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:38,720
were talking about a minute ago is uh that as you said he's nomencl it's been said that his

527
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:43,680
writing is enigmatic you could say that it was vatic that it's a prophetic and so it's like

528
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:49,840
banyam and you can read a lot into it you can read what you want but um i wonder if there aren't

529
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:57,600
some other things that can be said about that about why this is um attractive now that is to say

530
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:13,280
war uh yeah um and uh um if uh there is uh this kind of uh tension that is to say the idea of how

531
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:20,880
there's an underlying presence which is always there and something else uh in terms of the renaissance

532
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:27,760
too the assumption and what does it mean therefore uh what when we have a dual kind of meaning this

533
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:32,480
relates to both of the things that we've been talking about warburg says on the one hand

534
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:41,760
whether they say Athens and uh Oribi always won uh and then but at the same time using Athens

535
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:51,680
perhaps in another way he says uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

536
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:59,600
Athens once once to be conquered again back from Alexandria again and again i mean what does Athens

537
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:06,880
mean in both of these instances the same yeah it just means low logos yeah reason as

538
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:14,960
a star astra asta so um so and now is andry is a

539
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,720
is a meta-linear is not right but it used to it used to be Jerusalem but he switched it to

540
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:30,720
Alexandria to orientalize in a non-Jewish way yeah um but uh we're thinking of Oribi also being

541
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:36,880
what is always present underneath why why does it want to be why does it what do you how do you

542
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:45,120
interpret the vial the vola the the wanting why and how does that relate to the renaissance in

543
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:51,040
some sense that's that will to freedom that what wants to be reconquered from uh Alexandria wants

544
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:57,680
to be delivered from the clutches of the oriental uh bottle you know somaticism and drives and

545
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:02,800
some work right i mean and that's still how he's i mean we didn't even talk about that but that's

546
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:08,000
still how he saw the in i mean the renaissance for for him was this you know this uh this this

547
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:14,400
connection across time back to you know back to uh back to logos overcoming whether we're medieval

548
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:22,800
demons as well not perhaps it is also the fact that uh it is strange in vabo that when he speaks

549
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:32,720
about uh archaism primit archaism greek archa it's never greek archaic art it's always

550
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:43,360
alexandrin i i mean elenistice period always the laocoon style the peregamon you know so it's not

551
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:53,280
a cake at all for a history on the point of view of the history of greek art but for him this is the

552
01:11:53,280 --> 01:12:00,640
so alexandrin alexandrin should mean something with this kind of no i think his point is the classical

553
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:08,400
yes i think his point is the classical greek art alexandrinized itself and sort of allowed itself to be

554
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:13,920
contaminated by the oriental and that's what unleashed all these kind of baroque passions

555
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:19,200
which then needed to be tamed by by the renaissance which received them and corrected them

556
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,120
thank you

557
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:32,800
thank you

558
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:39,840
vaboque chose the renaissance as his focus his trap point or maybe the renaissance chose

559
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:49,360
vaboque um to speak to chris's point precisely because it was the period in which the oscillation

560
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:55,280
both the temporal and spatial oscillation between what he called the phobic legacy

561
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:04,800
and the mathematical resulted most clearly in batonin heights in in in this prudencia this

562
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:14,720
moment in which um a kind of clear-eyed wisdom could exist and therefore the classical ideal

563
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:22,560
was revivified but the renaissance has the double or the meta value that

564
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:32,480
it revivifies that classical ideal once removed and then you put vaboque as twice removed and so

565
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:37,920
he is able to as it were see himself reflected in that renaissance doubling

566
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:45,920
which raises the question of where we are now right one step further removed

567
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:55,200
which wing which which factions among the vaboque um literature are participating in that

568
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:02,560
specular regression regressive process in which are abandoning it and setting up other beachheads

569
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:07,680
occupying other beachheads i would be in the neuroscience well i don't want to do it

570
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:12,560
no i think it's more complicated than that certainly the neuro i would say the neuro biological

571
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,920
i mean i don't want to label it so much but this kind of it that aspect of interest in vaboque

572
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,320
is not interested in these questions of history that's all i was saying at the beginning and it

573
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,960
except in so far as the memory is the place where it's way unique

574
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:34,320
or other places too that's the place that person appears to me

575
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,320
mm-hmm maybe

576
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,280
first of all a quick comment to as your your um

577
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:52,320
reference to psychology which is i completely agree a very ambiguous word if you use it

578
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:59,600
referring to authors like very flin whose prolegomena to a psychology of architecture

579
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:08,400
uh work characterized as psychology without psyche because they are very symmetological and this is

580
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:18,720
true for many authors of the ein film theories as well he'll the brand fish authors very well

581
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:27,360
known to to vaboque um my question refers to your very dense paper of this morning

582
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:37,440
um and particularly on the notion of symptom which is crucial and central to the paper and to

583
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:47,440
the whole of your reflection and particularly to the polarity opening closing because if i think

584
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:56,720
of the notion of symptom as used in ordinary language but also in the discourse of the medical

585
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:03,440
discourse in therapy perhaps even in psychotherapy and in psychoanalytical discourse

586
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:15,280
symptom is referred to one manifestation of the body fever for example that can have different

587
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:27,840
causes so the in the medical semiotics you see something an image of the body the rush the red

588
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:37,120
the high temperature and you have to close the perspective because you have many i.t.i. many

589
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:47,360
causes and you need to close the perspective the optics until you have found the cause that

590
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:56,480
determines that symptom on the contrary if i understand well your position and your hermeneutics of the

591
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:07,600
symptom leaning on vaboque it seems to me that the use of symptom here is here is rather the opposite

592
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:19,840
it's not closing the perspective closing it on a single meaning because if we take a patos former

593
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:30,480
it is symptomatic but it is a bodily posture the nymph the manad that can be inversed and

594
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:36,960
transformed into a christian makdalene like in bertol vudijovani or the serpent that can be

595
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:50,000
a sign of pathology of evil and a sign of therapy a far macon so in this second perspective that

596
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:58,480
seems to me yours and verbal perspective symptom and perhaps even froy's perspective symptom is

597
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:10,000
not closing to a single cause but rather opening up the image to its possible multiple meanings

598
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:21,520
you know that it is a big question of course i began on this problem

599
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:32,320
um long ago studying and confronting charco's notion of symptoms and froy's one

600
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:43,520
it seems to me that the difference between them one could be said positivist and the other

601
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:54,960
okay for a new way of you find the same in art history the exactly the same

602
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:03,760
I love the essay by ginsburg about the the clues the indexical but he does not recognize

603
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:15,360
this battlefield so perhaps i invent a battlefield or if i am wrong or he does not recognize there is

604
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:28,160
a fundamental difference um you have fever the doctor comes and says uh influencer okay when

605
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:35,520
you have the name you have the solution because there are some medicine for influencer

606
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:42,400
you are in front of painting from the

607
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:55,280
the some collection in parma your name is morality and you say it's i don't know lon franco okay

608
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:10,480
the name means the solution symptom is an enigma and the name is a solution you have a series of

609
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:22,480
portraits and through a big graphic analysis you say he is loreann so the image is he is the son

610
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:31,360
the first son etc this is a kind of interpretative way

611
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:43,120
uh linked to this first interpretation of what is the symptom the second is of course in my mind

612
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:55,840
influenced by psychoanalysis i would say if you i am not an analizan but i'm sure that if you go

613
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:07,840
to a psychoanalysis and one day you say it's mama mami it's not the end of the interpretive

614
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:20,400
process perhaps it's the beginning and so is art history when you recognize a name an attribution

615
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:30,720
a signification iconography it's not the end it's the beginning this is my view and i think

616
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:40,640
there is a big struggle today without even which is not named as such between the symptom in the

617
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:51,920
first sense so to speak closing and the opening one the most delusian so to speak most rheismatic if you

618
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,160
want

619
01:21:54,160 --> 01:22:01,840
isn't that implicit in your notion of transversal that is metonymic

620
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:10,800
completely much like delusian fall which may be a single thing but it opens up

621
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:26,000
absolutely absolutely yeah i'm glad you just opened up a bridge which i wanted to speak about

622
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,920
i'm i'm kind of the devil in between i'm a painter and an art historian and when i was very young

623
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:38,720
i studied with i guess varbergian influence art historians like the toenai and vittkover

624
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:45,760
and panofsky was there and oscar christella i wasn't ready for all of them but what i want to say

625
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:52,960
it opened up a world for me because it formed a kind of armature or a bridge to inter inter

626
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:58,800
disciplinary worlds because here i suddenly saw the renaissance as an integrated culture where

627
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:05,200
we got literature and philosophy and all the different disciplines came together and it it

628
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:11,840
performed amazing kind of mystery for me of how to delve how to get into the intercesses of all

629
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:17,360
these fields and find a transmission of culture a kernel of culture i never took it literally

630
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:23,760
and of course we all criticized gombrick for calling primitive art and later it became tribal art

631
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,920
and of course there was a lot of christianists and a lot of problems with with um

632
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:37,040
um with what we call tribal art today an archaic art but it gave me a sense of how can culture be

633
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:41,840
contained it's contained in the word but it can also be contained in images so though it's not

634
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:49,920
the way painters will often discuss a painting it had it gave it another dimension and that

635
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:56,560
dimension um should be opened up that dimension of a transmission of a total culture um there are

636
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:02,880
um there are some painters today that attempt that uh unselylm kefer maybe kentridge a few who

637
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:10,160
attempt to kind of cultural transmission through imagery uh or as or just what we're talking about

638
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:16,560
now association so that there are there's no such thing as a closed image it's infinite in it

639
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:23,920
it's historical line lineage and we can go back and forth so it has in it to me speaking also of

640
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:32,000
bothlyn who was fascinating and i fascinating because he gave words for um for the beginning

641
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,120
of exploring a painting open and closed forms of course he said baroque renous a contrast at

642
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:43,040
everything we don't have to contrast it as simply but it is an interesting way of perceiving uh is

643
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:48,720
there such thing as a more closed culture and a more open culture or ways of talking about things

644
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:57,760
so i think this tradition is very important uh as again as a vessel for culture and shouldn't be

645
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:03,760
the dichotomy of artists and art historians and scholars should be opened up in a much freer way

646
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,280
and speaking well oh that's that's enough

647
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:27,280
i i i don't um object to the basic uh statesman by panofsky that art history is a humanistic

648
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:38,000
discipline i don't object to this uh this article by panofsky and artist uh scientist genius it's

649
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:48,080
the title artist savagini yes it was about the humanism as de cluison mo how do you say

650
01:25:48,080 --> 01:26:00,400
what is the compartment? the compartment so the in the age of renaissance we have a new kind of

651
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:12,000
interdisciplinarity so to speak this is wonderful okay uh i am uh i was born to so to speak in the

652
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:21,120
stricturalist french school at this time uh it was useful to say the humanism is over

653
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:33,600
i don't agree with this i agree with a very much revolutionary french writer whose name is

654
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:44,880
josh batai who said that we need a more he says it's a quotation we need a more complete humanism

655
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:57,440
and he meant we need a humanism which includes the ineshive mo how do you say

656
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:08,800
incompleteness what is to say of course we need the hypothesis of the unconscious that's all

657
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,560
you know that's all can i just add i mean i very much appreciate what you said because you've

658
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:20,000
been introduced a term which has been absent from our panel it should have been here and that's

659
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,920
the concept of a cultural cultural history or kulturvissenshaft is the germans called it a

660
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:34,160
total study of culture which within which varburg loom is very large and it's an ongoing process

661
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:39,120
and subject today of much debate about what would be an updating of this of this project that you

662
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:44,160
so well described and experienced the only objection i would have and it's a little bit parallel to

663
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:50,880
to josh and i would invoke not batai batai de gur who said of the humanists in his letter on

664
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:56,000
humanism he said the problem with humanism is that its conception of man is not elevated enough

665
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:02,480
it's this parallel he and batai were contemporaries and a parallel concept of the of the incompleteness

666
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:07,520
of the project and to that extent i would object the only objection i would have is to the very

667
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:14,960
concept of culture because the concept of culture it seems to me presupposes already an ideal of

668
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:19,600
how it should turn out but the culture in fact is something we haven't achieved and we'll probably

669
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,400
never achieve culture is some kind of this total connectedness so i don't i don't think that works

670
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:30,720
of art can transmit a culture or that they can in any way kind of deliver a culture to us they are

671
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:39,040
simply attempts or steps towards some kind of project called culture

672
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:44,480
i meant a historical evolution development by the word

673
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:51,120
the positivity of things that have existed right

674
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:56,000
okay okay but the word is in the in high degrees debate with casser and in barberges involved here

675
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,040
because remember varborg is you know casser's close to varborg and identifies his project with

676
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:06,720
varborg in high degrees debate with casser that's what it comes down to whether culture is is

677
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:12,000
something we can start with or whether we need to end with it but that wasn't necessarily the

678
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:19,440
line that one had to take because they were also close to boas here close to close to boas boas here

679
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:25,280
the anthropology here i mean in new york and that would that would have been another

680
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:31,680
lie i mean culture is the way you would have heard us and understood here in new york and uh as

681
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:36,800
you know the other side of the anthropology is being developed which also then enters into the

682
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:43,920
frang anthropology and so forth so it's uh it doesn't have to be the line you're describing as

683
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:50,880
as in which shall we say the mandarin view of five inch class

684
01:29:50,880 --> 01:30:00,880
happy yeah just just a short comment um many elements that came from this uh afternoon very

685
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:09,200
interesting discussion i think point uh or brother to put it slightly differently convince me even

686
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:18,960
more why we still need fraud and perhaps why we need more varborg in a way i think in

687
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:32,640
the present moment what is really of the incredible importance uh is uh to focus on images

688
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:41,600
their power their pervasive presence in our life i i take this to be even more important than

689
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:50,000
their supposed aesthetic quality because and uh there is a trend which keeps going on

690
01:30:51,280 --> 01:31:03,920
so to speak the more or less explicit tendency to sterilize images to reassert the necessity to

691
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:13,040
have a subject and an object to externalize images so that we can contemplate uh uh for

692
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:20,160
hand then so to speak but uh the problem is they are simultaneously very much through hand then

693
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:28,560
and this through hand the night of images speaks in my opinion also from the very narrow peeping

694
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:38,400
hole that our level of description allows that of neuroscience they uh put us into question uh so

695
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:46,480
they are not just the external object or contemplation but they look at us so there is a

696
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:53,120
charismatic relationship between the image and the beholder and to make full sense of that i think

697
01:31:53,120 --> 01:32:03,280
uh we need uh approaches uh like that of a fraud and and varborg they specifically focus on this

698
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:11,440
aspect that that needs to be more and more uh at the center of uh of our reflection now i think

699
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:18,720
and what do you think about phenomenology i mean for the but what's about uh merlot pointi

700
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:26,640
uh which i'm very fond of the late merlot pointi visible and invisible and particularly um i see

701
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:37,200
there is uh more and more people are are looking back to merlot pointi um in film theory for example

702
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:44,160
in this country there are people like vidian subject uh that since maybe 20 years with carnal

703
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:52,160
thought has brought back phenomenology and particularly merlot pointi in the debate of uh of film theory

704
01:32:52,720 --> 01:33:02,240
uh the publication of his notes for the course uh the collage difference uh the word of expression

705
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:08,480
and i don't remember exactly the the english title uh that has been recently published

706
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:17,920
marocarbonne for example in lion is working uh and uh this is perfect for also for for guiding our

707
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:28,960
approach uh to our relationship to images so i think this uh reversibility of the relationship

708
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:38,240
between the image and the beholder is something that uh can be inspired by by barber approach beside

709
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:46,160
uh as i said uh phenomenology so and i i'm i'm pretty much convinced that the debate on on images

710
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:53,840
will be more and more uh uh focusing on this aspect also because of the real volatile nature of an

711
01:33:53,840 --> 01:34:01,520
aesthetic definition of an image uh as an artistic one everybody seems to be aware of that nowadays

712
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:11,200
thank you can i say something just uh a small point reacting to your discourse

713
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:24,000
um if we take seriously the lesson of the phenomenological lesson uh through i mean even

714
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:35,520
beansbanker which tells merlot pointi lacco we must say that the the relation the visual relation

715
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:45,040
is complexified when lacan said you are looked by i am looked by you

716
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:55,440
uh the the the the the the the visual relation the the gaze is also something which is not only

717
01:34:55,440 --> 01:35:04,400
frontal it's a complexification of our our work and i mean when we study a work of art

718
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:10,240
especially for example or renaissance one we are extremely interested in what happened

719
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:20,720
in the space what space the cell the the the palazzo what happened of course the painting here

720
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:29,520
the tapestry but what happened there what was the specialty uh to look at is not only to look at one

721
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:40,560
point i think do you agree yes in fact that that makes a very nice foundation for an art history

722
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:46,880
which we normally artists are intent to try to find out who did what for who mapped our march

723
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:53,440
and when but then the next step is then with all this what is looking at us but that certainly

724
01:35:53,440 --> 01:36:00,160
doesn't exclude finding out the you know contract documents it's fundamental to reconstitute

725
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:04,160
that's still that is looking at us and that is not of course yeah what are the conditions

726
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:10,080
in which it were made and what was happening of course um i mean in terms of all kinds of things

727
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:15,120
that could be said or not about indeed about as we were talking earlier about the speed in which

728
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:18,800
something was made in other words of people are traipsing through the space where you're trying

729
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,920
to work all the time that's going to slow you down or if there's all kinds of other work going on

730
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:27,920
and what's happening if they're putting indoors or windows where you're trying to paint your

731
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:32,880
wall and that's happening for one reason or another or they're trying to conduct services in the very

732
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:38,720
place where you're working and so forth so all of that kind of thing is also related which is also

733
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:44,240
some things that we don't necessarily talk about but in a way uh the things that were opened in a

734
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:50,080
sense by warberg in terms of some of the aspects of cultural history and the other sense of what

735
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:57,520
goes on in it what goes on in the space uh yeah it's interesting it goes back to images so i was

736
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:03,520
just thinking about the other aspects of things it may be because we do have just to go back to

737
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:11,680
dr kiwije's so initial comments it may be because we do have this instrumentarium of uh imagery that's

738
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:19,440
so great that we talk about images rather than actually objects because the artifacts or what

739
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:25,840
whether they're art or not what we always you know what artifacts are the pro are what makes

740
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:31,040
culture i mean culture consists of artifacts now there i guess there could be visual artifacts too

741
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:36,720
but you know there's still there's still things that are man-made and that's it's

742
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:42,560
whether or not that's going to change the discussion that is to say that you have images which do not

743
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:49,280
exist in a in a materials in a material way and warberg could i don't think warberg envisioned that

744
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:54,640
he was still talking about prince carrying the image or whatever and the photograph carrying the

745
01:37:54,640 --> 01:38:01,680
image but yeah i'd like to say a little bit about what you're saying about gays something that

746
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:08,640
interests me very much about the Italian Renaissance art in churches uh is that the way

747
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:16,560
to go into contemporary art the way french artists made paintings still lives and so on

748
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:26,720
in the 19th century you you go right into the picture plane but with Renaissance art you do not

749
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:34,000
the work is hung high and it looks at you the different gaze

750
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,640
okay and i'm sorry

751
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:52,000
my name is saffron hula saffron i'm a professor of architecture at columbia university and they

752
01:38:52,000 --> 01:39:01,680
uh i have run with my students workshop on how to design redesign the bob institute

753
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:10,320
as part of columbia imagining that at the time when the institute had to move from Berlin to

754
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:17,200
london it didn't move to london perhaps we now realize that that london perhaps was not the best

755
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:23,760
choice considering the fact that the university is prepared to disperse the library just threatening

756
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:32,240
it's still threatening it's still threatening so we decided to design a place for the bob institute

757
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:39,520
at columbia and so we looked at many aspects of the physical aspect of storing images

758
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:46,880
and even in the half i know i now know that it takes two cubic meters as a physical form

759
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:53,120
to store it and the fact that historically there was a connection with columbia because

760
01:39:53,120 --> 01:40:00,800
when bob was on his way to visit new mexico he spent some time with bars bars was a

761
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:07,680
anthropologist from Berlin who started the first department of anthropology in american

762
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:13,280
universities and bars invited bobwood to come and speak at columbia accepted

763
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:18,960
bobwood in the meantime which i and therefore couldn't have and this led me directly to the

764
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:24,000
question of consolgia i think it's still be confusing for everybody including yourself

765
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:33,280
probably to mention lacan in the same branch because like what nobody would call a concon

766
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:42,720
from the other hand i think that they they for my point of view a

767
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:47,520
pathological chance it would be much better to understand

768
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:55,760
bobwood in technological challenge than any other challenge precisely there isn't even

769
01:40:55,760 --> 01:41:05,920
a kind of solid background today because he was in contact with ludic bingsbanger as we know

770
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:12,480
ludic bingsbanger treated him over many years and ludic bingsbanger after all was the first

771
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:19,840
psychiatrist who takes technology on board reading both whose words aim honey and so that

772
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:27,680
should have meant quite a lot and it seems to me up to this moment that this has not yet

773
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:34,320
filtered through and perhaps that's one of the reasons didn't feel that through is

774
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:42,480
uh the authority of uh grombick because grombick famously wrote as the director of

775
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:52,000
the bob institute he wrote a book on uh vahu in which he more or less dismissed him as a serious

776
01:41:52,000 --> 01:42:03,200
artist of uh grombick was totally committed to prepare the point of view and from prepare the

777
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:13,840
prepare point of view none of the thesis of a bobwood made sense about all empathy didn't make sense

778
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:21,360
and couldn't stand a kind empirical verification not at the time of but of of gromb by now we have

779
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:30,480
to be a new audience that basically this is a little bit more appealing to the basis not to me I mean I

780
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:40,560
wrote the thesis of a body uh a body and embodiment from a logical point of view in 1972 which meant

781
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:46,720
that I had a good basis to approach art from an equal point of view and I was responsible for art

782
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:54,640
in in the studio for the work of school art at the time that was um you know obstetric for some

783
01:42:54,640 --> 01:43:04,800
on the other hand don't it I dislike you in the application I like you very much but I think I

784
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:11,920
like I like it because it's you and because it's bound to a kind of rich intellectual of the last

785
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:22,080
10 years you see the problem of culture as nature or in point art is the balance between the external

786
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:30,800
in term when the Germans in Berlin built an instant museum and thought that by collecting great

787
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:40,640
object of art artifacts from the high point of Greek culture they could guarantee their own culture

788
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:47,200
and tradition obviously they make a big mistake because they believe the possession of these things

789
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:53,840
is in itself guaranteed for some kind to in fact I made this joke when it was recently

790
01:43:53,840 --> 01:44:01,200
uh restored they instantly said they would chip it with the English architect was responsible

791
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:09,440
for the French which is a masterpiece but I said to him you see the program of this museum was to

792
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:18,640
safeguard certain quantization obviously the structure of it is approved of an historical fact that it

793
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:27,760
did not have to safeguard any culture any visualization the state of crime tried to have a collection

794
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:34,880
of so-called anti-culture right it's a considerable collection it turned out that it wasn't a different

795
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:44,800
whole state what does it tell us it tells us that it doesn't matter that's what it tells us because

796
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:52,720
for him this object that were fake and obviously he never died to distinguish between me treated

797
01:44:52,720 --> 01:45:00,400
them as authentic works but he didn't matter he didn't matter just it doesn't matter how you write

798
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:10,000
go without you in the famous book that the handwriting of garbou was unwritten it would not be said

799
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:16,800
so Edgar Wayne in the famous league in anonymous or you in the theater at the time you know you

800
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:24,720
could write the news anonymously and Edgar Wayne wrote interesting on one hand you claim you can

801
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:34,000
read barbou and writing on the other hand you claim that he's included so either is claimed

802
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:43,360
in confide with that so i think the secret of barbou is precisely can be understood best

803
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:52,480
infineargica terms in serelian terms in which according to which the photos cannot the image

804
01:45:52,480 --> 01:46:05,200
is residual is only like letters are not important in themselves as the Chinese say

805
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:15,920
when you want to fish a fish you make a nice road and a nice something at the end of the

806
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:27,600
thread to capture the fish but once you cut the fish the road and all the rest of no interest

807
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:40,320
i just can answer about paris i mean lacquer okay

808
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:51,680
okay can i answer to the just about if you think the recourse to lacquer is confusing

809
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:58,960
perhaps it's because you think that paris is a territory but paris is like new york it's a

810
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:11,200
place of cost-popolitism i want to recall that the french so so called french thought french

811
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:20,080
stretch regularism i want to recall that michael fuckel began his work translating carefully

812
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:29,600
Ludwig bizvanger i want to recall that lacquer uh dedicated a lot of time to translate martin

813
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:37,600
heidegger and Freud of course and there are there were many connections especially between lacquer

814
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:45,520
and bizvanger because as you know bizvanger died in the 60s i think in the even in the 70s perhaps

815
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:54,480
i don't remember but a great psychoanalyst french one whose name is pia fredida who is not

816
01:47:54,480 --> 01:48:02,080
translated into english i guess was precisely the man who was able to go between between lacquer

817
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:11,520
and bizvanger fredida was the assistant and bizvanger at kreutlingen so there is no isolation of lacquer

818
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:21,920
and parisianism there is a link between uh profound link between uh french philosophy french

819
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:27,280
structuralism and german psychiatric

820
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:37,280
i want to make a distinction between the phandology of melopontic is incompatible with the phandology

821
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:44,400
of heidegger heidegger was in principle and he says so you know in contrast is a is a

822
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:52,480
turning turning upside down huster yeah but for t is much more in the huster egan

823
01:48:52,480 --> 01:49:00,320
yeah but contrast contrast is dialogue that is in the way for example we contrast but we dialogue

824
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:10,240
i think the two of you should fight this after the meeting we set aside a room for you to do this

825
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:18,320
two quick and really efficient points for your response um following on the idea of uh students

826
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:27,600
designing uh warberg library at columbia long before that in 1933 even as all the books and

827
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:34,480
artifacts were being packed up there was a very real possibility and i invite you to imagine

828
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:40,800
if that had happened where we would be right now at 17 east eightieth street the paul warberg

829
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:49,520
house was offered as the home of the ab warberg library paul warberg died in early 1932 um he

830
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:57,120
was my great grandfather his brother ab had died in 1929 i think but 33 they're packing up the

831
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:05,520
library where can it go london was originally seen simply as a safe harbor phillics warberg

832
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:14,640
another brother put up half a million dollars 1933 dollars to finance this library and it was

833
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:22,880
going to happen and the state department put sand in the gears the state department memo exists

834
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:31,840
saying there was a fear that it could stir anti-semitism in new york if this german library had come here

835
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:38,800
so i am i'm so it stayed in london where it where it was parked so i invite you to imagine

836
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:48,320
the warberg library here in new york cross-pollinating with the analytic community that was arriving

837
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:54,960
all through the thirties assisted in part by ab warberg's niece patina warberg who was once

838
01:50:54,960 --> 01:51:00,800
someone who walked the halls of the new york cycle analytic what would the warberg library

839
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:07,040
have been like and what would his influence have been like without gombrick annihilating

840
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:14,800
the legacy of ab warberg in and undercutting him in that fascinating way um the other

841
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:21,760
point to consider and i'm anticipating tomorrow obviously but i find it curious that we could talk

842
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:30,320
talk about in such a fascinating way ab warberg's relationship to history and his sense of the past

843
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:38,320
bearing down on us when you consider that his flight into madness that precipitated this day

844
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:46,320
uh at bellview in the treatment by bens vanger was in fact his sense in his intersection of

845
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:53,120
psychosis and brilliance that by delving into antiquities he had stirred these angry spirits

846
01:51:53,120 --> 01:52:00,800
and started world war one he felt responsible uh among other mad thoughts but he specifically

847
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:10,960
thought that it had to do with his delving into the past so would welcome response

848
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:24,640
it's i want to return but perhaps it is a program for tomorrow for the next year

849
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:33,520
uh to the question of the torio galese uh it is important because we are here in the

850
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:39,600
psychoanalytic new york psychoanalytic society and institute and i think the question was

851
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:48,960
very central why we need fraud why we need verbog and between these two fields of research

852
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:57,360
it is an intersection and for me the intersection today was really the question of unconscious

853
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:05,600
what is the place of unconscious in the process of creation and in the process of interpretation

854
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:14,720
of the creative work unconscious and drive we can say unconscious in memory it is the question

855
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:23,120
of the trace and the relation to the time which is very central in our discussion a lesson about

856
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:31,200
time and survival apre coup afterwards i don't know exactly how to translate always apre coup

857
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:39,920
and the question of drive is also patos formal and the question of gaze in the division between gaze

858
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:50,000
and eye it is important in lack of phenomenology like on this question with meadow point three about

859
01:53:50,000 --> 01:54:03,040
the question of the opposition between gaze and eye and i think it is in this distinction that we

860
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:10,720
have the resistance to the image it's really central we were discussing together a few minutes ago

861
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:18,000
what is what are the reasons of the resistance today to the image we are in the civilization

862
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:25,520
of images a lot of images the violence of images but in fact we are in a moment where it is very

863
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:34,800
difficult to think to images i propose for perhaps tomorrow that we discuss time and gaze

864
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:45,840
in relation to perhaps the history of personal history of barborg also in his own relation to

865
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:55,840
bin sanger okay so we will stop here and we will show the documenting

866
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:21,840
just a second before before the film comes it's been a
