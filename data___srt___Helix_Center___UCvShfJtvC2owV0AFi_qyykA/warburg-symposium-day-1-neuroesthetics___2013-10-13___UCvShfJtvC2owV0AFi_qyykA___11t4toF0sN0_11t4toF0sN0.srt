1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
I'm Ed Nurse-Escion, director of the Helix Center.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:09,760
I want to welcome you all to these two days of roundtables focusing around the ideas of

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,560
Abby Warburg.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,600
I would like to say primarily that I want to thank all of you who are here.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,040
I realize it's an early morning time.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,720
We are usually not here at this hour.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,720
I thank all the participants who come from various places in the world to be part of this

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,960
meeting.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,120
From our side, I think Rob Penzer has done a tremendous amount of work to organize this

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:48,200
and I'd like to thank him.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,320
And I would like also to thank Konstwakwie Bejie, who is here from London and who is director

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,520
of the Abby Warburg Institute in London.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,840
The beautiful poster that you see out there and the brochure that you have here were all

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,960
designed by him and sent to us from London.

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:18,160
So I'd like to thank him.

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,400
We are very honored today here to have the ambassador, Francois Bava from Switzerland

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,080
and I'm going to ask him to say a couple of words.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,520
Yeah, Ed.

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:40,280
Ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure for me to be here and to have Switzerland associated

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,360
to your symposium.

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,720
You may ask why Switzerland is associated?

22
00:01:45,720 --> 00:02:05,380
Well, you know the relationship between Warburg and Switzerland, K

23
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:12,380
and is supported by another foundation called the Will's Dog Foundation which owns the Rolex

24
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,960
Watch Company.

25
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:21,160
So it's really rooted in Geneva and as an important, I would say, an important support.

26
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:28,360
The mission of the Agalma Foundation is to explore the relationship between neuroscience,

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,000
psychoanalysis and art.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And the two persons in charge of the foundation are here today, Pierre Magistreti and Francois

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,660
and Francois Auncereme.

30
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:47,220
And the idea of this symposium, if I understand well, is born or was born from a conversation

31
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,900
between Professor Galese from Parma, Pierre and Francois in a train between Geneva and

32
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:00,620
Lausanne.

33
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:10,100
So, they were talking about Warburg and about his concept of science without name which basically

34
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:16,900
tries to bring together various disciplines and anthropology, history of art and biology.

35
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:25,380
And the objective of the Agalma Foundation is also to build bridges between the sciences

36
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,460
and art and humanities.

37
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,660
So they said, that's interesting.

38
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,460
Warburg as a resonance for us means something for us.

39
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:42,460
So let's try to do something and then they spoke to the endocision and today we are here.

40
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,020
So that's the link to Switzerland.

41
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,900
I wish you a very successful conference and have a good day.

42
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
Thank you.

43
00:03:50,900 --> 00:04:00,380
Hello, Professor Magistreti from the Agalma Foundation.

44
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:06,740
A very brief introduction now.

45
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:14,140
Actually Ambassador Barras, you can see how professional our ambassadors because he told

46
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,220
everything I asked to tell.

47
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:24,140
He really made his homework and said everything I wanted to say about the Agalma Foundation.

48
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,900
So thank you, Francois, thank you Ambassador Barras.

49
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,660
Anyway, as president of the Agalma Foundation, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you all

50
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,660
here.

51
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:41,100
It's true that we actually had the idea of this symposium, Victoria Francois and myself.

52
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:48,260
And even after, I should say, there was some facilitating substances like wine.

53
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:55,100
We actually had quite some wine and then suddenly we had this idea of organizing something here.

54
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:02,020
And more seriously, again, as mentioned very clearly by Ambassador Barras, the Agalma Foundation

55
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:17,260
as its mission to try to bridge neuro-science, psychoanalysis, culture and society.

56
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:27,180
And in these days, I think, of super-specialization and where academic life has lost a little bit

57
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,220
of its freedom, I think.

58
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,180
I can say this after having been in academic life for 30 years.

59
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,500
It's really very refreshing and very important that there are places like the Agalma Foundation

60
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:47,780
and I think the Helix Foundation where there is a freedom of thinking, a freedom of making

61
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:57,100
connection, thinking outside the box and trying to move fields forward, not necessarily in

62
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,380
a very disciplinary way.

63
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,540
And this is really the goal of the foundation.

64
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:12,620
In terms of activities, the foundation organizes discussions, I should say, between a guest

65
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,180
that Francois and I invite.

66
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,940
And then we speak for about 45 minutes.

67
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:25,500
I have to say we were very much influenced by what Ed launched many years ago with the

68
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:33,020
Philocht etes foundation, again, very free discussion on not necessarily even on a specific

69
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:41,060
topic, but just in our case, what we try to do is what we say an experiment with someone

70
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,380
outside neuroscience and psychoanalysis and see how he or she, particularly from the case

71
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:56,340
of the art and culture, how we can have some ideas emerge from this kind of strange mix

72
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,900
between neuroscience, psychoanalysis and someone from the cultural world.

73
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,700
And these discussions are filmed, again, very much inspired by what Ed has launched and then

74
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,780
they are on YouTube.

75
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:15,340
So if you go on the Agalma website, you can see we have now about, I think, over 20 of

76
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,100
such discussions and you may find them interesting.

77
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,220
Some of them are in English, I have to say most of them are in French, but then other

78
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:30,140
activities of the foundations are to organize occasionally small workshops like this one.

79
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:36,260
We just did one last week in Geneva for the 100th anniversary of the death of Férino de

80
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,940
Socio, the linguistic from Geneva.

81
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,820
It turns out just out of curiosity you may be interested that a member of the Agalma of

82
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:51,060
the board of the Agalma Foundation is a Christian de Socio, a descendant of Férino de Socio,

83
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,900
so that was even more appropriate for us to discuss this.

84
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,060
And we had, again, a little bit in a smaller scale, but the same idea, neuroscientist,

85
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,340
psychoanalysis, linguist, philosophers, I think quite productive and we will have actually

86
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,260
a small publication come out of this workshop.

87
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:20,020
And then we tried to sponsor certain research efforts which, for those of you who have tried

88
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:28,780
to engage in experimental approaches, bringing together psychoanalysis and neuroscience, it's

89
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,540
quite difficult without kind of denaturing both of them.

90
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,300
So it's a really very difficult exercise, but we think it's a worthwhile exercise.

91
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,260
So we have some fellows who work on this topic.

92
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,860
Actually, we have with Christina Berrini, who is quite unique because she's a prominent

93
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,980
neuroscientist and also a psychoanalyst here at NYU.

94
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,660
And so we have a project with her and we have a couple of other projects at the Federal

95
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,540
Institute of Technology where I work.

96
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:03,940
So this is to give you the context and the interests of the Agalma Foundation and it

97
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,940
looks like I've been looking at the program and I would like to thank Ed, of course, and

98
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,020
all the people who contributed to organizing and bringing together the people.

99
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,500
We have now an experiment that will go on in the style we like at the Agalma Foundation

100
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,460
and I think also at the Helix Foundation.

101
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:32,220
So thank you very much and I hope we have a very productive two days.

102
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,180
Thank you Pierre.

103
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,900
I didn't say anything about Helix.

104
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,020
I assume everybody knows about Helix, but if you don't, I'd be happy to talk to you

105
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,700
after the meeting.

106
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:51,540
So what I'm going to do is introduce the participants in this round table in the briefest way possible

107
00:09:51,540 --> 00:10:00,020
and then we'll get going.

108
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:08,820
I will start with Ludovica Loomer who is sitting there and she's a philosopher and a neurobiologist

109
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:16,220
and has worked with Samir Zeki who is one of the founders, I guess, of the Neuroesthetics

110
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,980
movement in London.

111
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:27,660
Next to her is Vittorio Galese who is professor of physiology in the Department of Neuroscience

112
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:34,260
of the University of Palma and well known for his discovery of the mirror neurons.

113
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:42,060
Sitting there is Anjan Chatterjee who is a neurologist and member of the Center for Cognitive

114
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,980
Neuroscience and the Center for Neuroscience and Society at the University of Pennsylvania

115
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,180
and I believe he has a book coming out on neuroesthetics or it's already here.

116
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:58,660
I don't know but it's certainly coming out this week.

117
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,060
David Friedberg who has participated in a number of our round tables in the past is professor

118
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,900
of Art History at the University of Columbia and director of the Italian Academy for Advanced

119
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,220
Studies in America.

120
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:21,020
And finally Andrea Pinotti teaches aesthetics at the University de l'estud de di Milano

121
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:28,900
and is director of the program at the College International de Philosophy in Paris on the

122
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:34,300
project Monumont, nonumont, correct?

123
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:45,220
Okay, so we'll get going.

124
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:52,100
To get this round table started I asked Vittorio to just say very, very brief words, a few

125
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:59,180
words to get oriented on the subject and then everybody else would jump in.

126
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,940
Thank you.

127
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,420
Thank you Ed.

128
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:11,060
It's a great pleasure to be here particularly because that dream that was conceived in Switzerland

129
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,100
between Genève and Luzon is now real.

130
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,940
I mean we are here.

131
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:28,180
We will spend two days discussing this amazing figure of Abi Warburg.

132
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:39,420
I think we begin to appreciate how innovative this approach was, perhaps particularly today.

133
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:51,340
When we are experiencing a new form of dialogue between disciplines that the first site may

134
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:59,020
look as remote as possible like the study of the brain, the study of art, of culture.

135
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:09,780
When Vittorio embodies I think in a marvelous way this curiosity and this attempt to bridge

136
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:20,340
different field of expertise particularly because cognitive neuroscience is very popular.

137
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:26,340
Every day we read the big headlines in the newspaper, we discover what romantic love

138
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:33,500
is all about, we discover a tiny little area where beauty sits and the like.

139
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:44,980
This I would say, outrageously excessive form of reductionism needs to be tempered by an

140
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:54,860
open dialogue with people that because of the background tend to look at the individual

141
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,140
in a more holistic way.

142
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:04,300
So we must bring back the brain to where it belongs to the body in the first place but

143
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:13,620
this brain body complex it makes sense to study it to the extent that even if we move

144
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:20,140
from a methodological reductionist approach so we are dealing with the nuts and bolts so

145
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:27,780
to speak of what it means to be human the ultimate goal must be to go back to the holistic

146
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:36,340
view of human nature and if we want to do that we cannot live out from our investigation,

147
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:44,860
artistic expression, creativity and how this relates to something which is hidden in our

148
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,220
psychology.

149
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:55,380
So I think that the chicanelises, neuroscience, the humanities broadly speaking now finally

150
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:05,140
are in a position to collaborate to this very exciting enterprise of shedding light on who

151
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:15,280
we are exploiting also this new level of description that cognitive neuroscience and I think a

152
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:23,380
prominent figure to bless so to speak this enterprise I couldn't imagine a better figure

153
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,380
than Abhi Babu.

154
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:36,040
So as I was thinking about today's meeting I thought I didn't think of myself as a neuro

155
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:42,020
esthetician I think of myself as an art historian who makes use of tools that seem to me that

156
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:49,740
will illuminate the objects of our studies and as many of you know I have long insisted

157
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,380
on the importance of opening one's mind to science and not getting too anxious about

158
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,460
the alleged reductivism of science but as I was thinking about today's symposium I realised

159
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:07,860
that probably once one was a child and suddenly one is old and probably I may have been in

160
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,660
this audience the first person to have gone to the Warburg Institute.

161
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,940
So I wondered when I could just begin with a little background.

162
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,820
So I arrived in Oxford to do my graduate work in art history at the end of 1969 and Francis

163
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:29,900
Haskell who had just taken over from another great and extraordinary hermeneute and art

164
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:36,700
historian Edgar Vinte who was a Warburgian of course was a high British positivist and

165
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,860
he looked at me and he said you can't study here go to the Warburg Institute in London.

166
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:47,220
So I went to the Warburg Institute so that was at the end of 1969 and as I was reflecting

167
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,740
on the direction of Warburg in studies and the ways in which many of us here including

168
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,800
myself and Vittorio have sort of seen the links between A.B.

169
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,980
Varbog and neuroscience I realised that it wasn't always so because when I got to the

170
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,180
Warburg Institute the emphasis was completely on both Michael Baxondall and Anne Sconbrick

171
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,380
were completely on the Naheleb and Der Antica.

172
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,180
Gombrick had done his own stuff on perception as we all know in art and delusion but the

173
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:25,020
real Warburgian work at that time and throughout the 1970s and even into the 1980s was really

174
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,260
about iconography and the Naheleb and Der Antica.

175
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:35,380
So when I wrote the power of images sort of thinking about the other aspect of A.B.

176
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:41,180
Varbog which has now come to the fore in other words this kind of psychological roots of

177
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:47,460
human responses to images embodied above all in the whole notion of the pathos formula

178
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,100
the patos formula.

179
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,980
In other words those aspects of art which move us because of the collocation of emotion

180
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,940
and movement in the body and its effects on the bodies of others which of course tied

181
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,380
up eventually with the work of the Mira Neuron group in Parma.

182
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:12,820
This was really a very late cumber on the Naheleb and of Varbog himself in London.

183
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:19,020
No one would have thought that the cognitive neuroscience offered any access to the works

184
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,020
of A.B.

185
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,020
Varbog.

186
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,300
So actually this is all a late development.

187
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,860
And it was always there in Varbog the notion of the emotional consequences of moving drapery

188
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,940
and dancing bodies and so on.

189
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,100
But nobody until fairly recently, I mean we have lots of people here, Chris Wood has

190
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,660
written eloquently about it, Chris Johnson also.

191
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:50,100
But for a long time the original conception, the rarely original aspect of Warburg's contribution

192
00:18:50,100 --> 00:19:01,580
was relegated to this more positivist decoding of the great iconographies of the Renaissance.

193
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:10,580
So now we have reclaimed what seems to be the most moving aspect as it were of A.B. Varbog

194
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,940
and its finding its fruition in the kinds of work which we have seen done amongst the

195
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,060
cognitive neuroscience and with the development of the neuroscience of emotion movement and

196
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,060
so on.

197
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,060
So I think we have a lot of people who are going to be able to move ahead in this direction.

198
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:28,260
But I just thought that that historical background would be useful.

199
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,460
Adding perhaps another issue to this question of the historical background more generally

200
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,860
as regards German culture in the 19th century.

201
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:47,740
Victoria, you told us about this figure, a special figure of Varbog as a possible bridge

202
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:54,860
between natural sciences and humanities.

203
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:01,660
We know that the German philosophical and epistemological discourse was responsible

204
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:08,780
for the division, the terminus technique was between Geistes Wiesenshaften on one side

205
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,660
and Mathur Wiesenshaften on the other side.

206
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:24,540
For the rest it was not unfrequent that students and scholars training in one field took courses

207
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,700
in the other.

208
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:34,780
Varbog himself is an example, an emblematic example because he was trained as an art historian

209
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:42,060
but in the 90s he went to Berlin to attend courses in medicine, at the Faculty of Medicine.

210
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:50,020
There is studied neurology and you find in the fragments on the psychology of expression

211
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:56,980
very interesting sketches and drawings on the structure of the nerves, on the problem

212
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:08,300
of the reflex and there are drawings about the relationship between stimulus and response.

213
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:16,660
And then he read neurologists like Evelle Herring and the very important lecture in 1870 on

214
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:24,860
memory as organized matter and then among his sources there was Richard Zehmon, a zoologist

215
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:33,580
and neurologist as well who gave him the terminus technique was Mime N. Graham.

216
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:43,860
So he was really imbued with this literature and I think that just taking one of the most

217
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:53,300
famous concepts in Varbog's discourse, Sophros Zune, the ancient Greek world that it translates

218
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
with based on and height.

219
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:07,100
I'm not sure what an English possible translation would be, caution, prudence, being wise, not

220
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
being impulsive.

221
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:16,540
There you find this idea of distance as interval, pose as crucial.

222
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,140
It was not only a question of symbolic distance.

223
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,900
The one that he discusses, for example, in the certain ritual lecture that modern technology

224
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:37,700
destroys the distance that magic and art had instituted between man and world.

225
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:45,460
It speaks also of distance in a neurological way, meaning the distance between the stimulus,

226
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:56,500
the response and the human being has the creature that can procrastinate, that can introduce

227
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:05,780
mediation, a postponement, a creature that is not obliged to immediately respond to the

228
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:13,580
stimulus but that can respond and Zehmon was very important to him in this context in a

229
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,300
procrastinated way, in a delayed way.

230
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:28,620
Image plays in this frame, I think, a very fundamental role because image has a biological

231
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:39,700
meaning in this biological utility in helping men in negotiating between stimulus and response,

232
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:47,140
corresponding the response, even for centuries, even for thousands of years.

233
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:54,700
And so this idea was thistchen round, bank round, the space in between, the space for

234
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:01,980
thought, the space for memory and that's around, all terms that Warburg evokes as a

235
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,740
constellation around the Sophros unit term.

236
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:12,020
I think they can also be usefully investigated from a neurological perspective, rooted in

237
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,860
those young years of studies in Berlin.

238
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:30,020
I wonder if I could pose a question as I've been listening to this, that I'm still trying

239
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,580
to get my head around.

240
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:41,980
Which is on the one hand, there are cultural theories of which I am relatively ignorant

241
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:51,380
of and on the other hand, there is psychoanalysis of which I am relatively ignorant and a sconst

242
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,380
in between.

243
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:59,620
Is that like a double negative?

244
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:09,460
And then there's neuroscience of which I have some knowledge and in part, I'm trying to

245
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,780
figure out what the relationships of these things are.

246
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:19,460
And on the one hand, you can think of cultural theories as something that is an emergent

247
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:25,060
property of a whole lot of things but can't be reduced to what one individual person or

248
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,740
what one individual brain is doing.

249
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:38,140
And at the other end, at least my medical school knowledge of psychoanalysis is a deep dive

250
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:44,860
into the individual at the level of the content of what they're talking about, what they're

251
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:50,500
thinking about, what they're dreaming about, what they associate, so on and so forth.

252
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,900
But neuroscience in some way seems to be somewhere in between, at least the way it's typically

253
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:02,500
practiced which is on the one hand, our methods are driven to try to generalize, it's the

254
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:08,020
inherent nature of much of empirical research is you want to get generalizable principles

255
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:13,860
but not typically so generalizable that they are applicable to cultural theories.

256
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:20,220
And the very inherent nature of generalizing is that we typically tend to be less interested

257
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,860
in the individual.

258
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:27,980
The individual becomes one exemplar of a general principle that we're trying to derive.

259
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:35,180
And psychoanalysis on the one hand seems to be, seems to drill down at the individual

260
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,740
and the content of the experience of the individual that we typically try to do away with in most

261
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,580
neuroscience studies.

262
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:49,620
But our generalization doesn't generalize to the point of having at least in a transparent

263
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,780
way making contact with cultural notions.

264
00:26:54,780 --> 00:27:01,940
And I'm just curious what people think about, are these tensions that are inherent in the

265
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:08,340
disciplines or are these just historical tensions that have to be traversed and settings like

266
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,780
this might help in that regard?

267
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:20,700
It's my turn to answer.

268
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,700
Thank you very much.

269
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,500
It's a small issue.

270
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:36,660
Actually, one of the things that was fascinating, the most about Warburg, is that he's expressing,

271
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,540
I'm not sure for the first time in the history of thought because we can always go back to

272
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:48,940
the Greeks for almost everything, but exactly the tension between subjective and objective

273
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,780
individuality and socially.

274
00:27:53,780 --> 00:28:07,860
I think one of the most striking things that make us what we are, this tension of being

275
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:17,260
a self, but this self is developed and we reach our concept of being who we are in the interaction

276
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
with the others.

277
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,300
So this tension is exactly what makes us what we are.

278
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:31,740
But I think at the beginning of the century, the end of the 1800, beginning of 1900, there

279
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:43,940
was this crack somehow that opened a discussion that we are still trying to solve today even

280
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:42,800
with the songs of yesterday of Jesus'

281
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:52,900
life, this mind-body matter over mind and mind over matter.

282
00:28:52,900 --> 00:29:05,540
And this crack opened up a sort of view came from which came out the destroying of all

283
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:11,580
our stability and certainty about our conscious life, about space and time, about the possibility

284
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,840
of measurement.

285
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,020
And everything came out at the same time.

286
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:25,160
And even Warburg was there at the same time and was striking with the notion of magical

287
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:33,400
and real and art, science, religion, because we don't talk about it, but it's still there

288
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:39,040
is the big part of our life anyway.

289
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:49,440
We were there to try to find a solution about this gap to give some uncorch which was done

290
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,480
because otherwise we would collapse into this crack.

291
00:29:53,480 --> 00:30:03,240
And opening this volcano of things, we had to find sort of solution, we had to find our

292
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,840
way through to build a bridge.

293
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,360
And I think Warburg was amazing in trying to do that.

294
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,480
Probably was not a solid, probably I'm not an expert on, I write quite a lot about what

295
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,760
he wrote, but I'm not an expert on him.

296
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:30,280
But it was one of the first to try maybe unconsciously to find a bridge to a world like

297
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,720
this gap.

298
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:39,240
And this was, most of our life is an individual experience.

299
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,960
We lived with deep-seatering culture and culture is a big part of what we are, but we live

300
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,600
in our individual life and experiences.

301
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:57,080
And so he describes the experiences, for example, in front of a war of art as the most private

302
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:03,360
thing is that the impact is there, is talking to you and you have to give life to the image

303
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,280
you have in front.

304
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:12,040
But then you have to insert in the history, in the culture, there is no history of culture

305
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,120
without the history of an idea.

306
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:22,120
So to make sense of this individual experience, you have to insert it in the development of

307
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,920
something broader which is more or less the history of.

308
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,720
We cannot even say the Western thought because it was linked to everything and everywhere.

309
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,760
It destroyed completely space and time.

310
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:40,960
The symbol could travel and live without barriers in every time and every space.

311
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:48,880
And this tension between the private experience of something and the objective is exactly

312
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:56,880
what art is about and what art came about when there was this huge brain.

313
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,600
In the postmodernism, art became an idea more than an image.

314
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Duchamp was the master of that.

315
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,120
I was putting us in front of a urinal saying, now you have to perceive it as a piece of

316
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,200
art and until you don't perceive it as a piece of art, this is not going to be art.

317
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,480
So you have to make this become something which can travel in history.

318
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:31,360
I don't know, it's funny what you said because it's something that I'm struggling with trying

319
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:44,920
to make sense of it, this tension between the aesthetic private experience and the history.

320
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:53,360
I think Anyan raised a very important point about the relevance and the specific status

321
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:02,240
of cognitive neuroscience when addressing these specific topics that traditionally as Andrea

322
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:12,800
was reminding us of, belong to these separate domains, Natur, Visinshaft and Geistus Visashaft.

323
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,640
I think it's time to seriously question this distinction and division.

324
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:26,000
However, we should also bear in mind that when we speak of cognitive neuroscience, we basically

325
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,440
describe a methodological approach.

326
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:36,960
So we all recognize ourself as cognitive neuroscientists to the extent that we all have a daily practice

327
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:46,040
with this very expensive choice, we call it the Marai, Hidens-D-E-G, Pet and the like,

328
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:53,760
but you can use employ these toys to ask completely different kinds of questions.

329
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:05,160
And it's true that to lay the grounding, the foundational basis of an approach to human

330
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:15,000
nature based on this specific methodological approach, it is unavoidable to start with

331
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:26,040
an approach that so to speak, a privilege generalizing results where we take the average

332
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:46,920
undergraduate most of the time white first world college student to be a sort of typical

333
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:59,240
example of the human species, so to speak.

334
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:05,640
Not only reductive, but heavily biased view of human nature.

335
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:12,200
Indeed, in the field of the study of emotions, people, there is a growing number of people

336
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:20,200
also of colleagues that begin to question the supposed universality of some of the findings

337
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:28,600
upon which the empirical study of emotion was based starting from the second half of last

338
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,000
century.

339
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:42,040
And interestingly, more and more of our colleagues are exactly thinking about how to study these

340
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:49,280
distinctive aspects of human nature, which is the individual quality of being a human

341
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,360
being.

342
00:35:50,360 --> 00:36:02,760
And it is remarkable that as soon as you decide to leave behind this approach to the supposed

343
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:12,120
generality of the finding, you are up to trying to dig more about the distinctive relationship

344
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:18,880
between how your brain works and what your personal life history was, your attachment

345
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:28,360
style, the early experiences you had with your parents, with other individuals, all of

346
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:33,400
a sudden you realize that you spot incredible differences.

347
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:41,800
I'm thinking about a study where people were required to watch videos portraying the facial

348
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,080
expression of their partner in pain.

349
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:52,080
And it turns out that according to your personality profile, different brain networks activate

350
00:36:52,080 --> 00:37:01,160
in spite of the exactly the same cognitive response when you are asked to evaluate the

351
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:11,000
unpleasantness and the intensity of the pain that supposedly your partner is feeling by

352
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,160
merely watching to this video showing the facial expression of your partner.

353
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,400
This cognitive evaluation is the same in all participants.

354
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:29,960
However, when you look at which part of their brain is active, you discover that people

355
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:37,760
with a different affective style activate the standard called the circuit for the empathy

356
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,920
for pain, the anterior part of the insular and the anterior cingulate cortex, while other

357
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,480
individuals don't.

358
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,160
They tend to activate more the visual part of the brain, the mesial aspect of the brain,

359
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,880
part of what we call the default mode network, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

360
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:07,440
So they most likely experience that particular image of their partner in pain in a completely

361
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:17,360
different way, which can be partly also identified with our peculiar methodological reductionist

362
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,760
approach.

363
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,640
So I think there's a lot to do and this is why I think this time is really exciting

364
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:32,480
for all of us because now that we learn how to use this machine, we are perfectly familiar

365
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,440
with the instruction manuals, so to speak, we know what to expect from a technical point

366
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
of view.

367
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,720
We know the limitation of the technique, but at the same time we should perhaps think

368
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:52,320
a lot more and someone said a long time ago that science doesn't think.

369
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:59,760
I think it's way too extreme view, but when reading some neuroscientific papers sometimes

370
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,400
I think Heidegger was right.

371
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:11,400
So there's a lot of room to improve the realistic value of this particular approach that I repeat

372
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:19,840
offers you a further perspective on human nature, which will never be able to give the

373
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:28,080
final answer to the question that keep us busy all the time, who we are.

374
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:43,080
But I think it can bring in new data, new perspective that if interestingly discussed

375
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:48,200
with the contribution of scholars from other disciplines can lead us to very interesting

376
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,480
results, I think.

377
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,480
So I'm rather optimistic.

378
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:03,160
I just wanted to say although Victoria and I have known each other for a long time, work

379
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,320
together, I noticed a slight backsliding here.

380
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:12,240
And I'm not sure that he's making slightly unnecessary concessions, but never mind.

381
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,640
I think the point is that, and I'll explain in a moment, I think Anyan's question is

382
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,400
a really important one.

383
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,560
It's one which the people in the humanities, whom I work with, mostly ask all the time.

384
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,640
I mean, the question is how can the generalizing aspects of science be reconciled with the

385
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,560
status of the individual, the effects of cultures and contexts?

386
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:44,720
So whenever I hear this question, I always inclined to say it's not a view which is well

387
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,160
received, but I'm inclined to say what's so difficult to understand about the situation?

388
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,840
I'll tell you why I think this.

389
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:00,640
What I think has happened now as the sciences have come closer to the humanities, it's offered

390
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,840
us an extraordinary opportunity.

391
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,840
And that is the best neuroscientists that we just heard are attentive to context.

392
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,680
There's no question about that.

393
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,040
But how do we arrive at the understanding of the individual with all this generalization

394
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,040
around us?

395
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,960
And this is what I'm trying to say is not so difficult to understand.

396
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:30,640
In order to grasp the effects of individual contexts of past histories, both personal

397
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:39,480
and historical, we still need to know what happens in the brain of all individuals, possibly

398
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,000
even primates.

399
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,600
But neuroscience also gives us the tools.

400
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,880
This has been the great privilege for me.

401
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:53,680
It also gives the one the tools to understand better what happens when the human brain is

402
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:01,440
modulated by the effects of individual cognitive experiences, individual inputs, individual

403
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,720
circumstances.

404
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,720
There is no, in my view, no distinction really between the task of the neuroscientists in

405
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:15,200
establishing basic structures in the brain and figuring out how individuality is constituted

406
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,560
on the basis of those, you know, we all have an amygdala.

407
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:24,080
If the amygdala is lesion, you just walk straight into the traffic across the way.

408
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,520
A amygdala is activated when you have a fear response.

409
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,880
Now, obviously, some of us know snakes better than others.

410
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,920
You know, her pathologists are probably less likely to be afraid of seeing a cobra, or

411
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,880
be seeing a, when I see a snake, I jump away.

412
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,000
I don't make any distinctions, any taxonomic distinctions between those that are poisonous.

413
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,400
But when you see, as Joe did as shown, when you see something that moves a bit like a snake,

414
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,600
everyone is going to have a startled reaction.

415
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:57,400
And thereupon succeed, I mean, you know, the great beauty of the neuroscientists now, it

416
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:03,400
also gives us a sense of temporal operations and temporal distinctions within the brain.

417
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:09,880
So I think the prospect here for understanding the individual is not curiously diminished

418
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,960
by the kinds of techniques which we have available, but in fact enhanced.

419
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,400
And that's why the backsliding, I just want to briefly, I don't think you need backslide

420
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,400
away.

421
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,000
So we need slide away too far from basic emotions and so on and so forth.

422
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,960
To be more outspoken, I'm really annoyed.

423
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:38,960
Keeping reading articles where it seems that people are even unaware of the absurdity of

424
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:47,600
translating the personal level description at the level of typically amenable to our approach.

425
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:54,480
So I'm not reducing the impact of neuroscience, actually the opposite.

426
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,040
I mean, I'm a neuroscientist.

427
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,040
That's my job.

428
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,240
I mean, I'm not an art historian.

429
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:09,080
I'm happy to spend time with people like you, but my approach is completely different.

430
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:21,600
What I meant to say is that there is not enough, people are not enough aware that our approach

431
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:29,720
could be a lot more fruitful if we would abandon this kind of neuro hubris leading us to establish

432
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:38,360
a one-to-one map between the words we employ to describe our inner life, our emotion, our

433
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,360
experiences and brain networks.

434
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:46,920
Because such a one-to-one map between words and neurons probably doesn't exist.

435
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:58,400
So the methodological reductionism that became available by the possibility of investigating

436
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:09,320
human nature with the tools of cognitive neuroscience is an invaluable tool enabling us to deconstruct

437
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,960
such words.

438
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:19,200
And for example, showing that many people got it right when they were saying that vision

439
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,600
in a way is a sort of haptic experience.

440
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,200
I'm thinking about Merlot-Ponti, for example.

441
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:35,680
Now with our expensive toys, we can show that Merlot-Ponti was right because indeed all

442
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,640
of our perception in a way is a synesthetic.

443
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:51,040
So it is really becoming hard to find parts of the brain that are unimodal.

444
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,720
Even primary sensory areas, it has been shown.

445
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,720
The visual cortex can be driven by auditory stimuli.

446
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,040
Primary auditory cortex activity can be modulated by visual stimuli.

447
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:15,160
We were the first to show that your somatosensors cortex is activated visually when you see

448
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,280
the tactile experience on someone else's body and the like.

449
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:30,760
So it is really our, our, our, our realistic value of this approach is greatly amplified

450
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:38,240
is if before addressing this empirical question you have a broader picture of the cultural

451
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:44,080
context and you discovered that many people were smarter than you are and gave serious

452
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,640
thought to this issue and came up with very interesting solutions.

453
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:53,280
So I'm not denying the realistic value of cognitive neuroscience, actually the opposite.

454
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:00,640
What I would like to see it employed in a better way than it still is by many of our

455
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,040
colleagues that don't.

456
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,040
That's my point.

457
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:08,400
Let me make a few comments from the psychoanalytic end of things.

458
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:16,320
I was very struck about with what you said about Warburg's interest in the neuron and

459
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:24,040
the transmission of the impulse because that's what Freud was interested also.

460
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:30,200
And when he worked on the project for a scientific psychology, that's essentially what he was

461
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,200
doing.

462
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,680
And what he was trying to do was take his observations which came primarily from observing

463
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:44,880
patients who at the time were diagnosed as hysterics and had all sorts of crazy symptoms

464
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,600
and tried to see how he could explain those symptoms by understanding the function and

465
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:58,440
the energies that moved within neurons via the axon and so on.

466
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:04,280
And he also talked about, therefore, the blocking of the impulse which is eventually

467
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:10,720
what led to the theory of repression which then became the central theory in psychoanalysis

468
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:19,000
because repression is what then defined and led to the notion of a dynamic unconscious

469
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,400
which is, as Freud himself, distinguished it from other unconscious.

470
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:31,120
The dynamic unconscious is what then influenced you in life by running your life a certain

471
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,920
way as opposed to the other way.

472
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:43,040
He also, of course, did do a lot of generalizing and he at times generalized too much.

473
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:51,000
And part of those generalizations were the, and I should also just say, I think, because

474
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:59,880
it's not often recognized that three or four of Freud's major works took, occurred within

475
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,720
a period of two and a half to three years.

476
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:12,280
Neuropsychology of defense studies in hysteria, interpretation of dreams, and the project.

477
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,520
Now he was using some cocaine at the time, but it's a tremendous amount of work that

478
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,600
came out from one brain.

479
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:29,040
But one of the things he did, and because of the time he was working on these and things

480
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,680
were not as complex and complexity wasn't recognized the way it is today, is that he

481
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:41,240
did create some simplifying formula so that you had psychosexual phases of development,

482
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:47,840
you had things like edipal complex which then served to generalize so people had castration

483
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,320
anxieties, people.

484
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:55,760
So it wasn't just on the individual level, but was generalized and then applied to larger

485
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,440
issues.

486
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:05,520
Psychanalysis I think has increasingly, without saying so, moved away from that and it has

487
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:18,720
become a lot more about the careful long-term intense investigation of how one person's

488
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,360
brain mind worked.

489
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:29,880
And in every possible detail that can be made available by the patient in the mental frame

490
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:36,800
of investigating himself or herself on the couch four or five times a week, and that does

491
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,840
give us significant amount of information and what it does give us also is what you were

492
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:53,240
saying is that everybody smiles, everybody dances, everybody says they love, but it's

493
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,400
tremendously different.

494
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,960
And that investigation I think is very important.

495
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,040
When neuroscience became so popular, I mean there wasn't even neuroscience when I was

496
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:13,000
in medical school, we talked about neurophysiology, neurochemistry, neuroscience, but neuroscience

497
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,440
suddenly took off, there was also an overt excitement from the psychoanalytic end and

498
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:24,520
similar things that are being done in neuroscience, putting somebody in an ephemera and saying

499
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:31,720
there is the point of love happened in psychoanalysis by saying this behavior is because of this

500
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,680
part of the brain.

501
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,320
It's inevitable, those kinds of things.

502
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:42,680
But I had a very interesting experience yesterday, I was honored by Christina to be invited

503
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:50,880
to her lab, and I went to her lab and one of the graduate students presented his research

504
00:51:50,880 --> 00:52:00,960
to my mind, I'm not a scientist, it was very carefully done and well presented about an

505
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:07,760
idea which he thought also confirmed Freud's idea, namely what we take for granted that

506
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,160
his childhood experiences influence you later in life.

507
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:19,760
But he did that with rats and showed how the effect of an electric shock and then showed

508
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:27,160
it that what periods it becomes, if you will, a memory that has an impact on future behavior

509
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,040
and at which point it doesn't.

510
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:34,760
But then I was thinking about this and looking from the point of view of psychoanalysis, I

511
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:45,080
was asking myself when a baby has experiences, he doesn't or she doesn't just have one thing

512
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,960
happen, like an electric shock.

513
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:54,080
But has a number of things and that these things interact.

514
00:52:54,080 --> 00:53:00,680
So the electric shock in the baby, hypothetical electric shock, may have an influence on the

515
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:07,120
way he's going to feel about the milk and the way he's going to feel about the milk

516
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,880
is going to influence something else.

517
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:18,720
So that very early on, and the graduate student showed this beautiful slide of synaptic and

518
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:25,840
neuronal development between the ages of six months, two years and four years and it's

519
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,800
incredible the change.

520
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:34,520
It's like you have a handful of neurons and synapses and then you have like a jungle.

521
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:40,880
And so in this process, a lot of things are happening but they are all interacting with

522
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,600
each other.

523
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:49,320
And so I think this is where the fields can come together because you can have, you can

524
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,840
just do that study or you can begin to think of it in a different context, in a larger

525
00:53:54,840 --> 00:54:01,440
way and see and begin to study how those experiences affect each other and what the consequence

526
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,680
of it is, which may then have a connection to how, and this is the subject of this round

527
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,680
table, you do or do not react or appreciate art.

528
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,840
And so since you wrote a paper on this just recently, maybe you should say a few words

529
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,840
about.

530
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,840
Yeah.

531
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:29,920
We decided to start investigating a static experience, not just dealing with the notion

532
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:38,240
that are so heavily culturally determined like the sense of beauty, for example, but

533
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:49,000
we were interested in investigating to which extent when you behold some artwork, particularly

534
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:56,520
we decided with David to start from the most difficult part of this enterprise, namely

535
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:02,560
to see what's going on in the brain body system of a beholder when there's no body to resonate

536
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,840
along with.

537
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:10,400
So we decided to start, not with the figurative art, but with modern abstract art.

538
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:16,840
And the first experiment was done on Luchofontana's cuts.

539
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:23,560
And the second one just came out on the brushstrokes of Franz Klein.

540
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:30,400
And although we employed two different approaches, we employed high density EG.

541
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,240
And in the first study, we just were happy to measure the level of this synchronization

542
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,960
of the motor system of the beholder.

543
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:45,600
So they're watching a static image, a cut by Luchofontana, and a controlled stimulus

544
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:52,440
where the cut is substituted by a black line with the same length and width of the cut.

545
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:59,360
But what is missing is the dynamic aspect of this static image, namely the shade produced

546
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,240
by the cut in the depth of the canvas.

547
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,000
And we never mentioned the word art, beauty, aesthetic experience.

548
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,320
We only said to our volunteers, you're going to see images on the computer screen, please

549
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:20,080
watch them carefully and try not to move as much as you can, because even blinking can

550
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:26,040
introduce artifacts when you record brain activity with this net on the head.

551
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:31,560
And the results were quite interesting and were fully compatible with the hypothesis

552
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:41,480
David and I put forward in 2007, namely that when you see an object, a visual object which

553
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:51,560
is the consequence of someone's hand gesture, the brain of the beholder, so to speak, produces

554
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,880
an embodied simulation of the gesture.

555
00:56:53,880 --> 00:57:02,160
And what you see is the reenactment of that gesture, which is purely simulated because

556
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:09,960
we recorded also the muscle activity of beholders and their muscles were completely silent.

557
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:16,720
But a part of their motor system was, so to speak, reenacting the gesture of a perform

558
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,680
by Lucio Fontana.

559
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:28,360
And of course, we decided to employ Lucio Fontana's artworks, probably a cut done by myself or

560
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:34,680
by Alessandro Milzka, the main author of this paper, would have worked the same.

561
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:42,120
Although I was talking with the curator of the Contemporary Art Museum in Prato, the

562
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:47,680
Pecci Museum, and he was telling me, you can cut a canvas a thousand times, but you will

563
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:54,480
never accomplish the end result, Lucio Fontana's taste.

564
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:02,040
And probably he's right, but nevertheless, and the second study was on the brush strokes

565
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:10,840
of Franz Klein, here we had a more sophisticated approach that enabled us also to locate the

566
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,120
sources of the signal in the brain.

567
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,120
And so we found three components.

568
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:23,560
So our analysis became a little more sophisticated, and you David will be happy to hear this because

569
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:28,680
you left behind the infooloon part of aesthetic experience.

570
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:35,000
You want to know more about the relationship between the brain and the evaluative aspect

571
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,840
of aesthetic judgment.

572
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:43,040
So basically we found three networks, a sensorimotor network which most likely responsible

573
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:52,120
of the enactment of the gesture employed by the artist, so dynamic, so charged with emotion.

574
00:58:52,120 --> 00:59:00,760
Then we found activation in the orbit of frontal cortex, which probably I'm very cautious

575
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:10,640
to establish this relationship because otherwise I would be guilty of the same oversimplified

576
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,440
vision of the brain I was blaming before.

577
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:19,800
But nevertheless, there is some evidence that links the activation of this ventral part

578
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:25,000
of the frontal cortex with rewards.

579
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:34,760
So probably has to do with the joy or the positive feeling induced by the aesthetic

580
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,960
experience.

581
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:42,280
And then we had the third cluster of activation in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, which

582
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:52,240
most likely has something to do with the more detached and evaluative observation of the

583
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,880
artwork.

584
00:59:53,880 --> 01:00:01,880
Then we recently also investigated this relationship between the gesture employed to produce a

585
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:07,760
static graphic sign and what's going on in the bottom system of the beholder.

586
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:17,360
This time we employed handwritten Roman alphabet letters, Chinese ideograms, and scribbles.

587
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:23,400
All three stimuli activate the motor system of the beholder, but they do it with a different

588
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,640
intensity and with a different temporal dynamic.

589
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:35,920
It is as if, and I'm very cautious, this is an hypothesis that has to be verified, it

590
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:44,360
looks as if the motor system of the beholder were unconsciously capable of distinguished

591
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:52,480
symbolic graphic sign which lead to a stronger resonance from the scribbles, which have no

592
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,480
symbolic value.

593
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:04,000
Which brings in a further question, is there any bio-mechanic, primitive shared by all

594
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,640
forms of symbolic written language?

595
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:15,160
This is an open question, no one so far addressed empirically, but these preliminary results

596
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:23,040
seem to raise this as a possibility that can be empirically investigated.

597
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:32,400
So far we focused on this relationship, the immediate relationship between something which

598
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:39,440
is static, but at the same time is very intensively dynamic.

599
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:47,640
And we believe that we discover one component that gives this dynamicity to something which

600
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,640
is static.

601
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:55,640
There is a wonderful decunic at the moment, the blue one, I don't remember the title of

602
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,200
the painting.

603
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:07,200
And every time I see it, I stand in front of it, I feel moved, not only metaphorically,

604
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,760
but physically.

605
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:19,280
And I think we can describe this component of the static experience, we can explain why

606
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:27,000
we are so moved that something that is still but induces a lot of movement.

607
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And this is a possible way.

608
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,000
It's a very good way to say that you didn't mention the world art, static to the students,

609
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
or whatever the issue.

610
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Yeah, when we were measuring their brain activity.

611
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:44,600
So, and were they aware that these were worked?

612
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:50,360
Well indeed, at the end of the experiment, we asked them a lot of questions.

613
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:59,000
You can imagine, we asked them to rate the quantity of dynamicity, of movement, they

614
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,160
could spot in the static images.

615
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,040
We asked them if they saw them before.

616
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:10,760
We asked them if they considered either the original artworks or the control stimuli as

617
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,000
artwork.

618
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And one of the most interesting results of this study is that the same effect could

619
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,400
be detected in all participants, no matter how acquainted they were.

620
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,760
And so why can you speak about the static experience?

621
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:34,720
So how can you speak about the static experience if they are not aware that this is something

622
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,600
link, I mean how do you define aesthetics?

623
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,960
Well, because for them is something.

624
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,320
Well, no, I don't ask him.

625
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:48,320
I have a similar and related question.

626
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:53,400
When you go in front of the ducomic, you say that I feel moved.

627
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,120
So you are aware of something happening.

628
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:08,760
In these experiments you did, were the activations similar, whether the person said at the end

629
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,360
they were moved, they were not?

630
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:20,360
There is all people rated as more moving the original artworks than the control stimuli

631
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:26,040
irrespective from their knowledge, those images to belong to art or not.

632
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:35,480
So there is a tight relationship between the dynamicity of the image recognized by the

633
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:40,680
beholder and the degree of activation of their motor system.

634
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:49,160
Then coming back to your question, of course there is nothing intrinsically aesthetic in

635
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:55,400
a sense in this experiment, although the easiest way to answer your question would be to go

636
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,960
back to the etymology of the world, the eye stasis.

637
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:07,160
So to put it shortly, but I am happy to leave it to David.

638
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:14,640
We never claim that aesthetic experience is the activation of the motor system of mirroring

639
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,600
mechanism period.

640
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:25,080
What we said that our point is that aesthetic experience is a multi-layered enterprise and

641
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:35,440
one key dimension of aesthetic experience beside the socio-cultural context in which it occurs,

642
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,640
the framing effect, blah, blah, blah.

643
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,680
One key ingredient is this embodied ingredient.

644
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:49,880
And this embodied ingredient is present in our relationship with all kinds of images,

645
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:58,000
not necessarily because of their artistic status, which by the way is historically determined.

646
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,280
I was reading a paper in the New York Times about the recent research showing that reading

647
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,560
novels leads you to a more empathic.

648
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:16,360
And they were making a distinction between a highbrow literature and I don't know what

649
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,360
they employed.

650
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:22,840
Fifty shades of gray, this kind of, we call it, Santini.

651
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,200
One of them was a bit more amazing.

652
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:30,400
So and journalist was asking me, what do you make of this distinction?

653
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:37,320
I said, well, one should be very careful because Honore de Balzac, who is now revered as a

654
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:45,160
classic, was publishing some of his Commedio men in newspapers.

655
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:53,280
So all of these notion judgments, evaluation are very much historically determined.

656
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:58,520
Even the very same notion of Bursat is historically determined.

657
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:06,360
That's why the tension between the objective way of looking at it and the subjective is

658
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,880
something which you cannot get rid.

659
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:18,640
I mean, when you talk about art, you cannot avoid feeling this, this tension between art

660
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,080
is made by by the evolution of culture.

661
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,560
Art is, art is not only subjective thing.

662
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:32,840
If you are a subject to be in front of something and you do not recognize it as art, probably

663
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,840
is not art.

664
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,840
I mean, it has to make sense.

665
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:45,480
Yeah, but what we now call art, for example, think about people putting their hands in

666
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,720
cover with pigments on caves.

667
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,560
We call that art.

668
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:55,680
Now, for them, probably had a completely different meaning.

669
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,120
It was religion.

670
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:03,720
It was the possibility to get into a different dimension.

671
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:08,920
Nobody really knows what was the meaning of this practice.

672
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:17,120
But still, I mean, even if you bracket this social, cultural, historical aspect that change

673
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:25,320
a long time, there is something, I think, intimately related to our own human nature,

674
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:32,280
which is a notion that for many decades was considered politically incorrect.

675
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:39,280
Okay, the human being is a construction, like Foucault put it, but this construction is

676
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,680
made of bricks that are always the same.

677
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,680
That's the point.

678
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,880
And cognitive neuroscience can reveal the nature of those.

679
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,880
And that's been widely included.

680
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:56,440
Yes, I think that a word evoked by Ed should be introduced in this conservation that is

681
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,920
inhibition.

682
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,160
I think that also David is working on this notion.

683
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:10,240
Because when Victoria says that our response to images is a sort of motion and emotion

684
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:17,880
response, so there is this idea of a motor reaction, the question is in the aesthetic

685
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:30,400
attitude, where is the threshold between emotion that remains at a possible virtual or quasi-virtual

686
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:35,680
response, reenactment, virtual embodied simulation?

687
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:44,040
And when, for example, in front of some images, very often religious images, we are elicited

688
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,440
to a real response.

689
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:55,720
In Van der Lee's, for example, or in iconoclasm, David here is a specialist of these reactions.

690
01:09:55,720 --> 01:10:03,800
There you have violent responses, and there the motor system responds to images in a very

691
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,600
effective way.

692
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:15,440
Somehow, upholding the idea that the image, as I evoked in my first intervention, is a

693
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:21,400
mediation between the stimulus and the response there in vandalism and iconoclasm.

694
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:29,680
Image seems rather to be a sort of bomb eliciting a very violent reaction.

695
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:37,000
I think that this is important also because I have started a work research comparing some

696
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:54,100
images in which V

697
01:10:54,100 --> 01:11:02,440
Rosa and she is deciding to kill her kids, but she has not already killed them.

698
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:08,920
She is there in the shadow, thinking of the strategy of the decision, but she hasn't

699
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,880
taken the decision definitely yet.

700
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:19,520
Or again, Rembrandt, the cloud use chivalis, a painting, Barbara was very fond of.

701
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:26,400
They had a copy made for the institute and the copy is still hanging there today.

702
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:34,960
The cloud use chivalis is there with the batavians gathered around the sacred table.

703
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:42,080
They are deciding to go against the Romans, the invaders, but they haven't decided it

704
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,160
yet.

705
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:54,960
So what they will do, Freud Moses, in that essay Freud collects opinions from the Kuswissenschaft,

706
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:09,880
from Borkert, from Verflin, and they all stress the fact that Moses is represented by Michelangelo

707
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:13,880
in the very moment preceding the action.

708
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:19,240
Freud describes, and of course he is very interested in the foot and the position of

709
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:22,600
the angle of the foot of the statue.

710
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:27,360
And we know that Barbara was obsessed with feet, the lymphose feet.

711
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:33,880
And if you compare the gradiva foot, you find that this gradiva foot is very similar

712
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:40,840
to the Moses one, almost 90 degrees.

713
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:49,760
So this is Lesting's Lao-Kon, this is the pregnant moment before the decision.

714
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:56,440
And this elicits, I think, a very interesting kind of empathy in the beholder that I would

715
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:04,440
call the egetic, core narrative empathy, because your imagination starts working there.

716
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:11,440
And you start asking yourself, what is it going to do?

717
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:17,400
Is it going to slash his brother and all the rave party around the golden calf, or deciding

718
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,400
something else?

719
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:26,880
We know the story, of course, from the early text, but we can also imagine possible different

720
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,360
options.

721
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:33,800
And this is a saturation of narrative into a single image.

722
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:42,440
It is an image of inhibition, it is an image of self-control, it is an image of the sofros

723
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:49,480
uni again, of Bezon and Knight, of caution, of pre-decision, which is, I think, could

724
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:57,960
be quite interesting to investigate even in the perspective of visual and motor systems.

725
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:07,360
I'm hesitant to talk because it is not in direct response to what you said, but I do

726
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,160
want to pick up some of the themes that have come up.

727
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:14,600
One of this idea, as you said, very early influences.

728
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,360
Well, the influences actually go quite early.

729
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:24,560
There is evidence, for example, that what a mother ingests and that their trimester has

730
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,600
an influence on the taste that the child would later have.

731
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,920
And taste is an evaluative judgment, it is a preference.

732
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:41,320
So these influences go very early, even before people are born.

733
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:47,000
The question of this relationship between the individual experience and what can be generalized

734
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,440
or how do we deal with that?

735
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:55,920
There have been two strategies in cognitive neuroscience.

736
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:02,040
And one, I think, in part, you alluded to, which was Freud's Roots, which came out of

737
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:09,960
Charco's clinic, and that there is a long history of careful observations of individual

738
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:16,840
patients and trying to make inferences of how systems work on the basis of the systematic

739
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:21,320
way in which brain damage produces consequences.

740
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:25,720
And I would take one minor exception to what Vittorio said, which is, I do not think cognitive

741
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,760
neuroscience is a method.

742
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:35,240
I think imaging has largely overwhelmed the public imagination of cognitive neuroscience,

743
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:43,040
but it is fundamentally asking questions about what the brain basis for behavior is.

744
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:49,840
And this goes back to the same intellectual climate that Freud was working on, that Warburg

745
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,440
stepped into.

746
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,360
You can take it back to Broca, Vernicki, Licktime, Lissar, Leepmann.

747
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:02,200
These are the people that set out the agenda and the framework that we're still dealing

748
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,280
with.

749
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:10,360
And so part of what got me interested in neurosthetics was from the observation that when patients

750
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:16,040
have brain damage, some patients that are artists, that they continue to produce art,

751
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:21,720
and their art is actually, this is the exception, not the rule, but their art is actually better

752
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:25,200
or received as better than what it was before.

753
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:31,040
This is the only major cognitive system where that observation has been made.

754
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:35,640
There are sensory phenomenon in which that observation has been made, but if you talk

755
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:42,960
about language, if you talk about any complex phenomenon, this kind of paradoxical facilitation

756
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:47,680
in the setting of brain damage is something that has only really been reported in art.

757
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,480
And that's telling us something important.

758
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:58,760
It's telling us something important about the biologic infrastructure that is in the context

759
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,040
of producing art is sufficiently flexible.

760
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:08,720
And one thing that these sort of detailed examinations of single cases I think can really be illuminating

761
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:13,880
in a way that you, as you were suggesting, that Freud did you take individual patients

762
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:19,320
and then you try to generalize from that in a way that analysis can only be done on individuals

763
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:24,200
because as soon as you take a group, you're washing away what is most interesting about

764
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,360
that behavior.

765
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:31,080
The second strategy that I think Vittoria alluded to, which is that in cognitive neuroscience,

766
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:34,080
there has been an interest in individual differences.

767
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:40,160
And I'll give you an example of art study we did which has been presented in abstract

768
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:46,360
form but not written up, which is there's a fundamental question of if you say, do you

769
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:53,280
like a Rothko painting or do you like Hopper that there is nothing inherently correct about

770
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,080
which answer you give, right?

771
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,760
This is an individual difference thing.

772
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:01,720
Some people like abstract art, some people like representational art, some people like

773
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:05,640
historic art, some people like contemporary art, so on and so forth.

774
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:10,280
So when you're dealing with that kind of massive variability, how do you approach this as a

775
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,440
scientist?

776
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:19,080
And what we did was, and this was with a group of schizophrenics and people with schizophrenia

777
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:26,040
as well as people with the normal controls, and basically did the kind of experiment where

778
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:31,000
people are shown pairs of paintings and they say which is better, which you like more,

779
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
right?

780
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
And you go through a whole series of these, and we also had these rather than evaluative

781
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:43,440
components, descriptive components where you say which painting is, has warmer hues versus

782
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,600
cooler hues and things like that.

783
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:54,040
So the trick here is that the assumption is that if you're looking at preference, which

784
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,000
is variable, it's still showing that you're looking at the difference.

785
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,160
So this should be the case that if someone prefers A over B and B over C, they should

786
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,200
prefer A over C, right?

787
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:06,960
Whatever your intro metric is, which may be different, it needs to be consistent.

788
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:13,040
And so the question for us was then, using people's individual differences allows us

789
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:18,400
to give an access of what people's consistency are, so then the question becomes consistency.

790
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:25,200
And what we are able to show is that in this group of schizophrenic individuals that as

791
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:32,640
a group to things, they're less consistent than people without schizophrenia.

792
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:37,440
They are less consistent in the evaluative judgment, which is this preference as compared

793
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,960
to the descriptive judgment.

794
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,440
So it's not that they're just inconsistent, they'll say whatever they want, it's specifically

795
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,480
about their preference.

796
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:50,160
And then the other interesting thing is if you look across the people with schizophrenia,

797
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,840
of course it's not that they're all bad, that there's some variability, and then you

798
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,440
leverage that variability.

799
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:07,160
And what we find is that the greater the variability in people's preferences judgment correlates

800
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:10,000
with how they also describe their hedonic experiences.

801
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,480
So you give them other kinds of questionnaires, and so it turns out that people who have a

802
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:21,960
kind of what has been referred in the literature as anticipatory pleasure, the pleasure of

803
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:28,800
anticipating what might happen, that people who had decreased anticipatory pleasure were

804
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,560
also the ones that were the most variable.

805
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:38,920
So now you take that back to the biology, it turns out that models of anticipatory pleasure

806
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,400
seem to really rely on dopamine.

807
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:48,360
Dopamine is at least an important system that seems to be abnormal in people with schizophrenia.

808
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,800
And what we don't know from this is whether this has to do with the medications they're

809
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,440
on or something inherent about the biology of their disease.

810
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,320
So that remains unknown.

811
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:02,480
But I offer this as a suggestion how you can use, you can actually leverage the variability

812
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:10,080
of the individual responses to honor the individual response and at the same time try to get a

813
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,520
generalizing principle out of it.

814
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:20,840
Yeah, I think most of us would probably agree that dopamine plays a role in aesthetic pleasure.

815
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:24,800
But I want to go back, I mean these are really interesting historians, I want to go back to

816
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:34,240
the discussion we were having earlier, partly raised by Victoria and then affirmed by Andrea.

817
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:39,560
And this is a discussion which brings together Freudian views of inhibition, Freudian views

818
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:45,080
of culture, the work of the neurosciences, but it's all a meeting I think in all our

819
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:50,760
discussions we are meeting one very significant issue which I'm going to come to in a moment.

820
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:58,400
I think the issue is slightly vitiated by these statements, slightly apodictic statements

821
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:02,000
that people make, you made it, there's quite a lot, art is.

822
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,080
I think we should probably just relinquish any kind of declaration about what art is.

823
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,240
Because we kind of know now that we don't know what art is.

824
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:17,080
I mean you go to any art gallery and you, art may just be what people pay the most money

825
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,640
for, we don't know.

826
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:24,920
So this whole issue was brought home to me with some force, I remember Chris Wood said

827
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:31,440
he may have been drinking a bit much that evening, but he said exasperatedly to me after I gave

828
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:36,480
a lecture about the sort of motor dimension of aesthetic response which Victoria described

829
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,880
very accurately, he said oh, why don't you realize that all art is irony?

830
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:46,800
I mean he was being kind of epigromatic that evening and I was very exasperated by this,

831
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:52,160
but he raised a very important issue which is I don't think all art is irony, but consistently

832
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:56,200
with this view that I don't think we should say what art is or not.

833
01:22:56,200 --> 01:23:01,880
But you know we talk about aesthetic appreciation, aesthetic evaluation, aesthetic enjoyment,

834
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:12,240
I just did that, but what really lies at the bottom of all of this, as Kant wrote, is aesthetic

835
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,720
judgement.

836
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:17,320
I mean we can talk a bit about aesthetic pleasure and aesthetic, you know how our feelings are

837
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:24,520
affected, but what is moot is not what art is, but what is that moment in which, you

838
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:28,160
know what happens at that moment when we make an aesthetic judgement.

839
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:37,240
And that moment must surely be a moment of a certain kind of removal, of reclaiming of

840
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:42,040
the self against involvement with the work of art.

841
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:46,400
And this seems to me our sense of absorption in the work of art to use, you know here's

842
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:53,400
Michael Friedkaring on for years about absorption's role in our aesthetic responses.

843
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:59,920
What really we need now to do, and I think, I'm trying to convince Victoria to do an experiment

844
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:07,400
with me on precisely what removes the self from its empathetic engagement with the work.

845
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:14,360
What happens then as it were, you know what exactly do we mean when we talk about inhibition,

846
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:18,520
what's happening in the brain, you know there are various candidates for the inhibitory

847
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,520
factor.

848
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:25,040
And I somehow think it's somewhat down in Basil Ganglia, he says no it's much forward

849
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,680
in prefrontal cortex.

850
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:34,120
So here is a real issue which can be discussed which will get us back to what seems to me,

851
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:40,480
you know at least a clear framing of the question, which is the framing in terms of the moment

852
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:47,640
in which we realize we are not in the object, but we are sufficiently detached to make a

853
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:48,640
judgement.

854
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:56,320
And this is Andrea and Varburg's notion of Dankham in which you have the space for contemplation

855
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:03,600
and you have a sense of the realization of who you are as a judging self.

856
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,440
So that's a project that you know we've got to get on with as it were.

857
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,440
Yeah.

858
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:09,440
I can comment on that.

859
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:15,920
So again going back to individual classes and this notion of inhibition of movements

860
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:20,040
in a way that might seem agentic.

861
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:25,680
So there's a classic relatively rare but classic neurologic syndrome called the Alien Hand

862
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:26,920
Syndrome.

863
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:35,880
And this is one in which we've done one of the few experimental studies of such a patient.

864
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,080
So let me just describe it for people who are not aware of this.

865
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:45,880
This is a situation where someone's hand, it's typically on one side, seems to be

866
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:53,640
to perform behaviors that seem complex but over which they have no control.

867
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:59,720
And so the particular man that we studied about seven or eight years ago, I mean he would

868
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:03,360
come in and he'd sit down and he'd sit down on his hand because he didn't want his hand

869
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,040
doing things that he had no control over.

870
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:10,960
These kinds of, or he'd grab a magazine or a cup and hold this because as long as his

871
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,360
hand was occupied it wouldn't do things.

872
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:20,760
But what are the kinds of things it does is that it will, he'll walk by a light switch

873
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:24,560
and his hand will reach up and start doing this turning on and off on and off on and

874
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,080
off the lights.

875
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:32,680
And there are a variety of these kinds of behaviors and what we, and his lesion, just

876
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:38,200
so you know the part of his brain that was damaged is the medial part of the frontal

877
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,200
lobe, right?

878
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:43,880
The classic location for this kind of phenomenon.

879
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:51,400
What we were able to show is the conditions in which this happens are two.

880
01:26:51,400 --> 01:27:01,680
One is that the control over affordances that most of us normally have, he didn't have.

881
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:02,840
And what do I mean by that?

882
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:11,520
Which is if you see a cup with a handle there is a kind of affordance that makes you want

883
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,880
to grasp it, right?

884
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:18,920
And it's likely that the mirror neuron system is in fact involved in that kind of experience.

885
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,080
Most of us can choose to do this or not.

886
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:27,320
And it should be clear that most of us, our motor systems operate below consciousness most

887
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,480
of the time, right?

888
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:32,160
Where usually you think about every time you drive to work or you walk to work you are

889
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,080
not really aware of all the little decisions you're making.

890
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:40,720
We largely respond to things in the environment with our motor systems and that's what this

891
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:47,760
person was doing but unlike the rest of us is not able to control it.

892
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,480
The second piece of this is he was exquisitely aware of this.

893
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:55,320
So if you have damage bilaterally you get something called utilization behavior where

894
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:58,840
people do this but they're completely apathetic about it.

895
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:04,520
So he had this monitoring system over his own motor behavior.

896
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:09,800
At the same time he didn't have control over one side and then this creates this sense

897
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:14,880
that this limb is doing something of which he has no control over, right?

898
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,040
It's completely responsive to the environment.

899
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:21,920
And so it's a kind of a problem within ambition.

900
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,040
At the same time there's awareness you have to have both of those things simultaneously

901
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:29,200
to have this kind of phenomenon.

902
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:36,520
I think even though I know we can talk a lot more about this it's time to go for question

903
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:37,840
and answers.

904
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:44,440
So anybody who has a question has to walk up to the microphone there and ask questions.

905
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:47,640
Peter, there are two papers.

906
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:50,640
Siri you want to ask?

907
01:28:50,640 --> 01:29:06,600
Most of the discussion this morning has been on the tension between generalization and

908
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:14,600
you begin with that and the particular case and your characterization of psychoanalysis.

909
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,920
It's a single case and what do you have?

910
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,160
So I'd like to say.

911
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:29,000
I practice analysis in Los Angeles and I've analyzed Chinese and Japanese and Latino,

912
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:38,920
I have a Latino, young lady, Iranians and so on and you get a picture of the culture.

913
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:47,640
And with that I want to say with Abi Barbour today when we're getting to a man embedded

914
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:55,280
in the German-Jewish elite of Hamburg, major banking firm that you all know branches in

915
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,440
New York and so on.

916
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:06,320
And he suffered and consciously from anti-Semitism.

917
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:16,880
He was a soldier in the German army prior to World War I and was unable to get promoted

918
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,080
to reserve office here.

919
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,360
He was a very symbolic, full of prestige.

920
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:29,760
Much's labor wrote a brilliant critical piece on the position of the German reserve

921
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:38,080
office here and he writes to his mother also as he's a student in Strasbourg.

922
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:49,000
How he hears other students and people in pubs issuing anti-Semitic remarks.

923
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,720
And he's very aware he's unhappy about it.

924
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:59,280
He calls it motion, which is an imitation of Yiddish.

925
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:08,360
Now, that's not all.

926
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:17,280
There is a huge, very significant Cartai, it's Cartai 61 in the archive, the Barbour

927
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:25,000
archive, and it is his collection, his method of working was to collect clippings from the

928
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:32,000
days newspapers of things that interested him and there are large collection of clippings

929
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:42,000
about the ritual murder myth in Eastern Europe, in Kiev, the Bayless case, in Konev, in East

930
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Prussia.

931
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:49,920
You know, he collected these and this was the raw, savage underside of European culture

932
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:53,280
they was very aware of.

933
01:31:53,280 --> 01:32:01,440
And it's significant that the breakdown, the psychotic breakdown came in November 1918.

934
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,840
Now that's not a random date.

935
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:07,320
That's the date of the collapse of the Wilhelmian Empire.

936
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:13,840
And it's a date where his peer and friend Albert Balene, whose name you might know,

937
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:20,800
the Hamburg America line, the Hamburg-Ost-Africa line, the Hamburg-Ost-Oggian line, these were

938
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:28,440
all creatures of, he was the CEO of this Empire of sea power in Germany.

939
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:32,280
He suicided in November 1918.

940
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:37,960
And that's where he had his psychic collapse.

941
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:43,520
And we look for, in psychoanalysis, the specificity.

942
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,760
Why on that date?

943
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,360
And what's the specificity of the delusions?

944
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:53,640
And the delusions were murder and blood poisoning.

945
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:58,400
He tells Benzwanger, you're feeding me human blood.

946
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:03,400
I'm not going to eat this meal.

947
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:11,920
I suggest to you that what you really want to know out of psychoanalysis is the culture

948
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,120
that he comes from.

949
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:20,240
And he and his brother, there was an event in the middle of World War I in 1916.

950
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:27,480
It's called the Yudin Seilung, where the Prussian general staff ordered a census of all the Jews

951
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,680
in the German military.

952
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:37,240
Now nothing like that took place on the Italian army, the French army, British army.

953
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:45,520
But they were with a purpose of derogating and deprecating the Jews, trying to show they

954
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,160
weren't doing their part.

955
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:52,640
And fact is that after this census, the results were suppressed.

956
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:59,520
They were never published until Franz Josef Strauss in the Boletus Republique was the

957
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:05,480
foreign strike, that defense minister, and he published the results because the contribution

958
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:08,720
of Jews had been magnificent to World War I.

959
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:12,560
So this is the world he comes from.

960
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:21,480
And when he sees murders and so on, he saw them and he collected data on them, extensive

961
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:30,520
data on German anti-Semitism, on European primitive hatred of the Jews.

962
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:33,720
And I suggest it comes back in the psychosis.

963
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:43,080
That's an intro to your panel tomorrow I think.

964
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:48,040
This is quicker and it's about lesions and it relates to something David said and to

965
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:53,040
what you said, which is individual differences and lesions.

966
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:58,120
So even in alien hand syndrome, you can get someone unbuttoning a shirt.

967
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:04,600
But also the famous case that I've forgotten the neurologist name of the self-strangling.

968
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:10,360
And also amygdala lesions do not produce identical results by the way.

969
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:12,480
They're a huge variation.

970
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:16,440
So I wanted to just pick that up about individual differences.

971
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:23,960
Is there a question of content, individual psychic content in something like say self-strangling

972
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,760
in alien hand syndrome?

973
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,920
Maybe two comments about that.

974
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:29,920
And thanks for the question.

975
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:36,440
So one thing it turns out that an alien hand syndrome is that the repertoire of behaviors

976
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,280
are fairly restricted.

977
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:42,320
There are certain grasping behaviors, there are repetitive behaviors.

978
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:49,400
They're actually the kinds of things not unlike what you see when people have motor seizures

979
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:56,280
and what healing Jackson talked about as this sort of grammar of movements where you have

980
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:59,560
these elements that are built on.

981
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:06,760
What we argued in this paper is that what you see in alien hand syndrome are concatenations

982
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:13,000
of these motor primitives and that you would never ever have the situation where someone's

983
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,640
alien hand would, for example, write a poem.

984
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,840
That could never happen on this model.

985
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:24,920
Whereas if you really think of this as there's an alien being on the divided self, that the

986
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:30,200
divided self would actually perform some intentional goal directed behavior, it turns out that

987
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,600
that's probably not the case.

988
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:38,000
The individual differences in terms of the consequences of brain damage is extraordinarily

989
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,440
interesting and the biology of that we don't really know very much.

990
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:49,960
So it is the case that often what you will read in the literature are these sentinel cases.

991
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:53,960
But if you see a lot of the patients, what you are struck by is that the same kind of

992
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:59,800
damage that produces vernicus ephasia that was so instrumental and important in thinking

993
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:04,160
of how language is organized in the brain is not what happens in everybody.

994
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:08,560
And not only that, what happens six months down the road is highly variable in terms

995
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,320
of how people recover.

996
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,600
Now what's the biology of that?

997
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,840
Why is it that some people do better initially?

998
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,320
Why is it that some people do better down the road?

999
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:22,120
There are some ideas around it.

1000
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,560
There are certain genetic predispositions.

1001
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:31,400
For example, people better homozygous for apo-e-elleals that is a predisposing factor

1002
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,920
for Alzheimer's disease.

1003
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:41,120
It looks like that might have been more generalizable to how the brain responds to injury.

1004
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:48,480
But what the mechanisms around that are not known, it may be a wiring issue, which is

1005
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:55,720
where if we took everybody in this room that is over the age of 50 and got high resolution

1006
01:37:55,720 --> 01:38:00,880
MRI scans, the amount of white matter abnormalities, assuming everybody in here is normal, is

1007
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:04,040
going to be highly variable.

1008
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:12,440
And so the consequences of that, of this kind of subclinical low level, and I hesitate to

1009
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:16,680
use the word damage because it's not expressed in any way, it might have consequences for

1010
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:17,680
recovery.

1011
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:24,320
And the individual differences in organization at that level, which is increases as you get

1012
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,320
older.

1013
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:30,840
So as Vittoria said, if you're doing 20-year-old college students, you've already filtered

1014
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:34,400
this to a very narrow segment, right?

1015
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:39,640
But I think those are exactly the kinds of questions a biologist needs to ask and try

1016
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:40,640
to address.

1017
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:47,640
Just walk through the microphone.

1018
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,640
Okay, sure.

1019
01:38:50,640 --> 01:39:04,000
Professor Galese's correlation of the motor system and Lucio Fontana and Franz Klein,

1020
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,840
I'm an art historian and a psychoanalyst and I've worked with a lot of artists.

1021
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:16,560
I've thought a lot about Ernst-Chris's image magic, the idea that an artist is trying

1022
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,000
to create life in the work.

1023
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:26,600
And I worked on Giacometti and Louise Nevelson and both of them, and I think many other artists

1024
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:33,280
and many of the artists I've worked with, are aiming in some way, consciously or preconsciously,

1025
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,840
to create a sense of life.

1026
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:38,720
And that is the dynamic quality.

1027
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:45,400
Looking at artwork that succeeds in doing that, even if it's the pregnant moment before

1028
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:51,920
the action, there is a sense for an artist who is aiming to make that work that he or

1029
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:57,640
she is trying to do something with what Louise Nevelson called livingness.

1030
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:03,120
I think artists have different ways of describing it, but it seems very related to the correlations

1031
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:07,120
that you are finding in the work that you're doing.

1032
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:08,120
Thank you.

1033
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,120
Pierre.

1034
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:18,600
So I would like to make a comment on what Bitoro said and I fully agree with you with

1035
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:27,080
the current trend of cognitive neuroscience and the reductionistic, let's call it, you

1036
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:42,240
know, consequences of being subject to considerable pressure by journals to come up with papers

1037
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:49,320
that have a large N, a number of subjects that you can make statistics on.

1038
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:51,560
And you know, I'm an experimental neurobiologist.

1039
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:55,680
I also like you try to publish in the good journals and we all play that game.

1040
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:04,240
But the issue is that it looks like we may need and just, you know, comes out of this

1041
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:13,640
discussion and thinking, you know, a forum where this vicious cycle in a way which, you

1042
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:23,480
know, you are forced in a way to have a large and erased individual differences or try to

1043
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:32,400
focus on the data that show more consistency across individuals to be able to publish in

1044
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,240
the best journals.

1045
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,720
And okay, you probably provide useful information.

1046
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,360
I don't say that this is not useful.

1047
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,360
So I fully agree with you.

1048
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,400
We are part of the game and we'll do it.

1049
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:45,480
But on the other hand, it's very impoverishing.

1050
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:49,800
We lose a lot of information like this.

1051
01:41:49,800 --> 01:42:01,920
And so I think, you know, let's think about how to push this, the value of individual observations

1052
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:08,360
and provide a forum for this in a way that is, of course, scientifically sound.

1053
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:12,600
It's not just to, you know, decrease the quality of the studies.

1054
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:13,600
Quite the contrary.

1055
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:20,840
But the tools, the expensive toys that you're talking about can be used much with a much

1056
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:30,680
more incisiveness if we were able to provide the right framework for an rigor for studies

1057
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:33,120
of individuality.

1058
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:36,400
I think it's an excellent idea.

1059
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:41,360
And if I know you enough, it will.

1060
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,920
We should expect some development.

1061
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:43,920
Yeah, let's think about it.

1062
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,280
I think you're definitely right.

1063
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:54,560
And I'm very sympathetic with the onion because I think we share a strong background in clinical

1064
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,200
neuropsychology.

1065
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:01,560
Because when people nowadays think about cognitive neuroscience, I'm speaking specifically of

1066
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:04,160
cognitive neuroscience.

1067
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:13,640
Most people think about the defensive toys we were discussing before, neglecting the

1068
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:18,440
fact that one of the most historically speaking, but also nowadays, although it's getting more

1069
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:24,280
and more difficult to publish single cases, almost impossible.

1070
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:30,360
We learned a lot about the relationship between brain behavior and cognition by studying single

1071
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,240
patients.

1072
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:43,760
And I think it's really a sad thing that the enormous pressure we all receive, in a sense,

1073
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,920
living in Italy is a privilege.

1074
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:49,920
You can take a lot more risk because nobody cares what you do.

1075
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,680
It's interesting.

1076
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:56,800
I'm trying how to see the positive aspect of that.

1077
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:02,880
But in other countries where there's a lot of attention about what you produce, so the

1078
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:10,440
emphasis is more and more on quantity, sometimes at the expense of, I mean, I'm not disputing

1079
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:16,720
that all of these people have enormous technical quality.

1080
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,960
What gets lost is why are we doing this?

1081
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:21,960
Why are we publishing?

1082
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,120
No, that's why they want to make the brain.

1083
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:30,840
But I think cognitive neuroscience and all that, what has been published in those circles

1084
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:36,640
and with that kind of philosophy, I think it's very useful and brought a lot of knowledge

1085
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:39,640
to how brain works.

1086
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:43,040
I think we understand it's a major progress, so I'm not disputing this.

1087
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,840
But I think we are losing a lot of information.

1088
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,080
And that's a pity.

1089
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:51,320
Well, it's interesting because we had Professor Andrea Califano here.

1090
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:55,480
And he's at Columbia and he's a microbiologist and studies cancer.

1091
01:44:55,480 --> 01:45:00,960
What seems to be happening more and more in cancer study is studies of N of 1.

1092
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,960
Okay, interesting.

1093
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,200
Which would be great if it happened in R.P.

1094
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:07,520
I mean, I can give you an example.

1095
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,960
I do a Professor's rounds at a rehabilitation hospital in Philadelphia.

1096
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:16,600
And last week, the case that was presented to me turned out to be incredibly fascinating

1097
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:21,000
and it relates to something that you were saying, which is this is a guy who was alexic,

1098
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,680
couldn't read, but had a very specific kind of alexia that I have not seen in the last

1099
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:31,800
30 years, which is he had difficulty identifying individual letters.

1100
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:33,480
But that has been observed.

1101
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:38,560
But what's different about him is that he could identify without any difficulty individual

1102
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,560
numbers.

1103
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:43,360
So the graphemic complexity of numbers and letters are exactly the same.

1104
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,360
He can see numbers.

1105
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:46,280
He can't identify letters.

1106
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:51,320
My first thought is we need to bring him in the lab and really study this and sort out

1107
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:56,840
what's happening at that level of visual processing in relation to these symbolic forms, which

1108
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:00,880
are letters and numbers, which have no inherent meaning other than our associations and how

1109
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,280
is this even possible.

1110
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,920
But no takers.

1111
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:11,200
None of my postdocs are all involved in programmatic research.

1112
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:14,520
And these cases require a lot of work because you have to really think through.

1113
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:17,920
You can't just set it in motion.

1114
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:23,040
But this is the kind of thing that I think because, again, our funding mechanisms that

1115
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:37,200
it is not and publishing constraints, I mean, these sorts of little unique NF1 studies that

1116
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:40,360
really have the potential to teach you something important.

1117
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:43,000
We're just letting them slip through our fingers.

1118
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:47,640
Okay, I think we need to stop because we have one more question.

1119
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:51,360
And then we will stop because we have another, we have Professor D.D.

1120
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,400
Woberman who is going to, is it right?

1121
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:54,800
No, he's not right.

1122
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:55,800
You're not the right?

1123
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:56,800
Yes, he's there.

1124
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:01,800
I thought I saw him.

1125
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:02,800
Yeah.

1126
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,000
So Christina, did you have a question also?

1127
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,480
I wanted a comment.

1128
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:10,600
Okay, right after this one comment from Christina and then we'll move on.

1129
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:12,960
Okay, thank you, let me introduce myself.

1130
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:16,200
My name is Lisa Farber and I'm an art historian.

1131
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:19,160
I'm the former student of Tom Kaufman.

1132
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:21,680
So that's probably why I'm here.

1133
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:23,080
I've heard your discussion.

1134
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:25,480
Please forgive me, I have to use my notes.

1135
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:33,000
Dr. Glazie was talking about the evaluation of immediate human sort of responses to visual

1136
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,520
images and that these responses were in some way consistent.

1137
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:43,520
And then you were all speaking about the relationship between neuroscience and the evaluation and

1138
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,640
reception of images.

1139
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:50,880
And there was one comment about the possible influence of early life experiences like mother's

1140
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:55,920
milk, you know, on the aesthetic taste later in life.

1141
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:01,400
I would like to know if the scientists here have really thought about the part of the

1142
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:10,440
brain that affects human memory and how that is a determining factor in people's responses

1143
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,960
to images.

1144
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:18,600
I would also like to suggest and I've studied Roboc naturally because I worked at Princeton

1145
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:24,840
and Tom Kaufman as a student of the Roboc Institute.

1146
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:31,200
I would also like to suggest that human memory shapes responses to images and that in viewing

1147
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:38,200
a work of art, it may be precisely that moment that David Freberg mentioned, the moment when

1148
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:43,720
the immediate physical response stops and then your memory kicks in, you relate what

1149
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:49,000
you're seeing to what you already know and that determines your human response.

1150
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:56,240
Anyway, I think that Roboc was interested in the gestures and the motifs that let's say

1151
01:48:56,240 --> 01:49:02,760
Batacelli was using from ancient works of art and how that influenced the reception of

1152
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:06,200
his painting in the 15th century.

1153
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:11,480
And then also he was thinking about the images of Albrecht Dürer and how the reception in

1154
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:19,920
Germany in the early 20th century was in part affected by people's familiarity, people's

1155
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:23,120
memory of those images.

1156
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:28,320
So I think that human memory is something that I haven't really heard discussed here

1157
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:34,080
very much and is there a part of the brain that you could measure because I think that

1158
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:40,880
some of the art historians here perhaps David Freberg or Christopher Wood or Andrea Beyer

1159
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:48,720
or perhaps myself, we have a slightly different visual memory or ability to memorize images,

1160
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:55,160
or call things and so that may determine why we become art historians and also how the

1161
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:58,560
regular population understands images.

1162
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:02,840
The next comment was made from Christian, I was a memory expert.

1163
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:05,280
By the way, we have a session on memory, right?

1164
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:09,440
No, actually my comment was not about that but we're going to have a discussion tomorrow.

1165
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,440
Yeah.

1166
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:18,040
I know all dedicated discussion to memory and art and emotions and all those connections.

1167
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:23,360
My comment was actually about what Pierre was saying and all the discussion that was

1168
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:33,240
going on and I think I hope this is not trivial but I want to make sure that we are distinguishing

1169
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:35,640
two different levels of analysis.

1170
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:39,920
One is the group analysis to understand the general principles and this is where we started

1171
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:45,120
because we know basically nothing when we started in many fields and so that has to

1172
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:46,120
be done.

1173
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:54,440
That would be an individual analysis and then another level equally important is the individual

1174
01:50:54,440 --> 01:51:01,360
analysis but that we need to find the way to do that scientifically in a very solid way.

1175
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:08,560
So what are the controls and that it has now been developing more and more clearly.

1176
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:15,160
Even in the animal studies, there are the group studies as well now the individual differences

1177
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:17,600
coming out of the group analysis.

1178
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:21,720
So I don't think it's a matter of selecting which paper is going to be published.

1179
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:25,720
I hope that's not what we're doing.

1180
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:32,200
I think those are two different levels that needs equally both to be understood and scientifically,

1181
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:33,200
solidly.

1182
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:34,840
Thank you.

1183
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:40,000
So we'll have about a 10 minute break and then Professor Hoberman will give his paper

1184
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:47,000
and then we'll stop for lunch and we resume at what time Rob?

1185
01:51:47,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Two o'clock.

1186
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Thank you for sending that to me by the way.
