1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
We're going to start the meeting.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,840
Francois, sir, may we introduce the participants of this roundtable.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,000
So if you would please sit down and we can get going.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:33,400
Okay, I have to present this roundtable about Nemo Sin, the roundtable about memory and unconscious.

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,720
The definition and the different limits between the question of unconscious and the question

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,080
of memory.

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:49,320
In this roundtable, there are people that I know very well like Kristina Alberini, who

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:59,320
is professor of neuroscience at NIU here in New York, and working about reconciliation.

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,880
We are collaborating with Guillermo Gistretti and I with Kristina Alberini about the question.

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,800
I have to present also Siri Housvet.

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:16,040
I can say what little world about you because everybody knows your books and reading your

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
books.

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:25,720
I remember that Pierre said that in one of your books, you said that reconciliation is something

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,400
like aprecur.

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:37,560
And he asked me what I was thinking about the relation between reconciliation and aprecur.

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,160
I said no, I don't agree.

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:47,320
And after I said yes, that you were right, that I am very happy to see you and perhaps

18
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,280
to discuss after with you about the notion of aprecur.

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,280
And he is also Joseph Sledou.

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,640
Joseph Sledou is well known for all the work about emotional memory and this famous book

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,760
for me too was very important, the emotional brain and all the works that were about traumatic

22
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:17,360
experience and memory and different emotional memory, emotional center of memory.

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:28,640
And also Kristo Fargenson, who I discover here and he is professor of Spanish early

24
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,680
modern literature at UCLA.

25
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,640
And Pierre Magistetti, that I know well, but I don't know how to present you.

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:47,200
We are working about neuroscience and psychoanalysis, but you are specialized in the energetic

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:56,200
of the brain and astrocytes and he is a famous neuroscientist and president now of the Ebro,

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,560
international brain research organization.

29
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:10,400
And we are together in Agalma Foundation in relation with the Elic Center discussing about

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,960
Vahburg and now it's time for the wrong table.

31
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,800
Thank you.

32
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:29,160
So I wanted to begin by following a thread that was thankfully begun in the last session

33
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,560
and it has to do with method and memory, the topic of our session.

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:47,640
The idea really is whether or not after he comes out of Kojtlingen, he produces or cultivates

35
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:55,200
what he calls in a letter to Binswanger discussing the Cesseteses, discussing the 1920s A on German

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:03,560
astrology, what Vahburg terms historical psychology and how Vahburg's own projects in the last

37
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,760
five years fit in with this historical psychology.

38
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:16,360
He says in this wonderful volume that David Aes, D'Amilly co-edits in a Vahburg rights

39
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,240
in an autobiographical sketch.

40
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:31,560
This is therefore in 1924 after Kojtlingen's diagnosis of manic depression has, as a word

41
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:38,920
is being now applied and therefore Vahburg is on his way to healing and he's looking forward

42
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,720
to going back to Hamburg and he's writing an autobiographical sketch and he recalls a

43
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,960
time when he was six years old and suffered a mild, what he calls a mild, of typhoid

44
00:04:48,960 --> 00:05:00,920
fever and he says at that time began the fear of quoting, disproportional, context less,

45
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,880
context less or without a context, memories of images.

46
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,640
So my question is how does he, with the Bilda Atlas, name wasune Bilda Atlas, it has many

47
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,320
titles, Vahburg could never settle on a particular title, how does he, with this constellation

48
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:30,240
of images, there were about a thousand images, 63 or 72 different Tothan panels, screens,

49
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:38,080
screen memories perhaps even, how does he come up with a new method by which he can

50
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:47,840
oscillate between the immediate demonic sensual, these are all words that Vahburg uses and

51
00:05:47,840 --> 00:06:04,160
the ecstatic prudential, wise, calm, mediated pole, or I mean he literally talks about

52
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:14,280
swinging between both poles, now the Atlas is, as we have it, largely wordless and it

53
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,640
is based on a method that is frequently diagrammatic, if we look at his notebooks, if we look at

54
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:27,440
the Zetto Kesten, he's not able to write it out anymore, he's not able, he was never,

55
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:35,360
he always had difficulty as Gombrick and others have noted with polished academic prose, instead

56
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:45,440
he condenses, he uses the word fadictus, his ideas, and he condenses them so dramatically

57
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:58,120
in the non-verbal Atlas that the de-demonization process that Vahburg sees as both personal

58
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:07,200
and cultural is achieved, so he moves in a chronological fashion from ancient Greece

59
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:17,280
to 1929 in Rome, in the course of the 63 panels, but that motion is not only cultural, chronological,

60
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,240
historical, but it's personal in that in many of the panels he is repeating his own research,

61
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,560
he's revisiting his own research, so it's a form of personal memory and cultural memory,

62
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:39,320
maybe just one last anecdote really, the last panel ends with the Eucharist, or he's meditating

63
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,080
on the Eucharist, so we know that this was a kind of redemptive gesture on the part of

64
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,440
Vahburg, both a religious and a redemptive gesture, but in light of some of the number

65
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,160
of people every kind of the accident or the anecdote that in Christ again he felt that

66
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,560
he was being poisoned with human blood, that he was forced to consume human blood.

67
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:14,960
Clearly, Vahburg was able to transform that, displace that by metonymy, by his art of combination

68
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:24,640
in the Atlas, maybe one further postscript is that he also becomes obsessed by the work

69
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,960
of Giardano Bruno in his last year of life, and he sees that as another intellectual project

70
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:42,480
that can satisfy his method and the fact that Cassieva, both in letters to Vahburg in this

71
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:50,680
period and in his funeral oration for Vahburg in 29, confirmed that Vahburg's method was

72
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,400
the right one to make sense of Bruno.

73
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,240
I think again, these are other examples of his historical psychology that goes between

74
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
image and work.

75
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,920
Okay, I'm going to try to make a bridge because we have an expert on Abi Vahburg sitting next

76
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
to me.

77
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:15,480
I've read your book and he really knows his stuff, and then we have three neurosciences,

78
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,600
one who is written with a psychoanalyst, so I'm going to try to make a bridge about

79
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,880
memory in the unconscious so that we have a way of crossing it, because what happens

80
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,800
in these discussions is that there are epistemological and methodological differences.

81
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,720
So people working in labs need controlled circumstances and you need to be able to reproduce

82
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,000
your results.

83
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
You do not need to do that.

84
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,280
You need to have important insights about metaphor and Vahburg, and you can write a beautiful

85
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
book.

86
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,440
I'm a novelist.

87
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,680
I don't need any of it.

88
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,560
But I think it's really crucial that we think about how this is going to work.

89
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,640
So we have essentially here, if we're going to talk about the unconscious, first of all,

90
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,000
we have a dynamic Freudian unconscious, something I think we're all here at this table familiar

91
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
with.

92
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,320
We have something now called, has been called the cognitive unconscious.

93
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:24,400
And if we remember in behaviorism, this wasn't even talked about in the early 20th century.

94
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,080
It came about later.

95
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,920
Now neuroscientists are talking about all kinds of higher cognitive material that is

96
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:39,880
part of unconsciousness that can, some of it, which can be brought to memory.

97
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,880
The Vahburgian unconscious, you will have to help me with.

98
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:54,840
It seems to me that what Vahburg is talking about is a kind of collective unconscious

99
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:01,760
that is perhaps more related to Jung in some ways than to Freud, but it's not clear.

100
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:12,880
The one science link that I found to Vahburg memory and the unconscious is Richard Zeemon,

101
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,200
the German scientist on memory who really got lost.

102
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,760
I started looking at it.

103
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:27,440
He was a Lamarckian, but as we know, not that Lamarck has returned, but there are studies

104
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:38,240
in epigenetics where there are shocks or stresses delivered to mice which change methylation,

105
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,560
which then can be inherited.

106
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,080
Interesting little link possibly.

107
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,840
Kristina knows a lot more about this than I do, and maybe you should take the ball from

108
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
there.

109
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,840
I'm trying to make little connective tissue so that we have something to talk about together

110
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,080
about the function of memory and how it works for Vahburg.

111
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:08,000
There's a 19th century, 20th century example of a scientist working on memory who had some

112
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,200
insights that Vahburg borrowed and transformed.

113
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,640
Now I throw it to Kristina.

114
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,680
I'll take it from there and just to start the discussion.

115
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm going to talk about memory in general, so what we define as memory and how is this

116
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,480
related to the unconscious.

117
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:38,680
We define memory, anything we learn, and then we keep as information over time.

118
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,120
There are already keywords here.

119
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:50,640
Learning, which is something that is perceived and changed in the brain as an oral scientist.

120
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:58,320
Then it's maintained over time, so there is the other important issue of time.

121
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,760
This already goes away a little bit, takes some space from the unconscious because there

122
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,200
is no time in that.

123
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,560
We can talk about that.

124
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,840
Is there for memory always conscious, of course not.

125
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,480
We know not only in psychoanalysis but in psychology and in neuroscience more and more

126
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:30,000
that many of the experiences remain in a place that is non-conscious and therefore by definition

127
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
unconscious.

128
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,080
Does that mean that is the Freudian unconscious?

129
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,720
That's going to be up for debate and discussion.

130
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:44,240
We actually wrote a paper together with Pierre and Francois exactly about these topics, so

131
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,840
perhaps Pierre can take it from there.

132
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:51,480
I comment about Freudian unconscious, cognitive unconscious, many types of unconscious.

133
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,560
Obviously needs to be defined because the word unconscious is common to all of them,

134
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,520
but do they have anything to do with each other?

135
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:18,640
Freud himself wrote that memory is actually an unconscious process or the memory trace

136
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,920
to be more precise is an unconscious entity.

137
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:33,800
The memory of the trace can be conscious, so he is distinguishing what is inside that

138
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,400
is maintained, let's say in the brain, the brain body connection, that is unconscious

139
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,400
but the memory of it of something is the conscious part.

140
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,480
So clearly in this trace there is something conscious that can be brought to consciousness

141
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,200
and the remains in the unconscious.

142
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:01,440
There is a lot that can be discussed and certainly a lot of interest, particularly in I am very

143
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,920
interested in that, in understanding the memories during development, which are very linked

144
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:15,760
to the psychoanalytic issues in question, how much are they conscious or unconscious?

145
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:24,480
Then is the process of consciousness coming in and are these traces, these memory traces

146
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:34,280
maintained and influenced our behavior later on, which is the answer is obviously yes.

147
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:44,080
So here we can connect about the perceptions of an artist making the work of art or thinking

148
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,240
or visualizing anything, any perception.

149
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,040
How much is that connected to memories?

150
00:15:53,040 --> 00:16:00,480
Memories besides that is a biologically essential function for life without memories we will

151
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:10,000
not survive is also a very important part of the individuality of who we are.

152
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,560
And there is a lot of connection to emotions and then Joe is going to tell us more about

153
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
the emotions.

154
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,240
So there is so much to go through, I think I will stop here and I will leave it to you.

155
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:30,360
Maybe I can take it from your distinction of three unconscious cognitive Freudian and

156
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,560
what you mentioned the Warburgian unconscious.

157
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:41,280
I think Christina already made a first pass to the first two cognitive and Freudian and

158
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
we can get back.

159
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,920
I mean as you say there is still a lot to be said.

160
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,200
But the quote unquote Warburgian unconscious, which you, until yesterday I never thought

161
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,000
that that could have anything to do with what you mentioned, some sort of collective

162
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,520
unconscious because for me it is very difficult to understand the notion of consciousness

163
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,280
collective unconscious.

164
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,760
So let me try to give you what I think about it.

165
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,880
I have been thinking about this quite intensively obviously because of this immersion since

166
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,640
yesterday.

167
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,680
That resonates by the way with what you were saying initially the cultural and the personal

168
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,760
memory.

169
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:37,440
It is another way, so this contrast, this paradox between something personal and something

170
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,480
cultural or collective I think is a question in the Warburgian unconscious.

171
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,920
Let us call it.

172
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,120
What does it mean?

173
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:54,160
So initially when with Vittorio and Francois we thought of this gathering here, I think

174
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,040
one of the starting point was the notion of Navelleben.

175
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:08,200
So this idea that there is something, as Jor-Vivolscom says, something that remains over time maybe

176
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,400
is updated at different times and cultures.

177
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:26,160
But there is these patterns that reemerge through different stages of culture.

178
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,000
It is something that is puzzling.

179
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,600
So it has something to do with memory but how do you talk about memory being maintained

180
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:42,920
across centuries and cultures, unless you speak of this collective unconscious which

181
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,440
I don't really think exists.

182
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,880
So how do you connect this?

183
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,760
So you can take two approaches.

184
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,960
One is, and I think that's the one that triggered our interest, is the idea that also, and Kristina

185
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,360
has worked a lot on this, the idea that traces are made after an experience and then somehow

186
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,520
there is the memory is very dynamic.

187
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,880
It can be updated, there are new associations of traces.

188
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,800
And one could say, when Navelleben is kind of a concept that has a resonance with some

189
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:24,000
neurobiological aspects of memory that there are traces that are re-abdated, re-associated

190
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
with time.

191
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,560
But it's really purely conceptual because the notion of trace re-association, of reconciliation

192
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,960
is linked to a single individual.

193
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,880
So how can you imagine that this goes on across centuries?

194
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:48,640
So it works as a model but I don't think it works in practice to explain this verborgian

195
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,280
unconscious.

196
00:19:50,280 --> 00:20:01,960
So it's an idea that I put here with all the, because we are completely open and discussed.

197
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:20,480
But I just thought that, how about if there are some patterns that activate in a particularly

198
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:30,360
strong way or patterns of neurons that it's an invariant of the human species, at least

199
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,440
over these two or three thousand years that we're talking about.

200
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:43,920
And somehow they generate some emotional response or some, even maybe cognitive response or

201
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
something.

202
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:56,120
So there is kind of a signature in certain patterns that is an invariant across time

203
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,520
and space.

204
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,200
And maybe something very primitive.

205
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,840
I can't actually help but thinking of in one of your early papers in the Scientific

206
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:17,120
American, you had a man in a forest hitting with a rod, a snake.

207
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:24,520
And the idea that the snake would go through the low way, the talamus amigdala and generate

208
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:33,160
this very fast response, not at all cognitively interpreted, which is the long way through

209
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,560
the primary sensory cortex and then back to.

210
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:45,960
So as a pure speculation, is it possible that these patterns that verborg identified and

211
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:53,680
that we can group under this idea of the verborgian unconscious actually reflect a neurobiological

212
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:06,640
reality of very simple or even complex patterns that are an invariant in neuronal circuitry

213
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:14,800
and then that triggers certain type of energy, if you wish, which then are then integrated

214
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:22,440
in much more elaborated productions such as the giérlandaleo or your name.

215
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,880
So this is my take.

216
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:33,080
I think maybe it is possible to talk about some kind of biological there there.

217
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:40,040
What happened yesterday I think is that in certain strains of poststructuralist French

218
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:51,080
thought, the body as a non-ideological, non-textual phenomenon vanished, which is I think the

219
00:22:51,080 --> 00:23:00,040
spat about La Con and Malle Punti was connected to this, that there is real biology and neurology

220
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:09,760
in Malle Punti in a way that La Con's relationship to drive theory, which I think there are people

221
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,800
here that can explain it better than I understood it, but it is changed.

222
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,440
He really revises that in relation to what is happening in French thinking of the period.

223
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,800
But if we can agree that there is some kind of biological route to human experience, which

224
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,680
I think there is, then this is from Vareberg's journal and I think maybe Joe will have something

225
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,800
to say about this.

226
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:45,600
He says, the inherited consciousness of maximized impressions stamped on the mind, engram,

227
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,600
engram, passes them on without taking cognizance of the direction of their emotional charge

228
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:59,560
simply as an experience of energy tensions, this sounds a little like Freud, this unpolarized

229
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:08,240
continuum, the imparting of a new meaning, you can think of that as Freud drives attaching

230
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,560
to an object, to these energies serves as a protective screen.

231
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,640
Joe, this sounds like you.

232
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,200
This is Bobo, this is Bobo, but I know Joe can pick up on this.

233
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:31,240
I want to start with something that Christopher said about the arrangement of these images

234
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,160
and the dynamic that is going on between conscious and unconscious processes.

235
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:46,200
Let's really simplify it and think of the conscious perceptual mind as one thing and

236
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,960
everything else underneath as more implicit systems that operate unconsciously.

237
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,040
What about the Freudian unconscious, all of that other stuff and just talk about it as

238
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,120
pure wiring of the brain?

239
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,920
Some things are unconscious simply because they don't have connectivity with the systems

240
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
that make consciousness.

241
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,960
We could call it cognitive unconscious, but a lot of emotion stuff is like that too.

242
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,720
We'll just call it the implicit of psychological unconscious.

243
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,840
Let's say he's there ranging these pictures, his conscious mind is looking at it, but his

244
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,880
unconscious mind is controlling his behavior.

245
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:32,080
The actual arrangement physically of the images is probably being done independent of what

246
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
he's consciously thinking.

247
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,240
That's how you're getting these.

248
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:44,640
You make a move, you put this here just intuitively and now it's part of your consciousness.

249
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,240
That gets incorporated into your present state.

250
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,960
Now you make another move and so it's a dance between the conscious and the unconscious

251
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,480
as all of life is every moment.

252
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:05,840
I see that as how these systems are interacting, but now to bring in emotion and universal

253
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,400
unconscious.

254
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,280
There are definitely things that are wired into the brain that we're sensitive to, whether

255
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:21,080
it's the certain shapes, the visual cortex for example, has things that it's innately

256
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,240
sensitive to in terms of angles and lines and contrast between stimulants and so forth.

257
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,240
There are more complex things that we might think of in a psychological sense such as

258
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,040
the snake on the ground.

259
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:41,480
We know that the low road that you talked about, which takes information into the amygdala,

260
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,160
which is important for detecting danger, the low road takes that information in, but it

261
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,960
has nothing, has no way to convey psychology.

262
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,040
All it has is curvature, intensity and those sorts of features.

263
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,360
The guy that's walking in the woods in this picture and is about to step on the snake and

264
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,760
freezing before he steps on the snake is not responding to the snake.

265
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:13,680
He's responding to a curve shape on the ground that activates this archetypal image that has

266
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:21,760
been threatening to our ancestors and our animal ancestors and all the way back down for millennia

267
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,840
and causing him to stop to freeze.

268
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,760
Just as you walk out on 2nd Avenue and the bus goes flying by and you jump back and afterwards

269
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,720
you consciously become afraid, the brain has this kind of capacity to respond this way.

270
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,640
As you know, many phobias are based on these kinds of archetypal stimuli, whether it's

271
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:48,600
snakes and spiders and heights and blood and things like that or social situations where

272
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,000
you're not in a sense of uncontrolled is present.

273
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,280
There are lots of things that go on below the surface of consciousness that then we

274
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:04,480
consciously recognize and incorporate into ourself, our mind, our personality, including

275
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
our own behavior.

276
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,880
So we act in a certain way that becomes part of our conscious perception of who we are

277
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,880
and in fact we learn a lot about who we are through the way we act.

278
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,480
I'm just going to say this, you can relate this back I think to actually trauma as something

279
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,200
important in Valvo and also to the images you mentioned first connected to the typhoid

280
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,760
fever.

281
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,520
And trauma and learned fear responses which is something that Joe has also written about

282
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:44,240
I think are very much implicated in Valvo's life but also in his theoretical position

283
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,320
about the shock that returns and you know Valvo I'm giving it to you.

284
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,040
Well I was picking up on the notion of the Valvo walking in unconscious in the distance

285
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:01,440
between or how we might move from a conscious level.

286
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:11,000
The first phrase in the introduction to name Azune is conscious creation of distance.

287
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,040
He insists upon the fact that he is this is a practice that this project is going to show

288
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:26,360
the means by which he moves from the demonic to something more ecstatic or more mediated

289
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:35,840
something something controllable and the fact that he insists on Nietzsche's polarity between

290
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,080
the Dionysian and the Apollonian in the same text suggests to me that he's realizing that

291
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:49,840
the method that he of collating combining separating which he worked on with collaborators

292
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,360
but mainly was it was Valvo himself who insisted on the arrangement of the images was the means

293
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:04,640
by which he could de demonize quote unquote these images but implicitly also his own past

294
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,560
and his own demons.

295
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:14,560
So if you take people into the lab and make them afraid of something create a threatening

296
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:20,840
stimulus by pairing something with shock or so forth and then re-expose them to that

297
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,560
stimulus and ask them to think about a pleasant field of daisies or something like that you

298
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,640
can lower the the response of the autonomic nervous system and also reduce the amygdala

299
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:39,480
activity to that threat by arranging a context for it so it sounds like this is similar to

300
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
what he's doing.

301
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,440
It's similar I'm just afraid from the sort of philological comparison perspective that

302
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:55,720
we're losing the historical richness of Valvo's knowledge that he knew things about the history

303
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,960
of astrology the history of cosmography the history of art that history of literature

304
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,560
that allowed him to as you suggested in your last as you suggested in your last sentence

305
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,720
to lower the fear factor as a her.

306
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:20,280
But at least when I sense is that and again you formulated it by speaking about cultural

307
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,600
versus personal memory I think there are two aspects that one can bring to the discussion

308
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:33,440
one is the the motivations let cool them or the drives that made Warburg organize the

309
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:41,080
images in a certain way in Nemozin in the Atlas and and and that is clearly the result

310
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,960
of his personal life his personal.

311
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Yeah I mean it's his unconscious drives and then his intuition about Naheleben these the

312
00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:02,160
constancy the the persistence the surveillance of of certain antique patterns and that relates

313
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:08,480
to to the other point I was trying to make and to to propose to this maybe there are

314
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,760
these archetypal forms that are not that nothing to do with a collective unconscious but simply

315
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,960
with a biological reality and and and actually I was discussing last night with the under

316
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:26,800
Pinoti about something that resonates with this and is the notion of ou built by Dülke

317
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:38,040
and so this idea that there are certain prime primal or original or original images that

318
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,920
that I have nothing mythical actually they have some they're biological for our species.

319
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:49,400
Yes and I think I think you're right we don't want to fall into some kind of reductive position

320
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:58,160
at least I don't maybe other people do where you're reducing this very complex historical

321
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,840
and intellectual reality to say a part of the brain.

322
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,120
Are we trying to understand him or are we trying to get more general ideas about the

323
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:16,880
mind or I think for example the idea of Dankram you can move this across fields so this idea

324
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:28,920
of distance or Dankram subject object can I think be related to unconsciousness or pre-reflective

325
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:38,840
self-consciousness and reflective self-consciousness in in phenomenology or Kierkegaard said immediacy

326
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:46,640
a motor sensory immediate you know perceptions that are coming into the body versus reflection

327
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:58,120
so and this would relate to what you call the slow road in fear perception right so there's

328
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,080
this immediate response to the snake on you know in front of you where your whole body

329
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:10,720
is just in alarm mode and then there are the slower responses that have cognitive functions

330
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:20,120
higher cognitive functions. So what this makes me think is perhaps the load of emotions

331
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:29,600
and the demons attached to it so it's overwhelming it's emotions and then making this space or

332
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:38,280
taking the distance by giving a context by giving something that is attached to it so

333
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:46,440
that a story can be made or a continuity so that something can be said from the beginning

334
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:54,440
to the end and that is a way to move from the pure emotional state that is overwhelming

335
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:00,120
and therefore may be therapeutic. And you're really figuring the fundamental metaphor that

336
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:09,880
Bobo uses well in all throughout the 20s namely the Vanda Strassa that the road by which he

337
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:17,000
moves from the demonic through to something more reason more prudential but then of course

338
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,680
he re-encounters the demonic maybe in 1929 Rome that it's never it's never unlike Gomberich

339
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:33,880
Snyol Kantian account of a Boboque career intellectual career and George has said this

340
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,320
in his book wonderfully it's never there's it's Boboque spot is not teleological never

341
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:48,000
comes to an end a nice calm settled synthesis and so that he's always re-encountering these

342
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,320
images in both in a manner that requires mediation and memory and the kind of work that you are

343
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:02,040
describing. In a form possibly of visual narrative and maybe that's my narrative obsession but

344
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:10,120
I do think it's making conscious meanings out of the terror I mean the the archetypal

345
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:18,960
motor sensory visual overload is the flashback that you're just there's no linguistic material

346
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:26,840
there. Exactly. There's no linguistic material so I think that the Varburgian reality is

347
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:36,600
negotiating exactly what you said the demonic is this motor sensory terror. He talks about

348
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:43,560
something like I have it somewhere the melancholy you know the the tranquility or no the oh

349
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:55,760
god it's cannibalistic fury and melancholic something or other here it is. Entire range

350
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,320
of emotional gesture and now he's talking about the image from helpless melancholy to

351
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:15,160
murderous cannibalism. Yes. Although I just that he in fact consists that the possibilities

352
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:21,760
of using his method can result in either this the ecstatic or the melancholic. Yeah. And this

353
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:31,880
is after having the initial he uses the phrase which is very Nietzschean nerve and rights

354
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:42,040
the initial initial pull draw of the of the nerves of the feelings of this bodily the

355
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:50,520
corporeal and then the abstracted even mathematical view of images that he condemns in for instance

356
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:59,360
Hellenistic astrology. It's either too visceral or too abstracted and Varburg is looking for

357
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:07,080
a middle road a middle path in which both the immediate and the abstracted can be in some

358
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:12,760
sort of balance. Therefore he's interested in logos and mythos at the same time. Yeah.

359
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,560
And hallucination is an interesting aspect of this. How so? Well the hallucinations that

360
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:26,240
he remembers from his childhood the and the fact that that he does organize his thinking

361
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:33,560
in a kind of bipolar way. And that then he has a psychotic break which is not just a

362
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:40,360
break but it lasts for years. Right. Which he then recovers from I think in a way through

363
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:49,400
Dankham. Through this therapeutic aspect of finding the distance through both writing

364
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:59,320
and maybe arranging his mind. Yes. These complexes of images. Just fascinating.

365
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:08,400
And he was extraordinarily keen to have acknowledgement from his peers that this new method of the

366
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,640
build a higher technique of sequences of images that it would successfully help others mediate

367
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:22,960
this polarity. The famous example of him traveling to visit Einstein and show him some

368
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:30,440
of the cosmographical images in this form of visual autonomy. And that Einstein was impressed

369
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,520
and agreed and could argue with him about the mathematics of it suggested to Varburg that

370
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,480
he had succeeded in finding a technique or method. Yeah. But I think also someone in

371
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:51,880
the last session Ernst Chris was mentioned. And Chris talks about an aesthetic barrier

372
00:39:51,880 --> 00:40:02,800
in art in creativity. That in a way preserves the artist from you know complete ego disintegration

373
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:10,640
in these imaginative flight. This is a this is a linked thought that the aesthetic barrier

374
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:20,480
is what Varburg is trying to set up. And the stakes are very high in his case.

375
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:30,960
But what just go back to this archetypal images that can then be re-put into different context.

376
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:38,480
I mean the for example we show the images that we saw yesterday in Georges presentation.

377
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:47,000
I mean the angle of the foot I mean this and and with all that it brings in terms of you

378
00:40:47,000 --> 00:41:00,920
know representations. I mean that is a very specific pattern that may have been remained

379
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:09,640
across centuries. And that's what I was saying again activating particular circuits but then

380
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:17,880
or neurons actually. But then obviously it's it's contextualized you know in a painting by

381
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,760
Guillermo and I or in in others. So this detail that he points and mentions often this and

382
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:29,560
others but the notion of detail that he gives so much importance maybe again I don't want

383
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,560
to be reductionistic but maybe it has a biological underpinning. Yeah well and I think if we bring

384
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:44,480
up Vittorio and you know mirror systems in the brain that are you know working preconceptually

385
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:53,080
and you know those wonderful tapes about dancers who are watching other dancers. And how the

386
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:59,000
activation is different from just a lay person like myself watching a dancer. So there you

387
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:07,680
know there are these this is not a conscious connection but it activates you know motor

388
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,800
sensory parts of ourselves and this may be a link to Valbo as you say. Not talking about

389
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:20,920
a Jungian collective unconscious but certain aspects of human experience that are well to

390
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:39,400
risk the word universal. And maybe you know Joe the notion of how the body is engaged I

391
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:47,400
mean in terms of the somatic states in emotions maybe again I mean that's also an aspect I

392
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,760
think in when he speaks I'm not sure maybe you have to correct me but he said you have

393
00:42:52,760 --> 00:43:04,160
patos formel is it some kind of affect some kind of emotion that such patterns can generate

394
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,520
you know maybe there also there is a connection with you know something that from the amygdala

395
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:18,160
activates endocrine or autonomic responses. There are certain systems in the brain obviously

396
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:26,080
they control our autonomic nervous system and the patterns that occur often are in response

397
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:32,320
to movement in response to behavior to meet the metabolic demands of the behavior. So if

398
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,640
you move your arm you've got to get blood in there and as you begin to move it you're

399
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,120
using energy until you have to resupply the energy. So every movement requires that the

400
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:49,240
brain orchestrates set of responses to adjust the physiology of the body to that system.

401
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,480
And all of those physiological responses whether they're of the autonomic nervous system or

402
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,720
the endocrine system are providing signals that then feed back to the brain as is the

403
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,000
movement itself through the proprioceptive systems. So there's a tremendous amount of

404
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,600
information coming back to the brain and I'm not necessarily talking about it in the

405
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:15,440
sense of the demazio kind of creating a feeling but it's certainly affecting the information

406
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,680
processing functions of the brain in a massive way. So all of the hormones that are released

407
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,040
for example cortisol is very important it's released in the adrenal gland goes into the

408
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:33,560
brain and binds to the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, you name it it's a hypothalamus

409
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,240
it's all over the brain and so it's going to affect the way all of those systems are

410
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:44,280
responding to the external world whether they're processing information implicitly or unconsciously

411
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:55,440
or in a conscious sense. So the detection of some significant stimulus in an image can

412
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,480
trigger all of that and then it feeds back to the brain which then affects the perception

413
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,600
and it becomes a feed forward circle.

414
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:11,680
So I suppose my question then would be in the case of Bob Walk and using the word case

415
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,960
after five years five plus years of institutions after having his voice there's a description

416
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,840
of his voice having been affected by all the screening that he did when he was institutionalized

417
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:32,440
it was kind of broken by it. Can, from a neuroscientific point of view could Bob Walk have how would

418
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:38,440
his reaction to the image have been changed having gone through that dark night of the

419
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:46,000
soul as it were and having learned or taught himself and been taught to see these images

420
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:55,160
over and over again for 40 years physiologically is there something that has changed or could

421
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,400
he have changed could he have cultivated a particular reaction is unique is he exemplary

422
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,840
well every experience changes your brain and the book is sitting here talking changes

423
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:11,560
your brain and the more profound the experience the more change there's going to be. So being

424
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:17,280
in a prison and screaming and being in an awful or any kind of awful situation is going

425
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,320
to change all of the systems in the brain because they're all responding and part of

426
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:31,400
this activity. So yeah I mean he's going to change his result of that and the way he

427
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,480
deals with the world after that will change as well. I don't know if that answered your

428
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,480
question but.

429
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,480
Which brings up plasticity.

430
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:43,480
Yeah which you have something to say about I know but so that in other words what we're

431
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:51,000
talking about are dynamic systems which does really relate to Volvo very in a profound

432
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,720
way I think both methodologically and you know how we can know what we know he's always

433
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,560
in motion. Yes.

434
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:06,960
Right it's never I mean this is what I'm Jo who was here anyway. Jo Jo was saying that

435
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:16,440
there's a kind of a day in flute you know to use the bin spong in the work itself which

436
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:26,200
can be maddening when you're reading it but is very very interesting from an intellectual

437
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:34,200
point of view that it can't be pinned down and so the idea of dynamism is implicit and

438
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,280
explicit in his work might in fact in his latter years he starts to use the word dynamo

439
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:47,560
ground yes yes as a replacement term for the pathos formula yeah yeah more or less yeah

440
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:55,840
and so again pushing on this of course every individual every experience has shaped the

441
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,400
way we see the world but I'm wondering.

442
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:06,400
The world's conscious strategies the build out list dynamo ground pathos formulas that

443
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,720
they they seem from a certain point of view to almost be not defense mechanisms but coping

444
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:18,440
mechanisms by which he is able to still look at those images that right cause him such

445
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:24,800
terror and uses the word terror fear over and over and over and over and so it's not

446
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:31,800
either or just to bring up here to guardian it's not either or it's some kind of swimming

447
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:39,560
and motion between these two poles that he you know he keeps thinking and it is a kind

448
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:46,720
of mind body polarity you know and unlike the rest of I kept thinking of the spatial

449
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:54,760
metaphor unlike the rest of western culture where it's mind over body the hierarchy.

450
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:02,400
In Valbo it seems to be the spatial metaphors like this and it's a continuum between the

451
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,160
two.

452
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:11,680
But you know you mentioned the plasticity and yeah I mean obviously every experience

453
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:17,560
changes the brain through the mechanisms of plasticity but maybe Christina you can say

454
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:23,800
something about the dynamics of memory and of the traces I think maybe that could be

455
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,040
of interest to the group.

456
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:35,280
Yeah so mechanism of plasticity which is that we used to process and we very much used to

457
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:41,440
make memories and memories can be short lasting or long lasting so there is short term plasticity

458
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:55,320
and this mechanism can be actually studying out relatively in detail so we know some of

459
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:02,640
the underlying mechanisms of long term plasticity important for long term memories and how those

460
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,680
then when they are retrieved the memories can influence the present and the present

461
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:14,400
is going to be made of the present experience plus the retrieval of the memories.

462
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:22,000
So this I think is very important and relevant to think about how that can play and there

463
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,480
is less known or understood about memory retrieval which is the other process that we are all

464
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,480
interested in.

465
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:36,040
I want to make a correction here actually Joe is the one who rediscover reconciliation

466
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,720
and when I started to work on it.

467
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:46,520
Carrying neither in your lab or in this conversation and those are processes that are very interesting

468
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:54,560
to think about also in the context of how we feel and how these changes over time so not

469
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:00,760
only this mechanism of plasticity which the brain changes and make long term changes to

470
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:07,760
store the memories but these changes are not static they keep changing they are very dynamic.

471
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:15,320
Which is related to Nacht-Triglickeit we can say to Freud's idea of what straight sheet

472
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:21,320
translated as deferred action which is not a good translation but afterliness which is

473
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,320
dynamic and not static.

474
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:30,800
So Christian maybe the coping that he is talking about is it comes to reconciliation where

475
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:38,440
the meaning is changed with each experience and maybe having the demonic and the ecstatic

476
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:44,680
together re-consolidates the memory in a slightly different way which then allows the next

477
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,280
experience to be less demonic.

478
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:54,280
I love this idea of re-consolidation or some people have described it as Boboek's

479
00:51:54,280 --> 00:52:01,400
combinatory art which almost is based on a medieval combinatory art that he can take

480
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:12,840
the heterogeneous copia and find a way to constellate it in such a way in a manner that is both

481
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:19,080
instructive to others satisfying to him and ultimately a form of memory work.

482
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,080
And that's...

483
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:30,000
So just to be a little more precise about how it works, re-consolidation is when memories

484
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:40,760
are retrieved and they become fragile and changeable and this is a temporal window during which

485
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:46,320
changes can happen and then the memory becomes again less changeable.

486
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:54,840
However over time because there are many inputs coming in, many new experiences, many

487
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:59,680
re-elaboration, the overall trace is very very dynamic.

488
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:06,640
But there are specific processes and temporal window during which there is a much more power

489
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:12,080
and possibility and ability to make changes.

490
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:17,480
So modulating obviously the state, the emotional state is one of those that happens to you.

491
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:24,720
I mean this idea that the mechanisms of plasticity allow the traces to be inscribed in the neuronal

492
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,880
circuits but that that's something that would seem like permanent.

493
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,240
But actually that's not the case.

494
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,960
I think this is why I thought it was important to discuss.

495
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,560
They can be re-mobilized and re-associated with others in different contexts.

496
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,960
So it's a really dynamic of these traces.

497
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,880
It's very important and it's being studied by Christina, Joe and others.

498
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,360
And this is a heuristic...

499
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,800
You're speaking to the heuristic quality of Bob Olg's late work.

500
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,920
He's constantly using these methods, whether in lecture or with sequences of images, to

501
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,360
discover and bring people along with him.

502
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:08,800
And people describe his four hour lecture in famous lecture in Rome, the Hitziana lecture

503
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:17,720
in early January 1929 as a heuristic experience by which Bob Olg takes his viewers, and I

504
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:23,080
say viewers, maybe that's a slip there, because he had 19 panels along the lecture room.

505
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,280
And no one could see them.

506
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,920
No one could see them.

507
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:32,280
But yet people described the being in the lecture as this marvelous revelatory experience.

508
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:42,160
And Bob Olg himself at one point in the lecture says, yes, this speaks of it in terms of phenomenology

509
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:52,440
by which he mediates between the legacy of the phobic legacy on the one hand and the

510
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,160
ability to engage the world.

511
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:03,360
So let's take the images and then the historical images and then let's re-experience them.

512
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,240
And he brings his audience along with him.

513
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,640
Well, and also I think it's important to this, the idea of a dynamic changing concept, which

514
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:18,520
I think has attracted so many contemporary thinkers and scholars to Bob Olg, is the idea

515
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,800
that you could move the images, right?

516
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,840
I mean that they were on a kind of black felt and then you could shift the arrangement,

517
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,720
which is very similar to what happens in memory.

518
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:40,040
I myself have noticed in my autobiographical memories, explicit memories, that I have

519
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,160
actually changed the location.

520
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:50,480
So I have a strong memory, emotional memory, of being embarrassed by laughing adults when

521
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,600
I was four.

522
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:57,200
And I always remembered it in my aunt's house.

523
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,760
Well, it was remembered.

524
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,520
It did happen, I believe, in my aunt's house.

525
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:09,920
But because I couldn't remember the early house, I shifted the memory to the later location

526
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,600
which I had memorized.

527
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,080
This is an extremely interesting example, I think.

528
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:21,800
First of all, that we need to pin our memories to location, which is a very ancient idea

529
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,960
and medieval idea, to low side.

530
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,200
Greek, yes, but the Greek was topos, topos, and then Cicero.

531
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,800
Seminities is the story.

532
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:43,520
And then it's Cicero who really codified this, who tells the story of Simonides.

533
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:53,280
And that idea of topos, I think, is completely valid in these discussions of reconciliation.

534
00:56:53,280 --> 00:57:00,160
In this sense, I actually would say that our memories are very inefficient, our memory

535
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:06,960
systems, or at least these type of memories, the memories that are declarative.

536
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,960
Shakeful.

537
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,000
Very shaky because we don't need really to remember all the details.

538
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:19,720
Actually, if we think about how many days we learn every single day, we lose them all.

539
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:27,560
What remains is an essential, very faint trace of something.

540
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,840
And then that something, especially if it's an old memory, has to be placed somewhere.

541
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:37,000
So then we make the connections, and this is how the false parts of the memories are

542
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
formed.

543
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I think imagination and memory, as Vico said, these are two functions of the same faculty.

544
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,400
And if you look at hippocampal lesions in the brain, people who can't remember very well

545
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,320
also can't imagine very well.

546
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:05,840
So that Buckner Carroll paper about the perspective brain that maybe it's not about accurate memories

547
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:11,360
of our past, but using that material to predict future events.

548
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,360
Exactly.

549
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,360
Right.

550
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:19,760
So it's a forward-looking kind of function, and I think that's useful.

551
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:26,080
And all of this actually is not very unvalvogian, except he was looking more past.

552
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,480
He was a retrospective gamer.

553
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,280
He was a retrospective looker.

554
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,280
But he was fascinated by memory palaces.

555
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,280
Yes.

556
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:41,680
And he describes the atlas at certain points as a kind of neo-memory palace that would

557
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,240
help salvage or retain those details that are lost.

558
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,400
Without insisting on the details themselves, but just by making them present.

559
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:57,440
Because there was no verbal thickening around them as it stands.

560
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:06,720
Well, did.

561
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:11,440
Where are we in our drama?

562
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:19,800
Do you have a question?

563
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,800
How should we do?

564
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,800
Yeah, I think so.

565
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,800
Don't you think?

566
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:29,800
Yeah, you mentioned that it's not normal in your life.

567
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,800
Just for this.

568
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,800
I'm doing this right.

569
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:41,040
I can speak a lot.

570
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,280
So two possible next sees for your discussion about memory and reconsolidation.

571
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:52,080
One is about the nature of emotions research, which would be a nexus between neurobiology

572
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,440
and the other stuff that we all do.

573
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,280
I'm thinking of Paul Ekman's work on emotions.

574
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,400
And of how you have rapid reaction about a quarter second before you become conscious

575
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,680
or show your emotional expression on your face and his work on gesture.

576
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:14,080
And the second possible nexus, I thought of Bob Pinus's work on trauma when you were

577
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,760
giving your specific memory about space.

578
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:24,040
And Bob points out how he has a developmental model of trauma, which I think fits with what

579
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,520
you were talking about, of reconsolidation.

580
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:31,200
And there's entry points where one can change for better or for worse, the nature of memory

581
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,200
of trauma.

582
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:39,400
But also in terms of spatial location, Bob points out how a child, for instance, in a

583
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:46,080
sniping episode in LA remembers the sniping episode, remembers details of the soldiers'

584
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:51,400
boots, and misremembers his location next to his buddy, who was shot.

585
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,600
As a way of protecting himself, it's different from your explanation, protecting himself from

586
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,200
the memory of how close he came to death.

587
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,040
But my memory wasn't traumatic.

588
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,840
It was emotional, but it wasn't traumatic.

589
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:09,200
I think traumatic memory has a very specific kind of, and it can be hyper-detailed.

590
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:14,680
I mean, I have a traumatic memory of being in a car accident, which was followed by flashbacks.

591
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:19,280
And that's similar in the sense that I have avoided the actual impact.

592
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,720
Everything else is hyper-clear.

593
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,520
But the impact is missing.

594
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,560
The research on that suggests that it's very clear, but not necessarily accurate.

595
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,560
So you have very vid-specific-

596
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,560
Absolutely.

597
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,560
Absolutely.

598
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:37,000
I'm not claiming that it's what I'm remembering is how it happened, because actually I have

599
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,600
black and white memory.

600
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:47,440
I mean, I think what the data show is that the main focus is remembered, and then the

601
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,960
periphery of the memory is where all the mistakes come in.

602
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,520
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

603
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:03,800
Two things you said, Siri, sparked thoughts that I would love to just make two quick observations

604
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,800
and throw it back to you.

605
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:13,960
Speaking of murderous cannibalism, A.B. Warburg became a vegetarian during his hospitalization

606
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:21,400
because of a very concrete, specific fear that he was being served the cooked flesh

607
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,640
of his own family members.

608
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:30,720
He had these persistent fears of drinking blood, not just the Jews' blood, but his own family

609
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,720
members.

610
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:39,200
He had visions, and he accused his doctor of in a very eerily prescient way, shipping

611
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,600
train cars packed with the flesh of Jews.

612
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,400
This is 1921.

613
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,640
So I'm asking a question for which I don't have an answer about his own ambivalence or

614
01:02:51,640 --> 01:03:01,660
even fear of his own aggression and his desire to not devour his relatives or their own

615
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,760
the Jews.

616
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:09,120
The other spark from something you said when you talked about him and his endless flight,

617
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:15,560
his endless motion and how he couldn't be pinned down while he was hospitalized, a doctor's

618
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:21,600
note in his chart, and this is obviously translated, said, he practices a cult with the moths and

619
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,280
butterflies that fly into his room at night.

620
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,120
He speaks to them for hours.

621
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:31,440
He calls them his little soul animals, Celin Tarkin, and tells them about his suffering

622
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:37,440
and then direct quote from his notes, it's hard to know is this experience or fantasy

623
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,480
or a dream or what it is.

624
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:45,920
The most beautiful butterfly I have ever pinned down suddenly bursts through the glass and

625
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,760
dances mockingly upwards into the blue air.

626
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,000
Now I should catch it again, but I am not equipped for this kind of locomotion or to

627
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,440
be exact I should like to, but my intellectual training does not permit me to do so.

628
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:04,440
I should like at the approach of our light-footed girl joyfully to whirl away with her, but

629
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,520
such soaring movements are not for me.

630
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,520
Yeah.

631
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,520
Yeah.

632
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,360
That's in the letter to Jolas, isn't it?

633
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,360
Yeah.

634
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,360
Yeah.

635
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,360
Jolas.

636
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,360
Yeah.

637
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,360
I think it's mostly like an elliptic.

638
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,360
Yeah.

639
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,360
Yeah.

640
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,360
Francois.

641
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,360
Yes.

642
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,360
Yes.

643
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,360
Yes.

644
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:36,960
I have a very nice question because here you are too from literature and free from neurosciences.

645
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:44,240
And Kessina is also a psychoanalyst and neuroscientist.

646
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:53,000
And I was asking me finally after this roundtable, what is a dynamic memory?

647
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,440
Because we are looking in a new way, a dynamic memory.

648
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:04,040
And you were speaking about verbal unconscious, new kind of unconsciousness.

649
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,360
This gets me afternoon.

650
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:10,200
Frigant unconscious, cognitive unconsciousness, now verbal unconscious.

651
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:16,920
And after the discussion about dynamic memory, reconciliation, retrieval, transformation,

652
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:21,520
I thought it was possible to introduce a new concept.

653
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:28,160
It is reconciliation in culture because you have the incidence also of culture through

654
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:37,000
the process of reconciliation, rebuilding, transforming the memories through not only

655
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:46,640
the individual history of each one, but also through the impact of the culture in the inside

656
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,640
world.

657
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:57,400
And I don't know if you can take this new view of thinking, reconciliation, also in

658
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,640
confrontation of the question of culture.

659
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:04,680
No, I think this is really important because I think it relates again to the dankham, to

660
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:11,320
reflective self-consciousness, if you will, to Kierkegaard's reflection to all of this,

661
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:17,560
that space where you have, necessarily, you have culture.

662
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:27,600
So if we think about human beings as socio-psycho-biological beings with those hyphens in some way blurred,

663
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:32,840
I know this is not good in science, but I can do this.

664
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:38,200
And that if we think about that, then we understand that these things are completely mingling

665
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:43,280
together because, of course, culture, everything we read, everything we see becomes part of

666
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:48,280
our, you know, psycho-biological reality.

667
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,280
Yes.

668
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:57,560
Because we have one part, plasticity means all is conserved, and for the other part,

669
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,840
plasticity all is susceptible to change.

670
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:07,560
And if you have this double view, for example, the snake, and it is the conservation of something

671
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:14,720
through memory, we don't know where, it's very difficult, Liam James, hypothesis, and

672
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:15,800
so on.

673
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:23,560
And we have also the idea of diachronic reorganization, permanent reorganization, each experience,

674
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:28,240
every experience modifies, we never use the same brain and so on.

675
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:35,080
And here in that, it's difficult to think these two contradictory dimensions.

676
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:40,360
It's all the same thing, so the snake is there, and so the place where you're bit by the

677
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:47,840
snake becomes stored as part of the, you know, becomes plastic and stored as a new memory.

678
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:53,560
And then the people you were with, or if you go back to that place, the people you're

679
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,760
with at that time become part of that memory.

680
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:03,800
And that's why I've argued that metaphor is precisely the way we need to read this dynamic

681
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:08,360
cultural space because it's able to keep contradictory things together at once.

682
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:15,480
But Christopher, absolutely right, that metaphor is probably the beautiful motion here of all

683
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:18,040
the possibilities of changing meanings.

684
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,040
Yes, yes.

685
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:26,360
Right, so that, and that can also be a form of dank realm between the two poles of metaphorical

686
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,360
thinking.

687
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,360
Sorry.

688
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,360
Thank you.

689
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:39,080
Thank you. I have a comment trying to link the two round tables and trying to go from

690
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:46,080
the notion of detail that was very much stressed in the previous round table to the notion

691
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:54,440
of this collective memory that on the contrary is at the center of some of your discussions.

692
01:08:54,440 --> 01:09:01,920
I will attention to the peripheral element, the particular, I would say, micro logical

693
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,320
attitude.

694
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:10,240
It is true that it's something that, of course, is typical of Warburg, but of many other authors,

695
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,840
not only art historians in the 20th century.

696
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,560
I was thinking of Benjamin, of course.

697
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:23,520
But Georgia yesterday mentioned Giovanni Morelli as even Leer Molliev, so important as we know

698
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,840
to Freud.

699
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:34,840
We shouldn't be very cautious here because I think that detail is crucial, but at the

700
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:41,240
same time we should distinguish two very different approaches, micro logical approaches, because

701
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:49,240
as George already said, in Morelli you have the analysis, the exploration of the single

702
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:57,880
detail, Botticelli's nail, Filipino DIP is ear, but what is the task?

703
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:04,080
The task is that you have to identify the responsible of the image, the individual, the

704
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,400
artist responsible, the attribution.

705
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:16,160
So detail here is used as I would say, Prince Chippium in the individual, the individual.

706
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:22,880
On the contrary, if you read the conclusion of the Botticelli's essay by Barbara, there

707
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:29,440
it comes out very clearly that he is not at all interested in Botticelli as an individual.

708
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:37,760
The detail is used there in order to see he uses Caliusti, in, of course, Aristotle's

709
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:45,160
categories, the notion of delta rauzi, the second substance, because he says the detail

710
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:51,400
evokes in Botticelli something that is not only Botticelli, something that Botticelli

711
01:10:51,400 --> 01:11:00,960
shares with the past, with a common ground, with other painters, and so it's rather the

712
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,800
common ground, the co-innae iced this, the common sense shared.

713
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:13,480
And so I come to the second round table, what is this common ground shared?

714
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:22,320
It is not the collective unconscious, I have difficulties as well in thinking of this notion,

715
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:35,400
but here, hearing Zehmon, it is inherited cerebral substance, which is a very difficult,

716
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:42,040
as difficult perhaps as the collective unconscious to understand, but it is substance inherited

717
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:49,960
from centuries, through centuries, and if something can come up again in the Renaissance,

718
01:11:49,960 --> 01:12:00,120
it is because Donatello or Botticelli inherit materials, so it's anti-Bergsonian, it's

719
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:07,440
not memory or matter, but it's memory is matter, and it's something shared, so I would call

720
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:14,880
it Brinchipium David was the only, because it hints at something that is shared among

721
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:22,320
a group of a community through centuries or thousands of years.

722
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,840
Yeah, we just don't know how that works.

723
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:31,520
I will only quickly add that it is true that Barbara is not Jung as we know very well.

724
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:40,040
It is also true, as we spoke, that's now the pair that Jung says, my notion of collective

725
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:51,480
unconscious is Zehmon's name, and my idea of archetype is Borquertz War built.

726
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:56,920
We know that Borquertz and Zehmon are two very important sources in Barbara, and perhaps

727
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:03,600
we have a good idea to finally discuss how from Zehmon and Borquertz, common and shared

728
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:11,760
sources to different perspectives on the idea of the over builder and the collective

729
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,040
memory can be articulated.

730
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:20,680
Well, it's true, but it may be, you know, we talked a little bit last night because I

731
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:29,800
started reading this guy Zehmon really because I found him in Valblud, and it's very interesting.

732
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:35,680
But when you return to Valblud after having read Zehmon, you realize that it's not Zehmon

733
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,920
anymore.

734
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:42,120
I don't know what your impression is because you're probably closer to this, but I just

735
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:47,120
thought, oh, so it's not like Jung.

736
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,120
It's denatured.

737
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:51,160
The time you get back to it, it's not Zehmon anymore.

738
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:57,360
It's a kind of, again, I think a dynamic principle that just keeps running through, which escapes

739
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,680
at least me as a reader.

740
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,640
I can't literally pin it down.

741
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:02,960
I can't do the butterfly.

742
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:08,080
But the dynamism isn't with Valblud rethinking Zehmon throughout his life.

743
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,080
No.

744
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:14,320
As a rather static view of Zehmon, rather it is the dynamism of this synchronic immediate

745
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,960
presence that he feels with at Gilandayo, for instance.

746
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,360
Yes, I agree with it.

747
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,280
There's this kind of synchronicity between himself and the artist that he studies because,

748
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:35,440
in part, they're heroically, Valblud's words, struggling with this energy that he is struggling

749
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,160
with as well.

750
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,000
And that's remarkable.

751
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,440
It's very stimulating.

752
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,520
So I have many questions.

753
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:54,640
Two questions for Chris and Siri, and one question for Christina, Joe, and Pierre.

754
01:14:54,640 --> 01:15:00,440
The first question is, stemming from my ignorance, you talk a lot about collective and conscious

755
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,440
Jung.

756
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:06,720
So what about if any, well, not you, but we discuss Jung a lot?

757
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:15,080
What if any relationship between Wundt and Barbara Wundt was almost never mentioned this

758
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,080
more?

759
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:23,880
The second question, particularly for Siri, the relationship between creativity was not

760
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,560
so much addressed so far.

761
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:30,840
So the relationship between mania or hypomania and creativity.

762
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,720
And for the neuroscientists, we have a dream team here about memory.

763
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,640
So something that really is puzzling me.

764
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:46,600
The brain is about 2% of body weight, but it gets about 15% of the heart output.

765
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,600
25.

766
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,600
25 or more than 20% of more than 20.

767
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,160
Based on consumption of oxygen.

768
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,200
So it costs a lot of energy.

769
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,200
Episodic memory.

770
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:04,480
It turns out I attended a lecture by Jerry Torb recently about music.

771
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:09,080
So when you are a kid, you listen every day to the Beatles.

772
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,080
Then you stop.

773
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,520
You decide to shift to a different musical taste.

774
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:20,440
You listen to, I don't know, shoots or some Baroque music.

775
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:27,680
Then all of a sudden you listen to as little as 30 millisecond of a song.

776
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:35,520
You used to listen a lot, but in the last 30 years you never listened to.

777
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,440
It hasn't to be helped because it's very easy.

778
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:50,320
But any song you listen continuously can be recognized immediately.

779
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,600
Or at least that's what I learned.

780
01:16:53,600 --> 01:17:00,480
So if you can confirm that, what is your opinion about the neurophysiological mechanism?

781
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:07,920
Enabling this trace to be sleeping for 30 years if it's a trace at all.

782
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,960
And then boom, to be recovered.

783
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,200
And how much affect has to do with this?

784
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,200
Thank you.

785
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,280
Well, there's the first one.

786
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,400
I'm just going to say something briefly about hypomania and creativity.

787
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:30,280
First of all, I really think that there is a connection, deep connection between the nervous

788
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:34,960
system, motor sensory roots to imaginative acts.

789
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:45,520
I can tell you just personally that for me when I'm writing, the rhythms are extremely

790
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,560
important.

791
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,040
And I can feel when a rhythm is wrong and I correct it.

792
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:57,920
And those rhythms and what I like to call emotional truth, which is why one story and

793
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:02,320
not another in my case, I mean this is a good question.

794
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,480
A fiction writer can write anything.

795
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,560
I can write about flying zebras if I want to.

796
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,760
And no one will say I can't do it.

797
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:18,200
There's no truth truth with a capital T. What there is are emotional truths that are expressed

798
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,760
through the stories and a great deal of that is unconscious.

799
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,960
And it's connected to motor sensory aspects.

800
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,200
I think all creativity is alike.

801
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,920
I don't care what fields you're in.

802
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:36,160
And I always pull out this brilliant quote from Einstein who was asked by Jacques Hadamah

803
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,960
how he worked.

804
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:47,160
And he said, none of my work has anything to do with signs, either mathematical or linguistic.

805
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:53,800
The way I work is visual, muscular and emotional.

806
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:58,360
And later it's translated into symbols.

807
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:06,080
This for me is simply an experience that resonates with my own experience.

808
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:16,000
And so I think that the roots of creativity and vlog, I think at least certainly implicitly

809
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,800
is talking about that.

810
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:27,920
The question of subject and object where there's no difference, this kind of deep bodily experience

811
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:33,880
where there's really no reflection which then becomes a form of reflection, say, in the

812
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:40,240
act of making symbols, whether they are, I think they're different.

813
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:44,600
Linguistic signs are different from images, but nevertheless they're all a form of creating

814
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:45,960
that distance.

815
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,480
There's an aesthetic barrier that's protective.

816
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,720
Yes, and we haven't really, speaking to the question of creativity, we haven't really

817
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:59,200
spoken about Vavwog's unpublished writings, especially in his late years, which are, he

818
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:04,720
calls them a laboratory, he uses this metaphor again and again, for his discoveries, for

819
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:09,280
his numerous unfinished, unfinishable projects.

820
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:16,520
The way that he moves from one idea to another and condenses, fadictates his language in

821
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:23,880
a playful way, is extraordinary as he tries to discover new projects and new connections

822
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:30,240
that he hadn't previously contemplated, even as he returns to his old ideas.

823
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:38,680
So, if you read the diary, the toggle book in the last three years, the palpable enthusiasm,

824
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:45,680
the inspiration that he feels with the new Bruno project is like a little kid.

825
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:56,080
And it's as if he's persuaded himself that he's been able to remake himself.

826
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:03,400
So, for instance, he says at one point, Bruno, with whom I've been engaged with for 40 years,

827
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:09,280
and there's no evidence whatsoever that this is anything but a new project.

828
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:13,320
Just suggest the degree to which he feels it.

829
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,320
Yes, yes.

830
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,320
It's a sibling.

831
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,320
Yes.

832
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,320
That's it.

833
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,320
Okay.

834
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,320
Oh, good.

835
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:23,400
Someone, Christina, maybe you'll talk about one star.

836
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:31,840
Some answer or some talks, some comment about the question of how these memories can last

837
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,240
for such a long time and be retrieved later.

838
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:40,640
That is one of the outstanding questions to be addressed in neuroscience.

839
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:46,960
There are a number of suggestive results.

840
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:51,160
Launter memories rely on biological changes, that's a fact.

841
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:56,520
So, what type of biological changes can maintain these information for more than 30 years?

842
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:04,600
And they are recalled in a fraction of a second or, you know, a very short time they can return.

843
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:16,320
So, you know, study all these mechanisms in the last 20 years, we know that the making

844
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:20,400
of proteins, what's called gene expression that is required for long term memory and the

845
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,760
transition of proteins, because proteins have a much shorter life.

846
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,240
They can not last for more than 30 years.

847
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:31,400
But there are mechanisms that regulates those making of the proteins.

848
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:37,560
One that was mentioned is, you know, chromatin changes, epigenetics.

849
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,320
And those can really last for a long time.

850
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:45,560
I would add to that that another possibility that is still not explored is feedback mechanisms.

851
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:49,040
They can actually maintain a process for a very long time.

852
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:57,440
One that has been very much discussed is actually the network of synapses, the contacts among

853
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:02,200
neurocells, including astrocytes, I would think.

854
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:08,960
And maybe the network is what is able to maintain over time the information.

855
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,560
So they can be changes because of this plasticity.

856
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,840
You can make no association, take out others, modulate the intensity and so on.

857
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:23,280
And there is a substrate, a combination of synapses that is maintained and when triggered

858
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,920
the memory returns.

859
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:29,200
And I live to draw the emotional part very important.

860
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:37,920
I think the music part is, you know, it's interesting that music does have the special

861
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:43,240
way of kind of getting to the sweet spot of emotion and memory in the way that nothing

862
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,880
else can.

863
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:52,680
But I would maintain that the musical memories that do that most are the ones from your adolescence.

864
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:57,480
And the reason for that is because, this is a total speculation, but because of the hormonal

865
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:02,640
upheaval and changes that are taking place at that time, consolidate those memories especially

866
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:08,000
strongly so that when you hear that fragment of the introduction to help or some other

867
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,880
song, it's because it happened at a time when your emotional life was just really starting

868
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:17,400
to happen in a profound way.

869
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,400
Just a comment on the energy utilization.

870
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:28,360
I mean, this idea that maintaining memories is an active process may be also reflected

871
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:35,640
in this very high cost for energetic cost of the brain, which is really ten times as

872
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,640
well.

873
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:42,960
What's puzzling is why the brain should invest energy to keep in memory something the brain

874
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:50,920
will never know if it will happen unless there's some very strong emotion of the evening.

875
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:54,080
But I mean, absolutely.

876
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:57,640
I mean, long-term memories are always connected to emotion.

877
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:02,440
Unless there is another way of making long-term memories, which is true repetition, those are

878
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,960
other types of memories.

879
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,360
And who knows, maybe also repressing memories cost energy.

880
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,360
Thank you.

881
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:17,080
It occurs to me that hearing what we've heard last couple of days and particularly at this

882
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:21,520
session that what VARBORD needs most is what Freud received.

883
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:27,000
I want to say 25 or 30 years ago, a book by Frank Soloway, Freud, The Biology of the

884
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Mind.

885
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,520
We need, it seems like, and I think Andrea mentioned that, you know, VARBORD went to

886
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,640
study medicine after his military service.

887
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:40,240
I don't think we fully appreciate the magnitude, particularly in some of the suggested passages

888
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:47,880
that Spiro has mentioned about VARBORD's reading of Darwin and that his belief that

889
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:55,920
perception involved a kind of energetic transfer, a creation of a symbol that is the stimulus

890
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:02,880
generated a response which became kind of the biological substrate for an internal image.

891
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:09,200
But I believe Professor Rose talks about it very persuasively and that it's the expression

892
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:15,480
of these biological images in pathos formula, schlock, build-up and what have you.

893
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:18,240
This is the stuff I think that VARBORD deserves.

894
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:23,680
He deserves the serious kind of treatment as a the first affective neuroscientist.

895
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:29,480
He, you know, and this business of this collective unconscious may not be as effective as what

896
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:37,320
Timothy Wilson talks about as in a, the, I think he calls it the adaptive unconscious.

897
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:41,520
And so this adaptivity, I think, is one of the things that VARBORD was constantly aware

898
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:46,760
of and why you could have these recurrences, this knock-labin is because the biological

899
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:53,920
substrate remains the same through time and the, you know, the stimuli change but the substrate

900
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,220
remains.

901
01:26:55,220 --> 01:27:08,440
Any thoughts on that adaptive and solway connection?

902
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:12,080
I would just say you make a very compelling case.

903
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:16,800
And I just want to address this idea of the mainia and creativity.

904
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:24,200
I think Freud was right when he said a mild state of depression is for him the best state

905
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:30,640
of creativity and that's because in a depressive position to go to Winnicott you bring the

906
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:36,440
projections back home, take responsibility and it's not all enemies out there, it's

907
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,440
inside.

908
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,640
Yeah, but hypomania does not have to be that.

909
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:47,280
I mean if you look at, you know, certain manic patients and the energy that's, that's produced

910
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:55,920
or even if you look at certain hypergraphic conditions that accompany temporal lobe epilepsy,

911
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:03,120
I'm, for example, Dostevsky, Dostevsky was clearly hypergraphic.

912
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:08,680
He had temporal lobe epilepsy and what he produced in those moments of I would, you can certainly

913
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:12,160
call it hypomania, we're, you know, brilliant works of art.

914
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:16,120
I mean the content is not determined by his hypomania.

915
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:20,840
But I think it can go both ways that depressive positions can produce great art but so can

916
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,360
hypomanic positions.

917
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:26,800
Anybody has a comment to the gentleman's question regarding adaptation?

918
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:27,800
Oh yeah.

919
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:32,560
If not, then we will stop and we will regather here at two o'clock.

920
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:37,280
That'd be a wrap up with about an hour and hour, 15 minutes where all the participants

921
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,440
would be, is it two o'clock?

922
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,880
Yeah, two o'clock.

923
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:45,960
So we finish by about three-third, did the latest.

924
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:46,960
Right.

925
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:47,960
Yeah.

926
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:48,960
Yeah.

927
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:49,960
Yeah.

928
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:50,960
Let's go.

929
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:51,960
Let's go.

930
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:52,960
Okay.

931
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:53,960
Well, sure.

932
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:58,960
Great for you to come.

933
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,960
I do?

934
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,960
Yeah.

935
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:06,960
I, I, I was in immense power.

936
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:07,960
Yeah.

937
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:08,960
Yeah.

938
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:09,960
Yeah.

939
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:15,960
Yeah.
