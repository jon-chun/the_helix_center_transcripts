1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
So I thought to start us off, I might refer back to comments that were introduced by Peter

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,600
yesterday on Bins-Vanger and Warburg, that foreshadow some of what we'll discuss, as

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:22,880
well as Francois's comments in the latter part of the proceedings, where he referenced

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:31,560
the role of the unconscious in creation and recognition of the creative products.

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,480
So if either of you would like to start, we'll take it from there.

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:46,440
It seems to me one point that's been overlooked so far in the symposium is that the psychoanalytic

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:56,560
method is very analogous to Warburg's method of close attention to detail, the hair in

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:06,760
a Roman sarcophagus and the hair in buttecelli, and that the small attention to detail is

9
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,200
also, of course, a psychoanalytic method, that it's a different kind of listening and

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:24,400
any kind of social slips that we hear in conventional conversation, we overlook them, and don't

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,000
make out anything, make anything out of them.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:39,320
But in psychoanalytic work, you pay close attention to the most minor verbal and nonverbal,

13
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,920
and the whole clinical teaching of Wilhelm Reich is to focus on the nonverbal, the body,

14
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,680
the posture, the way the man comes into the room, and the way he sits down or lays down

15
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,720
whether he straightens the cuffs and the seam of his pants and so on.

16
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:13,560
It communicates a great deal and psychoanalytically, the emphasis on the small detail is also what

17
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,200
Warburg has in common, and it was mentioned once yesterday, but I think it deserves a

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:28,240
little more, the technique of Carlo Ginsburg, who looks at the single case history in depth

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:40,200
and the minor things that took place in an inquisition interrogation and so on, and what

20
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,760
the man had to say, the Miller, so on.

21
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:57,200
So I think that when the illustration was made, there was a reference yesterday to the position

22
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,560
of Moses's foot.

23
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:08,960
Now I would say in that great statue of Michelangelo in the Church of San Pietro in Vinkoli, in

24
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:19,040
Romain, the Corzo Cabor, the small detail that one should focus on and that Freud focused

25
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,320
on was not the foot, but the finger which pulled aside that torrent of a beard.

26
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:38,680
It looks like a waterfall coming down a masterpiece and designed for the Pope Julius' tomb, but

27
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:48,680
this indicates for Freud, and I think we can go with him on this, ambivalence about action.

28
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,920
The theory, it's the second time Moses came down from the mountain and he was again enraged

29
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:11,720
and thought of smashing the tablets and thought of it.

30
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:19,680
I think it's not a coincidence, it's time-specific.

31
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:32,180
From there I would say that the fearful and the big thing that I'm not really hearing

32
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:50,160
is the demonic, bestial blood consuming that Barbara feared that came out in his psychosis,

33
00:04:50,160 --> 00:05:05,860
murders, kidnapping, threat, and I think that there's been a decline.

34
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:12,580
I think Freud was right in civilization, it's discontent, it's 1930, there's been a decline

35
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,720
in civilized and that really should be put in quotation marks.

36
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,020
He's behavior just as when he writes about civilized sexual morality and modern nervous

37
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:35,060
illness, he's mocking it and that civilization by 1930 was in danger and he says so, this

38
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,380
is explicit of Erebus is in danger of destroying itself.

39
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,900
There's that much aggression and one of the things that happened in the psychosis is that

40
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:59,700
the aggression wasn't contained, it wasn't bounded and it's really a comment on civilization

41
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:08,780
and if Freud had lived until 1945 we can only fantasy what he might have written about the

42
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,460
state of civilization but who are we to say he was wrong?

43
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:19,020
I think there's been a decline and I think we're on American soil now and you may know

44
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:25,060
that the American national anthem, the Stars Bangled Banner was written by Francis Scott

45
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:32,860
Key as he was in Baltimore Harbor in the War of 1812 to 14 which is the American part

46
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:42,140
of the Napoleonic Wars and he was not a prisoner, he was on a truth ship with a British admiral

47
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,740
in a British general and he had gone down on this truth ship to free a certain Baltimore

48
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:55,860
physician who she got out of British captivity and they were watching the bombardment of

49
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:03,460
a fort, Fort McHenry and the British admiral in general said now you've been with us,

50
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:10,260
you've dined with us and we can't let you go back because you now know our plan for

51
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:17,340
invading Baltimore, that we're going to bombard the fort and then make a landing and try to

52
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:24,580
come in on the east side and so on and so they held him captive during this night in

53
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:30,820
which he watched the bombardment and that's those are the words of the Stars Bangled Banner

54
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:38,660
but there's a level of civilization there between adversaries at war that you know they

55
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:48,140
treated him well, he had to be held for an extra day for this reason and there's a level

56
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,980
of civilization in the American Revolutionary War when you read in the letters of Thomas

57
00:07:52,980 --> 00:08:00,860
Jefferson, he was governor of Virginia at the time and he invited British captive officers

58
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:07,180
to dine in Monticello and there's a nice exchange of correspondence where they thank

59
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:14,260
him for his graciousness and he said you know we may have countries who are at war but we

60
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:21,620
can still be civilized to each other, we've had a debasement really it seems to be of values

61
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:30,340
and I think that the Warburg picture is very much a part of that.

62
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:39,380
Okay, well I'll jump in later, go ahead.

63
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:48,580
Okay, perhaps a question for me, confronting psychoanalysis and history of art who work

64
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:56,580
of Warburg is the common point between these two fields of investigation of research.

65
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:04,460
I think effectively that unconscious is a common point, an intersection and we have

66
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:12,780
to know how Warburg informs fraud and how fraud informs Warburg about unconscious,

67
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:20,300
the dimension of creativity of unconscious, the timeless dimension of unconscious, the

68
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:29,340
dimensionality of unconscious is really important in the creative process and also to interpret

69
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,420
artistic works.

70
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:39,620
But today in this morning I think the question, very difficult question is the place of psychosis

71
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,780
in the process of thinking of Warburg.

72
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:51,140
I am a psychoanalyst and a psychiatrist and it's difficult to speak about psychosis of

73
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:58,940
Warburg that I didn't know, I have no clinical interview with him, I've only his work.

74
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:05,220
Freud said about Schreber that it was possible to read the psychosis directly in the text

75
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,060
of the President Schreber.

76
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:13,740
We don't need to see the patient but I think it's difficult because as a psychoanalysis

77
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:21,980
analyst we have always the risk to be specialized in the prediction of the past.

78
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:29,020
It is an important message to have the history of Warburg, of Warburg work, to look at it

79
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:38,980
from Nemusin for example, Mark Leiben, the Atlas and so on and to use the creativity,

80
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:51,340
the scientific creativity of Warburg to interpret this strange moment between 1918 and 1924 when

81
00:10:51,340 --> 00:11:00,860
he was first in Vienna for psychotic breakdown and after he was in the Binslangerklinik at

82
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:09,740
KÃ¤uzlingen near Zurich and we have access to that description of everyday life of Warburg

83
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:21,220
in this clinic and it was very ill, very difficult moment of his life and how can we make a relationship

84
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:32,340
between these data of the clinical state of Warburg and his mental illness and also to

85
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:39,620
make a relationship with his thinking and art investigation.

86
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:49,020
And I think it is a clinical problem, it is a medical problem, it is also a theoretical

87
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:57,220
problem to make this kind of causality, this kind of relation but we can try to do it.

88
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:06,020
But for me it is necessary to be really prudent in the construction of something between mental

89
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,620
state and intellectual production.

90
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:20,740
It is very easy to make the relation afterwards and to use a retrospective projection, the

91
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,220
illusion of a retrospective and a reflection is difficult.

92
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:32,780
I have a point, it is important to think about unconscious for one part and about psychoses

93
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,780
for the other part.

94
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:47,540
For me the work of Warburg after the psychotic breakdown, perhaps we can discuss about a

95
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:58,700
real access to something new through the psychotic breakdown of Warburg.

96
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:09,620
Because I can speak about applied psychoses to investigation of art, applied psychoses

97
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:16,140
we have to discuss about that, the hypothesis, applied psychoses because we can say it is

98
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:25,500
delirium, delirium Freud was speaking about the question of truth in delirium, direct access

99
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:34,420
to the other, to important access, to access to the meaning, too much meaning, like if a

100
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:44,340
scanner of analysis of the world, delirium and truth, it is one question, one level question.

101
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:57,980
The other level is for me invention, psychotic invention and Warburg created new ideas about

102
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,340
art.

103
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:12,420
It was perhaps inventions, but these inventions finally revealed to be discovery and for me

104
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:20,780
to find how to associate delirium and truth, invention, why not, psychotic invention and

105
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,740
discovery is a very important field of investigation.

106
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:31,300
There are some mathematicians, we can speak about Nash, for example, we can speak about

107
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:42,380
Newton, why not, we were people with these strange borders, strange limits between invention

108
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:54,420
and investigation, when an invention and discovery, when an invention become a discovery, it was

109
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,340
for me an important question about value.

110
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:04,980
Really getting at the heart of a dialectical question that runs through much of psychoanalytic

111
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:11,260
thinking about, you know, is there a dialectical relationship between psychosis and creativity,

112
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,700
disorder and order, entropy and organization?

113
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:21,900
Exactly, exactly, we can say that for artists, it is perhaps well known, better known, artist

114
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:29,980
with psychotic problems, have a creative, or they lose completely the creativity or they

115
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,580
have a possible creativity.

116
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:42,540
But here we are speaking about scientific creativity in a psychotic thinking and I think

117
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:51,620
it is a great question for us, for psychoanalysts, for psychoanalysts, but also to think the

118
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:58,620
relationship between the process of creativity.

119
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:09,860
We are historians too, I think you stated very well and within psychoanalytic history

120
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,740
there is something of an anticipation of that, say, in Aaron's chris' regression in the

121
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,740
service of the ego.

122
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:21,100
It is very interesting to think how close Chris was to the Warburg school and how important

123
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:31,100
it was to him and just to follow up on some of the comments here.

124
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:38,540
In the work that I have done in studying Warburg's ideas and also for Zoxel's ideas in comparison

125
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:51,020
to Freud and to Chris, what strikes me is not only an intersection in idea and theory, but

126
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:58,260
a kind of methodological intersection that Peter also was referring to.

127
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,140
I was interested first to see how psychoanalysts interpreted culture, and I was interested

128
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:08,380
in seeing how the interpreters of culture were using psychology and Warburg was absolutely

129
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,180
crucial in this.

130
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:19,180
One idea I think that Warburg was advancing so to speak without putting it this way.

131
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:25,740
He talked about the afterlife of antiquity, but the return of the repressed, and that

132
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:35,140
this was an idea, an attitude or an interest of those in psychology and culture in the

133
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:41,700
early 20th century that could bridge what they were doing.

134
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:48,220
Warburg, what interested me in Warburg is not only the idea, but the methodology he was

135
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,660
pursuing before his breakdown.

136
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:59,140
What I found interesting was this, the very close attention to detail, when you read Warburg's

137
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:07,180
essays, and don't before expanding upon the content of his ideas or theories, but just

138
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,260
the methodological approach of his essays.

139
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:17,660
How extraordinarily careful he is in building an argument.

140
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,700
Excessively careful.

141
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,140
It's very interesting to point out, because as we're talking about him, we're talking

142
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:33,380
about very large, universalistic conceptions that stretch across time and borders that

143
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,540
were very important to him, and that psychology was key to establishing this.

144
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:45,620
In his own essays, how interested he was in particularities, and being able to cite the

145
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:52,020
source of almost every single proposition that he was making.

146
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:59,020
And so he could argue, you know, God is in the detail, right, was one of his phrases,

147
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,020
right?

148
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,060
He could also say the devil is in the detail, but God is in the detail.

149
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:11,780
Also his idea that within the image, the image is an accretion across time.

150
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:18,340
What attaches to the image is as important as the final product that we see.

151
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,780
And that Warburg didn't follow this as much as they Zoxel did.

152
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:28,820
I mean, Zoxel was very taken by the idea that you could trace these accretions and sort them

153
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,700
out in an even more detailed analysis.

154
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:39,700
And of course, Warburg thought that the image was in fact a kind of action, that to do art

155
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,420
was repeating an action, the action that was portrayed, and that it was a step from ritual,

156
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:52,140
which was too close to something that was further from it, more symbolic.

157
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:59,020
And he was very careful, and he saw the images, he saw images not only as documents in the

158
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,220
way we've been talking about it, but he saw it was essential to apply documents to an

159
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,300
understanding of the image.

160
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,740
And so when he was in Florence, he was not only looking, he was only looking within the

161
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,940
churches at the images, he was going into the archives, the family letters, the family

162
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,620
correspondences.

163
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:24,540
And he was key to developing a method of studying art through the patrons, through patronage,

164
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,380
through study of pageantry and ritual at the time.

165
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:36,420
And to come back to the point I began with, before the breakdown, he is so careful to

166
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:43,660
establish this context, that the context was almost away, was both an advanced methodology

167
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:49,900
for interpreting the image, but almost a way you can almost feel him trying to keep composed,

168
00:20:49,900 --> 00:21:00,300
trying to keep these ambivalent, conflicting issues he's dealing with, both within himself

169
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,940
and culture, to find this balance.

170
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:10,140
And it's fascinating to read his scholarly method as a way of sort of trying to keep himself

171
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,380
together, and moving forward.

172
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:18,900
And then comes the stage, right, where invention and investigation suddenly merge.

173
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
Perhaps not.

174
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:26,860
And he can say something about your argument, because it seems to me very important when

175
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:36,020
he was in Yanai, after in Bins Van Gehr clinic at Kuy Tlingen, he has this problem that was

176
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:45,580
very important for Bins Van Gehr, the flight of ideas, and too much meaning, everything

177
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:53,580
in relation to everything, and to have a too big access to the meaning.

178
00:21:53,580 --> 00:22:02,900
And I asked me about the process of healing of Verburg.

179
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:13,780
And we can say that the question of the details is very important, and it has something like,

180
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:22,780
if we can say, metonymic style of thinking, thinking from the part to arrive to the global

181
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,660
meaning, starting from the part, from the detail.

182
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,660
The God is in the detail.

183
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:36,460
It's the idea is like he was looking for a root of himself in the detail.

184
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:44,500
And we have for one part, flight of ideas, and for the other part, metonymic style of

185
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:55,460
thinking, interval, detail, the movement, the foot of the Ninfia Furentina, the foot of

186
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:06,260
the Gardiva for Freud, the foot of the boys, moments of suspension, a rupture in the flight

187
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,940
of ideas.

188
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:18,580
And I think perhaps we can have the hypothesis that he cured himself using the interval, the

189
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:29,340
suspension of the action, because he was in a flow of action, and all his intellectual

190
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:36,300
work and intellectual creativity was here to stop these flight of ideas.

191
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:46,660
And perhaps it is linked together in the process of creativity, process of scientific creativity

192
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,820
of verbal.

193
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:56,180
We think this frame of mind of trying to find parallels between artists and psychoanalysts.

194
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,900
I would like to introduce a third term, which I think is absolutely crucial, and that's

195
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,460
historiography.

196
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,980
I think that both complicates and expands the whole frame of what we're discussing, because

197
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,300
it's precisely historiography.

198
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:14,900
There is the analysis of the historical, the art historical text in this case, which is

199
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,540
the form of analysis, or even a psychoanalysis.

200
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:23,340
And what I find very, very interesting in this case is that the art historian himself

201
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:30,420
in Christling becomes an object of analysis by a psychoanalysis, namely Ben Swanger, who

202
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,340
not only analyzes him, but also his writings.

203
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:40,020
We know that he had read before he heard Christling in a famous lecture on the snake

204
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,940
ritual that not heard he had read carefully his works.

205
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:50,060
He mentioned Luther in his correspondence, which was just published in 1921, year before

206
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,820
he arrived in Christlingen.

207
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,700
In a letter he mentions the society essay of 1907.

208
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:41,740
And from certain comments we definitely understand that he had read the dissertation on B

209
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
it's telling.

210
00:24:42,740 --> 00:25:06,740
I'd like to bring one example, which is he, Ben Swanger's comment after Barbara gave

211
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:13,180
his lecture on the image of the Pueblo in 1923.

212
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,860
And his comment was rather dismissive.

213
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:21,980
He was very critical that the lecture was almost chaotic in its structure.

214
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,460
And of course, that Barbara was content and he was met with success.

215
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,180
But he had a lot of criticisms.

216
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:33,060
And in fact, he mentioned something that I find very symptomatic.

217
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:39,700
He says that what he does is he covers everything with so much accessory element.

218
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,700
And he calls that bivac.

219
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,980
He uses the term.

220
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:49,020
And the main events are left as philological illusions that very few people in the audience

221
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,340
can understand.

222
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:56,700
I think that's the most ingenious diagnosis that Ben Swanger ever had of Barbara, beyond

223
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:02,260
his mental condition, but of his own work, even if he's critical and negative.

224
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,740
Because that's precisely the core of Barbara's logic.

225
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:13,140
That is to bring the accessory or the detail, as we said, that is so much used in second

226
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,900
analytic interpretation to the very center of interpretation.

227
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,300
But of course, he's right to say that things are covered by accessories.

228
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:28,220
But then we can start asking ourselves, what's precisely the function of these accessory elements,

229
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,540
both in Barbara's historiography, but also in Freud's analysis.

230
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:40,300
For example, that to me, if I can make a parallel function similar to the role of screen memories,

231
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:45,380
images that appear again and again, and cover the main facts.

232
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,260
And yet the only access we have to the main facts are these screen memories.

233
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,060
And we have to go and move through them.

234
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,660
And usually there are certain details.

235
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,820
There's an image of the little botanical specimen flower, which is connected to all

236
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,820
these different things.

237
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:08,100
And to the flower bouquet that Freud wanted to give you his life, to the little book that

238
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,820
he had seen in a bookstore, and finally to Opium and Prokene, which is the main effect.

239
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,300
But we were never have gone there without the image of the little flower.

240
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,420
So I'm thinking, what if we think of images in these terms, in art history?

241
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:29,100
And see what appears as an accessory element that covers things can also reveal them.

242
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:39,060
Oh no, it's an excellent discussion, because it's also a discussion about a lesson of clinic.

243
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:51,140
To treat a psychotic breakdown, it's not only to put it away, but to use the solutions of

244
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,740
the subject.

245
00:27:52,740 --> 00:28:00,860
And here with detailed historiography, the context, all these kind of things we can postulate

246
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:11,740
that Ben Zwanger used that to treat verbal, not treatment, putting away the symptoms, but

247
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:21,060
treatment using the solution that opened the symptoms of the patient.

248
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,780
And perhaps it was an important contribution.

249
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:35,620
I know, for example, that Ben Zwanger proposed that to Prince Horne will come to his clinic

250
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:44,580
to meet verbal and to discuss with him about creation and art and so on.

251
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:50,940
The thing is that he gave Prince Horne's book on publication in 1922, and gave it to

252
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,340
Ben Zwanger, to Barbara.

253
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,180
This is what today you'd call a relational method of treatment.

254
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:06,580
He also had Barbara to tea and to dinner with the family, which is the method he acquired

255
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:13,580
from his teacher, Euigen Bloyler, used to bring patients in the Bergholsley, including

256
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:20,380
Sabina Spielrine, and you find letters from Bloyler to Mrs. Spielrine and, rest of them,

257
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:27,500
the Don about her behavior is much better today, and we had her to tea and so forth.

258
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:36,980
And I think the very humanistic treatment, the reward, would be you get to go for a walk

259
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:43,580
with Ben Zwanger and his son when the...

260
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:50,260
...Stubborn wouldn't need his breakfast.

261
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,900
Ben Zwanger laid down the rule.

262
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:57,700
You have to eat your breakfast by ten o'clock, and then you can go for a walk with me and

263
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,700
so on.

264
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,940
Now, I question this idea of really psychosis and creativity.

265
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,060
I don't think it's that simple.

266
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:17,420
I think that Lawrence Kubi had a correct intuition when he went back past the structural model

267
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,020
to the topographic model.

268
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:27,660
He said there's something that happens between the unconscious, which admits ideas to the

269
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,820
preconscious, and then you can work with them from the preconscious.

270
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,700
He goes back to the early model, and that's his model of creativity.

271
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:43,820
I think when you read Kafka, for example, he says, an artist cannot be alone enough,

272
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:49,820
meaning he has to go inside deeply and bring it up and work with it.

273
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:59,740
Now, Warburg was not particularly creative after release from the Croitsling, and he gave

274
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:04,980
a couple of addresses, talks to opening Congresses and so on.

275
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:16,940
But there's another kind of creativity that psychoanalysis, free sexuality, and Warburg

276
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:24,220
was able to enjoy a relationship with his assistant, Gertrude, and they went to Rome

277
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,380
several times, long trips to Italy.

278
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:37,300
There's a downside to that, that he necessarily, not necessarily strike that, that he didn't

279
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,020
remain attentive to his family.

280
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:46,980
When his wife writes, what shall we give the children for holiday?

281
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,500
He's dismissive.

282
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,220
Buy them whatever they want.

283
00:31:51,220 --> 00:32:02,300
But we have ample record that there he was in Roma and in Italy having a very good time.

284
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:08,740
I suggest there's a new release of a sexual freedom that came out of his treatment.

285
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:19,860
The harsh underside of European culture, remember that charming anecdote that in 1929, when

286
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:27,660
the Pope signed the Concordot with Mussolini, and it meant that Catholic instruction would

287
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:34,180
be given in schools and across in all the classrooms in the secular kingdom of Italy,

288
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:42,740
which since 1871 had been secular, there was great activity on the streets of Roma, and

289
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:47,340
they told him, don't go out, it's dangerous for foreigners, you don't know what's going

290
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,620
to happen.

291
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:54,340
He stayed out all day and half the night and came back and he said, you know, I've been

292
00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:01,540
studying the primitive underside of European culture for 40 years, and now you deny me

293
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:07,020
the chance to see the rebirth of the primitive here in Rome.

294
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:15,660
It was, I think, what he's looking for in culture, the primitive underside.

295
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:25,340
And Freud also incidentally found this in himself during World War I, terrible.

296
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:31,140
There was, mentioned yesterday, I think it was Diddy Huberman, that you could send a

297
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:38,060
letter from belligerent Italy to Austria and vice versa.

298
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:44,780
I don't know what his data is, but Freud's correspondence with Binswonger, detailed,

299
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:57,020
how after the war, his son is still in captivity, in the Abruzzi, he's wounded, he's in a

300
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:02,420
hospital, he's lost his pack, and Freud cannot communicate with him.

301
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:08,180
All they had was a postcard from the Red Cross, and so Freud writes to Binswonger, and it's

302
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,300
a long correspondence about this.

303
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,380
If you are in neutral Switzerland, you can get money to him, please help him.

304
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:25,100
And in fact, Binswonger did that, sent 500 Swiss francs to Martin, and we have Martin's

305
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,540
memoirs, where he said, due to my father's excellent international collections, I was

306
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:36,220
able to buy drinks for all the other prisoners.

307
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:45,260
Now that's the ego functioning of a very good father, but in himself, Freud discovers.

308
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:51,580
You remember the dream, which he, fortunately for us, the interpretation of dreams is something

309
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,420
that he revised and added to.

310
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:01,500
It's in the chapter on wish fulfillment in dreams, as a dream of 1919.

311
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:11,780
Take a look at it, the text by the manifest, let me just tell you about the, the manifest

312
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:21,700
content is that he gets a check and says to his wife, this is dream content, what is this,

313
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,700
5000 croner?

314
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,100
Do you know anything about it?

315
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
And she said, no.

316
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:36,860
And he said, well, we received this, an association, that's what a unit sends to the family of

317
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,780
killed soldiers, under of a seer.

318
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:50,260
And so then later in the dream, he sees a bandaged man reach for something up in a cupboard, and

319
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,220
he says, can I help you and the man doesn't answer.

320
00:35:53,220 --> 00:36:00,700
That's the manifest content and the latent content that he then associates to is who doesn't

321
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,260
answer, the dead don't answer.

322
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,860
And he brings about the death of his son.

323
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:13,460
I think the relation between manifest and latent content, you can see it in verbous historiography

324
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,300
itself, that is, especially towards his sources.

325
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,260
I wanted to mention Freud, for example, he does not appear in any of the published sources,

326
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:28,780
but so do not appear at the people like Darwin or Vignonle that were important to him.

327
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:34,660
So it's precisely his notes, the things that are today kept in the title custom that give

328
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:39,220
us a much more complete idea of what he had read.

329
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,100
And they give us the background beyond what has been published.

330
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,940
And also, it's your remark that, well, he didn't do much after he came back, he did

331
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
a lot.

332
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,220
But no publication, you're right.

333
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,220
Nothing was published.

334
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,660
But he gave lectures, he gave courses, he gave a nice exhibition.

335
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,660
And also, the work of our book throughout his life, even before the collabs, was precisely

336
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,060
that of making research.

337
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,180
And the research would not always lead to a publication.

338
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:13,980
There are hundreds of unfinished lectures, just for the sake of research that are there,

339
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,740
and somebody else perhaps later will come and finish them and publish them.

340
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,740
Exactly.

341
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,740
Yeah.

342
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,740
And they'll be very happy.

343
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,620
And I also wanted to mention, in terms of its relation to Freud, that's also a big

344
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,860
mystery, because there are very few notes on Freud in the title guest.

345
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:49,360
And I looked at it two or three, one of the town do

346
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,100
one thing, okay, we know he didn't have his books with him at the time.

347
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Couldn't he ask his finger?

348
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,900
You know, his finger had all the Freud's work at the time.

349
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:05,820
So I really want to ask what the phrase I miss Freud taught him in taboo.

350
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,820
And which chapter?

351
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,540
The third chapter on animism?

352
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:14,700
Or the second chapter on prohibition, or the killing of the father on the fourth?

353
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:20,820
All of these issues, that as I say, Freud is somewhat a latent content in verbal.

354
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:26,420
That's why we were also happy when the new Vermont book came out and made these connections

355
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,460
manifest at that time.

356
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,860
And I think the relation to psychonality is important there.

357
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:37,860
But that's, I would say, the latent connection to all sorts of different authors and writings

358
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,060
is an element of verbal.

359
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,540
And also how he converts everything.

360
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:49,020
I would not call Varebuk, either like Freudian or Davidian or anything.

361
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,060
Anything that he takes from other authors, he totally metabolizes it.

362
00:38:53,060 --> 00:39:03,540
There's a huge distance between him, which is I think a thinking distance.

363
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:15,020
An analogy which has to be limited in encountering Warburg as a scholar and the methods he used,

364
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:23,100
I thought of a completely different type of historian, the completely different vision.

365
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,420
And it was E.P. Thompson.

366
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:32,060
Only because once E.P. Thompson was asked, how would you define your method as a historian?

367
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:35,660
And his answer was anything that works.

368
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:40,300
And I think that sums up E.P. Thompson brilliantly.

369
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,940
That was his mindset.

370
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:53,060
And you read through Warburg's pre-1923 writings and even the Hopi lecture.

371
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:57,500
He was willing to try anything that worked.

372
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:03,820
And I think that it's very significant to keep in mind when thinking about why discuss

373
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,740
Warburg in connection with psychoanalysis, with neuroscience.

374
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,980
I keep going back to the method.

375
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:20,140
And the theories, I find they can be inspirational.

376
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:26,100
But for people who are pursuing work from different disciplines, I think it's the methodological

377
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:31,220
spirit, the methodological activity that seems so crucial.

378
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:37,500
When he says, you know, God's within the detail, when Freud talks about the importance of detail,

379
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:46,660
I also think, for example, of a neuroscientist, right, Erkendell, who in search of memory described

380
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:52,220
that, you know, his methodology was one cell at a time.

381
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,900
One cell at a time.

382
00:40:53,900 --> 00:41:02,460
And that's not so far removed from Warburg and that in that early 20th century approach.

383
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,580
You know, one detail at a time.

384
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:10,740
Now what Warburg found in the sort of detail of the nymph, right, I just add to follow

385
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:16,140
up on where there could be intersection and instinct theory.

386
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,420
Warburg also found death in the nymph.

387
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:24,500
Not just the sort of return of the repressed, but death.

388
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,220
And I think it's possible to compare, for example, what he was doing in interpreting

389
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,580
the Botticelli with what Freud was doing in the theme of the three caskets and interpreting

390
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:40,500
the fates and interpreting, especially Cordelia in the end, that this too, I mean, Shakespeare

391
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,300
was Renaissance in that sense.

392
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:51,420
And Cordelia, you know, is in a sense Freud's nymph as Grediva was.

393
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,940
And Cordelia is death.

394
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:59,340
And represented very much, very similarly in the sort of mental image, which is another

395
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,620
issue that I thought would be interesting.

396
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:06,260
You know, Warburg's, you know, that the image that we see is also accompanied by mental

397
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,100
image that has to be understood.

398
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:17,740
But the, those links as well, but methodologically, I think, yes, if one wants to build upon Warburg,

399
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,940
I think one turns to the methodology.

400
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:26,620
But that's speaking from someone who comes at it as a historian, and neither an art historian

401
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,620
nor psychologist.

402
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:37,860
I wouldn't have if you'd agree that the Croydselian lecture, the method is presendges, Fernand

403
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:44,100
Braudel, and the method we call Anal today.

404
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,380
The environment, the climate, the really.

405
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,380
That's very, yes, there's elements of that.

406
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,740
The first time that you use the term oovald, right, which is very negative.

407
00:42:53,740 --> 00:43:01,820
I think it's an important field of research in this conference, is the research conference

408
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:10,220
that we have to work about it, because it's not for me important to know if Freud was before

409
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,860
or marble before, or the marble knows Freud and so on.

410
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:25,380
But we have the same questions at stake in the same moment, and in different fields of

411
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,380
research.

412
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,620
It's very, something very impressive for an historical point of view.

413
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:35,660
Why do you have, simultaneously, Freud?

414
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,780
Why not the so-so for the question of the meaning in Geneva?

415
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:45,020
You have Schoenberg changing completely the music.

416
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,500
You have CÃ©zanne in painting.

417
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:52,060
You have a simultaneous change in different fields.

418
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:57,740
And for me, it's very surprising, very, very strange.

419
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:04,260
Even if they don't know them between.

420
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:10,540
I don't know for historical point of view, what is this kind of simultaneity?

421
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:15,620
Paul Ombart had the idea of an encounter between different intellectual living at the same

422
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:21,580
time, discussing what will be the discussion between, we have to create the discussion between

423
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:29,700
Freud and Verborg about detail, if you have a prior fiction.

424
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,700
They come together.

425
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:42,460
It's not me and you, it's Freud and Binswanger and Verborg discussing about the function

426
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:50,660
of metonymic thinking in the analysis of detail in clinic and history of art.

427
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,060
We are in this kind of situation.

428
00:44:54,060 --> 00:45:00,700
The other question that was presented about the tournament taboo, I miss my tournament

429
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,900
taboo, is fascinating and my association would be to murder.

430
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:10,700
It's the murder of sons and then the murder of the father and this is something he was

431
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:15,340
very obsessed with.

432
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:25,180
The outbreak of the psychosis was getting a pistol in Homburg, 1921, 18, but it's not

433
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:33,140
a country that had the Second Amendment and weapons all over the place.

434
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:39,540
He was afraid of murders, of his family, of himself and so on.

435
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,020
Tournament taboo, it's a wonderful.

436
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:49,220
The other question about your president discussion is the fact that for me I had the impression

437
00:45:49,220 --> 00:46:03,540
like you said that Verborg, after the breakdown after the clinic of Binswanger between 1924

438
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:08,660
and the death in 1929, had a very important creative work.

439
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,180
After life, ready to be.

440
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,180
Exactly.

441
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,180
Reanimated.

442
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,100
Yes, have the impression of that.

443
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,580
It is the second language.

444
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:22,540
The library, the nemosign, all these research we discussed yesterday was very central after

445
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,300
this experience of psychosis.

446
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,900
What you see is a kind of condensation of the things.

447
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:34,660
He goes back to the early things, even the Bodicelli and others, and condenses and I

448
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,180
don't want to say systematizes.

449
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,940
Somehow he puts together in the Nemo Ximian, Atlas, etc.

450
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,660
All of these themes that come back with all the Bodicelli and others and some new ones

451
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:51,540
such as Northern Renaissance, Baroque art that he never had touched before.

452
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:58,740
So, he revisits his own work with a new point of view.

453
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:03,540
I want to mention one other detail in the Kreuzlingen lecture.

454
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:10,180
There's one word that comes up and it's the only pathological one and it's the term schizoid

455
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,500
in the very second page of the published text.

456
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,820
And he says that to us, and that's a critique.

457
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,740
I don't know who he means us, the westerners, the audience, etc.

458
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:29,260
This dual practice between fantastic magic and sober perpersonist seems to be the symptom

459
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,340
of a cleavage.

460
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:36,500
But to the Indian, this is not schizoid, that he uses the term schizoid, but the sign of

461
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:41,020
an endless communicability with the environment.

462
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,260
So this is one time, and I don't know who he refers to.

463
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:55,140
The Indians, himself, it's one of these really dramatic moments that his own state and the

464
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:00,460
state of an entire culture that is considered schizoid, and that's his accusation.

465
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,300
This is not schizoid.

466
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:09,780
And that also sounds less far-book and more, I would say, Ben Zwanger of the phenomenological

467
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:14,180
era, the endless communicability with the environment.

468
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,180
That's not for the audience.

469
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:21,620
The Freud would consider the finely-hish oomphat, the hostile environment that we have to protect

470
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,620
ourselves.

471
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:28,620
It's a very interesting remark, and perhaps you can say something about that through your

472
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:35,740
work about verbal, because I was surprised that in the beginning, and it is also present

473
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:46,060
in the letter of Ben Zwanger to Freud in November 1921 for Ben Zwanger for a verb was a schizophrenic

474
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,060
patient.

475
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:55,340
In the School of Zurich, Bergelsli, he looked at the pre-senial delirium and something

476
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,460
like a schizophrenia.

477
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:09,220
And after the consultation of Kraplin in 1923, I think, Kraplin said it's not schizophrenic,

478
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:18,060
it is an endless flight of ideas, a mania.

479
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:25,220
He said it is a mixed mania codepressive state with a very good pronostic.

480
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:36,660
And after this diagnosis of Kraplin, the vision of Ben Zwanger about verbal changed completely,

481
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:45,540
and the evolution of, like if it was a change of paradigm, suddenly a change of paradigm,

482
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:50,900
for Ben Zwanger, for the clinic, but also for verbal game self.

483
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,820
But it is why it is very good that they prepared this book about the different documents with

484
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:00,500
the idea of endless healing.

485
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:09,060
It's a flight of ideas, the flight of ideas become an endless healing.

486
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:14,660
But I think there's a consensus, I'm hearing a consensus that was a successful treatment,

487
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:22,980
that there's a reconstitution, and whether this is a new burst of creativity, I don't

488
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:23,980
think so.

489
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:31,700
I'm building the library, an obsessively building the library was a major feat in Hamburg and

490
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:39,180
the details of the architecture and that they had tubes to send things from top to bottom

491
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,180
and so on.

492
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:46,700
So, I think it's a lovely building, which, do you know the, bibliotheca, John Giacomo

493
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:53,220
Feltronelli in Milan, the dome with the lights coming through?

494
00:50:53,220 --> 00:51:01,540
That's what it reminded me of, the photographs that we've seen.

495
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:06,620
What you point to is something to focus on about his post-Cortslingen life.

496
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,900
It's interesting also to think about in light of the library, because Warburg in the library

497
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:18,860
was to create a kind of community, so to speak, for himself, that he could not create for himself

498
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:25,740
in the outside world and maybe began to, you know, very, very late, too late in the 20s.

499
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,820
But when you think about how he thought of that library and the phrase he used to describe

500
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:36,580
to his principal organization the Good Companion, I mean when you think about Warburg's scholarship

501
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:44,300
and then that term put books next to Good Companions.

502
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:52,940
That's a very different attitude now and it's not unscholatively, but it's an idea of what

503
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:57,940
he's doing through his scholarship that is sort of a search for kind of community, that

504
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:02,420
by putting these books together, by putting these books together, he can be, he's in some

505
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:08,660
way putting the people together, and that he's communicating with them and it should be Good

506
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:14,780
Companions and that makes it natural, not artificial.

507
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:19,940
And to use the word natural to describe what Warburg does is very difficult at that time

508
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:27,380
because it is so, you know, because his search for composure is so complete, but there in

509
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:33,900
the library, right, this community that he creates for himself, one has to try to imagine,

510
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,620
you know, what it, you can't, you can imagine what it might have felt like, but I think

511
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,660
any scholar would be able to appreciate that.

512
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:44,900
That's something that doesn't distance us from Warburg.

513
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:52,940
And one more point having to do with how one finds, again, in the method an access to or

514
00:52:52,940 --> 00:53:00,540
at least a way of thinking about his sort of relationship to the world and to himself,

515
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:05,180
when Warburg goes in search of the documents, you know, when he goes in search of family

516
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:09,980
documents and business documents, I mean, he reads the accounts, you know, he's reading

517
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:15,060
the bank, the business accounts and the family memoirs.

518
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:24,980
Now I'm trying to picture Warburg handling the documents that were written by or being

519
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:30,140
in proximity of the documents of the people that created them.

520
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:35,700
And when he spoke about the artist sort of reviving antiquity, for him he thought that

521
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:40,060
the artist was putting himself in some kind of danger, so to speak, that there could be

522
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:45,340
some kind of spark, right, that would set something off, that there was some ego issue

523
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,780
that could result.

524
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:50,300
Well now Warburg is with these documents.

525
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:54,700
And I just try to picture myself, all right, I mean now, again, methodologically, right,

526
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:59,620
he's putting himself into proximity with these documents.

527
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,100
What is going on when he does that?

528
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,100
I have no idea.

529
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:09,620
But he was very, very intent, right, on being with the documents.

530
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:13,300
And I think that was something that was even very different from other art historians at

531
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,900
the time who emphasized the same kind of procedure.

532
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:22,140
Are you almost implying that there was a self-healing strategy in this piece?

533
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,140
Perhaps.

534
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,140
I mean, I'm not going to.

535
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,820
I think that it was a self-healing strategy.

536
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:33,780
But I think also that Binswang had used the self-healing strategy of Warburg.

537
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,420
This is very important.

538
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:48,500
Perhaps the documents, the metonymic interest for details, the metonymic style of thinking,

539
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:54,380
the question of movement, of inhibition of movement, as we discussed yesterday, is very

540
00:54:54,380 --> 00:55:06,340
important for Warburg himself to stop something which is in too much excitation.

541
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:12,740
So psychometric excitation.

542
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,020
Excess of the leaving.

543
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,460
Excess of meaning.

544
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:22,300
Excess of the signals of the body, perhaps.

545
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:27,140
And for him, perhaps the document was like a rupture.

546
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,460
But I think it also was a risk.

547
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,460
He was willing to undergo in some sense.

548
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,580
In other words, a risk he had to take.

549
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,420
I'm getting them, speculation.

550
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:42,300
In other words, the two aren't, they're not opposed interpretations.

551
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:47,380
But to undergo healing, you have to take a risk.

552
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:53,740
And there was always, just as in the image, as healing for the artist entails a risk.

553
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:57,260
And the risk that the artist took, he's taking with the documents.

554
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,260
Or I'm completely wrong.

555
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:05,300
That's not a reflection about treatment of psychosis, because to use the solution of

556
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:14,620
the subject, the invention of the subject, as it is for one part risk and for one part

557
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,620
an issue.

558
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:21,420
And we have this difficult way.

559
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:26,460
I think it was really important in the strategy of Bin Suang-e.

560
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:32,300
I think in that question of dealing with documents, I think he tweets both documents,

561
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:36,980
papers, either historical documents or even books, contemporary books.

562
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:41,340
And he's encountered with people in the same way as encounters.

563
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:45,020
For example, the first time he reads Darwin, he puts in his diary.

564
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:51,700
30 years later, he's going in the front cover of the book and write that I read this in

565
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:56,420
1989 and when I first read it, I thought that's finally a book that helps me.

566
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:01,980
So it's an encounter that he goes back to again and again, as if the book was a real

567
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,980
person.

568
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:09,900
As Richard Vigo recently wrote an article about a bar books reading of Darwin.

569
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:15,500
And the next day, he was reading that for two days in Florence in the library, the next

570
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,220
day he meets his wife for the first time.

571
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:24,380
And he leaves Darwin because he notes, finishes, and he plays the Ciceroana with Mary.

572
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,740
So what does this mean?

573
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:30,820
The most important book that I have read so far, and then the next day I meet the most

574
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,540
important person in my life.

575
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:39,100
I think psychoanalysts could, you know, put this sort of coincidence that happens at

576
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,100
a time.

577
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,580
And, you know, it's a periodic one.

578
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:46,780
I even think, and somebody said it yesterday, you know, he had to visit the Pueblo as if

579
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,300
it was a document, you know, and he reads them as documents.

580
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:55,780
And in fact, it's sometimes when we look at the notes, we don't know some of his sketches

581
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,100
of pottery, for example.

582
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,900
Did he see that live or did he see it from a book?

583
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,900
Because he also goes to the Smithsonian and other sources to look at books.

584
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:10,820
So it's a scholarly research and people, life people, real people, and historical sources

585
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,460
somehow come together in literary sources.

586
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:21,820
And even, and that would be the most extreme argument that could make, is that his visit

587
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:28,580
to Christ again, in Bellevue, somehow ultimately acts as this encounter with the very things

588
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:33,940
that he was researching his entire life, that is, madness, irrationality, et cetera.

589
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:39,580
I'm not saying that he pursued that visit, but in the end that's how it functions.

590
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:45,100
There's almost an implication in what you're saying in terms of his encounter with books

591
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:52,700
and objects that almost a retention of the ability to animate the inanimate that is a

592
00:58:52,700 --> 00:59:02,140
quality that people like Greenacre attributed to highly creative people, that what is so

593
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:07,420
immediately available to us in early childhood to sort of take the inanimate and in some way

594
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,660
make it animated or to anthropomorphize, you know, all living things.

595
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:17,340
I would say even the relationship between the books that you mentioned, it's fairly, if

596
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,100
not animistic, tautomistic.

597
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,540
That is, you have all the books on the snake right next to the books on the ego and right

598
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,620
next to another bird, et cetera, et cetera.

599
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:31,660
So there is this totemic affinity in analogy between the books, which some time you can

600
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,500
rearrange in new analogies.

601
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,500
Right.

602
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,500
Pre-corresponder.

603
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,820
I've been to a new world.

604
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:45,620
I contiguity, and not continuity, introducing a discontinuity, because what is surprising

605
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:55,280
with Warburg in the library of Warburg in my impression is that it's not a psychotic confusion.

606
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:05,220
It is in production tensions, rupture, contradiction, details in the process of the book.

607
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:13,740
The process of the organization of the library, also in the iconology, if the image was a

608
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:20,100
stop, an open question, an enigma, and not a source of confusion.

609
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:26,260
And perhaps in the process of healing, it was a decisive moment when it was not in the

610
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:34,740
flight of ideas and confusion, and he opposed something which is suspension, fracture, tension,

611
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,300
and rupture, contradiction.

612
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:45,500
And it was his way of breaking what he thought were artificial, even, unproductive boundaries

613
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,220
between disciplines.

614
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:55,060
I mean, the catalog of the Good Companion meant as a methodological result is that books

615
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:59,980
from entirely different disciplines were going to be found next to each other.

616
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:08,940
And to my mind, again, in a conference like this, that was Warburg's sort of truly kind

617
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:18,180
of prescient step, that this is an alternative organization, and we must begin to conceive

618
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,140
of this interdisciplinarity.

619
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:28,420
At a time when he probably felt very constrained by that, there was no clear method forward,

620
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:35,020
although in a few years Freud would found him ago, psychoanalysis applied to all of the

621
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:38,220
Geysys Viscenschaft and all the humanities and social sciences.

622
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:43,540
But Warburg himself in that library was his way of trying to create a framework for doing

623
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:50,540
what so many people now across disciplines conceive of as necessary.

624
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,540
Yes.

625
01:01:51,540 --> 01:02:00,380
But the question remains why these kind of solutions of invention were finally discovery.

626
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:06,420
For me, it's very mysterious, from invention to discovery.

627
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:14,420
But I think one of the things that I want to pick up about the treatment, I think it was

628
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:21,300
successful, and I think it's significant of Franz Juaz, which you point out that Ben Zwanger

629
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,300
was quite pessimistic.

630
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:28,700
He said, in fact, it's hopeless in 1921 and that there's a move.

631
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:38,620
Now Freud and Bloyler told us, and there's a psychodynamic truth in it, that behind every

632
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:46,860
psychosis there's a kernel of truth, something happened, something that we can get at if

633
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:53,780
you listen properly, get into the phenomenological world of the patient.

634
01:02:53,780 --> 01:03:09,260
Now one of the things in his delusions was murders, recounted briefly that he was very

635
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:10,260
concerned.

636
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:21,700
He had a big cartai of all the Jewish persecutions and the blood ritual murder in the barber archives.

637
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,820
It's there.

638
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:29,620
And one of his charges against Ben Zwanger was he wants to murder the Jews.

639
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,860
Comes up several times.

640
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:47,620
And I think this psychosis of murder and in the delusions in Croitslingen, he says, this

641
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:54,180
male orderly is the one who poisons me every morning.

642
01:03:54,180 --> 01:04:04,060
And this idea that his family is in another pavilion in Croitslingen and being tortured

643
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,660
and held captive.

644
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:12,300
Even on these walks with Ben Zwanger, he would walk up to the other pavilion and knock on

645
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:16,940
the door and ask for his wife Mary.

646
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:24,780
So you've got a re-emergence in life of some of these early fantasies.

647
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:35,980
And they get, I think it was a phenomenological treatment of a person that was successful.

648
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,660
And you can see Ben Zwanger working with him as a...

649
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:47,380
When I read the clean go, history is put together wonderfully by David Stemmily who should be

650
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,380
here in fact.

651
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:52,020
He has published that history in Italian, France and in German.

652
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,100
Is the extreme ambivalence, indeed, towards the end?

653
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,060
There's always a treatment, right?

654
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:01,980
Sometimes he's devil, sometimes he's the healer as clippiest, which is inevitable, right?

655
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,180
In every type of treatment.

656
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:13,660
And then there's a very amicable correspondence after he returns to Hamburg at that point.

657
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:21,780
So, and I think that all of these fears somehow don't get resolved, but somehow the object

658
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:27,500
that embodies the ambivalence is basically the snake in the lecture, right?

659
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:32,580
The snake is both a healer and the awful snake that belongs to the fire.

660
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:34,580
And he changes.

661
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:36,340
Those are the film yesterday.

662
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:40,340
There are some wonderful snakes, but they're not rattlesnakes from...

663
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:46,300
But it was wonderful in the film, it was an image of the actual capella in the KÃ¤uslingen

664
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:50,100
that has precisely the presentation of the presenters.

665
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:54,460
And we know that he in fact visited the chapel and he saw that.

666
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:58,820
But it's interesting how this little object, again I don't want to call it a detail, but

667
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:04,580
this small, cannot become the cause of all evil or good, etc.

668
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:11,700
But everything can be condensed to it and somehow present some kind of resolution through

669
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:15,500
that lecture, which is not exactly a snake ritual.

670
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:20,420
The editors call this flag and went to our, but it's just an image.

671
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:26,500
Yes, the writing of the memories by Schreber was a solution for Schreber.

672
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:31,540
The conference about snake ritual was a solution for Wehrberg.

673
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:38,220
But we are at the end of the roundtable, I think, but perhaps it will be a possibility

674
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:41,220
to do another roundtable about transference.

675
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:47,060
Because if we are talking about clinic, it's also the difficult question of transference

676
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:48,220
in psychotic patients.

677
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:54,660
And here it is transference with Binsfanger and the clinic, but also transference of Binsfanger

678
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:58,380
with pride and the question of the correspondence.

679
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:02,180
And it's a lot of people included like in the culture.

680
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:09,540
We find the same inclusion of the thing in another semantic field.

681
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:14,540
It's a wonderful way to end the roundtable, to pose questions for the future.

682
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:17,860
And we're going to have the question period in the afternoon.

683
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:22,460
We're going to take a 15-minute break and then the memory roundtable is going to convene.

684
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:25,060
So thank you all for having me.

685
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:26,060
OK.

686
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:53,020
Thank you.
