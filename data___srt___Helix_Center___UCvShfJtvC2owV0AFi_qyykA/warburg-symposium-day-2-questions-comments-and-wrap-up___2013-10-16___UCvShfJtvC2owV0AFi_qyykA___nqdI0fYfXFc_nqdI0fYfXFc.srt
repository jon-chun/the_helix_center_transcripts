1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Can you give me, is it on?

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,400
OK.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,160
So I thought, what we'll do for the wrap up,

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,440
anybody who is sitting on this, in this round area,

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,400
you would all participants in the meeting in the round table.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,320
So if you have any ideas, thoughts,

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,080
that you feel you didn't get a chance to express properly

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,240
or any conclusions you draw or any questions you have,

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,200
this is the time to discuss that.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,640
And then after a brief period of time,

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,720
we'll see if there are any questions from the remaining

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,960
audience, and then that's it.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,960
So Siri.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,320
Yeah, I have a question for the psychosis,

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,400
then Swangah people, and actually anyone else

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,880
who wants to contribute.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,360
And there are two points.

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:03,440
One is relating the bipolarity of Valbox thinking

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,800
to or the continuum from one pole to another

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,880
to the psychotic disorder and manic depression.

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,920
And the other thing that's very interesting,

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,280
and I know someone who may answer this,

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,120
is the question of cosmology and psychosis.

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,840
When I was teaching writing as a volunteer

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,880
at the Payne-Whitney Psychiatric Clinic for almost four years,

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,160
a lot of psychotic patients in my classes,

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,920
and they were highly cosmological thinkers.

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,680
And I mean, they would bring together

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,160
all kinds of different cosmologies into one,

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,760
and write about it was very interesting.

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,560
So I wanted to know from scientists and psychoanalysts

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,680
like what the connection between cosmology,

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,000
psychosis, and Valbox.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,440
That's it.

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
That's it.

36
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,440
That's it.

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,720
I think more than that.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,160
Paul, once more, that's your number.

39
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,960
You are the psychiatrist.

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,640
Yes, for the first question, I think

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,040
I discussed this morning together.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,440
It is the relation to the meaning, to the excess of the meaning.

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:37,160
And we can discuss the psychosis like I said,

44
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,080
la con, an anacroncion a ciluver, an open sky unconscious.

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,040
With the direct access to the things in other schools,

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,680
we can speak about symbolic equation.

47
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,200
It is the fact that for us, for neurotic,

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,120
it's very difficult to interpret the world.

49
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,240
But for a psychotic, he has a direct access to the meaning.

50
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,440
But it is for psychotic.

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,360
This is for psychotic in general.

52
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,080
For bipolar is also the question of humor,

53
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:09,760
the

54
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
depression.

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,520
For me, for Warburg, it's difficult to do really the

56
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
difference.

57
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,800
Because the time of Warburg to say it is a mannequin

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,600
depressive psychosis, it was a psychotic structure.

59
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,800
And if we see the different description of Warburg

60
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,480
states during the clinic at Binswanger, he was really in

61
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,240
a psychotic access with delirium, with psychotic anxiety,

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,800
with new world, with persecution, with projection,

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,720
with dissociation.

64
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,520
The question remains the same that we discussed this morning.

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,200
Why invites this kind of state?

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,760
He has an access to something which is inaccessible in

67
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,120
another state.

68
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,680
For cosmology, I think it is important.

69
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:25,680
For example, it was Bispour, who from Brazil, from Rio,

70
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:33,640
who created a cosmological coat with all the world inside

71
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,920
the coat and the both.

72
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,720
I think Les and Kiteslingen, that Les and the Bell of the

73
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
clinic.

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,800
But more actually in the theories before where he's

75
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:55,600
actually articulating a bipolar theory of emotion,

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,800
essentially, and how it appears.

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,240
Yes.

78
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,120
I once said something about the bipolar.

79
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,640
I have a brilliant small article called the Eternatus

80
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,160
Cso, where there's always movement.

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,640
He never occupies either one pole or the other.

82
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,160
I agree.

83
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,720
And in fact, he has a little figure striding and standing

84
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,520
up on the ceso in the middle.

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,120
That's a very difficult position to keep for several

86
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,640
decades, right?

87
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,800
It's much safer to either sit on one side or the other.

88
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,920
And you have to keep your balance dynamically for so long.

89
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,800
And that has to do also with his later critics that want to

90
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,040
position him either on the one side or the other side of the

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,520
Enlightenment or the irrational Kant or the

92
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:40,880
religion.

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,040
It's never either or.

94
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,680
It's a position in between.

95
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,920
And next to polarity, there's the other term,

96
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,120
Ousklish, at Maden Varyngheuser, which in English is called

97
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
not exactly a balance.

98
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Balance.

99
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,640
But it's not a static balance.

100
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,040
The balance is always dynamic.

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,480
You're always sort of oscillating between the two.

102
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,280
And compensation is a kind of economic term.

103
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,560
You can't say why.

104
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,400
Right.

105
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,880
Yeah.

106
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,000
So it's always dynamic.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,840
And there's never exact safe positioning in the

108
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,200
property.

109
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,240
In fact, he energizes the polarity by making it

110
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,040
unstable.

111
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,440
Well, I think the question is how perhaps you will give the

112
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,320
perspective, because for me it is not the good way to do a

113
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,880
discussion about psychosis of verbog.

114
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,000
It's more important to understand how this kind of mental

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,680
status opened to something new.

116
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,440
Like it was creating.

117
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:51,040
In fact, we are now in New York 100 years after discussing

118
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,640
about verbog.

119
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:58,440
Each one perhaps, we have each one, his own verbog.

120
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,960
It's my impression after this discussion.

121
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,360
We have different verbog views.

122
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,000
And we are taking lessons from verbog in a different point of

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,760
view.

124
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:16,200
But for me, the question of people-already is interesting

125
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,480
for the notion of patos, for perhaps what can we

126
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,800
learn from patos.

127
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
I know nothing of psychosis, of course.

128
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,840
I just wanted to recall the fact that when verbog describes

129
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:43,120
himself in terms of sort of autobiographical image as a

130
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,080
psychostorian, trying to explore and understand the visual

131
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,840
history of the West has taken between two extremes,

132
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,440
mania and melancholy, the ecstatic nymph and melancholic

133
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,000
god, of river god.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,280
There, of course, you have a polarity of figures.

135
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,520
And this polarism, as he says, he thought at a certain time

136
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,400
it was his own invention.

137
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,880
His own creative invention as a historiographical category.

138
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,960
But there is a very interesting entry in his journal

139
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,720
as early as 1907, where he says, I'm reading good as

140
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,000
metamorphosis of plants.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,640
And I find there the notion of polarity, polarity,

142
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,520
polarity, what I thought was my own idea.

143
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,160
But all is there, all is there in good.

144
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,800
And I think I have tried also personally to explore this

145
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,520
background, which is morphological.

146
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,320
And morphological means that you never understand one

147
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,200
phenomenon if you do not see both forces in it.

148
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,120
So that patos formul exactly is the fact that you have a

149
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,360
formul, which is not a form, which is both a form and the

150
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,480
repetition or the possibility of repetition of this form,

151
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,640
the formula, which immediately expresses a patos, but can be

152
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,280
electrotechnically inverted.

153
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,160
Polarized in this sense, even from these

154
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,960
electro-technical metaphorics we were talking about it before.

155
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,960
So it can become, as we said many times during these

156
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,040
round tables, the mannered and the Magdalene.

157
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,120
The healing serpent and the poison serpent and so on.

158
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,000
But good is there.

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,600
Just to follow up, I would like to invite you to,

160
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,640
since you wrote extensively on this topic, you were

161
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:06,080
mentioning a verbal reading of the good searching for the

162
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,600
wolf lands.

163
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:18,800
So could you tell us more about this sort of trail recurrent in

164
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,440
the history of images of econology, trying to link

165
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,080
symbolic forms with their biological origin and perhaps

166
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,280
bringing in pit rivers and the like?

167
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,280
I'll try quickly, which is not easy.

168
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,280
Of course, the question of the war, of the origin, of the

169
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,280
war built that has already come out during discussions is

170
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,280
rooted in Gerta's morphological thought.

171
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,280
And Gerta, as we know, understood this idea of natural

172
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:05,280
research, not as a dilatentistic approach to the study of nature,

173
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,280
but on the contrary, as the other side of the moon, meaning

174
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:17,280
that a novel, a love novel as the elective affinities can be

175
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,280
understood as well as a chemical treatise, a theory of

176
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,280
attractions and repulsions of nature and the

177
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:32,280
importance of nature, of sympathies and antipathy of

178
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,280
magnetism as well.

179
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:43,280
So it must be read as a holistic author in this sense.

180
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Or we find already in Gerta, I think, a tension which is to

181
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,280
be found afterwards in Barbara as well between historical

182
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:02,280
understanding of the war and properly morphological.

183
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:08,280
When Gerta was looking for the warplancy, for a certain time,

184
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,280
it was convinced that the warplancy was the first plant ever

185
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,280
that had appeared at the beginning of the world.

186
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,280
And it was convinced that he had found it in the jinkopilob,

187
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,280
the jinkopilob was the most ancient plant on earth.

188
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,280
From the jinkopilob, every other plant had derived,

189
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,280
according to this first historical approach to this notion of

190
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
the war.

191
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,280
But then going to Italy, there was a letter to help there

192
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:50,280
from Palermo's botanical gardens.

193
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,280
And there he understands, and of course his reading of Kant is

194
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,280
very important as well because he speaks of a transcendental

195
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:07,280
blood, transcendental leaf, meaning that war is not something

196
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,280
that you have to look for on the timeline, the first point on

197
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,280
the line of the chronological line.

198
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,280
And from that point, everything else in the vegetable phenomena

199
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,280
descends and arrives.

200
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,280
War is rather the theme never given, sort of a bit against

201
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,280
the imperceptible, say, because it was a morphologist as well,

202
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Gertian, morphologist as well, who took perhaps a family

203
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
resemblance.

204
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,280
So you recognize the theme among all the vegetable phenomena.

205
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:51,280
During processes of condensation, of expansion,

206
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
how do you say it?

207
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Alungamento.

208
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Lengthening or compressing, any vegetable phenomenon is the

209
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
leaf.

210
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,280
So it can become the roots, it can become the branches,

211
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
it can become the trunk.

212
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,280
And the same can be said for the osteological system.

213
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,280
So when he speaks of the war we are built, the original

214
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:26,280
vertebrae, and he sees that it can become the bones of the

215
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,280
leg, of the skull in metamorphosis, you recognize the

216
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,280
vertebrae, but you never actually see it in itself.

217
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Only varides, so if you want to use a musical metaphor,

218
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,280
we could say we don't have the theme, but we just have

219
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
variations.

220
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Variations of a theme that is never given in itself, but only

221
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
in its variations.

222
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,280
And if you look at the panels of the nemosunearlas, where is

223
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
the nympha?

224
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,280
You have variations of a theme, of a patos forma that is there in

225
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,280
every nympha that you look at, but never exhausted in any

226
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
single nympha.

227
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:16,280
So you can look at the golf player at the servant of the

228
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,280
gillandaya, of the archive manad.

229
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,280
And this I think is a morphological approach, theme

230
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,280
never given, but in its variations.

231
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:37,280
This is this tension between a historical approach to the

232
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,280
oor, and a morphological is to be found in Barugal as well.

233
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,280
For example, when he studies Manet, and he says Manet is not a

234
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
new author.

235
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:53,280
The de jenès sur l'erbe is not la nouveau té absolut.

236
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,280
It's something that has roots in your journey, in

237
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Marcantonio Ramonde, in a drawing by Rafael, unfortunately

238
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:15,280
lost, in a relief in the wall of Villa Medicin Rome.

239
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,280
And so he needs to reconstruct the historical chain, going back

240
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
to the model.

241
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,280
So he has a traditional idea of the oor as the origin.

242
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:36,280
But as we know, many links in this chain are missing.

243
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:42,280
And moreover, if you go back to an elanistic model, you cannot

244
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,280
say you have found the origin, because you can ask for a

245
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Greek origin, and for an archive Greek origin, an oriental

246
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
origin, and so on.

247
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,280
So the quest for the origin transforms itself rather in

248
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
amorphology.

249
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,280
So it's not important to put all these figures in a timeline,

250
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,280
chronologically oriented, but rather to think them, I would

251
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,280
say, in a radial scheme.

252
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,280
At the center of the scheme, you have the Patosfarna, and around

253
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,280
the scheme you have the figures that gather around the mother,

254
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,280
as Gautis said, of the phenomena, of the oor phenomena.

255
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Like a mother that gathers around herself the children, and you

256
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,280
have this network of phenomena.

257
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,280
And I think that each panel of the mnemosuna are less

258
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,280
organized like that, like sort of gathering of children around

259
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,280
a mother theme that is never given.

260
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Warburg is one author of a very complex landscape, morphological

261
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,280
landscape in late 19, early 20th century, that has never been

262
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:11,280
reconstructed yet in its density, in its complexity, and I would

263
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,280
call it this morphological paradigm in the humanities.

264
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:25,280
In anthropology in our history, we found it in Yollis linguistics.

265
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,280
The I'm Faje Farm is a morphological approach.

266
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Prop, morphology of the folk tale.

267
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,280
Some structuralism, the stealth psychology.

268
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,280
So really many, many, many fields, and I think linguistics

269
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,280
is post-formalism, Russian formalism.

270
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:55,280
Hook school, this idea of course, a morphology of lifestyles.

271
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Although if you think about Darwin and expression of morphological

272
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,280
qualities of expression of emotions in animals and humans,

273
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:11,280
as everyone has many people have noted, an important book for

274
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Vavog.

275
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,280
There is a chronological element there that perhaps you're

276
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,280
downplaying somewhat.

277
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,280
I agree with you that Vavog is not like Walter Benjamin is not

278
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,280
interested in Orchbrongh as a chronological beginning point.

279
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,280
But yet if we look at the panels, they do move from antiquity

280
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
to the present day.

281
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:44,280
So he is offering us a historical atlas, one that proceeds

282
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
and moves forward.

283
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
I agree.

284
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,280
In fact, I was talking of attention because I don't think that

285
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,280
Barbara is emancipated completely from the traditional

286
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
historical approach.

287
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,280
On the contrary, it feels the tension between this and it feels

288
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,280
attracted by the traditional historical task to reconstruct

289
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,280
the timeline, the chronology of the phenomena.

290
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,280
And this is there together with the other side.

291
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,280
When Spiro says it's never one or the other, but you have to

292
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
think in between.

293
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Moreover, if you read the origin of the species by Darwin,

294
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,280
there is a paragraph on morphology.

295
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,280
He knew very well good and he says morphology is the mother of

296
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
our problems.

297
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:39,280
So even in this depth that Barbara has toward Darwin, you can

298
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,280
see in transparent but as well again.

299
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,280
And I mean, to complicate or to swing the pendulum just a bit

300
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,280
further, it doesn't really discuss the school, the school

301
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:04,280
of Athens in the Chvamdoydong as a kind of syncrene of symptoms

302
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
of appearances.

303
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,280
I think you recall.

304
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Yes.

305
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,280
I don't remember, but I'm not the Freudian here.

306
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
The Freudians don't remember it.

307
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,280
I'm not responsible.

308
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,280
I do, I don't remember.

309
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,280
Perhaps in the impression.

310
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,280
I'm pretty sure he does.

311
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,280
But downstairs.

312
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:41,280
But perhaps an important question which was in the origin of our

313
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:49,280
meeting here and our discussion was the question of plasticity,

314
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,280
dynamic memory and unconscious.

315
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:59,280
And the purpose was to revisit the new vision of unconscious and

316
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:06,280
memory with the information of contemporary neurosciences.

317
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,280
And I think it will be interesting to discuss a little about that

318
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,280
because we can say there is a dynamic memory today in the

319
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
vision of neurosciences.

320
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,280
Very dynamic memory.

321
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:27,280
And the question from neurosciences is the dichronic identity.

322
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Welcome from the dichronic identity.

323
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:36,280
If we are always changing from where the permanence of

324
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,280
yourself, the permanence of your reference, of your history,

325
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
welcome from.

326
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,280
And perhaps we have a paradox as we discussed before.

327
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,280
In biology we have permanent change.

328
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:56,280
And in cultural point of view you have something which is more

329
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,280
in the dialectic of memory as a conservation, as continuity.

330
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,280
And I think the discussion about continuity and discontinuity in

331
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:12,280
the dynamic process of memory is interesting to have it change

332
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,280
from the point of view.

333
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,280
For a classical psychoanalyst we are thinking about

334
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:25,280
psychoanalysis, about human sciences as the field of the

335
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
possibility to change.

336
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
And biology as the terminus,

337
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,280
programmation, fixed structures.

338
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,280
And with the new parroting of plasticity you have an

339
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:43,280
understanding of the representation, perhaps more mobile in

340
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,280
biological structure and more, in mobile in cultural structures.

341
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Is it a pity that the memory people are not here anymore?

342
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Yes, it's gay.

343
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,280
And I know psychoanalytic memory.

344
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,280
We can manage.

345
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,280
I was wondering in fact myself about what we were discussing,

346
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,280
they were discussing, you were discussing this morning.

347
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,280
Because it is indeed one of the most interesting things that

348
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,280
at least I think for neuroscience came out from this

349
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Varburg meeting.

350
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,280
The thing is that the memory was discussed this morning is

351
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,280
in fact somehow very fixed and very flexible.

352
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,280
I mean you speak of a synaptic trace which is something that

353
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,280
really deeply change your brain.

354
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,280
Everything you hear, you listen, you do can change through the

355
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
processes of your brain.

356
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
But still it's a dynamic thing.

357
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:57,280
So ongoing, even during these days, we are carrying on changing.

358
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,280
But we perceive our self and our identity as a stable, at least

359
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,280
if we don't run into the pathology as stable in space and time.

360
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:15,280
So I was wondering if what you were saying about the variation

361
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,280
in the theme could be somehow applied in trying to understand

362
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:26,280
memory but not as a synaptic trace because it's like explaining

363
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,280
vision with the functioning of the cells in V1, V2 or Colours in

364
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,280
V4.

365
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,280
There is something more, there is, you know, our story is also

366
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,280
a narrative story of our self is something and is not only

367
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,280
about learning what Christina was saying, memory is something you

368
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
learn.

369
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,280
I'm not sure it's something you learn, it's something you

370
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,280
experience, something you go through, something that changed

371
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,280
yesterday, the Victoria was saying, we are made of bricks, but you

372
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,280
can change the disposition of these bricks.

373
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,280
And somehow the bricks can be the variation around the theme.

374
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,280
And so the dynamic aspect of memory could be not this variation.

375
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:21,280
Yeah, the creative and plastic aspect that both reproduces

376
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
and produces.

377
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,280
I was thinking, listening to this idea of plasticity, of course,

378
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:35,280
of the very famous passages in prose or even in certain

379
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,280
phenomenology, but even in all those authors that have insisted

380
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:47,280
on the retroactive retrograde movement of truth,

381
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,280
Bexon has a beautiful conference on that, the aprecouled in

382
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,280
Treglichkeit Borges when he says that Kafka creates his precursors

383
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,280
or a Thomas Eliot that says in tradition an individual talent

384
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,280
that when a new author appears in the scene in the literary

385
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,280
landscape, the old history has to be rewritten.

386
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:21,280
So briefly, the present shapes the past, the past shapes the present,

387
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,280
and you have, again, this in between of passivity and activity,

388
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,280
a chiasmatic relation if you want to use the Merlot-Ponten notion.

389
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:39,280
And I'm not a neuroscientist, but from your comments and this

390
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:45,280
course is about plasticity, I immediately connected them to this

391
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,280
constellation of problems, which is exactly even in verbal the idea

392
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:57,280
that he says the Lao-con should have been invented if it was not

393
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:05,280
there, meaning that Renaissance is a construction, was there a certain amount

394
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:13,280
of phenomena, but there's a retrograde creative installation

395
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:19,280
of this notion of Renaissance as an aprecouled.

396
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,280
I think there's a...

397
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:29,280
No, but just to stress again, the notion that one dimension of

398
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:36,280
plasticity is that it allows experience to leave traces by modifying

399
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,280
synapses that are facilitated and then when they are reactivated,

400
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,280
that somehow reproduce the experience more or less.

401
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,280
And at the same time, particularly this idea that whenever...

402
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:53,280
It's not an idea, it's actually an experimental observation that when

403
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,280
traces are reactivated, as Christina mentioned, they are becoming

404
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:05,280
more fragile or more susceptible to associate with others with a new concept.

405
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,280
So nothing is lost really, but it's updated permanently.

406
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:15,280
So this is in a way that try to grasp this notion of permanence and at the

407
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:21,280
same time of continuous change, which is something that is paradoxical because

408
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,280
you would say, you know, memory is something that is there, you know,

409
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
once and forever.

410
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,280
And this is really the evolving notion that it's true, but at the same time,

411
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,280
it's susceptible to change.

412
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:41,280
And all the mechanisms are not known, actually, but certainly this possibility

413
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,280
of re-association of traces.

414
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,280
So given trace is now put into...

415
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,280
Associated with others in a new context.

416
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,280
So produces this change in a way.

417
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Yes, it is important because we have to revisit the relation between nature and

418
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,280
culture if we can say that it is a prominent change.

419
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,280
We can say also that we are, as we said in our books, we are biologically

420
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,280
determined not to be completely biologically determined.

421
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,280
We are biologically determined to be free.

422
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:30,280
And finally, we can say in this discussion that we are biologically

423
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:37,280
determined, determined to receive the incidence of the culture.

424
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:46,280
And the idea, the space for the culture is inside also the biology of the...

425
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,280
And after it is the question, why is it like that?

426
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Why is it necessary?

427
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:00,280
The incidence of the culture, we are unachieved at birth.

428
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,280
We need the other, or this is a psychiatric psychoanalytic point of view.

429
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,280
We need the action of the other.

430
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:15,280
And we can develop these ideas, discussing about the necessity of the

431
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:21,280
culture which is inside the biological organization.

432
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:32,280
I found the discussion very interesting and talk provoking in particular.

433
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,280
I've been thinking about the issue of memory.

434
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:43,280
So for a psychoanalyst, there is a relevance and history to the concept of memory

435
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:53,280
because Breuer Freud with his experience with Charcoal and then on his own discovered

436
00:31:53,280 --> 00:32:06,280
that certain manifestations in a patient, certain symptoms could be traced back to a specific memory.

437
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:16,280
And that the bringing into awareness of that specific memory would alter the symptoms.

438
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:23,280
In that way of looking at it, memory is a very discrete entity.

439
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:32,280
So what we call memory trace, so that there are all these traces, they are discrete entities.

440
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:48,280
But when you start thinking from the perspective of, let's say, plasticity, when you and Joe this morning say,

441
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:54,280
well, the brain changes after this meeting or during this meeting, the brain changes.

442
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,280
What is memory in that?

443
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:06,280
There isn't a discrete, so the whole question of, and then the other thing is,

444
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:12,280
Christina says, well, there is learning, well, there's learning, there's experience.

445
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:21,280
And there is what Freud didn't really directly touch upon, though it's inherent in the concept of free associations,

446
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:29,280
but it's not like you have a discrete experience and that experience stays isolated.

447
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:37,280
It must be that all experiences are affecting each other forwards and backwards in a dynamic way.

448
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:48,280
And so, within this way of saying, it's difficult to speak of memory in the usual sense we speak of it.

449
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:55,280
There may have to be a different approach to understanding exactly what it is that is happening.

450
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:14,280
That is, and even, and I think once you start thinking that way, the Freudian dynamic unconscious becomes something that needs to be revisited.

451
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:23,280
Yes, and perhaps the limit between memory, dynamic memory, and dynamic unconscious, Freudian unconscious,

452
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,280
is less clear than before.

453
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:36,280
For us, we consider that unconscious was, Freudian theory is not a memory system.

454
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:49,280
But if we enter in plasticity, dynamic memory, we have something new in the confrontation between unconscious and memory.

455
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,280
And finally, it's easier to understand what is unconscious than what is memory.

456
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:08,280
Well, but in classical Freudian thinking, unconscious or dynamic unconscious is connected to the notion of repression,

457
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:14,280
which means the memory is not becoming conscious for a reason.

458
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Whereas it may be that memory is not becoming conscious, just further from being whatever needs to bring it into awareness, into consciousness,

459
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,280
is not happening.

460
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:33,280
So if you don't listen to that piece of music for 30 years, that memory you could say is unconscious,

461
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:43,280
you could even say in a speculative Freudian way, you kept that memory out of your consciousness because it happened during your adolescence,

462
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,280
you were sexually into this and it kept it.

463
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:54,280
But it may just be that you didn't have the method of accessing it, and when you accessed it with the repeat of the same music, it came right back.

464
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,280
But this gives a very discrete perspective or retrieval too.

465
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:08,280
So, and your example was incredibly good in showing that even the retrieval aspect of memory is not discrete.

466
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
You don't have to...

467
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
Exactly.

468
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:21,280
So, I think what I was just an idyllarium thinking of your description of the original, this variation around the theme,

469
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,280
it would give to memory a more complex structure.

470
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,280
So, I don't know exactly how it could be formalized, but...

471
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:43,280
I think the difficulty of addressing these issues, the relationship between memory and unconscious,

472
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:58,280
the notion of form, where the form comes from, the problem of the ure, or even the related problem of self-identity,

473
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:08,280
bring us back to a key point of our ontology, of our epistemology, which is language.

474
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:24,280
And there's a passage that keeps obsessing me, which I totally, by chance, found in a wonderful book by Premolévi,

475
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,280
that's drawn and the saved. I don't have the English, but I can...

476
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,280
It's very short. I have the Italian one.

477
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,280
What we commonly conceive of as understanding, he writes,

478
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,280
coincides with simplifying.

479
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Without a deep simplification, the world around us would be an endless undefined knot

480
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:59,280
that would challenge our ability to orient and decide upon our action.

481
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:07,280
We are, to put it simply, forced to reduce the knowable to schema.

482
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:17,280
And this is the specific purpose of the wonderful instrument we built in the course of evolution,

483
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,280
which is just specific of the human species. Language and conceptual thought.

484
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:30,280
So, I think Premolévi here is dealing with a completely different issue.

485
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:38,280
What does it mean to survive ausch with... what does it mean to feel guilty of something, etc.

486
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:51,280
But if you somehow use this as a starting point to reflect upon many of the themes that we have been discussing during these days,

487
00:38:51,280 --> 00:39:00,280
I think that the notion of identity can be much better tackled from our point of view,

488
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:07,280
from the neurobiological point of view, if you interpret it as a process, and not as...

489
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,280
So, there is no such a thing in the brain as the self.

490
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,280
The self is a process, a dynamic process.

491
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,280
Which, in a way, is a way not to answer in the question, okay, a process of what?

492
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:35,280
So, then the neurobiologist desperately needs something to grab in order not to be completely drawn in this sort of indeterminacy,

493
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:45,280
universal indeterminacy. And this something to grab on are the bricks that metaphorical is speaking, I was alluding to.

494
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:56,280
So, going back to Várburg, Francois said, each of us has probably had, or his own, Várburg.

495
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:07,280
One of the things that really struck me of Várburg is his definition of the history of art as the history of human pragmatic expression,

496
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:19,280
which immediately in my head suggested the possibility not to naturalize the history of art.

497
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:26,280
That's not the way to put it. But at least they attempt to naturalize the process of morphogenesis.

498
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:46,280
And then, Várburg reading of Gerta and the tradition that Andrea was very briefly referring to offer a sort of kind of very remote,

499
00:40:46,280 --> 00:41:00,280
but not totally crazy goal, which is specifically that of looking for possible biological roots of symbolic forms.

500
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:13,280
And I think that in that respect, Várburg definitely, at the very least, I don't see him as standing against this project.

501
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:29,280
But I think that by reading Várburg perhaps in my very own idiosyncratic way, I think Várburg would not and would encourage this sort of search.

502
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:50,280
And then I will stop. The notion of a form that is not the primitive form, but being instantiated in a variety of ways still keeps some constant aspect

503
00:41:50,280 --> 00:42:04,280
reminds me of the notion discussed by Agamben radicalizing a paradigm by Aristotle.

504
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:26,280
So according to a gamble, this is specific of our species. The possibility to achieve something that cannot be universal, but being paradigmatic becomes, so to speak,

505
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:35,280
by means of decoupling, something from his usual reference role, he makes the example of Rosa.

506
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:47,280
Rose is a word referring to a biological object, but when decoupled from his role of referring to something in the physical world,

507
00:42:47,280 --> 00:43:00,280
when it becomes one element of the latent declination, Rosa, Rosa, it doesn't refer to any specific roles, it becomes a paradigm.

508
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:14,280
So I believe the same logic can perhaps be applied to the notion of morphogenesis and can be perhaps fruitfully tackled from an all biological point of view.

509
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:24,280
So that's the main reason why we decided to confront scribbles with the Chinese ideograms and alphabetical Roman letters.

510
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:45,280
So, and if I had the power to do it, one project I would really like to pursue would be to look among all known possible writing that we know along human history,

511
00:43:45,280 --> 00:44:00,280
to look for specific biomechanical constraints, kinematic bricks that somehow, so I mean the way we are, it's a dynamic process.

512
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:10,280
I am not the same as I was 20 years ago. Before becoming a father, my attention started one meter above the ground.

513
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:22,280
Whatever was moving below one meter didn't exist. Now, all of a sudden I become a father. I discovered the world is full of children of this kind of thing.

514
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:28,280
So I am not anymore the Victoria or the single...

515
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,280
Clayboard.

516
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:40,280
It's a red set. Somebody from person. So the idea is that this is something that can be investigated.

517
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:46,280
And I think verbal in a way can be a source of inspiration.

518
00:44:46,280 --> 00:45:15,280
But I mean, maybe I am just reading what you say in light of what I think. But the point I made this morning about these hardwired, maybe neuronal circuits in a way that respond to certain archetypal biomechanical shapes and patterns

519
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:24,280
I mean, for me, can be related to what verbal is identified as persisting over time.

520
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:37,280
And then, of course, based on this, they can re-emerge and be reinterpreted and find their life on their own

521
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:54,280
through plasticity, through culture, through a given moment in time. But there is a constant invariant throughout time and cultures that is based on some biological property.

522
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,280
So I think we shared the same point.

523
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:08,280
But it might be interesting to make a distinction between images and text, right? Between images and language. And it's interesting that Valbuk seemed to have...

524
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:22,280
You really had a hard time with writing. I mean, I don't know what your experience is, but my experience of reading Valbuk is God was not only in the details, but he got lost in the details.

525
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:28,280
And you can feel a certain compulsive inability to extract...

526
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,280
Let alone the handwriting.

527
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:39,280
You know exactly. And then stopping the project. So we have to think about that. There was something... And when he came to Numosina,

528
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:53,280
he really didn't get the text done. He died before the text was finished. But the idea of these pictures speaking. And you know Freud talks about mental images, not external images,

529
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:00,280
but mental images as phylogenetically and ontologically older, of course, than language, which we know they are.

530
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:09,280
So it would be interesting to hear people talk about this distinction, which is related to conceptual questions and morphology.

531
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:24,280
I love the example of Primo Levy, because I mean, Valbuk would describe to it immediately in the sense that this is what he thought in Vissure and the Viconians that he was reading.

532
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:38,280
This is what the symbol is. But then I would just want to add to that and complicate that with what Andrea, by mentioning invoking Gerta and the Gertian symbol,

533
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:49,280
was precisely what Valbuk did not want to have, because for him the symbol had to be discursive. It had to be endlessly metonymic.

534
00:47:49,280 --> 00:48:02,280
It couldn't have that romantic Gertian symbolic power, because it was too complicated. It was too oscillating. It was too unstable.

535
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:16,280
My impression is that the effect in between various the tradition Christ or Baccofen, that is a symbol is something dense, complex.

536
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:26,280
When you narrate it and you describe it, you have the exegesis of the symbol, and then you have the myth.

537
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:39,280
And then you recount the history of the serpent as a escapious, and so you decline and you inflect it towards the good, towards the positive pole.

538
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:55,280
Otherwise you can describe it and recount and narrate it in the myth of Lao-Kon, so the exegesis determines the symbol and its density towards the direction.

539
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:10,280
But it also undermines it. It doesn't allow it simply to be the serpent or the flag or the chalice. It becomes iconographic, as well as I call it.

540
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:27,280
I have a question to your argument, your excellent argument of Victoria Gédese. We are speaking about biological roots of form.

541
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:42,280
Or a biological necessity of the form, because something is missing in the programme of the human being. We are without instruction for use. We are unachieved at birth.

542
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:53,280
And we need also something from the other. And perhaps we need the form. For me it's different to say, perhaps it's the same, it's different.

543
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:07,280
But it is important, not the biological root, if like if it was inscribed in your programme, but the biological necessity of the form.

544
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:27,280
It's like the distinction, excuse me, like the social between language and speech. Each act of speech, each speech act, modifies the system of the language.

545
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:49,280
And you have this kind of dialectic with an endless permanent change. Or with the necessity of the form, but the possibility not to find the true form, but to recreate permanently endless new form from another form.

546
00:50:49,280 --> 00:51:03,280
And for me, Warburg is very interesting, because in Nemo's sign he put together different kinds of forms that are unified by their necessity, and not by the common root.

547
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:18,280
If I could pick up on what you said about text and image, I was reminded listening this morning and now that in fact in Warburg, late years, which are dedicated to his own recovery, there's two great words that have the same title, at least Nemozine.

548
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:23,280
The first is the builder, Al-Aza, and the second is the library, so you have text and image.

549
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:33,280
And this also reminded me of a very short text that I give to students when I introduce the library and the expectation of how to find your reading list, etc.

550
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:57,280
And I read very short text by Verbal, which describes the library as an off-claroon-vaff, a weapon of enlightenment. And to me, that seems to be a very powerful way of inverting is phobia with gun and turning the library into something very dynamic and very organized at the same time, because the library has quite a clear organization.

551
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:05,280
It's organized chronologically, there's an alphabetical order, so it represents time, and it also is subdivided by space.

552
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:15,280
So it's indeed a space of self-healing and of creating a space where you can navigate himself.

553
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:21,280
Hello? This isn't a direct response to what has been said.

554
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:28,280
But when you refer to the library as a weapon, I think that it's something to bear in mind.

555
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:40,280
And that is Varbar's relationship to the world around him, which was very close, very attentive, very conscious and self-conscious.

556
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:49,280
When we speak of his identity, there's something very problematic for him in a socio-political sense, and that includes his family, includes religious background,

557
00:52:49,280 --> 00:53:02,280
and he was constantly negotiating this with himself, within the family, with others, and who he was socio-politically, was on his mind.

558
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:15,280
And that the creation of the library was not just an intellectual act, not just a projected psychological woman, but a socio-political one,

559
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:27,280
that he negotiated with his family, through his family, and that continual concern with where he fit within the society, the politics of his time,

560
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:38,280
his identity with his class, with his state, but his problems with that, his identity with Judaism and his ambivalence there,

561
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:45,280
his attention as Peter pointed out to anti-Semitism and what he could do about that.

562
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,280
This remained constantly of importance to him.

563
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:59,280
And so all I would say is that in the discussion of his intellectuality and his relationship to the intellectual traditions, with which he is dealing,

564
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:10,280
I think his socio-political sense and background just sort of helps in some way to understand what stays with him, what he decides to pursue.

565
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:18,280
That little aphorism fits very well into what you said, because it continues the library as a weapon of enlightenment against orthodox materialism,

566
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:31,280
and he says, Luther, the French Revolution, science, liberating the right to think for oneself. But I think that really fits very, very squarely into that discourse.

567
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:46,280
As I've been listening to the way that each of us has been thinking about Warburg, I wonder if in one sense he's an ego ideal of something that the psychoanalyst,

568
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:59,280
Rothenburg, refer to a Genucian process of thinking after the Roman god Janus, where there's an active and intentional conception of two or more opposites simultaneously

569
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:11,280
that is very much like primary process thinking with the equivalents of opposites, but is actually a conscious, intentional, rational process that also obeys reality testing.

570
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:22,280
And that this is something that we recognize perhaps in Warburg, and so many of the comments have been attempts, rather than maybe trying to find the middle ground, reconciling opposites,

571
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:37,280
whether it was kind of an Aristotelian and platonic undercurrent to what you were, yes, and it's not finding the midpoint, but we're all sort of, you know, I think in a way,

572
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:45,280
fashioning or thinking after Warburg, and this is what I think we see as so ideal about him.

573
00:55:45,280 --> 00:56:03,280
In this context, I want to bring up the seismograph. You know, Valba really felt he was a seismograph, and if you think about it, I've had this much humbler metaphor about my own nerves, which is a tuning fork.

574
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:11,280
You see how humble that one is compared to the seismograph, but the seismograph is, you know, picking up earthquakes.

575
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:27,280
And you feel this in the sensibility, and this might be, this is obviously personal, it's subjective, and I have noticed that, you know, people want to walk very carefully for human and good reason, respectfully,

576
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:39,280
around the subjective reality of what it was like to be Abi Vabhupa, that we can't know, of course, but we can guess through this particular metaphor of the seismograph,

577
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:51,280
that he was a person who was picking up a lot, and you feel it in the psychotic material, and you feel it before that, and you feel it after.

578
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:57,280
Sure. Even in 2019, he uses the metaphor of the antenna as well. Yes, there you go, the same thing.

579
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,280
Okay, I think we could stop here and be open for questions.

580
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,280
Return it.

581
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,280
No, you want to make one last comment before we close?

582
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:29,280
Yeah, because Siri introduced this very delicate issue text image, and of course, in visual culture studies, it's a main issue, word versus image.

583
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:49,280
I was wondering whether exactly reading a barber and looking at the panels, we are not perhaps too radically opposing these two systems and registers.

584
00:57:49,280 --> 00:58:10,280
Both for our past and the etymological reason, that is the Greek verb graphane means both to depict and to write, and the same happens in ancient Egyptian language, in Gothic language.

585
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:37,280
Victoria was mentioning the Chinese ideograms, pictograms. We encounter text and image icon text as many people in the visual culture say in advertising, on the web, in our books, even on the panels of Nemo's Unem.

586
00:58:37,280 --> 00:59:06,280
So I was wondering, and I'd like to ask you as neuroscientists, if such a division between a separation between the responses and the reactions and the processes in the brain with words and with images, is something useful, or if we shouldn't rather develop a method to approach in a holistic way.

587
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,280
The whole thing.

588
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:28,280
Short answer, I'm not sure how the actual present-day neuroscientific research goes on exploring world versus image.

589
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:44,280
Perhaps my feeling is in a separate way that our regions processing our relationship towards regions, processing our relationship to images, responses and so on.

590
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:56,280
Is there a research nowadays questioning the way we respond to icon text?

591
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:06,280
Well, I'm not aware, but that doesn't mean necessarily anything.

592
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:25,280
One of the very interesting discoveries that neuroscience has made recently when comes to the relationship between symbolic graphic science and the brain, I'm referring to the research of Stanislav Dehann.

593
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:44,280
Of coin, people in Paris who have discovered that apparently there's a part of our visual brain, which is specifically and uniquely activated by letters, but not by numbers, for example.

594
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:57,280
So it's not the pragmatic component which specifically leads to this activation, but is something brand new in terms of evolutionary time.

595
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:06,280
It's just an eyeballing 6,000 years of, against the history of at least more than 100,000 years.

596
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:17,280
So what is this? I tend to be inclined to an exoptation perspective.

597
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:26,280
So I don't think our mind can be described metaphorically as a swiss army knife.

598
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,280
No, don't you respect?

599
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,280
That is wonderful tool.

600
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:50,280
But I don't think our mind can be modeled in that particular way. I don't think that every cognitive abilities is necessarily the outcome of its specific adaptive value, but I stick to gold and leaventh in the spanners of some Mark of famous paper

601
01:01:50,280 --> 01:02:01,280
where they introduced the notion of exoptation. So to put it simply, nature is a sort of bricolor.

602
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:15,280
So you have something that evolved to answer some specific pressure and you somehow transformed dynamically.

603
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:25,280
Perhaps you use the very same bricks, but the same bricks dynamically connected in a different way can accomplish different things.

604
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:40,280
So what is remarkable is that a trace, a footprint for an animal at best can speak of some other animal that was passing by.

605
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:51,280
In our case, the handprint is a sort of vindication of our identity. So I am.

606
01:02:51,280 --> 01:03:01,280
And it's amazing how many handprints are discovered. I have a friend who is an archaeologist, Maurizio Fort.

607
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:17,280
He studies the Neolithic period, Catalyuk in an atoria. And he was telling me that all of these houses in a very specific, detailed, very much ritual-like form,

608
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:30,280
there are thousands of these handprints on specific walls. I don't remember if they, with respect to the cardamom points, there is also a rule in that respect.

609
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:36,280
Which is a way of asserting our identity or whatever. I mean, you probably will never know.

610
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:53,280
So this is a real challenge for a biologist because we are dealing with an aspect of human nature that too many is beyond any reach of the empirical sciences.

611
01:03:53,280 --> 01:04:01,280
I tend to be rather optimistic or delusional.

612
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,280
I think we have a chance.

613
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,280
Okay, we have one comment on that.

614
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:11,280
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask a question and just kind of follow up on that.

615
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:24,280
You know, Cassierer following Warburg looked at man as the Animal Sinbolicum. So, and his Cassierer's example was, give me a line. And it's all in the context.

616
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:35,280
It's our ability to bring to that line whether it's a mathematical graphical formulation or an aesthetic calligraphic expression or whether it's a numerical symbol.

617
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:48,280
And so, what I found to be interesting and I wanted to know what the neurophysiological opinion might be on this, that there's work done by Stephen Costland and others.

618
01:04:48,280 --> 01:05:00,280
That says the brain actually projects in the visual courtesies, iconic resemblances to the affordances that we see, that we pay attention to.

619
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:08,280
That the curves that we see are actually modeled two dimensionally on surfaces in the visual courtes.

620
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:18,280
At some point there's got to be like an interpreter that's grading and evaluating like maybe the interpreter, Gazonega talks about.

621
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,280
Is there any literature that talks about this?

622
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:31,280
The word interpreter is a scary one because you don't want to fall into the moncolous trap.

623
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:44,280
So, the interpreter is at best an emergent property of the whole system. I would put it in that specific way.

624
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:55,280
The vision has been, in my opinion, so far too much studied and conceived of within the limit of vision itself.

625
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:03,280
As we were discussing yesterday, unimodality is not the rule, it's the exception in the brain.

626
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:28,280
So, synesthesia apparently is rules. I have the suspect that a very viable rule to glue this otherwise patchwork like a world of our perceptions of the world is action, is the mortal system.

627
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:47,280
By means of back projection. So, it's not only a matter of top-down effect, like when you see a shaded confused pattern, you don't see anything, then I ask you, oh, don't you see the dalmatian dog?

628
01:06:47,280 --> 01:07:03,280
Okay, that's a clear example of a top-down influence on early processing. These role of back projection has been either neglected or not sufficiently explored from a neurobiological point of view.

629
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:20,280
People who study the visual system from an anatomical point of view systematically emphasize the fact that recurrent connections, by and large, exceed feed-forward connection.

630
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:44,280
So, there are a lot more fibers that travels back from V1 to the lateral geniculate body than fibers that from the towns gets to the primary visual cortex. That problem means something, which is, I think, also very coherent with the notion of perception that has been discussed during this today.

631
01:07:44,280 --> 01:08:03,280
So, it's a sort of multimodal enterprise. And I think if one changed this perspective, even the study of images, the study of econology can have a new boost, I think.

632
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:23,280
We still have to map uncharted territory that can perhaps give some food for thought, also for discipline, that in principle don't need the contribution of neurobiology, but I think they can profit of this contribution.
