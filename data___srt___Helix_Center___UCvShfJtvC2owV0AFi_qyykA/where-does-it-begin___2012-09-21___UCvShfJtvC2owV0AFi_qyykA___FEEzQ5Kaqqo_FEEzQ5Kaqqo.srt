1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
So I would like to briefly introduce the participants.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,440
Alphabetically, Chris Impey is the Stanley Kelly Visiting Professor for Distinguished Teaching

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,400
at the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,760
His home is Arizona, where he is a University Distinguished Professor at University of

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,480
Arizona and the beauty head of the Department of Astronomy in charge of all academic programs.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,280
He has obviously huge number of publications and honors.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,320
Just for our purpose today, I will say that he's written three popular books, The Living

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:49,680
Cosmos, which was published in 2007, How It Ends, Talking About Life.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,920
And one of the reasons why he's here, his new book is called How It Began.

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,160
Professor Joseph Cohn, who's sitting to his right, is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics

11
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,680
at Princeton University.

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,560
He's also winner of numerous prizes, including the Society's Still Prize and the Bergman

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,960
Prize, and he's a member of the National Academy, United States National Academy of

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,240
Sciences.

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,240
He has written numerous articles and spoken in many places.

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,480
Professor Tim Modlan is sitting here.

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:36,440
He's primarily, his interest focuses on the foundation of physics, metaphysics and logic.

18
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,000
His books include Quantum Non-Locality.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,320
He's a professor at NYU.

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,360
His books include Quantum Non-Locality and Relativity, Truth and Paradox.

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,280
And the Metaphysics Within Physics, and also Philosophy of Physics, Space and Time, which

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,600
is due in publication 2012.

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,480
It's not yet published the last one.

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,400
Any moment.

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,000
He has been a Guggenheim Fellow, a visiting professor at Harvard, and prior to going to

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
NYU, he was at Rutgers.

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,960
Mark Norell has been with us a number of times.

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,880
He probably knows about people and geography more than anyone else.

29
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,000
Certainly in this room, if not in the world, he's constantly traveling.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,200
He's the Chair of Paleontology at the Museum of Natural History.

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,720
And he has also written many scholarly articles and books.

32
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,880
And his recent book is called Traveling the Silk Road Ancient Pathway to the Modern World.

33
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
So with that, we will begin.

34
00:02:45,880 --> 00:03:09,640
Well, the question that was my directions for this seminar for this ground table was,

35
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:17,360
I noticed the question was asked in the link on the internet was, why are we curious about

36
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
beginnings?

37
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,760
Maybe this doesn't work.

38
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,000
Now, does this work or not?

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,200
Can you hear me?

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,160
Okay, maybe I should.

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,360
Anyway, ah, I can't hear myself now.

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:45,600
So the question was, why are we curious about beginnings?

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:55,320
And I think that we're curious about beginnings because that's how we can organize our thoughts,

44
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,120
our beings.

45
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:05,800
And I want to quote here Borquez, who is, Jose Luis Borquez, who is one of my favorite

46
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:15,520
authors who writes a short story called Aleph, which is the Hebrew for Alpha.

47
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:24,640
And he says, as a boy I used to marvel, to marvel that the letters in a closed book did

48
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:31,880
not get scrambled and lost overnight.

49
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,080
So somehow you have to make order out of this world.

50
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,920
And the way to make order out of the world is to start somewhere and to start at a point

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
and start counting.

52
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,920
So that's the first reason why we're curious about beginnings.

53
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:59,320
Now I also want to point out that the moment one thinks about beginnings, one can't help

54
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,720
but think about endings.

55
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,120
First of all, it's coming in two weeks.

56
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,600
It's coming in two weeks.

57
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,920
But I think that's sort of inseparable.

58
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,800
Let me start maybe with the biblical kind of thing.

59
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,120
So Aleph is the word for Alpha in Hebrew.

60
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:32,240
And it turns out that the writing of the Bible starts, instead of starting with the letter

61
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,920
Aleph starts with the letter Beth, which is the same as Beida in Greek, or Psenor.

62
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:45,920
And but in Hebrew it's written like a kind of a thing that's open on one end, like this,

63
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,440
more or less.

64
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,280
And so anyway, there are two explanations for why doesn't start with Aleph, which is

65
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,640
the first letter.

66
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,840
So one explanation is sort of mystical.

67
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:09,440
And I say, well Aleph being the first letter is sort of humble and doesn't want to go first.

68
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,720
So that's one explanation.

69
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:23,960
But the other one, which is by the commentator Rashi, which is short for Rabbi Schlomo Yitzake.

70
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:41,400
And his definition is that this letter Beth has an open end because, and the other things

71
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:49,080
that are closed because the open end encourages to ask questions.

72
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,040
And you ask questions about everything, but the closed part means that you're not allowed

73
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,760
to ask about what comes before.

74
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:08,920
So it sort of implies that when you say something begins, it sort of implies that there was

75
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,360
something before in some ways.

76
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,880
So anyway, it's a theological thing.

77
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,480
So that is one connection with opening and ending.

78
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:28,560
But another connection is this, that in mathematics, the letter Aleph actually stands for a kind

79
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
of infinity.

80
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:37,800
In fact, infinity is according to the mathematician Cantor, where classified Aleph sub zero Aleph

81
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,560
sub one and so on.

82
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:47,920
And it turns out after you take all the numbers, in the collection then you can sort of join

83
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,600
still another number, which is called Aleph sub zero.

84
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,840
And then you can continue developing Aleph sub one and keep going.

85
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,960
And then reach still another number Aleph sub one and so on.

86
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:09,600
So you have the, so Aleph, the first thing really refers to the end of the ordinary things

87
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
at the beginning of the new things.

88
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:19,400
And similarly in ordinary academic language, you go to commencement exercise when we're

89
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,840
really ending one period and starting another period.

90
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:31,640
So there is, I think there's the deep property.

91
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:38,480
Let's see, perhaps some other remarks, maybe I should stop for a while.

92
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
I can make a counterpoint.

93
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
Yes, please.

94
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,560
Counterpoint to the desire to organize our affairs and have a story that we can tell with

95
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
the beginning and an end.

96
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,880
I think there's a tension because in historical terms, preceding, you know, long before there

97
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,760
was a scientific story of our origins as humans and the origin of the Earth or the origin

98
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,840
of the universe.

99
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,560
And long before there was a Judeo-Christian tradition with the Genesis, the major cultures

100
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,960
of the world in non, not in communication with each other had endless time, cycles of

101
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,040
time, the myth of the eternal return.

102
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,200
And that's a tradition that goes back to prehistory as long as we have records.

103
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:26,720
So simultaneously, from amongst the Aborigines with Dreamtime, amongst the early Asiatic

104
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,960
cultures, wherever we can understand their culture, they did not have origins.

105
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,960
They had cycles of time, cycles embedded within cycles.

106
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,800
We've been made familiar with the Mayans and their predictions recently, but that's a pretty

107
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,000
universal trade of humans.

108
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And to me, that speaks to the fact that there's a predilection to avoid the notion of beginnings

109
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
or endings, because as we've already seen, it's a bogus reassurance to say that you

110
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,240
have a story that begins and ends because immediately you have a boundary and then you

111
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,320
have to ask, as Greek philosophers asked, you know, well, if there's an edge to the universe,

112
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
what's beyond the edge?

113
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,200
And if there's a beginning of time, what started it or what was before that?

114
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,760
So you've not really finessed anything of the infinities by declaring that you have a

115
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,880
beginning and an end, and I think the ancient cultures just went with that and posited themselves

116
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,760
in essentially an infinite stream of events without maybe always thinking about it too

117
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,760
deeply, but they came up with that independently of each other around the world, which is just

118
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
meaningful to me.

119
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,080
Well, I mean, I think there's something interesting just about the cycles of time also because

120
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
that, I mean, some of this set...

121
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Okay, sorry.

122
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,400
I think there's something interesting about this idea of cycles of time, too, because

123
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
it's just...

124
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:51,560
It's how much time it exists because many of the central Asians that I work with and have

125
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,040
been around as well as a lot of the...

126
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,080
What I hear from the ethnologists that I work with at the museum, that they talk about this

127
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,120
idea of what time means and that...

128
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,960
I mean, I think that, you know, us, we sit here with our iPhones, our calendars and everything,

129
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,960
and we can say, well, okay, tomorrow, two days from now, I'm going to do this.

130
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,000
Last week, at this time, I was doing this, and whereas that, you know, so many of the

131
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,760
nomads, things that they'll talk about, things...

132
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,440
And they'll say, well, then you'll try to figure out, when did that happen?

133
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,760
And it turned out it happened like 125 years ago, but they're talking about it was like

134
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,920
the other day.

135
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,120
And so, like, I mean, the whole notion of how long these cycles are is very, very, very

136
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,000
culturally defined and very, very different.

137
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,520
And that's an interesting phenomenon itself because it makes you proximate in a community,

138
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
both in space and time.

139
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,920
You can have your neighbor who you shared a meal with the day before, and then you can

140
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,920
have this thought of something that actually happened three generations before you were

141
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,800
born, but it's just proximate in your culture.

142
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Exactly.

143
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
It's your neighbor.

144
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Exactly.

145
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,400
Well, I guess if it's my turn.

146
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,400
It's your turn now, but then we're not your turn.

147
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
It's my turn.

148
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,320
I mean, let me just...

149
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,640
If we start with the question, why do we care psychologically, why do we care about beginnings?

150
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,520
I mean, I guess we ought to get cleared sometimes because...

151
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:25,960
And to take another part of a larger version of the Bible, also, NRK-Ain logos, right,

152
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:33,160
in the beginning was the logos, was the word, because in a story like that, what happens

153
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:40,560
at the beginning organizes in a certain way, rationalizes, explains everything that comes

154
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,560
after.

155
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,480
But I want to distinguish that because we also have an astrophysicist here from simply being

156
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,000
curious about how things began, because I take it, the story we have now, is more or

157
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,640
less that the way things began, if they did begin physically, doesn't give us that, right?

158
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
It's an interesting story.

159
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,800
It's a fascinating story, but it's not one that particularly is going to make sense out

160
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,720
of everything that comes after.

161
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,680
So if you want to start by thinking why we're interested in beginnings, I think it's worth

162
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:21,320
while seeing that it's true, in narrative, often the beginning plays a very central role.

163
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,680
But if we're expecting that at the universe, we may be sorely disappointed.

164
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,680
Exactly.

165
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,000
I mean, maybe we should just poll the audience that does the knowledge that you are sitting

166
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,480
on a planet in this room having a conversation as part of a 13.7 billion year story that

167
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,560
led to the development of 100 billion galaxies and probably 10 to the 22 habitable planets

168
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,720
where analogs of this may or may not be occurring.

169
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,520
In a vast universe that's 45 billion light years across, does that reassure you that there's

170
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
a...

171
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Or not.

172
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,880
I mean, that's as good as we come up with.

173
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,960
You know, it makes cosmologists, you know, they pat themselves mildly on the back, but

174
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,640
not very much because most of the universe is still enigmatic.

175
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,000
But that's our backstory.

176
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's a pretty amazing backstory.

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm not sure if it satisfies the psychological requirement.

178
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,440
I think though, even within the context of like life on this planet that we can look

179
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,640
at it within this, the same sort of thing.

180
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,640
I mean, it's just that there's several historical events that have happened that at one point

181
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:34,960
that the Earth was pretty close to being completely like turning into an ice ball, like very

182
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,120
close to turning into an ice ball.

183
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,800
Everything like this is not in a distant past and this past paleontologically, it's maybe

184
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,380
about 300 million years ago, but certainly multis

185
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,880
certainly that there was organisms around and everything else.

186
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,640
And that would have been a very dramatic thing.

187
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,600
I mean, it would have basically stopped all the evolutionary development of organisms

188
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,320
to that point and it would have been like, you know, start over time.

189
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,920
And that, you know, that life on Earth is headed up and down in the same way.

190
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,320
And each one of those you could look at as a beginning, whether there's been massive

191
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,000
extinction and then there's been rebound after that.

192
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,680
So that, you know, the whole, you know, question of beginnings is basically, I think that what

193
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,920
you could pose to people in a strong reason come about cosmologists, you know, beginnings

194
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,800
of what?

195
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,920
So I mean, one question I would want to ask the animals that I believe to be most highly

196
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:38,000
sentient is, is do they have a, do they have a question about beginnings?

197
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,760
There's, you know, it's, it's controversial, all the evidence of this nature that elephants

198
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,440
mourn their dead and are aware of non-existent.

199
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,960
You know, there's a small set of higher mammals where there's apparently either some version

200
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,200
of a perception of self or some awareness of the possibility of non-existence.

201
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,280
But that's not, it's not proven at all.

202
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,920
But if I were wanting to interrogate an orca or an elephant or one of those animals, that

203
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,000
that's pretty much what I, if they have a transmitted culture, which is of course that

204
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,120
very high bar that we might ask of an animal to declare them somewhere in a, you know, plateau

205
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,680
around about our mountain top of intelligence, that's one, that's going forward.

206
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,960
And then I'd want to know what they think about origins.

207
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,920
So it's a, you know, it does mark us out.

208
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,200
And then you wonder in the history of the planet, you know, no one's ever got to the

209
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,320
stage we've got to ask such questions to talk about stories in this way.

210
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,000
Has it happened elsewhere in the universe?

211
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,040
I mean, yeah, it's since nobody's going to take my money for sure.

212
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,000
I'll place a heavy bet that yeah, it's happened somewhere else.

213
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:57,880
Well, I think that was my opportunity to tell the joke that I would mention to you.

214
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:06,960
So one of the questions that comes up with important for beginnings is the debates for

215
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:13,880
over morality of abortion and contraception and whatever.

216
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:26,120
So there is a joke which probably most of you know, but frankly some don't, is that

217
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:33,200
you have a rabbi, a Catholic priest and a Protestant minister discussing the question

218
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,280
of when does life begin.

219
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:46,400
And the Catholic priest says, well, we believe that life begins at the moment of conception

220
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,800
and Protestant minister thinks about this and says, well, you know, we have some somewhat

221
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,720
different view of things.

222
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:03,520
We believe that life begins when the fetus becomes reliable.

223
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,080
And the rabbi says, well, I don't know.

224
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:21,720
From my experience, we think that life begins when the children leave and the dog dies.

225
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,680
So there could be these different things about beginnings.

226
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:34,000
And how about like, you know, cultures, several cultures that don't think there is a beginning.

227
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,640
They just think that this is the way it's always been.

228
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,840
So you know, I've been wondering about this not so much in terms of beginning, but in

229
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:49,440
terms of everything that was being discovered in your field.

230
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,080
And I've often wondered why are we interested in it?

231
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:02,400
And so the issue of being interested in the beginning is related to our interest in learning

232
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,880
more about something.

233
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:15,640
And I'm not so sure why what makes, I'm not saying why in terms of its validity, why in

234
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:23,840
terms of our psychology as humans, at least not all humans, but some humans, so interested

235
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
in it.

236
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
And fascinated by it.

237
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,240
I think, I would like to hear your opinion on this.

238
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:37,120
I mean, the idea of the Victorian aspect of progress and the fact that I can talk about

239
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,760
a cosmic version of this, but the fact that we haven't always been here on this planet

240
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,160
and that we evolved and that we were sculpted by the environment and natural selection and

241
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,000
we have certain capabilities that we're overly impressed with, obviously.

242
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,520
But they're legitimate capabilities and I think that's reasonable to want to know that.

243
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:06,240
The cosmic spin on it might be that the universe contains carbon and without carbon organisms

244
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,800
like us would be impossible and it's actually hard to even contemplate theoretically how

245
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,680
to do as well without building blocks like that.

246
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,840
And so our stories are bound up with a history of star formation in the universe producing

247
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,680
the heavy elements upon which carbon chemistry depends and that's another Victorian notion

248
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,760
of the universe getting better and better and more and more and more prone to have life

249
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,160
in it because when the big bang happened, you had hydrogen, helium, a little smattering

250
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,640
of lithium and deuterium and that's it.

251
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,960
And the cosmic, the great designer sitting there with hydrogen and helium and trying

252
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,880
to stick them together can make exactly nothing, one hydrogen molecule and then you're done.

253
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,560
So the universe in a strain, you know, maybe that's another anthropic thing, we shouldn't

254
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,080
be surprised to live in an old and vast universe given that it's expanding.

255
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,160
It had to be old for there to have been enough generations of stars forming and dying and

256
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,600
ejecting their heavy elements to deposit enough of them on a rocky cinder around a middle

257
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,840
weight star to lead to us.

258
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,240
But that's a terrible post hoc story so it leads to the question, you know, why did

259
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,840
it go that way or how did it go?

260
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,960
Could we have been, could you posit us, and technically you could posit us within half

261
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,720
a billion years of the big bang.

262
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,800
There were parts of the universe within which there had been enough heavy elements produced

263
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,360
and almost certainly planets.

264
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,920
We found exoplanets that are 12.7 billion years old so we know planets existed pretty

265
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:44,360
early on so you could posit analogs of us very far back in cosmic time.

266
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,600
But what do we kid?

267
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Why do we care?

268
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,960
Maybe in the first astronomy and cosmology is probably bound a little bit in our uniqueness

269
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:00,360
and whether the things that happened, this crazy, careening history of life on this one

270
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,560
planet, is that a unique story or is that one of a large number of stories that could

271
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,320
be wildly different or maybe even similar.

272
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,280
Either of which is very interesting of course.

273
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:18,080
I mean the question why do we care?

274
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:25,760
You have to ask yourself to begin with what kind of understanding are we aiming at.

275
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:32,520
And a lot of the time you understand something by understanding at least immediately how it

276
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
came about.

277
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,160
So you're understanding what's going on now in terms of the situation a little bit earlier.

278
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,640
Now if you then are like obsessive about this the way philosophers are you then say okay

279
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,760
fine but now what about the earlier thing right?

280
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,800
I now need to understand that.

281
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,320
Well you in a practical sense can't go on forever backward so it's nice to find a place

282
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,000
where you feel like okay I'm satisfied stopping there.

283
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,840
Of course interesting that you might call a kind of narrative beginning it's actually

284
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,120
a stopping because what you're doing is thinking backward in time and finding a place where

285
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,440
I'm happy with that and once I see how where we are arose from that I have a sense of

286
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,340
comprehension.

287
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,520
That would suggest that we don't start out interested in beginnings we end up interested

288
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,920
in beginnings because we were trying to stop ourselves in a continual iterated set of questioning.

289
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:35,920
There's a kind of a forward version of that story which is a straightening Kafka I think

290
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:43,920
a lot where there's always in Kafka stories there's always this idea that just reaching

291
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,400
for something and you can't get blocked and keep going forward and it's trying to look

292
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,040
for the beginning.

293
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:58,600
I think there's a short essay about him about trying to find out what the law is and the

294
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,600
man kind of also in the castle there's a similar kind of thing that a man comes to this place

295
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,920
where the law is being kept and he wants to get into it and there's a guard and he won't

296
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,440
let him in and he said let me in I have to go.

297
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,040
He says look if I let you in you'll go in there but there'll be a guard who's even more powerful

298
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,680
than I am and will want to let you into the next room and if you do happen to get to the

299
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,960
next room there'll still be another guard.

300
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:34,240
So it's a kind of a it's going it's the same argument you have but going in the other direction

301
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:44,040
which I think and I think there's something deep about about people wanting to get away

302
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,320
from the present somehow either going to the future or to the past and then the things

303
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:58,160
are sort of and they want to in order to find out what find find their bearings in this

304
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:05,040
world you know you feel where you come from or where you're going to what the law is or

305
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,760
what the thing is so you're always knocking against these beginnings.

306
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:18,680
Because I think where I think that that's the way human beings are organized that way

307
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:26,240
because it's probably can be explained in evolutionary terms because we can do better

308
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:35,080
if we try to visualize what's going to happen next and try to organize ourselves and understand

309
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,560
our environment better.

310
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:46,120
I think it helps helps the survival and the going forward of then otherwise so probably

311
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:52,520
we're wired to ask this kind of existential question.

312
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,360
I think that one of the things that makes us you know fundamentally human is that we're

313
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
naturally curious.

314
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,720
I mean that's like led to our you know our ascent and melee to our demise but at the

315
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,800
same time I mean that we are by nature very curious and you know people as someone who

316
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,000
works on dinosaurs people always ask me well why do people care about dinosaurs why are

317
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,160
people so interested in dinosaurs.

318
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,480
And you know that on one level I say I don't know but I really don't know but on the other

319
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,440
level that I think that it's just a way in which that you know people can visualize something

320
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,440
that they can't see today that exists from the ancient past and they're able to just

321
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,000
work their minds out on it and you know and think about these things and think about them

322
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,760
in very very thoughtful kinds of ways and that you know we are curious I think about the

323
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,520
past we're curious about the future that you know everywhere you go in the world that

324
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,680
you know people are you know wanting more understanding of that whether it's like from

325
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:57,360
astronomy or whether it's from you know paleontology whether it's from archaeology and that you

326
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,320
can talk to you know cab drivers in Cambodia and stuff and that they'll ask you questions

327
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,240
about the past and you know what it tells us and things like that.

328
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,120
I mean I think that it's just it's a characteristic of us in general.

329
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:20,360
I think one indication of that is that in the I think there's a kind of a general in politics

330
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,240
here especially these last days it's kind of a general anti-intellectual attitude.

331
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,480
Nevertheless so that people say well why should we spend our hard-earned money with these

332
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,920
academics who do useless stuff.

333
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:41,000
Nevertheless there's no opposition to research in astronomy and there have been an astronomers

334
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,920
I must say a great admiration for them not only for the scientific accomplishments but

335
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,120
also for their accomplishments in getting these extremely expensive things funded.

336
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,960
And no one.

337
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,680
That's until we learn how to make black holes and then they're going to start locking us

338
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
up.

339
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:09,000
But no one objects and you can be the most right wing anti-government person and nevertheless

340
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,120
astronomy how can we deny those guys funds because you know the stars I mean so.

341
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,520
Where's the philosophers they're really subversive you have to be really what's that.

342
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
They won't get their own ideas.

343
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
You don't get any money.

344
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
They don't need it.

345
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,360
Which is the perfect pace from which to be subversive.

346
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,160
They don't need those fancy telescopes.

347
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,880
I don't think maybe they do nowadays.

348
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,520
But I wish it were true.

349
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,720
I wish I could tell myself it were true that people are interested in dinosaurs just out

350
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,880
of curiosity.

351
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:49,880
But you know go to a guy who's working on paleobotony and who's working out the structure of long

352
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,480
gone firms and you'll get a lot more people saying what the heck is that worth because

353
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,960
dinosaurs are big and scary and exciting.

354
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:07,520
I think you could really say that if you boil it all down to like that we are scientists

355
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,760
and stuff that if we sit around and we do science and there's two kinds of science you

356
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
could do.

357
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,360
You could do science the same science on charismatic organisms as non-caresmatic organisms.

358
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,960
If you work on charismatic organisms it's a lot more fun first because there's more

359
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,040
money in it as far as for your research.

360
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,200
And second we can talk to groups of people who are actually interested in what we do.

361
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,080
And also come to it with a lot more background knowledge.

362
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
Charismatic is relative.

363
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,880
I mean you and Wilson make ant sexy.

364
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
No questions.

365
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Exactly.

366
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,040
Exactly.

367
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:43,160
I think another part of the answer back to the curiosity question is it's meaning.

368
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:49,200
We're looking for meaning and a little warm like aspect of meaning in our brains is not

369
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,160
wanting to think that it's too accidental.

370
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,480
It has to make sense.

371
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,760
Like I don't, okay if I just woke up and I was a dog I'd have probably three thoughts

372
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,960
I think oh shit I'm a dog and then I think oh I'm going to die and then I get to why

373
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,680
am I a dog and why not something else.

374
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:19,760
And as a person my mom and my dad might have just through some glancing encounter with

375
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,200
a third party got drunk that evening and here I am.

376
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:30,240
Or my dad might have been the girl behind my mom in line and it was misread or whatever

377
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,840
and here I am.

378
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,680
Now is that accidental part of my story diminish me?

379
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,680
Well no because I'll rationalize it anyway I like.

380
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,920
But we want to tell the same story about humans and the story of how we came to be that it

381
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:51,320
not be an entirely serendipitous role of the dice that the contingencies not be so overwhelming

382
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:57,120
that there's and yet we also know the logical other point of this back from the teleology

383
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,960
and things that you know if you're not buying into a standard religious narrative you're

384
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,880
not wanting to posit yourself that way either.

385
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,080
So that's a tension there between the accidental and the inevitable.

386
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,440
It occurred to me one thing to mention on this topic which is the opposite side of the

387
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:25,560
coin you just gave about finding out that your origin was more or less accidental.

388
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,760
You often hear and this goes back to the narrative idea people want to know where they came from

389
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,240
to somehow find out the meaning invest their lives with meaning.

390
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,160
Am I here for a purpose was there some purpose?

391
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,800
And I guess it's worthwhile pointing out as far as I can tell even if there was it doesn't

392
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,440
help at all for most problems.

393
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,200
I mean if you went to your parents and you said why am I here and instead of this story

394
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,760
about the accidental meeting they said well you know we decided we wanted a chess playing

395
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,520
progeny right and we very specifically had you in order to train you as a chess player

396
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:07,120
and from your childhood they you know drilled chess into you and if you get to you know

397
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,200
your middle age and you say you know I just don't find chess interesting you know my I

398
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:19,000
don't find a life as a chess player fulfilling or important or satisfying finding out that

399
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,560
nonetheless that was your purpose right that was the purpose in your creation.

400
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,520
I didn't have doesn't help you at all right and say well sorry mom and dad you know I'm

401
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,880
going to disappoint you but the fact that I'm here you put me here for that purpose

402
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,800
just doesn't help me right so I think sometimes we again have way too high expectations for

403
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,640
what we even in principle could get out of an origin story.

404
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:53,520
There are certain kinds of desire for significance that no origin story of any sort could really

405
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,040
satisfy okay and you got to live with that but then you start working for your significance

406
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:04,440
elsewhere which I think is probably the best thing to do.

407
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:11,280
Well yeah but there is a kind of a practical idea of putting things in some sort of order

408
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:18,440
right for example if you are applying for a patent right it's nice to figure out whether

409
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,280
you were the first one to make this thing or something.

410
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:34,400
Yeah that's very exciting economic and also I should say that it's also very to change

411
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:42,720
things a little bit there's also a very useful thing of not having beginnings like for example

412
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,920
when people started counting everything was one two three and so on and it became within

413
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:57,360
it's every game evident that when people started going backwards it was very useful to put

414
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:06,880
it also zero minus one minus two and so on so that so that as I said there is a natural

415
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:15,120
thing that when you look for a beginning you are also looking for the end of what happened

416
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:23,200
before in some ways and this particular ability feeling of wanting things to be predictable

417
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:30,400
of something to do with it probably probably people feel that if they understand the past

418
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:37,920
they will learn from it or something like that seems to be empirically not verified right

419
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,400
and to make the same mistake over and over again.

420
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Well at least within the context of biological evolution though I mean it's just that it's

421
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,160
very very hard to predict anything from it because it is so influenced by singular historical

422
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,160
events I mean like you never know when a giant meteorite is going to hit the planet and wipe

423
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,920
everything out or you never know when just basic geological processes are going to happen

424
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,080
you never know like a lot of these things so it's like looking at the history of Western

425
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,200
Europe I mean things happen and they don't happen and if you re-ran the tape it would

426
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,800
be completely different completely different I mean so it's not as predictable as astronomy

427
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,320
or something like this where you are looking at an event but you also have a lot of large

428
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,080
numbers and you have some more basic sort of mathematics come to play on things so that

429
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,880
I'm sure that maybe 500 years from now when we get down to the nitty gritty and astronomy

430
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,120
it's going to be just as dirty as it is of looking at biological evolution and stuff because

431
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:41,280
it's when you're looking at specific cases in the evolution of you know singular systems

432
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,960
that they'll be just as hard.

433
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,720
In a sense the fact that it is unpredictable like that should be liberating because you

434
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,960
have a story and whether you like it or not that we all you know evolved from you know

435
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,900
slime mold that might be on your shower curtain or some relative of that you know we made

436
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:07,760
something of ourselves but you know really it sort of starts now I mean knowing the story

437
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,040
doesn't tell you how to go forward the future is that unpredictable that you wouldn't even

438
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:20,440
try I mean you know do you know how many teraflops of computer power is applied to weather forecasting

439
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,880
and the guy who's just told to say same as yesterday beats the computer beats the hundred

440
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,680
million dollar stations tell you something totally different so you know so don't feel very comfortable

441
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,560
about the power of technology applied to things that are chaotic or intrinsically unpredictable

442
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,560
and the evolution of life is going to be like that and then and then so then there you are

443
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,760
you're we're here and we got a we have a story it's interesting we can spin it whichever

444
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:52,760
way we like you know but the truth is it all really starts now we're all having our oh

445
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,800
shit I'm a dog moment which is oh shit I'm an early 21st century human on a planet that's

446
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,400
in some peril with a sort of technologically sophisticated but fundamentally tribal world

447
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,600
culture that's not quite getting it shit together and how's that gonna work you know

448
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,880
and do I have a pardon and can I help the whole picture as well as my little piece and

449
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,320
so that would be true whether the story started in a different way than it actually did it

450
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:29,680
almost doesn't matter so so beginnings don't matter do you think there'll be sunrise tomorrow

451
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,800
I'm persuaded Bertrand Russell told the story about that so I'm I always follow Bertrand

452
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:42,160
when I can't his story incidentally just a simple one the chicken the slightly smarter

453
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,880
than an average chicken anyone who's been on a farm knows how smart chickens are not

454
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:54,160
the chicken that has experienced the sun rising and the farmer coming out to scatter feed

455
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:04,040
and so inductively concludes that this rising ball this light in the sky leads to the food

456
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,360
for the day and then one morning the sun rises and the farmer comes out and sprinkles the

457
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,960
chicken for the dinner table the drastic failure of inductive reasoning but then it's just

458
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:23,880
the chicken so you know it's okay so I believe in it slightly more than the chicken does

459
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,520
or for different reasons but the chicken was right and believe the sun would rise right

460
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:35,320
that's true yes we all have our stories it's fine but so that there is maybe there is some

461
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:43,360
kind of value to knowing what happened before to predict what was going to happen in the

462
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:55,360
future yeah but that's only a probabilistic argument right right everything is a probabilistic

463
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:08,920
argument of course but they kind of curiosity that you are using to explain why we are looking

464
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:17,560
to find out more about beginnings origins and so on and cosmology you don't find that

465
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:23,680
amongst all the people that you meet I mean in your travels I think that probably I mean

466
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,960
I think it's pretty much a cultural is a universal I mean people are interested in that they're

467
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,600
either interested in or they have a story of where they came from and so that's a form

468
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:43,320
of a beginning and most of them have some apocalyptic story about what's going to happen

469
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:50,160
to them in the end what will happen in the end I mean it's just I mean you know as we

470
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,080
were talking earlier it's like that's something sort of a universal sort of thing amongst culture

471
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,840
around the world so so here's a straightforward anthropological question you said before there

472
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,640
are lots of cultures that yeah had a sense that there wasn't a beginning the time was

473
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,160
they've always been there but is there a culture that doesn't have an origin myth

474
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,920
and origin some kind of origin myth that's passed down it may not sort of cohere with

475
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,720
the idea that things have been around for them not that I'm familiar with but but you

476
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,880
would think I mean it seems like one years everybody has some narrative right every

477
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,760
culture develop some narrative that you call an origin right and it's also I think not

478
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,440
this not my field but what I've read about it is it's interesting that many of those

479
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:37,560
cultures the Judeo-Christian narrative you know with has its obvious moral underpinning

480
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,440
and overlay but that's also true in these cyclic stories of time there's a redemption

481
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,040
rebirth there's apocalypse and so you know these are very common themes even when time

482
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:55,840
can be considered cyclic and maybe not explicitly eternal because it's not always conceptualized

483
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:02,400
that way but operationally it might as well be eternal but it still has a moral overlay

484
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,640
and a cycle which means something to the person who's posited within that cycle within a cycle

485
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:16,720
within a larger cycle that becomes essentially infinite as far as they can tell so it doesn't

486
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,000
the timeline you know could be as close to infinite as makes no difference and it seems

487
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,680
that there's a universal yearning to have a tether in it and to have a an operational

488
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:37,440
as sort of an action oriented or moral tether in it you know a reason to be connected to

489
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,520
this chronology not just it's there it very different from okay to take a completely

490
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,840
a sort of crazily hypothetical different scenario as you some of you have probably read this

491
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:57,800
and I'm sure you know all about it the you know there's a there's a premise out there

492
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,040
that if there's intelligent life in the universe it's almost certain that we're not the first

493
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:09,920
or the most advanced and you can follow various arguments that include the possibility that

494
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,560
you know we're living in a simulated reality created by aliens that are just a lot smarter

495
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,840
than we are and they don't even have to be that much smarter just because we're only

496
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,520
a few we're only a few centuries from this capability which is a you know nothing is

497
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:29,400
the link of the eye and it caused me time so if you think so then you have an interesting

498
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,720
a true question to ask yourself if you thought you're living in a computer simulation of

499
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,560
some superior an entity that's so sophisticated you can't really understand them does it change

500
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,560
the way you view your life would you behave differently everyone should be able to ask

501
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,080
themselves that question because I'm telling you right now there's a finite probability

502
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:55,440
that it's true and the case so it's a completely sensible thing just like you know you walk

503
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,560
out in the street and there's a big gold ingot sitting there and there's no one around and

504
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,160
you should always ask yourself you know would I take it if I could lift it up and you may

505
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,280
be confident in your answer you should always ask yourself all these hypothetical questions.

506
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:17,600
But I think like you know some of the things about making us different from other you know

507
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,280
animal species on the planet and stuff is just we get away from instinct in that we actually

508
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:28,280
we have this curious aspect to ourselves and one of my friends who one time said like

509
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,960
what you know humans became humans for that they they got over one of the three most

510
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,080
basic things that are instinctual amongst animals and one is that you know looking around a

511
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:47,320
group of other animals you say like I eat that I run from that and I screw that so like once

512
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:53,400
we became bigger than that we became to be you know look at the world and try to explain

513
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,640
why we did that and that was like the beginning that was like with the origin of humankind

514
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:06,360
maybe 300,000 years ago. I mean it's interesting to notice it's also of course the source of

515
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:13,160
all our troubles as well. I mean that particular story if you look in the republic and Plato's

516
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:20,840
republic he starts to first design an ideal city and the ideas to say well what do we

517
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:27,840
need we need food shelter clothing so let's figure out how many people would take to make

518
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,560
that in the most efficient way find out who's good at what do it all about we have a small

519
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,880
group of people and they don't have to work much because that's and then they just sing

520
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:44,120
a lot and they they sleep on on rough ground and having a wonderful life and the immediate

521
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:49,520
response of Gao Kahn and Adam Antis is you know if you were designing a city for pigs

522
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,760
what else would you give them we need couches we need sofas we need luxuries right this

523
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,920
is not a good city and it seems to be you know Plato's point was exactly the same one

524
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,920
because you think my dog you feed him you give him a nice place to sleep he has no ambitions

525
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:14,160
beyond that right he's not driven by insatiable desires insatiable ambitions and Plato's point

526
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,520
is then you see what happens because humans have these insatiable desires and mostly it's

527
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:26,480
bad but maybe one good one was a kind of insatiable curiosity as well right an insatiable sense

528
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,240
of of wanting a further story about things that maybe leads to you know at least led to

529
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,720
science and when properly harnessed but it it also seems to be the thing that you know

530
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,840
leads to all our troubles as well would you say looking at the arc of life on earth or

531
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,160
just the way that evolution works as you understand it that it would this would be a

532
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:55,880
dysfunctional capacity I mean we've sort of with technology was sort of transcended some

533
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,480
of the natural limitations we had thousands of years ago but in general this this sort

534
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:07,200
of insatiable thing it could be seen as being this very disceye I think the like you know

535
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,760
you met like there's a lot of ways to look at the evolutionary process and certainly I

536
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,760
mean that there's been a lot of you know talk both from you know people working doing experimental

537
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,560
work as well as mathematical simulation about that evolution is all about escalation so

538
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:28,840
that you know where that escalation takes you might not always be a good place because

539
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,400
you know that even that there's you know classic examples in our own bodies like our knees

540
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,040
like if you're an engineer and you're going to design those that they don't work and

541
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:44,880
that but it's just a combination of what we started with and then what that when we became

542
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,880
bipedal then that we ended up with which isn't necessarily a good way to be and that you

543
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,160
know you can take to the more macro level and say that well you know that the evolution

544
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,280
of ourselves the evolution of other animals and things like that hasn't always for the

545
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,400
health of the planet if you could measure that in some empirical kind of way isn't the best

546
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:12,520
place and that I mean what evolution optimizes on is not always good.

547
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,400
On the other hand you might sort of discover mathematics and be so happy that you forgot

548
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,600
to run away or run after anything or screw anything and then I guess then you die up

549
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,600
too.

550
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,680
Theities was looking up at the sky and found it well.

551
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:31,640
I mean you know the original lab is what happened.

552
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:38,360
And there are you know that I it's hard to deny that that insatiability has led to some

553
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:44,680
of our current problems but there's this bizarre strand of futurist thought you know

554
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:51,880
there it's the Kurzweisels of the world and others who really think that we have enough

555
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:57,680
capacity to satisfy you know then you know once you've got okay I know this isn't true

556
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,640
even in a city like this but once you've got you know seven or eight cars you can't really

557
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,920
drive anymore and once you've got seven holiday homes you can't really get to anymore so

558
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:16,480
you know you can in a situation of large capacity for wealth or creation of resources where resources

559
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,640
become essentially free and there are some economic models that you know that you might

560
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,000
just think they're just wildly optimistic and unrealistic but they exist and they have

561
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,640
as much validity going forward into an uncertain future as anything that say that we could

562
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,720
get to this a happy place.

563
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,720
That's not human psychology.

564
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:39,360
I mean we were just like my wife was just reminding me there was a story in NPR about

565
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,640
somebody it was about collecting they had different stories about collecting.

566
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,640
There was one guy who what he collected was copies of the Beatles white album.

567
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,120
The same exactly the same he had five hundred copies as many as he could get his hands

568
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:59,800
on right everyone exactly the same all I guess in a shelf that was nothing but copies of

569
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,400
the white album.

570
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,400
Now you'd think one would be enough or maybe two if you want to be careful.

571
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,080
There's you know there's something you can get yourself in a frame of mind where and he's

572
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,360
not even competing it's not like you know he's staying ahead of the guy who's got four

573
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,560
hundred ninety nine and he is five hundred.

574
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,160
You know there's something in the human mind human character that can.

575
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:29,640
I think I think the Brezhnev had maybe a hundred cars and he wants to collect two more.

576
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:36,400
So so the optimistic the optimistic read on this is that we also have the itch to create

577
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,640
and there's no limit to that I mean I know young people who come up and they want to

578
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:47,040
do popular music and they just think you know every popular song that could be worth listening

579
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,560
to has already been written you know surely.

580
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:56,720
But of course it's not true so in the creative arts the potentials for future creation or

581
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,280
nobody knows what the bounds are.

582
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:04,440
So there's an unlimited potential future resource that doesn't really negatively impact anyone.

583
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,040
I mean eventually we'll just all walk around groaning.

584
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,440
Oh god not more beautiful poetry I don't have time for it you know.

585
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:17,880
I already read 50 poems today you know I'm sated for whatever it is so that's a part

586
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:25,200
of our insatiable that I don't know has it downside and you know we maybe can conduit

587
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:31,640
that or maybe there's their external shaping circumstances that could lead that to be obviously

588
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,840
more valued than it is now or because that that's something where you just follow it

589
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:45,120
you can keep going there's no reason to put a bound on it.

590
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:52,040
I don't know I mean the capacities of every person sort of limited in these insatiable

591
00:50:52,040 --> 00:51:02,760
thing to do something and pushes all else out you know it may not work out so well.

592
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,720
But a lot of it is also you know that I mean we say that yeah you know that every all 7

593
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:14,360
billion of us on the planet can have a much better life well that's just us.

594
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,520
I mean that says nothing about the rest of the planet.

595
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:21,920
I mean definitely I mean we have the technology and the resources especially moving forward

596
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:30,240
to probably have quadruple the population of the planet and that quadrupling of the

597
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,360
population of the planet had each individual person have a much better life but that the

598
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,960
other organisms of the planet and the other things that you know some people like hold

599
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,920
dear like you know rainforest things like that that's not going to be part of the equation

600
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,880
I mean that's going to be the sacrifice part of it and stuff so that you know the improving

601
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:57,640
people's lives comes as a caught and increasing population comes as a cost to other things.

602
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,760
I actually think we'll get to the point of being able to create new beginnings you know

603
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,160
I have to say this because I'm an astro geek but I think you know despite the doldrums

604
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,480
you see around you of the space program and you know 7% of the students I teach don't

605
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:20,680
think we went to the moon it's drives me crazy maybe it's even 10% I don't know it's a significant

606
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:26,080
number but and the shuttle is old and decrepit and nobody likes a space station the whole

607
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:31,640
thing is just kind of a mess and and you then you look at the exponentiation of your electronic

608
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,800
digital life and think what's going on where's the connection here anyway I think that's

609
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,960
just a bump I think we'll get through that and so I think in 100 maybe put a number on

610
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:48,000
100 years we'll have a new beginning which amounts to us going off Earth and that will

611
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,680
be an extraordinary thing that will be a new story of us of and it won't and it'll stop

612
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:59,080
being us they'll be different people they won't be us after a while but we'll be invested

613
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:04,960
in it and I won't get to live to see that but I think it's going to happen and so the

614
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:11,640
beginnings can take turns that you didn't expect I think this is nice not just one story I

615
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:19,280
hope I believe we may generate multiple stories what do you think about them what going off

616
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,880
the planet and becoming and changing not just of course I mean it'll it'll be like Wally

617
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:36,880
well it's totally different but yeah I mean I mean even within and it's not just the crackpot

618
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,480
element and stuff who says this and stuff even that there are some pretty well-known

619
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,800
biologists who really feel that even life itself may have come from someplace else on

620
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:51,040
our own planet and stuff as far as that you know that looking at the chemistry some meteorites

621
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,320
that have amino acids in them and things like that so like I mean that the basic building

622
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:00,320
of blocks might not have been things that were assembled on our own planet I mean I disagree

623
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,400
with that but I mean that this is not just like I said it's not crackpot stuff it's not

624
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,840
outside the idea of rationality but I'm I mean so I'm going to be a little bit of the

625
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:17,080
contrary in here I'm I just don't see it as if it were to occur I'm not I'm not sure

626
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:22,000
why it would be so significant I mean right now as you say we have people who live for

627
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,640
long periods in a space station that's orbiting here it's kind of unusual hundred years ago

628
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,040
you would have thought amazing we're kind of bored by that right what are they they're

629
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,560
up there we don't even know what they're doing we don't pay attention to what they're doing

630
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,720
we don't think this is the beginning of a new humanity if new had become president and

631
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:44,600
we got a moon colony my guess is we put a lot of money into it and some people would

632
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,920
live up there and every now and then we check in and say how are things on the moon they

633
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:54,320
say fine but we wouldn't think it was a new beginning for humanity or it I mean people

634
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,120
are kind of odd about this is idea you should well we should go to Mars because what if

635
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:04,760
we ruin the earth then we can terraform Mars and you think we can do bad things to the

636
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:09,960
earth but we can't do anything so bad it'll make it look like Mars right if we if we could

637
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,160
make Mars habitable we ought to be able to make the earth habitable heck of a lot more

638
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:20,800
easily so I think again I think there's a kind of romanticism which you understand of

639
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:27,480
this of it being new and it being amazing and but you know of course new things become

640
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:33,880
quickly old and the amazement rubs off kind of quickly so I'm I'm if you ask me would

641
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,880
even if we were to invest in interplanetary travel or something like that would that be

642
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:43,080
a new beginning to humanity I can't see why I can't quite see why it would be I mean we

643
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,080
could right now send people to live down at the bottom of the sea it wouldn't be I guess

644
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:51,280
that expensive be a very different kind of isolated hermetic life and they would live

645
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,560
differently and they'd look out the windows and see things we don't see every day we'd

646
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:00,200
get the board with a reality show after a while yeah it would start Monday I mean it

647
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,280
is just a glorified reality show at the beginning I mean the space station right that's a good

648
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,400
example because that's that's no further straight out than you could drive in an afternoon so

649
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,920
that's pathetic that's not that's not space I mean it's expensive but it's not space no way

650
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:20,000
would happen is in a hundred years because it could the technology is available I mean

651
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,600
it will be people taking a one way trip there's a coin tus odds that there's an earth like

652
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:31,360
planet on one of the office around one of the office and Tory pair of stars that are

653
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,600
sunlight it's a really and astronomers will know within a couple of years whether and

654
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,840
and so that would be amazing if in a universe what we think is littered with habitable planets

655
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,880
but the distances are large we lucked into a habitable planet around the closest start

656
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:50,760
it really could happen it's very interesting and at that point you would go you know someone

657
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:56,960
would go so what kind of probabilities do you assign to all this the existence of an

658
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:04,840
earth like I know this is a finding considerably or finding such a thing oh it's uh it's good

659
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:12,560
I mean it's the techniques are available to find Mars mass or even lower mass at 10 20 30

660
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:19,720
light years so if those planets exist we'll know it and then we'll know how you'll find

661
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:25,080
planets that conceivably could have this kind of so you the detection of the planet and

662
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:29,200
its mass and its orbit and whether it's in a habitable zone that's techniques already

663
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:35,880
in hand yes but what's the probabilities oh it's actually how many of these planets are

664
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:42,800
in in the Milky Way there are a hundred round numbers a hundred million terrestrial habitable

665
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:48,000
planets which is the portion of them will be hazardous oh that's we have no idea so it's

666
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,920
then it's a that's a question for you you have a hundred million petri dishes right how many

667
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,800
of them do you think something interesting happened or anything and then something interesting

668
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:03,000
right I mean again that's it's it's a very difficult question because it depends on something's

669
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,120
going to happen a lot of them something interesting might happen in a very smaller amount but

670
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:12,640
but you know going back to the habitable planet idea you know what about even like that building

671
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:18,600
an atmosphere on Mars so it just turns out that NASA you know you can pull off the shelf

672
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:23,800
NASA have done that and it's it is you're right it's absolutely insanely difficult and

673
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:29,840
expensive just terraforming Mars is a three stage process and the minimum is about a thousand

674
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,520
years and a hundred trillion dollars minimum and they've costed it that's not just a ballpark

675
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:39,640
number that's an alright actual massive people do this is more expensive when they actually

676
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:45,400
get done and so was a close to where he also can do it cheaper and then the other thing

677
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:51,480
you said is exactly right that it you know we're always better off not soiling our own

678
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:56,840
you know place and making it better and or even finding parts of it we can live in living

679
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:01,640
in domes or under the sea or whatever it's just so much easier than going to Mars so so

680
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:07,600
yet we're not going to go off Earth in that limited way I think it's more this more purely

681
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:14,040
adventurous thing where with the one way ticket and an uncertain future you take the minimum

682
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:20,040
genetically viable population will be you know a quarter a hundred I guess six seventy

683
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:25,840
eighty individuals and they will go to some earth like planet where you've diagnosed the

684
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:30,400
atmosphere and you know that it's breathable more or less and they are and within three

685
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,600
generations they will start to not be us I mean they're there they're their environment

686
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,640
will be different enough if they survive of course they may not survive so but that and

687
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:48,280
yes they'll be sending their information back and it'll be this crazy reality show but so

688
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,400
it's not necessarily a new beginning of us of course we would rather I think most of

689
00:59:53,400 --> 01:00:00,080
us would rather have a new beginning here you know by resetting on some of the dysfunctional

690
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,880
bad stuff but that's very hard to do because how do you get everyone in a room to push

691
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:08,320
the reset right I mean that would be much more reasonable as I say we sort of invest

692
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:13,440
our hopes in funny ways I mean even take the case it always occurs to me suppose in one

693
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,320
of your habitable planets there's even already inhabitant and there's a civilization and

694
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:25,840
so on and you know of course our whole science fiction industry has been suggesting that

695
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:30,840
it would be the great it would be in a certain way this great thing to find this other intelligent

696
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:36,600
civilization and of course it would be fantastically interesting but on the other hand I mean think

697
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:43,400
about it from the other side what do they find they just find us right for them the big

698
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,880
thing is to come here and what look at I love Lucy I mean you know we'll get chairs like

699
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:53,640
this wow look you made it I mean it's not clear that this other civilization would in somehow

700
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:59,080
be intrinsically different but whether it would be intrinsically higher or better or you know

701
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:03,480
lend significance to our life in a deep way it's hard to see why because otherwise we

702
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,880
have the capacity to do that to them we ought to do it to ourselves first right let's give

703
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,080
our own life meaning and you know do things nicely around here and show them something

704
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:19,360
when they show up but it would be the fascinating part of that was that this is of course making

705
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:26,360
these crazy assumptions of roughly equivalent sentience intelligence and even communication

706
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:31,200
which are impossible but they will have a story they will have an origin story and it

707
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:36,000
will be different you know regardless of the cultural differences on this planet which

708
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,560
have led us to slaughter each other in vast numbers so they're not trivial we still have

709
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:46,080
the same story I mean it is in the end the same story it's one story to know that there

710
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:54,000
were other stories in existence that is those sentient intelligent entities evolved and exist

711
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,760
elsewhere and then to actually learn one or more of those stories that would be extraordinary

712
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:05,840
I mean it would recontextualize our story at some level it wouldn't negate it or trivialize

713
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:13,760
it but it would sure be an interesting thing to know about the difference between philosophy

714
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:21,560
and cosmology none because we don't know you know cosmology you know I'm not going to

715
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:26,440
even I'm not going to brag about it at all it's some level there's been some success but

716
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:33,560
the ultimate endeavor you know runs into a brutal wall of ignorance because we don't

717
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:37,840
know what the two major ingredients of the universe are dark matter dark energy each

718
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:44,840
of them represents new and unknown physics at some level we have a story that the vectors

719
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:50,600
backed points backwards towards an initial state that we don't understand we don't have

720
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:56,680
a good theory of and and so yeah I mean there's big question marks all over the place so you

721
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:03,080
know so the chronology from about a microsecond forward yeah we can we can paint that nicely

722
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:08,160
but you're exactly right you're driven if you're doing your job properly to not be satisfied

723
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,200
with explaining everything that happened after a microsecond after the big bang you want

724
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:17,880
to know initial conditions why I got that way and no all bets are off that is truly

725
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:23,000
natural philosophy at this point some very clever theories some great ideas and you know

726
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,440
but I'm a kind of gritty you know show me let me pour my telescope at something you know

727
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:35,400
give me some evidence and not yet not now so the same sorts of arguments go for the origin

728
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:41,560
of life I mean like you know we have catalytic activity and even self-replicating activity

729
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:45,680
and things that aren't white but organizing all of that into something which actually

730
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:54,520
you know really works as a excuse me as a biological machine is something which is unexplained and

731
01:03:54,520 --> 01:04:00,520
that's a that's a fascinating part of what of you the origin of what you do which is it

732
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,080
seems to me that the origin of life you know something we do care about it's our story

733
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:09,640
it's the very beginning of our story because it's historical science we may never we might

734
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:15,000
not ever know the answer right exactly I mean I think we'll never know the real answer but

735
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,440
we might be able to model it and come up with a proxy for it that we say well this is the

736
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,440
best simulation that we can do but because it is historical that we're we're burdened

737
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,440
by this historical contingency we weren't there

738
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:33,440
are you ready to take questions?

739
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:41,440
I'll show sure go ahead yeah I think given that we're in a house of psychoanalysis that

740
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:49,440
we would be remiss if we didn't reference something about the developmental aspects of

741
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:58,440
curiosity and you know Jacob Arlo in 1982 wrote a very interesting paper on scientific

742
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:09,440
cosmology and roman biology and here here Mike is uh thank you thank you

743
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:18,440
Jacob Arlo wrote an interesting paper in 1982 quote scientific cosmogony mythology and immortality

744
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:28,440
and he basically saw the conciliance between our theories about the origins of the universe

745
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:37,440
mythology and the unconscious fantasies derived from early childhood wishes and beliefs regarding

746
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:48,440
procreation you don't have to go further than Corbae's the origin of the world to gain

747
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:55,440
understandings about unconscious processes related to how a child asks questions about

748
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,440
the first really the first epistemological question is where did I come from where do

749
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:06,440
babies come from and I think it's an interesting perspective to think about how we frame questions

750
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:16,440
as adults about beginnings and what connections that has to earliest mental life in solving

751
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:23,440
the problem of where one originates as a child because a child is confronting a very

752
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:33,440
bewildering world filled with intense motivations and in relation to your idea about people

753
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:40,440
becoming something other than human I think as long as we are raised in small cohorts where

754
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:47,440
we're mapping our motivations on the relationships with parents there's beginnings will never be

755
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,440
new in a certain sense because we'll always be starting off with the same kinds of questions

756
01:06:52,440 --> 01:07:02,440
anyway I mean that makes me wonder how these questions will change and the stories the answers

757
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:11,440
given when we start cloning when we start genetically modifying humans not creating an

758
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,440
an issue obviously but you know that those will be different stories that the uniqueness

759
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:23,440
the issue of uniqueness the origin the motivation of the origin the story I don't think we're

760
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:30,440
ready to answer questions like that even as we prepare the technologies to do it is there

761
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:38,440
I mean this is I know nothing about child development it's relevant but I'm just curious when you say

762
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:47,440
the world for a child is bewildering I'm just wondering what reason to think it is bewildering

763
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:55,440
to them I mean they they it seems from what I understand children come with certain

764
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:01,440
expectations basic physics expectations so that things can violate those expectations and they

765
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:07,440
get startle responses or whatever from you know from essentially time zero

766
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:17,440
bewilderment really does suggest a kind of very sophisticated desire for an explanation

767
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:24,440
and I just wonder why why think that kids I mean I understand after a while they may come to ask

768
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,440
questions but when you say the world is bewildering to them rather than say actually quite familiar

769
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:33,440
you know we've all seen the little kid who's who's trying to get the the time magazine

770
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:39,440
cover to change by you know because they're so used to iPads why well they grew up with

771
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:45,440
you know they weren't bewildered they're bewildered why it doesn't change now right so I mean it just doesn't

772
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:52,440
meet their expectations right they form certain expectations in a very road kind of way so

773
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:57,440
when you when you have this description of the life I mean I always it's always curious to me you know

774
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:03,440
what one thought is yes it's a world of bright vibrant colors and confusion and so on or for all I know it

775
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:09,440
might be a world that actually was rather dull and you know every day I don't know how do you tell I mean how do you

776
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,440
think you can get yourself into the well I think I think I'm a logical state of it well what I'm

777
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:19,440
referring to is the disparity between the experience of reality and the child's and the domination of

778
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:27,440
fantasy in early mental life and the difficulty that the child has in sorting out the two so that those

779
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:32,440
early questions right are are at you know very much at the heart of that disparity

780
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:49,440
should we open it for questions go ahead there's the you have to walk to the microphone there

781
01:09:49,440 --> 01:10:02,440
so we pointed out that every traditional society has a creation myth and we live in a sort of amethical

782
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:08,440
scientific world view where we don't allow the scientific story of creation to fulfill a myth

783
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:18,440
mythic role in our society so my my the question would be or if it is a myth it's an anti-myth it's

784
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:24,440
a myth of meaninglessness and purposelessness kind of a stoic existentialist story which works for me some

785
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:33,440
days a week but not every day of the week so so so there's something

786
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:43,440
an thetical about the way that we are trying to incorporate the new scientific origin story which has the benefit of

787
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:51,440
being progressively true truer and and practical all kinds of ways but something antithetical to

788
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:59,440
something about human nature and human societies which needs some framework of meaning and purpose in

789
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:08,440
order to function coherently so how do we how might we address that question

790
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:16,440
I'm going to repeat myself a little bit here but because it was one of the things I kept coming back to

791
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:28,440
I just think there's a kind of error in thinking that the origin story even could play the sort of role

792
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:38,440
people so that the scientific I don't think the scientific story should bother you at all people have a tendency to have these

793
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:47,440
thoughts that seem to render their lives meaningless like you say oh a thousand years from now who will know

794
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:57,440
what conversation went on in this room or you know how well I did in this or that nobody will remember so what's the point

795
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:04,440
and I sort of never got it right why should I care what they know about a thousand years from now right if if my child

796
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:10,440
falls down and and skins her knee and I'm going to comfort her I don't what what's the point of thinking a thousand years from now

797
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:16,440
no one will never know I comforted my child right well I'm not doing it for them a thousand years ago I'm doing it for her right now

798
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:24,440
and why is it significant because she's hurt I'm making her better right you know her life is better because I'm doing this

799
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:38,440
I mean these sorts of and is a very trivial kind of thing but it seems to me if you if you're expecting something from a kind of cosmic story

800
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:45,440
that it couldn't give you no matter how it came out then of course you're going to be disappointed but I think it was always the wrong place to look

801
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:51,440
and that's why I don't think the scientific you know replacing it with a scientific story should have really any effect at all

802
01:12:51,440 --> 01:13:01,440
if you're answering a philosopher not as a sociologist or psychologist or how do I'm not currently so if you're asking how do you get people to realize that

803
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:14,440
to care yes here on a lot of them yes yes yes and he's in the anti-intellectual or just yes movements that continue to have feet changed by the past

804
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:34,440
so right now so the first part was to say if you if you sort of think it through deeply it's a misplaced you know emphasis now you're asking me how do you get people to replace their irrational thoughts with rational thoughts

805
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:51,440
and if I could answer that I'd be very happy I'm I'm unfortunate I have nothing to say they're much more trivial things like climate change and so on where you say well all the rational evidence goes one direction how why is it we can't just convince people in everyday life that this is a real problem

806
01:13:51,440 --> 01:14:09,440
against because there are people whose you know personal interests are such that they don't want you to realize it's a problem I have nothing on that wonderfully important question I've been used to say so yeah my job is trying to trying to figure out how things are but then

807
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:27,440
but then but then changing things how they should be is you know that's above my pay grade my question is similar it's one of the original question you asked is why do we care about this and we care about it because

808
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:43,440
you know the elephant in the room is God you know like if the universe is eternal we don't need a creator and if suddenly we find that it isn't it was created then where did it come from so you have Lawrence Krauss who talks about a universe from nothing

809
01:14:43,440 --> 01:15:02,440
and then you have people who say okay well there's all intelligent design and so forth and there was a purpose and I think to a certain extent what everybody is asking if there is no purpose then of course there's no life after death there's none of the other perks that come along with somebody looking over for you

810
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:22,440
and I think you know not that you know there's anything new but it's just I think that was the elephant in the room well but the elephant has been sticking its trunk in I mean Chris mentioned before what if we're all in a simulation and so our as we're accurate creation story is some extraterrestrial civilization

811
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:40,440
created very powerful computers and gave to their fifth graders you know a take home project create a simulated world and we happen to live in it right it's my preferred deistic right the question he asked which I think is perfectly accurate is

812
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:59,440
okay that interesting so what right get up tomorrow morning you still got to make breakfast all of that and I think even if it's God I mean this was sort of the point I was saying about the children even if it's God none of that will will give us we can't derive

813
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:12,440
significance from that people who ascribe to religious dictates tell you that God has a purpose and this is what you must do but you know so why must I do it I mean it may be your afterlife

814
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:41,440
things is he's gonna beat me up forever if I don't but that's a kind of my thin way to put my life people blowing you know buying into buildings and doing all sorts of terrible things because of these beliefs so absolutely also regarding cosmic the cosmic story told by science I don't really think there's any you know I don't it's not a Stephen J Gould non overlapping magic theory I I mean because people individuals you know mash these things up amazingly

815
01:16:41,440 --> 01:17:00,440
I have I give science literacy type surveys to my students 18 year old at a big state university and they show a fantastic ability to hold you know a reasonable comprehension of the major tenets of modern science alongside superstitions religious faith

816
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:18,440
all sorts of things everyone's a mashup it's a marble rye so but as far as the cosmology goes whether it's a you know a big bang that's all we can say or some eternal some multiverse site you know endless timeline eternal past eternal future that that really does to me it has no connection

817
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:47,440
or implication to to to the landscape it has no projection into the belief system particularly it's not required I think also like you know I mean I think that as a scientist one of the things that I try to point out is that you know that you know calling it the scientific creation story is not really what it should be called because it's not really a story I mean there's a big difference between thinking and believing and that you know that has somebody who

818
01:17:47,440 --> 01:18:01,440
works and things you have to be everyday prepared that you're going to go in through office one morning you're going to turn your computer on and somebody is going to have written something which is going to cause you to say everything that I've ever done in my entire career is bullshit

819
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:11,440
and I just got to like get on with it and think within this new paradigm and that's not the way the belief systems work I mean because belief systems continue to

820
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:34,440
reinterpret all new data within the construct of those belief systems instead of abandoning totally what they've had before and I mean you guys at that experiment would have really been right in in in Europe a few months ago from that they had particles going faster than the speed of light if that would have been true that would have been a big problem for a lot of modern physics and modern astronomy

821
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:45,440
of course that's that's when it's fun you know most of us wanted that right right right right that's a free apple card yeah exactly exactly so

822
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:55,440
but the but the GPS this is not my question yeah but but the uh blaming and on a miscalbrated GPS has been refuted so it's still an open question

823
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:03,440
so um no it's been resolved has it yeah yeah they actually something was plugged in not completely

824
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:19,440
yeah yeah it wasn't a GPS they were receiving the time signals and it goes into a calibrator and literally the connection wasn't quite made properly and it introduced a 60 nanosecond delay and that was it it's

825
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:32,440
it's amazing you know you're over throwing the laws of physics based on it you know connect or not quite and just just as it's that's one line of the aliens code going wrong and it's more like tribal civilization

826
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:43,440
just one little line of course so here's the thing so I'm going to do something that's going to sound a little simplistic but I'm going to bring this back to a neuro biological interpretation

827
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:54,440
so one thing that hasn't been addressed directly is that we are here talking about what we're talking about in a structure that started as an idea because of our complex and

828
01:19:54,440 --> 01:20:05,440
civilization specifically I want to talk about the frontal cortex where the planning the ability to plan to foresee a future to imagine a future largely occurs

829
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:17,440
now that said and referring back to Damasio-self come to mind in the case that the emergent self awareness that every human being individually goes through that we went through as a species

830
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:29,440
one I would imagine a great source of anxiety that gives rise to religions and their stories is the fact that we are aware of our own mortality

831
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:39,440
so I wanted to ask how many of you would care to respond to the to the question that once we have a robust functional and structural connect on

832
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:53,440
and we really advanced technology such as optogenetics and the next generation of fMRI that goes beyond statistical analysis there are some already in play as you may know

833
01:20:53,440 --> 01:21:06,440
once we understand the language of the brain do you think that will answer the question why we care from the frontal cortex? That's the question

834
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:18,440
I mean that's way outside my field as I understand the research though that if that hypothetical is a huge one because that area of research

835
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:31,440
I mean if you think understanding the singularity and the initial conditions of the big bang is a challenge then go work on the mind brain problem for a decade or a whole year

836
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:42,440
so I am not familiar enough with the current state of the research but I think that's plausible it's just so far off we can't even see that horizon yet

837
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:50,440
even if we could take it one step further and say that we could do at some point in our life a total down mode of our entire brain

838
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,440
right it's a substrate independent mind

839
01:21:52,440 --> 01:22:03,440
that's exactly and we would have all of our memories we would have you know everything that I'm not sure that once it's divorced from your own body and stuff that we would have

840
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:07,440
and yet that would be exactly what would be required for us to be in a simulation

841
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:14,440
yeah but wait I'm not sure now I'm missing I thought that maybe the question is to change so let me just understand the question

842
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:25,440
I understood the question to be would advances in neural imaging say take them all the way down to you can you know what every synapse is doing over some period of time

843
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:33,440
would that give us insight into why we're so scared to die now the question is if I could create a deep dive

844
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:40,440
if I could create a replica of myself somehow functional replica would I no longer be afraid of dying and which question are we talking about

845
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:47,440
they're both they're both implied by understanding the out of the structure of the frontal cortex so let me

846
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:55,440
let me answer both of them then I don't think knowing the neural structure down to the finest details you like is going to give you much insight at all

847
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:59,440
well that's why I added functional connect to structure

848
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:09,440
into into the origin of our anxieties I mean it's just a different level of analysis you need a level of analysis that should apply fairly independently of

849
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:21,440
hardware you know implement why is that though because if anxieties are emotionally driven and emotions arise out of the older portions of the brain like the reticular act doing formation the limbic system and the rest of it

850
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:29,440
and those interact with the mid and higher level functions of the more encephalized portions of the brain right why not be able to answer it in that capacity

851
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:39,440
well because the type of functional description of what's going on just isn't going to be tied that closely to neuro anatomy would be my guess

852
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:46,440
well again again I'm not saying all the out of me I'm talking about function as well but it's a time to go

853
01:23:46,440 --> 01:24:03,440
this gentleman then yes how would the discovery and habitation of another planet different from the discovery and habitation of a new world by the Europeans

854
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:18,440
so that's a good question it would be substantively different just because of course as the original denizens of all these parts of the world noted you know they were there first so there weren't that many truly

855
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:38,440
antarctic out part there humans the patterns of human migration 60 to 30,000 years ago are extraordinary so there were very few places that were untouched and then it's us and it's us in a home that we've evolved over tens of thousands of generations

856
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:58,440
and adapted to the full physical range if we visited and even colonized a habitable world that could tolerate us and we could tolerate it you know the branching of evolution would happen and be sculpted very quickly

857
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:15,440
and it would be a new thing fairly quickly I think so that's the sense in which it would be different also because of the time and space disconnect that that would be you know it would be a new start because you'd have a generational

858
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:35,440
light time light travel time or you know artifact travel time between civilization one and civilization two would be something different so it would feel very different and presumably civilization one prime would not feel beholden or bound by

859
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:52,440
whatever had happened before they would feel like a new start as well.

860
01:25:52,440 --> 01:26:06,440
So I'm not a historic I would not answer that question because I'm not really a historian I can't comment.

861
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:31,440
Let me just suggest that the mind particularly the unconscious mind is a developmental organ the mind the unconscious mind particularly is a developmental organ that being developmental that we have beginnings and we have and we develop

862
01:26:31,440 --> 01:27:00,440
the essence of our being may in fact be our development the sort of meaning of life so to speak may be to develop that try to follow these assumptions with me that mind this developmental mind may in fact have been

863
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:22,440
an aspect of matter that more recently evolved so that you could have primitive matter you could have big bang matter and then you could have something that happened that evolved to mind that mind is another matter wave if all matters are

864
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:43,440
if all it energies away and substances away time is away and so on that mind is another is another way for me that is a ball so the question I guess I have is would this be a subject of interest to cosmologists and how did this new matter wave evolve

865
01:27:43,440 --> 01:28:06,440
and was it in fact the evolution of mine as a new matter wave that evolved life did the evolution of mine precede the evolution of life that is can we imagine any form of life that doesn't require at least a little smitchen of mine to survive

866
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:21,440
in other words what do we have a court force problem but the question you all I think is is that would that be of interest to cosmologists is what steps were necessary to form mine

867
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:41,440
I mean I'd actually like to hear philosophy perspective on this but from this perspective of my field really we don't have a toolkit with which to answer that question all we can say is that in terms of the you know the ingredients and the raw materials for

868
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:58,440
biological experimentation you know that you've got time and space in abundance because you've as I think I alluded to you could have an earth clone with 8 billion year head start on this planet so you've got a lot of time to work with

869
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:16,440
and you've got 10 to the 22 round numbers habitable worlds so that's a lot of petri dishes and you know and we know what happened here we also know that of the hundreds of millions of species you know only one of them sits in rooms like this and has conversations like this

870
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:29,440
so and even if we had like that like an exact twin world that's had the same starting conditions right over the like you know 3.8 billion years of life and stuff it would have come out totally different

871
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:53,440
right yeah and that's a famous debate you know Stephen J Gold wrote that you know 100 earths lit by 100 suns come back in 4 billion years after life starts and what odds would you place on animals at all primates homo sapien like entities and of course the people in the field don't agree on that there's no way you can resolve that contingency question

872
01:29:53,440 --> 01:30:17,440
so I don't actually have an answer to your question I don't know if you are well I mean I think there are two questions bound up one of which is just really really hard one of which is technically hard but we see the way through it and neither of which is exactly the one you ask so let me separate them

873
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:34,440
if you start with matter you can ask yourself how do we get consciousness when you're because you're just saying mind right how do we get awareness that is I think the hardest question there is and that nobody has a clue pretty much how to even approach it

874
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:53,440
given that we nonetheless do seem to know that states of consciousness are in very particular and precise ways dependent upon states of matter right that is you can get a tumor in a certain place in your in your brain and lose very specific cognitive capacities

875
01:30:53,440 --> 01:31:12,440
right absolutely specific cognitive capacity so it's not as if there's a mind somewhere else that's unrelated to what's going on in your brain so I think the origin or the evolution of consciousness is just intractable because we have no idea really how to connect

876
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:28,440
the presence of consciousness with material structure in a comprehensible way there's another question which is the evolution of what we would think of as intelligent behavior that we find among animals and living things and so on

877
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:44,440
there I take it there's a pretty straightforward evolutionary story about why certain configurations when they become reactive to their environment are better computers I mean at least once we have some you know microbes competing

878
01:31:44,440 --> 01:32:13,440
there's a reasonable story to be told about the evolution of more and more sophisticated behavior and when you said can there be life without mind I take it amoebas don't have my I don't know why we would have to think amoebas have anything like mind and they do enough to start an evolutionary process off right they replicate they can vary they reproduce you get that you you've started the evolutionary story or certainly in some sense you might say viruses are kind of alive and they're not much room for a mind in a virus

879
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:42,440
so I don't think that we need mind before life but how you get consciousness out of any process I think is but it's a bit we're talking about origins and the origin of mind is a is a wonderful question and I you know like to think of it again in this sort of hypothetical cosmic realm where we have diagnosed through work of my colleague here and others the story of more a good chunks of the story of what led to us

880
01:32:42,440 --> 01:33:00,440
but we've also seen some interesting potentials and possibilities that might play out elsewhere differently so for instance if I were asking a hypothetical question about the evolution forward of life on earth I would say if we weren't here you know kingpins and sort of sculpting the planet to our will

881
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:18,440
I would be very interested to see what social insects would turn into in a few hundred million years or I would be very interested to see you know bacteria use quorum sensing and if you add up the bandwidth of their chemical communication it exceeds that of a conversation we're having now so it's not trivial

882
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:35,440
and they work in commensual ways in cooperative colonies and no one's pretending there's intelligence there or consciousness or mind I just like to see how that plays out in hundreds of different circumstances or with evolution given the vast you know folding

883
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:50,440
times available to it with time so I would not rule out the inception of something we call mind from quite different architectures biological architectures to the ones that led to us and quite different lineages and paths

884
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:58,440
we can't do that we can't do the experiment except conceptually we do it in the past though because social insects at a hundred fifty million has started on us

885
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:15,440
right I mean I when that when does have the sense again there's a always a kind of sense that evolution the evolutionary process must be aimed at something like us and so if we weren't around you know the the the the the the insects would evolve somehow

886
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:27,440
higher intelligence what we think of as higher intelligence but we know that's not right I mean that dinosaurs had plenty of time the insects as you say have had plenty of time the fact is what we know for sure because out of all the billions of species of

887
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:51,440
species there's ever been only one developed the kind of intelligence it's not evolutionarily very useful it can't be if it was like eyes right like sensors it would have evolved millions of times the interesting question isn't what would have my guess is if we weren't around and you have to let it go nothing would evolve with our kind of

888
01:34:51,440 --> 01:35:20,440
technological intelligence the question is why us now you know one I don't know I know there's an interesting book about the hand that said it's because we got hands right I mean the fact is if you're a hyper intelligent tree good for you it's not going to help you right you can't do anything with it even if you're a hyper intelligent dog they're better ways to use your resources you know he got hands there's lots you can do with your intelligence or maybe voice or maybe language I mean you know they're all these different things

889
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:25,440
you know they're all these different questions of what was the driver that suddenly made it

890
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:41,440
usefully enough for human beings to grow really big brains so that it actually became hard to give birth to them right because they're because they're craniac got so big and it's certainly not because there is a general purpose

891
01:35:41,440 --> 01:36:10,440
evolutionary advantage to that kind of intelligence because if that were the answer we'd see a lot more of it well I was a lot of questions already been asked I was on on that track I was interested in the creativity of the brain I was also thinking of Emily Dickinson speaking about the brain larger than the ocean and also of life beyond need I mean even in the animal kingdom thinking of crows or ravens they build structures to

892
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:39,440
appeal to the mate there is a creative force that exists in the universe it's beyond immediate needs of food shelter and that and that is even more expanded in the human being so one has to even go into the whole realm of creativity the desire to go beyond the known to hit against the boundaries so it's not only the boundaries of the universe it's the boundaries within the self that wants to go exceed itself and exceed its limits so I think that's a very important area of creativity

893
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:42,440
okay
