3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,520
So we're following up on our inquiry into beginnings by posing complementary questions about endings

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,320
Why are we curious about endings whether it's that of the cosmos our own?

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,800
Can we discover something about each other's curiosity about endings?

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:37,000
How might conceptualizations of the end of consciousness life civilization and the universe at large inform one another?

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,720
So I'd like to introduce our guests today

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,200
Starting here James Berger is senior lecturer in American Studies in English at Yale University

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
He received his BA from Columbia University

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,520
His MA from Teachers College Columbia University and his PhD from the University of Virginia

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,040
His interests include 20th and 21st century American literature

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:02,680
Literary theory disability studies neuroscience and literature and apocalyptic literature and film the latter including

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,320
Apocalypticism and the notion of the post-apocalyptic and exploring the limits of language the relations between language and non-language

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,320
The status of discursive objects imagined is somehow whether through global catastrophe

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,080
Personal impairment or religious or ethical imperative outside the bounds of discourse

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,640
Dr. Berger is the author of multiple scholarly articles and his books include after the end representations of post-apocalypse

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,160
Next to him is Paul J Steinhardt the Albert Einstein professor in science and director of the Princeton Center for theoretical science at Princeton University

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,200
Where he is also on the faculty of both the Department of physics and the Department of astrophysical sciences

19
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,240
He received his BA in physics from Caltech and his MA and PhD both in physics from Harvard University

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:52,160
The author of over 200 refereed articles five patents three technical books numerous popular articles and the co-author of the

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,240
2007 endless universe the Big Bang and Beyond a popular book on contemporary theories of cosmology

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,760
Professor Steinhardt's research spans problems in particle physics

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,240
Astrophysics cosmology and condensed matter physics with Neil Turock at Cambridge University

24
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:14,040
He proposed the cyclic model a radical alternative to Big Bang inflationary cosmology in which the evolution of the universe is periodic

25
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,440
And the key events shaping the large-scale structure of the universe occur before the Big Bang

26
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,480
Next is William Cole Brenner associate professor of English at Bart Elon University

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,840
He received his BA from Columbia College his MA from University College Oxford and his PhD from Columbia University

28
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:38,320
He is written in major scholarly journals in literature history theology psychoanalysis and cultural criticism on Jewish topics in commentary as or

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:45,360
JQR and AJS review tradition and many other Jewish publications and the Washington Post column letter from Israel

30
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,920
Professor Cole Brenner is also the author of the 2008 book Milton's Worrying Angels a study of critical engagements and

31
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,960
the 2011 open-minded Torah of irony fundamentalism and love

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,720
Michael Rapino is professor biology with the Earth and Environmental Sciences program at New York University

33
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:11,400
And his research consultant at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He received his BA from Hunter College of the City University of New York and his PhD in

34
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:20,000
Geological Sciences from Columbia University a highly regarded teacher at NYU professor and Pinos research led to his proposal of the Shiva hypothesis a

35
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,680
general theory integrating Astrophysics planetary geology and the environment and the history of life to account for Earth's periodic

36
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,200
Extinctions his research also investigates the role of volcanic eruptions and extinctions

37
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,560
Bioguochemical cycles and global climate over a range of timescales

38
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,800
So our round table will go for about an hour and a half followed by time for questions and discussion from the audience

39
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
So let's begin the end

40
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,880
Why are we curious about endings?

41
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,160
Well, drop you want to say something about the lack of microphone for bill. Oh, yes that

42
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,440
Dr. Cole Brenner in observing the Sabbath

43
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,920
You know cannot wear an amplifying microphone today, so he will speak

44
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
That was good

45
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
Okay

46
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,160
Well, I'll start I guess my background is in is in the geological sciences and

47
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,880
There has been a paradox shift in the geological sciences over the past couple of decades and then that's away from the old idea of

48
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
a change

49
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,040
Gradually all the time very slowly over very long periods of geological time to a new vision

50
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,240
which is much more apocalyptic which suggests that there are

51
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:47,320
individual catastrophes which are happening periodically to the earth and those catastrophes are causing mass extinctions of life and

52
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,320
As far as the history of life is concerned you talk about endings

53
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:00,160
More than 99% of the species that have ever existed on the earth are extinct. So in terms of species

54
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,040
Extinction is the name of the game. They last for a few million years

55
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,080
Then either they evolve to something else or else they become extinct with no issue

56
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:19,720
I mean, I'll fall up. I mean, I'm interested that this is about endings and a couple of weeks ago was beginning

57
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,040
As a literary critic I think of Elliot's term or phrase the end is where we start from

58
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,600
In the beginnings and ends or is related one to another

59
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm just very interested on being in a panel first of all then a literary critic

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,540
But I'm interested in the way you think about catastrophe and

61
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,720
Paradimorship to think about ways in which

62
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,880
The languages of the sciences also use plotting as a device

63
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,200
I saw an advertisement on television for a new movie called something extinction

64
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Extinction is thematized

65
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,640
A narrative sense

66
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,480
And I'm wondering for both of you kind of it from a scientific point of view how much

67
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,120
narrative or storytelling or plotting

68
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:12,320
Is something that gets it's obviously not foregrounded to the same extent that it would be from the agenda, but I'm wondering how much that is a live issue

69
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,960
That's my curiosity

70
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Well the old idea of the

71
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,240
gradualistic change in the earth sciences comes out of

72
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,040
Lyle-Jaws-Lyle his book principles of geology back in 1831 and Lyle saw

73
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
geological happenings as being

74
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
gradual and

75
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,720
being

76
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,360
connected and so there was a story there the gradual history of the earth and

77
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,760
And he didn't believe in evolution at the time

78
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,760
So life was somehow put into this picture and it was for many years

79
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,840
Geology when you were a student technology 101 you would talk this the same the present is the key to the past

80
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:04,160
In other words things that are happening at the present time geological processes if you extrapolate those over a long time periods

81
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,120
Even very gradual slow change like erosion by rivers add up into a big

82
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,620
result like the the grand canyon and that was part of Lyle's view of the

83
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
naturalness the gradual

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,880
The gradualism nature, but this was the way God set things up and

85
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,720
There was an order to this the order that was in God's mind when he created the universe

86
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,760
I was gonna say something akin to what you mark

87
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,240
Which is that the one of the reasons why we're interested in the end of

88
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,440
The universe or

89
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,040
So the cosmologist we're talking about the universe

90
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,440
Is because it gives us a lot of information about how it began and the stages of evolution in between

91
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
They're all tied together

92
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,400
And so the debates that we're having about what's going to happen next in the universe

93
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,040
are all tightly related to

94
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,680
What set up the conditions that led to the conditions we observe today and

95
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,240
Those are in turn tied very closely to how

96
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,000
The evolution of the universe is tied to the fundamental laws of physics and what those laws tell us about conditions

97
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,320
At the very beginning or at the big bang or maybe even before the big bang

98
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:34,400
Yeah, I suppose right about one difference you can point to between the way that the English teachers and scientists

99
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,880
I think we

100
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,440
in our thinking about narrative place the human subject kind of the center of it and

101
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,520
We know that for one thing we ourselves are finite

102
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:52,120
So the question of ending has to do with the question of finitude in general

103
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,120
and

104
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Narrative

105
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,720
Contributes to that there's a great line in Don de Lilla. Don de Lill is novel all plots lead toward death

106
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,400
So there's that perspective as you're thinking plots. There's going to be an ending to the plot at the same time

107
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,560
You have the example of shehara zal which plot

108
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,280
extends like as long as you can tell the story

109
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,920
You can extend you can put off fine to

110
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,080
There's a couple of movies I always I don't I just want me to think abstractly about this

111
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,800
You know that I think in terms of movies there's a 1991 vin vendors movie called until the end of the world

112
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,320
In which after a lot of kind of weird misadventures they end up in Australia at the end of the world and adjust at that moment

113
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
and

114
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,720
A nuclear satellite falls down creates this electromagnetic disruption all around the world or at least in Australia

115
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,400
And so every and they think they're so isolated. They think the world has in fact ended

116
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:01,960
At which point the plot of the movie completely shifts and there's this amazing invention which someone has developed in order to

117
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,880
Get capture the neurochemical event of vision for one of the characters blind mothers

118
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,520
His mother is blind so she is able to see images again

119
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,080
But they also has this other purpose which is to they discover they can see their own dreams

120
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,480
They can basically videotape their own dreams and so they get this

121
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,320
Insight into this experience of what you might call in psychoanalytic terms primary process complete

122
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,160
Unmediation complete absence the eradication of mediations this extraordinarily

123
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:41,360
Sophisticated medium for eliminating mediation and what happens is they become addicted to their dreams

124
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,840
That's all that's all they want to do and so that becomes in the sense the apocalypse that's the revelation is this revelation of

125
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
complete interiority and

126
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,520
complete

127
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,000
Removal from any symbolic world any social symbolic world and I think it's some degree

128
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,240
That's also what apocalyptic thinking is a yearning for I mean here. We are these symbolic

129
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,680
We're so we're so you know involvement our symbolic communications our relationships to ourselves. He'd be mediated

130
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,760
What is there that's direct? What is there that's unmediated? How do you get to sort of the thing itself?

131
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,480
And some level what apocalyptic thinking allows you to do is to find some place in

132
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,800
In fiction in imagination where that takes place. I think a lot of apocalyptic narratives have to do with the

133
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,280
bashing of this symbolic edifice so that you have people who somehow are

134
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,000
absolutely

135
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There without a symbolic overlays

136
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,360
But that's yeah, I don't know that's that's infection

137
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
For them

138
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Your suggestion

139
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
The kind of pre-modern

140
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,640
Manifestations of apocalyptic thinking which is just the way everyone thought that is thinking that that history has to tell us

141
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,920
There's an echetym towards which history is ended and the way in which that sense of an ending

142
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
infuses the president

143
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,400
Meaning

144
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,960
There's not any beginning in an end that sense of an ending takes

145
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,520
Chronometric time literary pre-chromo may use this distinction

146
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Kind of waiting

147
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:52,040
Tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow that lack of mediation things happen

148
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
But an end

149
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,560
And promoting this degree term chiris. I guess it means the fullness of time

150
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,480
That end towards which one is tending not only forms the end of history

151
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:16,840
But also infuses the president you spoke before about the president being the key to the past and I think in some sense

152
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:24,680
Models of time, I mean maybe Adam folks might put it like this. Tell me what you think about why I'll tell you what you believe

153
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Because conceptions of time

154
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,960
Is there an end towards which we're tending or is there not really

155
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,920
And I'm wondering in a kind of scientific or post modern or post-apocalyptic world

156
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,480
How

157
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,560
Does the echetym does this or in your inner is to tell you terms is the notion of life as a pop

158
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,280
He's a either cosmological time as a plot beginning the end and

159
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
the way that might

160
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,280
interact

161
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:10,120
With the subject thinking of his own life or all life as a plot with beginning middle and end is that still something?

162
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,040
That's viable

163
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Or an opposed to apocalyptic age

164
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,520
Born an age given over to scientific stories and narratives for those really

165
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,040
That sense yeah, I think that's a

166
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Science of just to add one one thing to that

167
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,160
In the sense of endings that you're talking about in the commode

168
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,280
People talking about the end the way one conceives the end is what gives meaning to the present

169
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:45,360
But I'm but I think in the scientific way of thinking in the cosmological way of thinking I can't imagine how that would be

170
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,040
actually

171
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,840
Take place whether sort of the meaning of social and personal life

172
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,960
would have anything to do with the way one conceives of

173
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,400
The act be the ending the universe as hypothesized scientifically

174
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
Yeah, I think I think we're talking about

175
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:11,480
humanity and of humanity for example if there's one kind of apocalypse we think about the earth another kind of apocalypse and

176
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Then the universe

177
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,440
Which is which is a different?

178
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,880
Different kind of end we could talk about for the universe

179
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,760
I think one thing that's happened in cosmology in the in just the last few decades has been a tremendous

180
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,400
Opening up of the possibilities of even what we mean by universe

181
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,680
Which colors the question of what do you mean by the end the end of what what are you interested in?

182
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,000
So of course we're interested in humans and the earth but in terms of the universe

183
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,480
Are we interested in the part of the universe we observe?

184
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:50,400
Because up until recently we had the notion that we observe all that there is but the current view is that what we observe is a

185
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:57,200
Tiny infinite testimal patch of what is out there and that what we observe may or may not be typical of what is out there

186
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,000
Now we may be interested in this patch because it is all we see and can ever hope to see

187
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,600
I mean the laws of physics prohibit us from seeing regions that are beyond a certain that are stretching far enough fast enough from us

188
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,240
and for that for that region we can talk about and

189
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,240
We can imagine two kinds of ends at least two kinds of ends one in which it

190
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Crunches into something like a black hole in which time and space lose their meaning

191
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,560
and another one which is where

192
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,040
Time and sense some sense lasts forever, but not in a meaningful sense

193
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:39,160
The universe expands into more and more vacuum and there's more and more vacuables and empty and continues that way forever

194
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,240
This this patch of space we observe

195
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,000
In either of those circumstances there may be interesting events creation events in fact occurring in other parts of the universe

196
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,560
where new regions are being created new patches are being created and for all and and

197
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:02,040
Many plausible circumstances this would this process would continue eternally forever and there would be no end to the entire process

198
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,160
Although there may be ends to the regions which are of greatest interest to us

199
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,760
so I've just given you a few examples of some of the

200
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,080
wider variety of possibilities that have been opened up and motivated by recent ideas and in cosmology

201
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
It's to give you a taste

202
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,920
I know a few years ago. It was a lot simpler story

203
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,160
the universe began in the Big Bang and

204
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,320
Through cause and effect the scientists could trace the history of the universe from the time of the Big Bang to the present

205
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,080
And the idea then was that either the universe was going to expand forever

206
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,560
Or if the galaxies were massive enough the gravity would pull it all back in again

207
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,960
But things have changed since then things have become much right complex

208
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,560
So first of all in terms of the future going to the future we've discovered there's an entity in the universe

209
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:58,320
Which we knew in principle could be there, but we didn't realize was actually there which is what we called dark energy

210
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,480
So most forms of matter that were there all the forms of matter that we're familiar with

211
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,760
Gravitationally attract each other in fact most of us learned in school that gravity always attracts

212
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,440
It's not actually true gravity attracts for certain forms of matter and energy, but not for others

213
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,240
There's a form there are forms of matter and energy which would actually cause us repulsion

214
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,520
We've known about it since 1917, but you probably didn't hear about in school because no one believed it it actually

215
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,680
Was an important component of the real universe?

216
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,020
Well, we've known from we now know from recent measurements in the last decade that

217
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,880
73% of the universe is this stuff and

218
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:40,920
once it takes so it's already taken over the universe in terms of being the dominant form energy in the universe and

219
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:47,720
It's causing therefore the expansion of the universe to accelerate at the present time speed up rather than slow down

220
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,320
so it's actually promoting the expansion rather than resisting it and

221
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,120
if this continues then what will happen over time is

222
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:02,720
More and more of the matter that we see in the universe today the galaxies and stars will begin to disappear from view because of this expansion

223
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,000
every region of the universe will begin to approach empty space and

224
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,320
This will be a kind of M and which is like you know TSL it's whimper in which you simply

225
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:20,080
You know slowly decay into an emptier and more deadly universe for this patch of the universe

226
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,760
And that's a possible that's a possible end to the universe

227
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:32,280
The point of view is that this dark energy is unstable and will eventually decay and then it will lead to a new crunch bang and

228
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,280
And and the process will begin again even in this patch of the universe

229
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,560
So you have all these things periodic and it could even repeat periodic

230
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,120
So this is the idea behind a possible return of the idea of a kind of cyclical universe

231
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:51,080
So I'm saying there are other patches that we're just living in a patch. Well, what's what is almost certain?

232
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:58,480
Is that what we observe as a tiny patch of a much larger space that we're not that when we look at the farthest distances?

233
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
we can see

234
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,480
those are not the edge of space that there's simply the edge of what we can see because

235
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,520
The oldest light we can observe is 13.7 billion years old

236
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,080
It's only had a chance to travel 13.7 billion light years

237
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,040
That's as far as we can see but that doesn't say that there isn't plenty of space out

238
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
It's not a boundary at all. It's our person

239
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:31,000
It's our it's in fact we call it our horizon because it's essentially a limit to our vision of what we can see so how do you know that is something beyond them?

240
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,640
Well, we can already see hints of it when we look at radiation from the

241
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,800
comes from the oldest radiation we observe in the universe gives us a

242
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,360
Is radiation that comes from a time when the universe cool to the point that the first atoms were forming in the universe?

243
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:56,240
So let's go back a bit if you extrapolate back in the time the universe was more and more contracted and more and more

244
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:03,160
Heated up as you contracts a gas and heats up you go back far enough in time was hot enough to boil atoms into their

245
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
fundamental constituents

246
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:14,400
So now around that time which was when around 13.4 billion years ago 13.7 billion years ago

247
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,560
The atoms first atoms formed the universe became transparent

248
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:27,040
Radiation began to stream freely through the universe and we collected today to get a picture of what the distribution of matter and radiation

249
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
what looks like at that time and

250
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,520
What it shows us is an extremely uniform distribution of matter and radiation that even gives us some vision of

251
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,840
how

252
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
smooth

253
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,080
If you hadn't even is able to show us that there isn't an edge that this isn't the edge that there has to be something

254
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,400
Beyond the light to give us a kind of smooth

255
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,200
Boundary to what we're seeing so that already extends us a short distance

256
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,680
And most of our theories to explain that degree of homogeneity tell us that actually what we observe is

257
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
a much tinier

258
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,120
tiny patch of a much smoother region of space it must be much larger than what we observe and

259
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,760
And in many versions of these many of these theories that this is one of many

260
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,840
Infinitely many patches that would have formed over time and would continue to form over time. So very

261
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,040
Pushing us way beyond what we can actually observe

262
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,520
It's a doctor how much time do we have?

263
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,000
This is when we need albie singers pediatricians reassurance that Brooklyn's not expanding right

264
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,840
Yeah, I think Brooklyn's okay

265
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
How much to tongue we have

266
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,880
Well the universe is a habitable place me say that is could be quite long, you know, I mean

267
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,760
I mean as long as our Sun exists, you know, so another five billion years or so

268
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,760
And our galaxy in this scenario would be habitable

269
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Until such point that there might have been a crunch or something like that if that were to occur then

270
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,800
so

271
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
estimates would range from anywhere from

272
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
tens of billions of years to

273
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:28,480
In definite I mean I just I can't help but latch onto the wedding I don't mind

274
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,480
I just wonder what what are the effects of these kinds of cosmological

275
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,200
perspective speculations horizons

276
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,360
What is that what is the effect of that on subjects?

277
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,240
I mean we have different we have models of time

278
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,120
beginnings and middles and Jim and I were talking before

279
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
the

280
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,920
Modernist the persistence of the modernist emphasis on enemies

281
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,720
We didn't pursue it because there is a certain kind of post modern

282
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,280
That we're posting

283
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:16,360
And signed in seems the cosmological visions of the universe reinforce those models

284
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,040
But is there a persistence of a sense of an ending?

285
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,720
That that renders the present meaning

286
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,080
I mean the post modern abandoned that kind of ending

287
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,800
leaves a kind of tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and

288
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
I'm just wondering is there

289
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,160
In the world that we live have we given up those endings

290
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,760
psychically of subjects we structure our lives as class

291
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,280
The psycholamilists ask their their their

292
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,440
They're patients to think of their their lives and narrative terms

293
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,960
I think in some place here I'm speaking out of my discipline

294
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,800
The Freud speaks of a past present future in terms of it ego and super evil and the sense in which

295
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,360
Not a non-repressive version of the super evil that the vision of this of the future

296
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,280
The idealized vision of the future will help me reconstitute

297
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,040
My desire is my drives allowed them to speak in a certain my past

298
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,520
so I can believe any more meaningful present

299
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
And again, I'm wondering about

300
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,440
the seeming

301
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,240
Facticity of a universe that is one among many

302
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,080
billion year scheme and

303
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Our own

304
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
thrusts or drive

305
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
For me

306
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,080
I think meaning comes that's why I started to begin about plots and stories

307
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,080
meaning comes through stories and plots

308
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,280
The story that you gave us is first of multifaceted

309
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
the 17th century

310
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,080
which notes

311
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:16,120
The speculation that many many were the first kind of science fiction and it was very unsettling for those who lived in a kind of

312
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,920
universe where there was the divine plot the divine sentence would be getting

313
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Wonder post science

314
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,240
This kind of cosmology

315
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
Where does the subject?

316
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
How does this subject mean?

317
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,160
How does the subject plot?

318
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,160
We exist on one planet

319
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,600
out of probably many many habitable planets in the in the in the galaxy and

320
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
We're the product of

321
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,000
four billion years of evolution and

322
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:57,640
So if you look at it from the cosmic context at least here on this habitable planet evolution the origin of life started here

323
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,240
Evolution produced more and more complex kinds of life and we are the most

324
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,280
Intelligent at least for the time being form of life on the planet and so we have that narrative

325
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,200
It was the course that I teach at NYU you have the narrative of

326
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,840
Looking back from this special place which is human consciousness and looking back at the history of the universe

327
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,240
It all seems like it's leading someplace, but then that's just a way of looking at it

328
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,880
Really doesn't mean anything because evolution is very very contingent

329
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,160
Because mileage I'd even make that point more strongly the discovery of dark energy

330
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:39,240
I think shatters this kind of vision that many people had of just what you described the universe itself as

331
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,960
Evolving from simple to more and more complex

332
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:49,480
If there were not this dark energy if we only had ordinary modern radiation the idea that we had be up until a decade or so

333
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,280
Then what we then the prediction would have been that

334
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:58,840
The universe does become more and more complex more and more structure forms more and more galaxies form more and more planets form

335
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:06,360
But that story is now shattered something recently recently on cosmic scale has happened dark energy has taken over the universe

336
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:14,120
Now the expansion of the universe is accelerating that prevents the formation of any further structure in the universe the largest structures

337
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
we see in the universe today or the

338
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,720
Late will be the last to form and now what the universe will be doing is reverting to well

339
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,040
We'll be turning into an emptier and emptier universe

340
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,840
And this has happened so this is this is shattering from several points of view

341
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,280
It means there's something special at this particular juncture in time in cosmology

342
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,680
We live at a juncture in time in cosmology on the one hand

343
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,200
There's enough matter in the universe that we can see galaxies and stars and planets out there

344
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,240
So we can see that where the past came from we can also see that there's dark energy in the universe

345
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,040
So we can see where we're headed if you if we had lived

346
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,920
Let's say six billion years ago

347
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,960
We could see the matter where we couldn't see the dark energy if we in the future will be able to see the dark energy

348
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,760
It'll be hard to see the matter so we live at a very special point in time

349
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:11,240
This shatters the notion of evolution is some sort of steady process in which every moment is in some sense as good as any other moment

350
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,040
There's really something special about this juncture in cosmology and we don't understand why it's just a fact of nature

351
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,400
We have to live with what nature hands us whether we like the answer or not

352
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:27,200
It's a special because we're here is the anthropic principle kind of working here. We're in we're there because we're there

353
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,680
If we were early we wouldn't be here if we were late we wouldn't be here

354
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,320
So we so so we could have so there could well be species that evolved earlier

355
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,400
We've evolved you know really relatively could have evolution could have occurred faster suppose it

356
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
four billion years ago

357
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,600
Ascension beings evolved in the universe. They would have a lot of trouble seeing that the fact that there was this dark energy

358
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,080
because

359
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:59,240
The ratio of dark energy to matter changes over time so back then that dark energy would have been a relatively small percentage

360
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,120
Now it's kind of intermediate

361
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,640
We see there's a significant fraction of matter and a significant significant fraction of dark energy in the future

362
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,200
It becomes more and more dark energy, but you know it could have been could be that life evolves in our galaxy

363
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Let's say a hundred billion years from now

364
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,480
They will have a lot of trouble seeing it. There was a lot of matter once in the universe

365
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,680
They'll think they just they just lived in one little island galaxy

366
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,160
They won't see the billions of galaxies

367
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,080
We see and they'll see almost everything being dark energy and they'll have a lot of trouble reconstructing

368
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,520
How they got to where they were right?

369
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,720
It'll be very confusing cosmologists would be in trouble cosmologists

370
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,540
Get involved at that time for the first time at that time will be a lot of trouble

371
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,140
They will have a lot of trouble reconstructing their history just like cosmologists that you know

372
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,120
We're born at four billion years ago

373
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,120
We have a lot of trouble figuring out that the future was going to be one dominated by dark energy

374
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,880
So this is shattering to our traditional ideas and I don't think I mean to me it's something that's a

375
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:02,560
It's a profound important scientifically what it means, but in terms of what it means in terms of our human reaction to it

376
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,680
I don't think we've even begun to absorb it yet

377
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:10,080
I don't think the message has gotten out that our view of the world of the universe has changed in such a profound way and

378
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,520
Okay, what are we to make of it? Yeah, I can't think of

379
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,520
Human cultural imaginative examples that that in any way

380
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,680
Take take in these these scientific findings

381
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,000
The closest I can come as Blake

382
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,400
See say William Blake that you know sensing that that what we see as the surface of reality is somehow just

383
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,640
not really the case and you have to burst these doors of perception and

384
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,800
And our whole very terminologies are skewed. We need a new set of names to

385
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,720
Talk about what human existence physical and spiritual are the other person

386
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,940
I think that's some maybe sensitive of trying to negotiate speak a little louder

387
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,640
The other person is a block in their name the South African woman writer

388
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
No, no the other one

389
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,760
Doris last thing yeah, exactly as you know

390
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,180
This whole series of kind of science fiction could nostic science fiction

391
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:21,340
texts in in which all kinds of interesting things happen with time Philip Dick

392
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,540
I guess would be another example of someone who's making that attempt, but generally are you know

393
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:30,620
most of us are thinking in terms of of human the time frames of human history and

394
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,220
the various historical political

395
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,780
social economic

396
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,220
problems

397
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:44,060
Which which faces at the moment so in the sense each I think each generation and each writer within each generation

398
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,060
generation

399
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,340
And not just writers but just just people

400
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,820
Sort of choose the ending that fits their immediate concern

401
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:57,220
So that's a in the late 19th century when H G Wells was writing, you know, you can see in the book like the

402
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:04,300
the time machine, you know, you know, exactly what the kind of prevalent social anxieties there are which are

403
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,300
anxieties that evolution in which way evolution is going and

404
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
anxieties that's class

405
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:17,500
So you have sort of Darwin and and Marx there at the center of those things of those apocalyptic anxieties

406
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,940
So that the anxiety the vision of the end of the world are

407
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:26,340
extrapolations of ideas of Marx and ideas of Darwin plus of course then

408
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,220
You know, there's the bifurcation of the social club. There's a specie accorded to social class

409
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,020
But at the end of that book if you remember

410
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:41,780
Then actually he even brings in the cosmological view you have the sense that everything is gone except these completely non-human

411
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,660
Creatures and the Sun is

412
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:50,460
Is this giant thing that's expanding and about to you know encompass the earth or something?

413
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,900
and in a relatively

414
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:01,060
Trivia or at least weird contemporary example. I've been actually been watching this TV show the doomsday preppers

415
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:08,140
What is the doomsday preppers about it's basically a home improvement show? How do you build perfect bunker?

416
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,140
You know, you know Ted and Edie

417
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:18,420
You know believe that the world's magnetic poles are going to shift in the next five years and therefore they need an underground bunker

418
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:23,220
They need to stop, you know, how are they best going to do it and they consult experts and they you know build whatever they have

419
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,140
They build

420
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:30,140
But what are they really worried about me? We're worried about the social chaos that will instill a lot of them

421
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:34,620
I mean, that's a lot of people they're worried about the social chaos that will ensue from some

422
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:40,780
Catastrophic breakdown of of whatever it may be and these people are always not in cities

423
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,420
There is never doomsday prepper in New York City because if you are one you're not gonna be here

424
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,540
You're gonna move somewhere else but don't you think some of this and you

425
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,580
Bringing in psychoanalysis

426
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:57,860
Some of this has just to do with reactions to mortality and various ways of trying to deny

427
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:06,020
Mortality the preppers maybe the preppers are basically worried about black people pouring out of cities and invading the suburbs

428
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,940
I mean the racial subtext of this show is unbelievable

429
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,700
So

430
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:21,020
You can direct about anxiety in different ways you can express it to different things

431
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:27,340
But if they end with you ending then it has to have something to do with mortality

432
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,300
You mentioned

433
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,820
Psychoanalysis and meaning their different ways psychoanalysis looks at meaning one way you look at meaning is

434
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,540
When you have a person in analysis you try to understand

435
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:47,340
What is the meaning of their behavior? What is the meaning of their interaction with others? What is their meaning and their?

436
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,180
The meaning of their fantasies about themselves and others

437
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:56,860
But then when you're talking about meaning of life that's something that develops over time

438
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,860
I don't think an 18 year old who really cares much about the meaning of life

439
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,700
He cares about getting a nice car and a nice girlfriend and so on

440
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:11,580
The older you get the more the issue of meaning of life and achievements and what you've done and what your

441
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,700
Kids are doing becomes more central

442
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:21,580
So and that again has to do with mortality is the idea that things are not going to last forever

443
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,740
So you may as well feel like you had some kind of

444
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,420
Good or impact or something that you did in this world

445
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,100
and

446
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:38,700
This came up last time and it's come keeps coming up to my mind and I've asked the number of

447
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,660
cosmologists and physicists

448
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:49,580
And I don't really get an answer and the question I have which I think Rob put under the rubric or

449
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:56,700
Mark no rest put under the rubric of curiosity is why are we interested in the stuff you're talking about?

450
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,660
I mean that you know you're talking about billions of years

451
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,620
I maybe have 10 more years of life. Why do I care what's gonna happen?

452
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,340
What happened billions of years before I was even around?

453
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,180
And why do I care about what's gonna happen?

454
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,860
15 years 20 years 30 years from now maybe for my kids, but after that there is no

455
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,020
But yet we have these tremendous I personally have

456
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,900
curiosity and interest in

457
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,580
The kind of work that you do

458
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,940
And there has to be something in humans that makes us want to keep understanding this

459
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:43,980
Even to a degree that which seems almost not understandable that this black energy expands or doesn't expand or whatever else it does

460
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,900
Well because well first of all hopefully it does become understandable we

461
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:55,580
First discover things they at first they're confusing but you've come they begin to become familiar as you deal with them more and more

462
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:03,740
Um, why are we interested? Well, I think we're all curious to know where we came from where we're going and why things are the way they are

463
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,500
and

464
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
So the question of the future

465
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,540
Is not just a question about the future. It's a question about what forms of energy can exist in the universe

466
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,180
how what kinds of effects

467
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,420
What are the interactions between matter energy and gravity because

468
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:28,140
Not only does that affect the future, but it affects every stage of the universe including the president and what's even happening in this room

469
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,740
So if I want to know for example, you know

470
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:39,260
Why the atoms in our bodies are stable? I ultimately have to understand something about the most microscopic

471
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,820
components

472
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,260
of matter

473
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,820
Which are the key components of matter that existed at the very beginning of the universe

474
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:56,060
If there was a beginning at the very beginning of the universe when the universe was quite young they were universe was boiled into those constituents and how they interacted

475
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:03,180
Is what eventually determined how you ended up with atoms and molecules planets and earths and humans?

476
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,700
and that's also related to what's going to happen in the future and

477
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,340
You want to study every stage of this

478
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:17,020
I mean the goal is to is to figure out this puzzle of why things are the way they are and you use every hint available to you

479
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,460
Which includes thinking about the past future present

480
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,060
recent past and

481
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,060
Another way to look at it which is that

482
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,460
If there was no end

483
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,220
There wouldn't be really an interest in end

484
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,980
So it must be that to some degree our own mortality is what

485
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,820
Encouraging us or what's pushing us

486
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:51,340
So when you say well everybody's interested in where it began where it is and where it's going

487
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,340
Yes, that is true, but why is it so?

488
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,700
Why be interested so?

489
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:05,660
Psychoanalysts have theories about why it's that we become interested in our beginnings and in our endings, but

490
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,580
The fact that we all are aware

491
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,780
That there is a final danger

492
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,900
Which is mortality and that we are

493
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,940
Biologically designed to always avoid danger

494
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,140
We are constantly avoiding anxiety

495
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:30,300
We are constantly avoiding danger and we have the signal of anxiety which tells us there's danger. Don't go there. Don't go there. Don't go there

496
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,780
so that anxiety

497
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,940
Must have something to do with the kind of

498
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,540
Things we need to find out because we feel as if

499
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,260
You know fantasies that the more we know the safer we are

500
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,180
Don't remember yeah

501
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,380
Which

502
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:09,260
Conceptions of my ideal self will allow me to give meaning to my past and therefore my presence

503
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:16,220
And I think the question that you're implicitly asking or raising is really the theological question

504
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:23,660
And we know that Freud's sense of religion was one of a kind of false consolation

505
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,140
and

506
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,820
Adam Phillips writes about the kind of magical narratives

507
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,340
of the universe, charming oneself with visions of the future

508
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,380
and through those charming narratives

509
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,220
those fantasies of benevolent future a future that gives meaning

510
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,260
of rendering the present meaningful

511
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,380
Phillips says it's really avoiding our helplessness our fundamental

512
00:41:52,380 --> 00:42:02,380
So humanity is defined by their helplessness and we use these narratives of the future of a comforting future significant end to avoid that

513
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,100
And I'm wondering

514
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,900
We haven't spoken about apocalypse and we've spoken about endings

515
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,980
There's also messiness which functions in the same kind of way

516
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,940
And I'm wondering to the extent I find Phillips so interesting because he's skeptical about everything

517
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,260
And he'll write one book where he undermines one set of terms

518
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:30,220
And the next book he will write will undermine the terms that he used to undermine the previous terms

519
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,460
The one thing that he shows no skepticism about is this a critique of just this kind of theological thinking

520
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,860
Meaning theology

521
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,140
Coming from this Freudian matrix, and I'm gonna know not everybody embraces this

522
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,380
And the low wall the clearer exceptions to serve extent

523
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:52,380
But theology becomes the one thing about which one and the endings that it passes

524
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,500
Becomes the one thing about which there is endless and only skepticism

525
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,180
And even your comments add I think indicate that you know we get old and we have worried

526
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,980
And we sense danger

527
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,580
And we get sentimental and we create narratives about the future

528
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,180
I'm wondering if that's an exhaustive account

529
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,180
I mean obviously

530
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:24,220
This kind of transcends the disciplinary conversation where does theology fit in or does it does it not

531
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:34,620
Is there a generous view of theology from a psychoanalytic point of view from a scientific point of view

532
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,980
Is it something we just tolerate or presume might exist in one of those patches someplace else

533
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,140
Is it an embarrassing question to

534
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:53,420
I think it's implied in any idea of meaning

535
00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:00,220
I mean feel if implying an actual god

536
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,500
As being part of the picture. I mean it's it's a world

537
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,820
You know their worldviews

538
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:11,420
For some reason your your voice is not going to be adjusted

539
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,020
I don't know okay. All right, I don't I want to sort of talk

540
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,740
Yeah, it's hard to talk about I mean there's plenty of people who who haven't an

541
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:40,140
apocalyptic messianic view of the world the left behind series has sold an enormous number of books the christian apocalyptic

542
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,340
perspective

543
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,180
But

544
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:58,300
Yeah, but I assume when you're talking about theology you're not you know that doesn't exhaust the question

545
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:03,580
I mean, I don't know next year in Jerusalem. I don't think I'm going to be there

546
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,780
Who knows?

547
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,300
Sure, I'm not I also I don't think we should be rebuilding the temple or anything along those lines

548
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,540
So yeah, I'm yeah, it is it's not an embarrassing question

549
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:24,380
But it's certainly a difficult question because I think some sort of ultimate sense of where we are and where we're going is

550
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,300
Is implied in all the literary cases that I'm looking at

551
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:34,620
It may or may not be involved in the minds of scientists who are thinking and he said I mean proof myself

552
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:41,420
Just in my lazy way. I think that if the universe is going to drift off forever as you described in one scenario

553
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,580
bad

554
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:50,460
If the universe is going to recoil back on itself and begin again that to me would be a hopeful possibility and so that I suppose is

555
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,740
Well, I'm just gonna science point of view the galaxy is full of planets

556
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,380
and some of those must be Earth like planets just by the

557
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,220
statistics and on some of those earth like planets there could be

558
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,580
Evolution of life would go on and it would produce intelligent beings

559
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,060
and so to do a lot of

560
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,820
Astronomers and planetary scientists the galaxy is probably full of

561
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:22,700
Symbolizations intelligence civilizations possibly trying to contact each other over the vast distances of space

562
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,100
So we're just one world in a many many world situation

563
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:32,700
Chris the case that the distances are so vast that communication is

564
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,620
Pretty hopeless possibility. No, Chris MP said last week two weeks ago

565
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:43,260
Your colleague Chris MP said two weeks ago and I don't know if you agree with it or not

566
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:48,460
He said within the next hundred years. We will have people going to some other habitable

567
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,380
planet

568
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:55,900
And when they go there they will continue to live there they will change because they'll be on another planet

569
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:01,980
But he saw that within completely within realm of possibility humans would go elsewhere humans will go out there

570
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,660
But I think he means planets within our solar system like Mars

571
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:13,820
I don't think you meant that's a little bit different than contacting the planets that Mike's talking about which would be

572
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:20,380
Probably a habitable planet where there already exists intelligent life would be probably much farther out

573
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:25,740
We could receive if we were sending right but having a conversation. I think that's what he was. He wasn't done but Mars

574
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,100
We can't travel very far into the

575
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,700
Space because this distances are so vast and our rockets only go so fast

576
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,460
Well, he was saying in the next hundred years. That's a pretty

577
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,940
I think it underestimates the dangers of space. I mean we I mean just thinking about going to Mars

578
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,020
One of the already there was a

579
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:05,660
Dangers of going that distance, but what you're talking about which is sort of the Star Wars stars track kind of vision

580
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:12,220
To develop a tremendous technology. I don't think it's a hundred years. I

581
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,220
But I wanted to ask a question because I don't know the answer to this is so so in

582
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:24,540
A lot of discussion we're having about theology and cosmology acts like one

583
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,540
It

584
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:32,220
Presumes that the interest in theology is cosmological and my impression is that's a more modern

585
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:41,660
Addition to theology theology was really designed about everyday life and decisions we make about our relationship between ourselves and

586
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,820
God and and how we should behave and was

587
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:54,140
Never you know, it was never intended as a serious competition with what we would call science nowadays as as creating a

588
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,020
Cosmological model that's something we impose even posed on it

589
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:04,700
Maybe the last thousand years or so or something like that fairly recently

590
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,340
I mean compared to when the religions were compared to when the religions were created

591
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,500
And there was the creators of those religions

592
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,820
Cosmology was not foremost on their mind

593
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,900
Behavior was an ethics was on their mind survival

594
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,500
Have a frame of reference now I was thinking

595
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,060
And they said before that tell me what you believe

596
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,180
Tell me what you think about it at the time and I'll tell you what you believe

597
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,860
Paradise lost in certain senses and education in temporality

598
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,900
The first five lines in the poem

599
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,860
And with the one greater man restore us

600
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,820
It begins with mortality death all our world

601
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,340
The human condition helplessness

602
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,580
It's idea of being lost

603
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,580
And then this

604
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:11,420
Ended to one greater man restores that is Jesus Christ figure who's going to come to being history

605
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,660
I think in many interesting things about what you said, I think this

606
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:22,380
The relationship and this is why people coming back to it. There's a relationship between cosmology and ethics

607
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,140
There's a relationship between cosmology and how we know the world. There's a relationship in the day-to-day

608
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
And

609
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,820
So so crucial to milk it

610
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,820
and other figures

611
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:42,940
In the Christian world, Dante, even classical world the importance of ending is in your style

612
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,660
everything tends in esstylosis

613
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,580
trilogy

614
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,580
everything tends towards an ending

615
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,220
And in the very beginning of the plot one can already feel the end of the plot

616
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,660
And I think there is again that strong relationship

617
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,540
Between ending and ethics

618
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:06,860
I mean, we just tend I think naturally to look at these messianic frames overly simplistic

619
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,900
Milton

620
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,820
gives the light of that because in a way he shows the skeptical

621
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:18,780
We're not religious moment in the heart in the heart of the religious experience

622
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:23,340
The reason people keep on reading Milton is because he's a theological skeptic

623
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,580
Which is a paradox

624
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,580
Because I think he he accommodates

625
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:31,340
Ed sense of we want to know what the ending is

626
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,260
But he doesn't give into simplistic renderings of what that would be

627
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:41,580
Okay, so let me be more specific about my question. There's okay now. I was being vague

628
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,620
I was going to so let me say specifically Christianity

629
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:51,740
I think imposes constraints on cosmology because you can't have the idea of original sin and emisiah

630
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,820
Unless that sets up that sets up a time frame of a rigid time frame of beginning

631
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,700
There's something before and there's got to be something at the end

632
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,860
if you think it push that away for a bit then

633
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,940
Then the idea that might be

634
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:11,500
And you can see that such a concept really runs into trouble when you think about a universe

635
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,180
Which has different patches which are being created at different times and what is original?

636
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,460
What does it mean to say something? What does this whole story even mean in that context?

637
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:24,860
Sort of loses its meaning in that context entirely whereas it doesn't lose its meaning in other theological context

638
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,900
So I think I think to some degree the problem

639
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:33,500
It may be specific with the with a christian theology as opposed to other theologies

640
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:40,140
I would say judio christian in the 17th century one sees this tension the card of hops begin to

641
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,860
sense binoza begin to undermine

642
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,820
theology

643
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:52,780
And create a whole different set of disciplinary hierarchies and which signs is at the top then of course there's just a disjunction

644
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:58,620
And then and theology comes artifice. That's why I keep on coming back and taught

645
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,780
I'm very interested in the way in which both of you

646
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:10,780
Even as you're presenting us and I'm sorry. I'm to be a human here presenting as a picture of facts are reliant upon metaphors

647
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,540
ships

648
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,060
catastrophe

649
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,020
dark

650
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,060
Energy

651
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:22,780
Which I think comes from her as laws dark maddens of the transformation dark mils dark matter

652
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:27,580
So it seems to me that there's always a narrative renderer

653
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,220
of

654
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:35,900
The objective scientific world in which you do obviously the realm of theology and

655
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,700
Literature the artifice is foreground

656
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,260
but I understand

657
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,500
The discomfort you would have with those all of the versions of cosmology

658
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
And how they don't they don't gel

659
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,500
And I wonder whether one modern

660
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,140
transformation of theological thinking is utopian thinking

661
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,820
Which also fell into disrepute and disuse

662
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,420
And the sense I think came more that

663
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:11,660
This way of life that we're in which is capitalism which is global capital

664
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:16,620
It's simply going to continue and continue the history and you know the end of history scenario

665
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:24,140
That this is what's before us more and more consumer goods perhaps increased prosperity around the globe

666
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:31,340
Perhaps not but at the end at any rate no alternative and I think it's that sensibility that has spawned

667
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,980
the just absolute plethora of

668
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,380
violently ending

669
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,500
Narratives which characterized the last 50 years

670
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,180
um

671
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,020
You know just so many apocalyptic you know the apocalyptic imagination

672
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,700
I think is very much in response to this sense of

673
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:57,820
The end of historical progression and this sense of sort of what seems to be a lot of stuff happening all the time everywhere

674
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:00,380
Is really just a kind of complex form of stasis

675
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,060
um

676
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:05,340
And so the even utopso theological thinking yes, it's

677
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:09,180
Who needs it but even utopian thinking is going it's

678
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:16,940
A lot of I'm not sure where the origin of this statement is but um, it's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism

679
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,860
I think it's it seems to be the case

680
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:26,380
There are so many ways to imagine the end of the world and all of them seem dedicated to just wiping out this

681
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,060
crop

682
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:35,020
That seems to be the contemporary world out of which and to which there seems to be no alternative

683
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,580
So the challenge to sort of locate an alternative is

684
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,460
And you know when I think that's one of the reasons that say the occupied movement became

685
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:50,620
Such a powerful you know popular and powerful phenomenon at least in that moment that it was whether it will be again

686
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:54,780
I don't know but it's certainly wise for a while and because it seemed to be well

687
00:55:54,780 --> 00:56:03,740
Right, right there is some other way of thinking about addressing the social problems that face us in this country and globally

688
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:11,500
For ways which are not apocalyptic or which are well or which are but at any rate some some other some other way of thinking

689
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:18,540
Which is what the utopian imagination is trying to do and which was as I say kind of discredited

690
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,820
For some time

691
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,820
But

692
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,980
It may know is it a form of theology

693
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:32,060
Yeah, I think you can make a document in the in the evolutionary picture in history life and of the

694
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:36,860
Science I said that the old idea from lael was the president is the key

695
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,420
The past study what's going on now?

696
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:46,300
You can figure out what went on in the past the new model. This has been replaced is the past

697
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,180
Is the key to the future

698
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:54,460
So study the way what has happened in the past if it if it did happen it can happen

699
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,220
Right and then those things will repeat themselves

700
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:05,740
Into the future and also with with Darwinism Darwin had this very capitalistic mode right of competition between species

701
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:10,060
And extinctions were caused by what species winning the competition. That's all changed now

702
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,380
The picture now is that species go along for a long period of time pretty much

703
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:20,060
Stable and then something bad happens and lots of species become extinct some catastrophe

704
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:25,020
And then the aftermath of that extinction life radiates into lots of new forms

705
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,820
Mammals didn't out-compete the dinosaurs

706
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,740
They just managed to survive the catastrophe 65 million years ago

707
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:35,580
And they radiated into all the forms of mammals that we see today popular in the earth

708
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,660
So it's been a change and I say it

709
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,220
What did with the social darlinist do with this?

710
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,820
There's no rule for social darlinist. Yeah

711
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:57,340
I think something that's been implicit in much of what's said is kind of the reverse engineering of

712
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,780
what you call were

713
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,980
Communicating about

714
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,500
how

715
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,460
The

716
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:13,500
dominance of dark energy would kind of shatter our self-conceptions the reverse engineering of that being and you know

717
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
You've all been kind of touching upon this

718
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,540
How are self-conceptions

719
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:22,380
Shape and influence how

720
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,020
You as scientists

721
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:30,460
theorize and how you recognize things for what they are what about the

722
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,340
Self-conceptions

723
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:38,780
that influence that that's that kind of gets at the bridging of the two cultures that you were kind of

724
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:43,580
Negotiating down in the green room. I wonder what thoughts you have about

725
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:49,660
I think about that as a theorist as to whether or not we've thought about all the possible

726
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,780
kinds of theories one can have of the universe

727
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:56,700
Historically most theories of the universe fall into one of three categories

728
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:02,380
The created universe which is created and then evolves and just goes forward in time

729
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,700
I've been becoming more and more complex with time

730
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,700
the static universe universe. It's always the same

731
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,340
and the

732
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,340
cyclical type universe and

733
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,500
I think we understand

734
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:20,380
Where those come from in terms of our human experience they you know

735
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:27,100
cyclicity occurs and in certain things in the daily cycle and the seasonal cycle we understand that and a

736
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:32,780
Stasis we understand we look out the stars and they seem to be static so they they have an apparent stasis

737
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:36,940
Although we now know there there's not a real stasis there, but that's where that would have come from

738
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:42,860
And the idea of the created universe that's birth. That's that's that's that's part of our human experience as well

739
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,460
And when we talk about the end that's kind of you know, that's like our death

740
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:50,060
So the question is is okay. So most models of cosmology

741
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:53,180
You could put into one of those categories and you can ask the question

742
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:58,940
Is that all the possible theories there are or is that just us humans trying to impose our you know

743
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:08,380
Are we just so influenced by our humanity that that's the only kinds of theories we can come up with and one of the interesting things about recent theories is that

744
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,620
Many of them don't quite so simply categorize and so

745
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:16,380
That's interesting. I don't know. We don't know whether or not they're true or not

746
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:21,500
But I think that's an interesting development that we're breaking out of those those traditional moles

747
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,220
I don't know, you know in some sense, you know

748
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,180
You know evolution is also undergoing a change in terms of

749
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:34,460
Being more complex not not being a simple store a simple story, but being

750
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:42,540
I mean you were even simplifying it the way you were describing it, but some sort of combination of you know slow evolution and

751
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,940
Traffic evolution and just things are more complex than any simple narrative

752
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,580
Tell us who

753
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,900
Slow evolution taking place and then you have these

754
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,140
Apocalypse

755
01:00:54,140 --> 01:01:00,940
Catastrophe right so one of the things that science has forced us to do is to come to grips with whether our narratives make sense

756
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,660
So you keep pushing your narrative and saying okay if this narrative is true then

757
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:10,140
I would guess the following would be true and then you look to see if that's true and when it's not

758
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:15,260
You're forced to correct your narrative and that's I mean that's the discovery of the scientific method

759
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:22,460
That was the grand discovery that you take the scientific method and you add the human brain to it and really something miraculous happens

760
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:28,460
Suddenly new information is created out of at a much greater rate than we were able to create any other time

761
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,100
The other period up till the present

762
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,820
Exactly why that come works that way

763
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:40,380
I don't know. I think it really requires both the humanity and the scientific method to work the humanity to be

764
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,060
imaginative to come up with stories to come up with guesses

765
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,100
and

766
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:50,940
Huge jumps huge leaps and then the scientific method to check that to put that in check and say okay

767
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:56,620
That's a good guess and that's a bad guess and somehow that works together in some magical way that has led to

768
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:01,340
A tremendous amount of tremendous run of progress over the last several hundred years

769
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,580
The scientific method I'm not trying to understand what you're saying

770
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:09,900
The scientific method is something that exists outside of us that we

771
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:14,060
Yeah, so I mean we discovered like the monolith and oh it was discovered

772
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:20,540
Yeah, the idea that you empirically test your ideas that that you don't just tell your story and because it's a good story

773
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:25,340
I mean that's this we were talking about theology theologies are really good stories

774
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:30,780
Which have a lot of appeal to them and and there's some good lessons to be learned from them

775
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:35,180
But then you want to you know, but you know, is that story true or is that story true?

776
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,940
You know well well theology

777
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:40,460
You may be not answer the question but for you know why stars form

778
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:47,980
We can either different stories you could think of right but you need back and so the human imagination allows you to leap and think of many possible stories

779
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,420
and then

780
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:52,300
You impose on that the scientific method with many different

781
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:58,700
You know, I have to find objective ways of demonstrating to you that that idea is right and that idea is wrong

782
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:05,020
Objective in the sense that you know people in different parts of the world with different backgrounds can all agree on

783
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,980
You know, I'll make those observations and come to the same conclusions

784
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:12,060
That was an invented idea and you know invented in the Renaissance

785
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:19,660
It was not an idea that was there historically beforehand and it led to a tremendous run of several hundred years up to the present time

786
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,500
of

787
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:28,300
You know the rate of which new information has come to us is just you know, just just exponentially increased since that time

788
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:32,780
Maybe there's a better invention a better something better than the scientific method for

789
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:36,140
Increasing the rate at which we gain information. We haven't discovered it yet

790
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:40,540
I don't know but the moment this is our best invention that does just sound to me as a literary

791
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:47,580
I'm using the death of the topic in there is the scientific method is the mirage

792
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:58,540
Yeah, I don't know if this free of science to talk about it, but obviously any all pre-modern societies have had some form of trial and error

793
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,660
You made

794
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:06,220
Stone, you know implements you figured out ways to do it. It wasn't a formalized scientific method

795
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:11,580
But it was an empiric it was a form of empiricism, I think so but but but as you

796
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:20,700
But something happened in the whatever 16th 17th century some convergence. I would think of political economic

797
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,980
social

798
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:28,700
Thinking such that this idea of standardization of repeatability

799
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,700
a

800
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:37,420
Different goals. I mean, I guess I would question the sense that oh, you know

801
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:42,860
Just for no particular reason somebody thought of this great way of doing inquiry

802
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:46,300
I think the results of it. I think or as you said

803
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:51,180
but but the origins of it maybe that was discussed two weeks ago, but

804
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,060
the origins of it I

805
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:59,980
Think they would be more other social ideological economic questions that were

806
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:01,820
played

807
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:06,140
You know when wanted to be able to do things one wanted to be able to explore the world

808
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:11,580
wanted to be able to create products and markets developing so I just at least that's that's just

809
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:16,620
the mindset that I can disagree with and it's a good and don't disagree those were

810
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:19,340
that was part of the

811
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,340
spirit of the time I mean and

812
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:27,420
Yeah, so being being successful and meant being able to succeed in a marketplace

813
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:33,260
Was different than being successful because I say I was the king or something like that. So so

814
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:36,220
it led to more competition of

815
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,700
products and a competition of ideas and

816
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:46,220
Knowledge is power and so suddenly it was possible to be powerful without being let's say aristocratic by having knowledge

817
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:51,580
And I think that that's I'm not a story. And so my guess would be that would be part of the

818
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:58,780
Forces that are at work that led to what I think is clearly an invention because certainly the way knowledge was gathered

819
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:06,780
You know say before Galileo Newton is quite different than the way it was gathered since Galileo Newton and the amount of progress has been made there in every

820
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,100
Area of science is just

821
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,660
There's no comparison

822
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,660
I mean

823
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,660
There's no comparison

824
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,460
I mean

825
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,100
Sensors of endings and ways of knowing

826
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,540
We know

827
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,300
No

828
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,140
Well, so for example

829
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:42,780
You know there are different idea we have this is a question

830
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,020
So so

831
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:53,820
Maybe the way to respond to that is to say to make it a scientifically meaningful issue it had better have some empirical consequences

832
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:58,780
So in some sense being a scientist you restrict yourself to a domain of questions

833
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:05,980
Our domain of issues which have empirical consequences if they not you're welcome to think about them

834
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,980
But they're outside the domain of science

835
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,860
Different different different consequences

836
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:34,740
Different cosmology is electrical is known and the culture that he represents in competition with this conian Hobbesian universe which is I mean Hobbes really comes armed with bacon and anticipated in a society and he comes to destroy Don Shakespeare and Milton these are not legitimately known

837
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,500
They are

838
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:46,740
How are you through what Hobbes will call and reject as metaphor and contradiction? It's also an extremely resonant question here

839
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:52,260
How does this kind of empirical mouth Jim talk before about primary process about dreams?

840
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:57,140
What happens to those primary process insights those insights that are not

841
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:01,940
reducible to secondary process in how does the psychoanalyst

842
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:08,140
Intertwan this miraculous narrative and I'm not I'm not doubting

843
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:16,220
Not only mining that was narrative I also trying to understand

844
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,940
the

845
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:24,220
Consequences of that cosmology grounded as it is an object of fire reality

846
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,820
With other cosmologies which allow for other kinds of known

847
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:33,700
And that's a literary historical interest of mine

848
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:44,740
The beginnings and Milton and the one in the beginning of a kind of murder anybody's also the end

849
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:50,380
And Hobbes of course is just amounts of it before just the death of this other kind of culture

850
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:56,180
And the death of a kind knowing which is based upon metaphor or which is based upon paradox

851
01:08:56,180 --> 01:09:02,140
It seems so much of what would go on in this building would have to do with that other kind of not

852
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:06,540
So maybe it's worth saying that in cosmology

853
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:13,500
So although cosmology is in some sense one of the oldest sciences in terms of people thinking about it in terms of being an empirical

854
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,500
Science, it's one of the newest

855
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,940
so

856
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:22,300
Up until 1920 we weren't even able to see and recognize there were galaxies beyond our own and

857
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:26,940
We've gathered more data in the last ten years about the nearby

858
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:33,820
Intermediate and most distant observable parts of the universe which correspond to the present

859
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:39,260
Intermediate and past distant past of the universe that we just didn't have before so

860
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:47,940
From a scientific point of view you can just take the data from the last ten years and throw against that all the concepts of cosmology

861
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:56,340
That have been developed by humans throughout human history and almost all of them are inconsistent with those observations with the exception of two I can name

862
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:03,380
Two ideas, which is a pretty amazing statement just based on a decades worth of data. So that's so

863
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,100
Where does science come into it?

864
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:12,660
Well if you insist on the scientific methodology that your cosmology should make sense with it

865
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:19,860
You know with an objective observation, which is what sciences do then then you can sort through these different ideas and say okay

866
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:22,700
That was a great idea a very imaginative idea, but that idea is

867
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,820
Not our universe and okay, and this one is even though it may not have been the one you would have chosen

868
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,420
So that's all I can offer

869
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:38,700
I think so but you may not always be happy with the outcome

870
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:44,340
So so maybe

871
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:51,500
There are further comments from the round type we could open it up to questions from the audience

872
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,500
Please you know state your name and

873
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,500
The

874
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:13,260
Sessions for weekly there on Monday and she said that the world was going to end on Friday

875
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:17,020
And then the next session when she came out on Monday

876
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:24,420
I asked you how she felt about the situation. She said no, it's going to it's gonna end on Friday

877
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,660
This went on for months

878
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:36,540
Reason I mentioned is that I think the a couple like the apocalyptic and sort of dramatic sense of ending

879
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:42,180
Make have a basis in a stereotypical unconscious

880
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:48,740
Part of our minds where it's it's it's sort of boilerplate. It's stereotypical

881
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:54,020
It doesn't come it doesn't seem to be based on anything. It's delusional and

882
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,260
That it just is sort of there

883
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:00,900
Had my therapy focused on

884
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:07,940
Relieving her of the problem that the world was going to end up it would have gotten nowhere and probably actually would have gotten worse

885
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:16,180
And any psychotic medication actually did reduce that over a period of time and she got to the point where she said

886
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:18,180
I just don't think about it

887
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:20,260
the other issue was

888
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:24,920
that the problem with anxiety with this lady was was her marrow

889
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:27,420
And I thought oh, it's symbolic

890
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:32,060
see if the world's gonna with what that means to her is

891
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:37,500
My marriage is is gonna break up and that will be the end of the world for me

892
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:43,660
It really wasn't any connection at all in fact the marriage wasn't breaking up in fact

893
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:51,500
We did make some progress with the marital therapy and she did fairly well, so it's just a

894
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,220
Sort of a word of caution. I guess is to

895
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:59,580
is that in the in the unconscious with the stereotype of unconscious we have I

896
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:05,180
Asked I worked in a prison for what I asked inmates to write down to draw me the devil

897
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:13,220
It was amazing similarity I had 12 drawings people that didn't know each other and we're not comparing notes a

898
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,500
rodent like figure big teeth

899
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:22,220
big eyes big ears tail pitchfork

900
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,180
so on

901
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:26,180
This is a stereotypical unconscious

902
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:29,860
It and I'm afraid it it fuels things like

903
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:37,460
Alcoholics and so on that it just keeps keeps that going that we just keep in mind that maybe part of our whole structure

904
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:41,260
of our mind that is is more stereotypical than actually symbolic or actually

905
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,700
Thing I want to ask is

906
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,180
for

907
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:50,980
You in particular is would you consider?

908
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:56,860
There that there might be an eternal universe, but there also might be a local big bang

909
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:59,940
universe that we live in that's not eternal

910
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,140
is

911
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,940
and is there

912
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,940
Do we perhaps perceive that?

913
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:11,180
intuitively and is there something having to do with envy?

914
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:18,420
Are we because we're so finite envious of the eternal that may be out there, and so we try to

915
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,220
go through elaborate situations

916
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,300
In our instance the reason so on to make believe that

917
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:32,260
Our life is eternal, you know, it's not the universe have those are we envious of the cosmos?

918
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:41,780
I can't address an interesting question the last one I can't answer it, but to answer your your your scientific question

919
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:46,940
Which is can you is it possible to have the universe which is eternal on on average?

920
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:54,180
There are parts that are always existing and being in new creations taking place and parts which are ending in one way or another

921
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,180
ending by

922
01:14:56,180 --> 01:15:02,140
Catastrophically or ending by this sort of petering out. Yes, that is the picture that is if you were going to guess that if you were

923
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:07,540
Gonna describe the prevalent picture it bunk cosmologist. That would be the prevalent picture among cosmologists at present

924
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:11,660
The physics the science seems to allow for that possibility

925
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:18,700
And it seems by but allows for it. I mean it makes predictions about the part of the universe that we observe that so far

926
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:19,900
I've been verified

927
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:22,380
So it doesn't allow us to see out there to check it

928
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:28,300
But there are other inferences of such theories that we can't that do make implications to what we should observe about

929
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:35,460
The radiation from the early universe and the distribution of galaxies that so far work and so right now that idea seems to be

930
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:40,460
working well

931
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,460
I would just add

932
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:48,460
that ancient cosmologist from the Tomlittic Rambi's to Augusta

933
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:51,460
Assume the time is created thing

934
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:56,460
That there is something beyond time and eternity

935
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:01,460
But I also would just add speculations about eternity

936
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:07,460
Dovetail with what I keep on coming back to the speculation about the divine

937
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:12,460
And the non-impirically objectifiable

938
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,460
I think that was the question of the science

939
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:17,460
Is there something beyond the empirically objectifiable?

940
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,460
And that becomes not a question

941
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,460
I think only for scientists

942
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,460
about here the scientific answer

943
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:29,460
That becomes a conversation where philosophers

944
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,460
and maybe your words also

945
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,460
Ernest Imbradley the new school

946
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:45,460
I have the impression that we were really talking about two different times

947
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:50,460
One the cultural time in which theology is subsumed

948
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:54,460
All theology not just your day but Christian or whatnot

949
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:59,460
In which literature is subsumed from Doris Lesson to Milton and whatnot

950
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:01,460
Psychiatry

951
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:08,460
And what I was lacking in this conversation was the fact of a self-awareness

952
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:13,460
That we are all talking in a box that we are Western oriented

953
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:19,460
We have not included other boxes which would still be boxes

954
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:26,460
So that's really I don't want us to believe that we are the horses mouth

955
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:29,460
That's why I was very important to mention this

956
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:36,460
But if I use a term myth that we all every culture needs a myth

957
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:41,460
To deal with death not just with ending but with death

958
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:44,460
And sometimes their death can lead into rebirth

959
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,460
So there is no ending

960
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:50,460
And I thought maybe we should also keep that in mind

961
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:54,460
And then the last one question I really have is

962
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:59,460
A question addressed to the cosmologists and the astrophysicists

963
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:05,460
Whether astrophysics isn't again a myth

964
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:15,460
A contemporary myth that is totally dependent on the instruments that are available

965
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:20,460
The instruments chasing the big bang or whatever

966
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:27,460
And of course you can say that the instruments themselves are already the outcome of the direction

967
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:30,460
In which you want to go with your research

968
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:38,460
But I wonder again whether this is not inside a box which is our box today

969
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:41,460
I think that is a very important thing

970
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:44,460
I think that is a very important thing

971
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:47,460
I think that is a very important thing

972
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:50,460
Well, let's see, so

973
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:56,460
You have a number of interesting comments that I'm trying to decide which one to begin with

974
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:00,460
I do think that

975
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:06,460
I tried to make the point that I think science is a human invented method

976
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:11,460
Which combines our ability to imagine and make myths

977
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:17,460
And make stories and make narratives with

978
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:23,460
Objectivity in the sense of the instruments and ways in which we can make prescriptions

979
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:27,460
I can write something down and say you do this observation

980
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:30,460
I predict you will observe the following

981
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:32,460
You will go do it and you will actually observe it

982
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:36,460
Which is an interesting truth

983
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:40,460
Which turns out to have a lot of practical value that we can do that

984
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:43,460
As opposed to other stories which may be less practical

985
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:46,460
Maybe very appealing but maybe less practical

986
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:50,460
But I mean you can call, I'm not sure the words have connotations

987
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:53,460
So when you say is science a kind of mythology

988
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:57,460
Which involves instruments and mathematics and objects

989
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:02,460
And you can use the word myth

990
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:05,460
But I think it somehow deserves a different word

991
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:08,460
And so I'll use the word science

992
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:14,460
But I think you're saying that there's a difference between calling science a mythology

993
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:20,460
And science arising from the same human capacities that myth-making entail

994
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,460
Doesn't mean that science is a myth

995
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:25,460
I think we've extended our imagination

996
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,460
And that's the point I was trying to make

997
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:30,460
I think a scientific methodology extends us beyond our imagination

998
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:33,460
To be able to distinguish different stories

999
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:35,460
Which are of practical interest

1000
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:39,460
Like I want to know if there's going to be a solar eclipse in Japan today

1001
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:43,460
Which there is

1002
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:47,460
The fact that I can predict that is based on observations

1003
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:50,460
And then you can go off and check with the Japanese

1004
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,460
Call your friends in Japan and say yeah sure enough

1005
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:55,460
A solar eclipse there is different than other myths I could make up

1006
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,460
Of why there are solar eclipse

1007
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,460
Which would not give me that power to predict

1008
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:06,460
So I think of science as just a way we've learned to make our imaginations more powerful

1009
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:11,460
To be able to predict and explain things in ways that now allow us to say

1010
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:12,460
What's going to happen next?

1011
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:18,460
Give us better control over our lives, our health, all the things that technology brings us

1012
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:22,460
Those are real things that science has brought us

1013
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,460
Which make it different than myth making

1014
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:26,460
Yeah, absolutely

1015
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:37,460
I think the mythological or ideological consequences are that the idea of predictability becomes a kind of fetish

1016
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:46,460
If a discipline does not lead toward predictive consequences then it's devalued

1017
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:49,460
I think that is maybe what Ernst was talking about

1018
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:51,460
And that's certainly something that occurs to me

1019
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:55,460
For example the very prominent pseudoscience of economics

1020
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:58,460
You're not allowed

1021
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:04,460
It seems to me it's predictive assertions seem to be completely

1022
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:07,460
Inattic, please

1023
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:10,460
And yet there's an ideological fixation on this discipline

1024
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:14,460
Such that the smartest guys in the room are the economists

1025
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:17,460
Because they can do these amazing things with numbers

1026
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:19,460
And they have this whole apparatus

1027
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:26,460
And so the scientific instrument has now been appropriated by a field

1028
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:29,460
Which really has nothing to do with science as you described

1029
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:31,460
So there is a mythology of science

1030
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:36,460
Actual scientists I didn't think are part of it in the whole

1031
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:39,460
But there is a myth that comes from it

1032
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,460
Well it's an attempt to

1033
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:45,460
I mean, okay we've discovered this method that works for certain kinds of questions

1034
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:49,460
It works really well for explaining why this table is as solid as it is

1035
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:53,460
And the same methodology doesn't work so well for economics

1036
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,460
And so science is limited

1037
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:58,460
As I said it's an invention and like any invention

1038
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:02,460
Like the Blackberry, it works well for some things but not for other things

1039
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,460
And how do we...

1040
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:04,460
It works so powerful

1041
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:06,460
And when it works it works really powerfully

1042
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,460
Right, and we've seen that

1043
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:11,460
And so we... Okay, so it's natural to say

1044
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:15,460
Well could we apply it to answer this question or that other question

1045
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:18,460
And sometimes you can and sometimes you can't

1046
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:24,460
And so you try and do it in a part of human efforts to try to gain knowledge

1047
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:28,460
I have a more narrow technical question

1048
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:31,460
You and they were Michael Sattice

1049
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:35,460
A more narrow technical question for Dr. Stonghart

1050
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:40,460
Is it thought that the amount of dark energy is increasing

1051
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:45,460
And if so why how does it come back?

1052
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:48,460
Okay, so it's a simple question

1053
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:50,460
You guys a simple question, so

1054
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:59,460
Yes it is increasing in terms of a total amount of dark energy

1055
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:03,460
But there's two things going on at the same time

1056
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:06,460
The river is expanding and as it expands

1057
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:10,460
Energy spreads out, it becomes more dilute

1058
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:14,460
But different forms of energy become dilute at different rates

1059
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:18,460
Matter just spreads out the more you make if you double the volume

1060
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:21,460
It's density decreases by a factor of two

1061
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:25,460
Radiation decreases at a faster rate because as it spreads out

1062
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:29,460
It also... the photons redshift so they actually lose energy faster

1063
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:33,460
Dark energy is the energy that loses its energy either not at all

1064
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:36,460
It's density not at all or at the slowest

1065
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:42,460
So over time it eventually takes over because everything else stays loose and it doesn't

1066
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,460
Another thing that's happening is when you're stretching the universe

1067
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:48,460
You're creating more space and that space has energy in it

1068
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:51,460
So there's therefore more energy, total of energy is growing

1069
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:54,460
And where is that coming from? Well it's coming from gravity

1070
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:59,460
So one thing that's not... we should have all learned in elementary school

1071
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:02,460
I even find my advanced graduate students don't quite appreciate it

1072
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:08,460
Gravity is the one form of one force from which you can draw an infinite amount of energy

1073
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:10,460
And this is an example of it

1074
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:14,460
An expanding universe filled with dark energy keeps stretching

1075
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:17,460
Creating new space filled with dark energy

1076
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:20,460
So the total dark energy grows, the gravitational energy decreases

1077
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:23,460
But gravitational energy is a kind of bottomless pit

1078
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,460
So you can just keep doing that forever

1079
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:28,460
And that's what the laws of physics tell us can happen

1080
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,460
And could be happening, that could be happening

1081
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:34,460
That's one possibility for the long term future of the universe

1082
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:38,460
That's all that happens, there's more and more dark energy less and less of everything else

1083
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:40,460
Go ahead

1084
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:43,460
There's gentleman Daniel

1085
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:50,460
My name is Ernie Heller and I'm just passing through like the rest of us in life

1086
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:55,460
I have to go to my question

1087
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:59,460
It's been a great, I really mean a great post-doc over discussion

1088
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:06,460
But I would like you to focus for a couple of minutes on the starkest notion of one's end

1089
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:09,460
That's one's personal death, one's demise

1090
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:16,460
I would venture to say that to discuss the topic today

1091
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:24,460
If this were your final hour, would you say things differently would be clarifying, terrifying

1092
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:26,460
Or indifferent?

1093
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:33,460
The silence towards the time sound

1094
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:39,460
Yeah, I think Bill would have been fine with it

1095
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,460
Would it be my last hour?

1096
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:42,460
Yeah

1097
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:50,460
Well, in my last hour, I just had one preservation of poetry

1098
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:53,460
And I'm wondering if that gets preserved of these cosmologies

1099
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:56,460
You said, you know, I might not like it, but one of the things I don't like

1100
01:26:56,460 --> 01:27:00,460
Or is there, you know, the post-apocalyptic?

1101
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,460
Is there post-apocalyptic poetry? I mean, mention less

1102
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:04,460
I mean, Blake, we know that Blake

1103
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:07,460
Literary theory is post-apocalyptic poetry

1104
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,460
We know that Blake worried about Newton

1105
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:12,460
Because Newton made poetry possible

1106
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,460
Or he thought so

1107
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:20,460
To get away from the intellectual level, what about the emotional level of life

1108
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,460
That was a little too good about his hearing

1109
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:28,460
Where is that involved our efforts to try to get to the point of it all?

1110
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:35,460
I don't know, is one's sense of the meaning of life

1111
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:42,460
Dependent on the actual act of dying, the moment of one's death?

1112
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:47,460
I don't know, I think there's meaning in every moment of your life

1113
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:51,460
I don't, I think it's melodramatic to put it in those terms

1114
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:56,460
Of course, when one gets to that point, then you'll get to that point

1115
01:27:56,460 --> 01:28:00,460
Somebody suggested to me we should have an undertaker for this round table

1116
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:05,460
So, I don't know, I can't answer that

1117
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:10,460
I'm not sure that to answer the question, it's not what questions you want to answer

1118
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:16,460
But you're asking whether the emotions you have near your moments before death

1119
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,460
Are helpful, is that what you're asking?

1120
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:20,460
Are they helpful in addressing these questions?

1121
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:23,460
My guess is they're not helpful in answering these questions

1122
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:27,460
Because you're emotional, you're a little preoccupied with something else

1123
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:32,460
I'm a little bit nervous, I'm a little nervous, I'm a little nervous

1124
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:37,460
I'm a little nervous, I'm a little nervous, I'm a little nervous

1125
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:41,460
Probably irrationally, but I don't know, I don't know

1126
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:52,460
I'm very interested that you try to connect the arts and literature with the sciences

1127
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:58,460
In terms of what's developing in the science and wanting to feel that the arts have to follow suit

1128
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:03,460
Because most often the arts have dealt with certain structural elements

1129
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:08,460
And there's an implication that some of these structural elements you felt were obsolete

1130
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:16,460
For instance, like tension or drama or apocalypse or contradiction or paradox

1131
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:23,460
And it's curious that you're thinking as science develops, we the artists and the writers and the philosophers

1132
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:28,460
Have to change our structure of the very nature of our existence

1133
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:33,460
Because we experience life in one way, and even if our knowledge changes

1134
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:39,460
There's still certain elements in the paradox of living because of the inherent tensions in it

1135
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:43,460
So I found this, why were you so concerned that my goodness?

1136
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:46,460
Actually that seems to be some of the problems that what's happening in the arts today

1137
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:53,460
That they're dissolving and evaporating and receiving almost in fear that certain structures are obsolete

1138
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,460
This is just a general comment

1139
01:29:55,460 --> 01:30:01,460
And I have one other thing that always interested me, maybe because in philosophy it was mentioned in Chopinhauer

1140
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:07,460
And so about repetition and Heraclitus speaking about you can never step in the same with a river twice

1141
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:15,460
And it seems to me as you're talking that repetition, there is not any longer a concept of repetition in science

1142
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:21,460
But there is some base by which you work that gradually evolves

1143
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:33,460
But is there an underlying structure that keeps changing or do you find there are some elements that are building stones that are there?

1144
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:40,460
If you follow what I'm saying, I mean the Heraclitusian view versus the idea is there such a thing as repetition?

1145
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:43,460
Do we ever repeat anything?

1146
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:51,460
I think the first question, the humanities have been anxious, poets have been anxious as Plato

1147
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:55,460
We've become anxious again in the 17th century with Hobbes

1148
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:58,460
We became more anxious with the development of science

1149
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:03,460
The disciplinary hierarchies have changed, and go to my university in Israel by a lot

1150
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:08,460
And see the size of the Netflixx buildings and the nanotechnology buildings and the old humanities buildings

1151
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:11,460
It's very clear why that anxiety should exist

1152
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:20,460
I'm also just struck by the assertion of the separation between emotional and intellectual

1153
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:23,460
That's us somehow given, and again I think we're our way

1154
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:28,460
to this building, which I think about that time, very strongly and terribly

1155
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:36,460
To think about the role that the poetic functions not only have hops with the rockator of the Buddha

1156
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:41,460
For something which is a nice looking or pretty

1157
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:46,460
But the way primary process functions as a way of knowing

1158
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:54,460
And paradox functions as a way not only of some kind of ephemeral poetic expression, but of which the emotions

1159
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:57,460
And the intellect are somehow more beautiful

1160
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:01,460
I mean that's one of the inheritances of the scientific world view

1161
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:06,460
Is that the emotions have been pushed out, poetry has been pushed to the side

1162
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:12,460
Yeah, I don't think the arts really are necessarily sort of following the sciences

1163
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:17,460
Or trying to sort of keep up with what scientific developments are doing

1164
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:25,460
Except, I don't know, the science that seems to capture people's imaginations

1165
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:31,460
Those recently have seen the neuroscience and the resonant arts and neuroscience

1166
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:34,460
And some of the people who continue thinking about quite a bit

1167
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:40,460
The gap in sort of disciplinary emphases between cosmology

1168
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:45,460
And these kind of enormous wastes of time

1169
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:50,460
These voids of time

1170
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:55,460
So the question is where do we come together?

1171
01:32:55,460 --> 01:33:02,460
And I'm thinking about different things, the histories of our disciplines are different

1172
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:06,460
Maybe this is what a line of the raspberries

1173
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:11,460
Maybe there should be an apparent tension, what's wrong with things that aren't resolved

1174
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:16,460
But our tension between what's happening scientifically, what's going on in the arts

1175
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:19,460
There can remain the tension between which creates

1176
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:26,460
And in the populist division of creates a dramatic movement, a dramatic vision within it

1177
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:31,460
Yeah, I don't think there's any problem with different fields, having different methodologies and different approaches

1178
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:36,460
There's different kinds of people, we've all had different childhoods, we had different teachers

1179
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:41,460
In high school, we went different ways, so that's what we did

1180
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:44,460
The question is where do we come together socially and politically?

1181
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:50,460
Or are there questions which we really do think about in common as a mortal being and be citizens?

1182
01:33:50,460 --> 01:34:00,460
And I think that's the more important question, I think, that whether our particular academic interests coincide

1183
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:08,460
Well, science is not a robotic process, it's a creative process like in the arts

1184
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:13,460
And so where does the inspiration come from?

1185
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:16,460
Well, the inspiration comes from a very similar human process

1186
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:21,460
Sometimes you might go to an art museum and look at a piece of art, that might inspire you to think of an idea

1187
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:25,460
That turns out to have a scientific meaning, you know, so

1188
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:27,460
That's the purpose of this round table

1189
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:33,460
Or this, yeah, so that's why I'm here, part of the history

1190
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:38,460
We're here, coming to this is because this kind of thing can't inspire unusual discussions

1191
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:42,460
It gets you just thinking a little bit differently and then suddenly on the train home

1192
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:48,460
I may think a lot of problems and view it in a different way and something good happens from it

1193
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:51,460
So that's where the human part of the process comes from

1194
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:56,460
I want to answer your question about repeatability

1195
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:01,460
So, in fact there's a sort of double problem about repeatability

1196
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:13,460
Number one, if you mean by exact repeatability classically before we consider quantum physics

1197
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:19,460
That is statistically, you know, so unlikely is not to be worth considering

1198
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:25,460
But with quantum mechanics it even becomes ill-defined because when you say exact repeatability

1199
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:30,460
It assumes that you have an exact notion of position, time, energy, mass

1200
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:37,460
And in quantum physics those are all now fuzzy objects which only have probabilities, not certainties

1201
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:44,460
So that's the current condition, or a current way of understanding the best we can do in the universe

1202
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:50,460
Or we can say it's approximately repeating, something is approximately repeating in certain average quantities

1203
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:55,460
But exactly repeating would never, would almost lose meaning in the quantum sense

1204
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:57,460
Go ahead

1205
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:01,460
My name is Ken Wade, I'm the artist from downtown

1206
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:03,460
And I'm talking about Dark and Mad

1207
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:04,460
Dark and Mad

1208
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:07,460
Sounds like a very sinister thing

1209
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:13,460
I remember in movies when I was a week of launching the Japanese to morph into an old fanang

1210
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:19,460
The wolf man came out in full, so I know we're affected by stuff out there

1211
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:25,460
So I'm wondering, this is an increasing problem, as you said

1212
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:27,460
Dark energy, yeah, yeah, right

1213
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:38,460
So does this explain everything, or does it have any influence on matters here, like all these terrible storms?

1214
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:45,460
In the recent republic, in primary things, you were acting a little bit easier

1215
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:51,460
I'm just wondering, is there a push-pull thing on this?

1216
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:58,460
So first of all, the term dark energy is not meant to be sinister, it's meant to tell you that it has energy

1217
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:00,460
And that it doesn't emit or absorb light

1218
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:06,460
So it's a fairly boring term, and not my favorite term for it, but that's become the convention

1219
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:11,460
So although there's lots of it, it's extremely thinly spread

1220
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:17,460
So within our solar system, most of the matter in our solar system is not dark

1221
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:20,460
Most of the energy, sorry, in our solar system is not dark energy

1222
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:26,460
It's the matter you know and love, the energy that makes up the humidity, earth, the sun, the planets, and the light

1223
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:33,460
However, space, it's hard to conceive until you've thought about the numbers

1224
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:42,460
And even with the numbers it might help you, but space is enormous compared to the places where you matter is concentrated

1225
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:49,460
And if you imagine that even in those places between galaxies, there's still this thin distribution of dark energy

1226
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:53,460
It adds up to be a huge total, so the total is huge

1227
01:37:53,460 --> 01:38:01,460
But within our galaxy, within our solar system, it's so thinly spread that it doesn't have any significant effect

1228
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:04,460
So the fact of this only effect is when you look at the universe in the large

1229
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:11,460
And then when it sums up to be more than all the matter in galaxies and stars

1230
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:15,460
Then it becomes a dominant influence in controlling the stretching of the universe

1231
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:21,460
And because it's gravitation, we also encourage the stretching and causes this acceleration

1232
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:26,460
Whereas the matter is trying to hold itself together, it wins because there's more of it

1233
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:31,460
Because it's so thinly spread, but it's spread out, but it occupies so much space

1234
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:33,460
More than one

1235
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:37,460
Yes, more than one effect than one effect there are elections

1236
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:46,460
My name is Peter Dithy, I'm a psychoanalyst and I'm a nurse and I want to offer the end of life

1237
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:53,460
People at the end of life, and one of the things that I think you mentioned

1238
01:38:53,460 --> 01:39:01,460
Stuck me about this gathering and what we're doing here

1239
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:08,460
And it seems to me that it's a lot of what we're doing is intellectualising

1240
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:16,460
Speaking in the abstract and being scientific is a defense against the anxieties

1241
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:27,460
That we all could feel if we took the time about perhaps our own impending death

1242
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:29,460
Whether it is or isn't

1243
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:35,460
My religion, if you like, and it's not really a religion, it's a lifestyle, it's Buddhism

1244
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:50,460
And Buddhists have a way of making impermanence meaningful to us by using it to motivate us maybe

1245
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:58,460
And say, life, life, I'm mortal, my life is infinite

1246
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:06,460
And I must do something meaningful is one of the common prayers if you like, of the Buddhist

1247
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:12,460
And that therefore is motivating

1248
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:22,460
Impermanence is seen all around, and might walk down the street and see a pigeon that's dropped dead overnight

1249
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:30,460
Any one of us could drop dead now or on the way home, and it's having that awareness in our consciousness

1250
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:41,460
That lends to, adds to the quality perhaps of our lives

1251
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:49,460
Because we know that that is there, to ignore it is a defence against feeling that

1252
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:52,460
Thank you

1253
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:53,460
A little rabbit

1254
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:55,460
Yeah, so I

1255
01:40:55,460 --> 01:41:05,460
Want to thank the audience's comments and interlocutors and our panelists today, Jim Berger, Paul Steinhardt, Bill Cobrenner

1256
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:09,460
And Michael Rampino for a stimulating discussion

1257
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:16,460
Perhaps I can invoke Winston Churchill's words from 1942 when he said

1258
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:22,460
This is not the end, it's not even the beginning of the end, but perhaps it's the end of the beginning

1259
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:32,460
And please follow us on helixcenter.org for further announcements, for our fall programs

1260
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:34,460
And thank you all for coming

1261
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:46,460
Thank you
