His research interests live within behavior and public economics.

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,320
He investigates the role played by social norms and particular psychological traits on

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:27,040
activities that are economically relevant for public policy and business strategy.

More recently, he's been working on the role of reciprocity in the interaction between

33
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:39,120
special interest groups and politicians, the effect of present bias preferences on procrastination,

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,480

Thank you.

58
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,000
We can just get going.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,800
Well, I feel humbled.

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,720
So I'm going to let one of y'all start.

61
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:52,240
Well, you know, what puzzles me continuously in traveling around the world is that the

62
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,480
United States seems to be out of step with many countries, other countries in the world,

63
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,720
such as the Nordic countries where there is a high employment rate amongst women.

64
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,160
So what comments might you have on that?

65
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,480
Well, I attended a conference recently where one of the participants addressed that issue

66
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:26,600
and mentioned that some of the social democratic policies that have affected women in the workforce

67
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:33,120
in the Nordic countries essentially emerged when some of the Nordic countries were concerned

68
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,200
about the influence of immigrants on their economy.

69
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:44,760
So essentially, some of those policies emerged essentially to keep the labor force more Swedish

70
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,880
or Norwegian or whatever.

71
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:56,280
So while we can look at those policies and admire them, I think that it reminds us that

72
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,000
for any kind of assessment of what's happening to women in the labor force or women in the

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,920
workforce or women in social relationships in general, that we have to look at a number

74
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,280
of different factors.

75
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,520
We have to look at the social, the legal, the economic, the behavioral, the psychological.

76
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,280
Since, by training, I'm a sociologist and do study diversity in the labor force, including

77
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,280
race, ethnicity, gender, and other kinds of differences.

78
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:39,840
I did, I'm fairly familiar with the, at least the research findings for the US, not as much

79
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,880
the research findings around the world, although when we're talking about women in the labor

80
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:52,040
force, particularly in advanced countries, it looks pretty much the same.

81
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,720
So let me just mention a couple things and then maybe that can spark some of the conversation.

82
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,680
There's a very good book that just came out fairly recently called Documenting De-Segregation

83
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:13,680
that analyzed the data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1966 through 2005

84
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,680
and looking particularly at the issues of what has happened since the passage of the

85
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:25,800
civil rights movement to segregation for various kinds of groups from white men in the labor

86
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,120
force in the US.

87
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:37,640
And the big story there is that much less has changed than we probably assume.

88
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:46,720
The biggest story of the stories in that book is that essentially white men have retained

89
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,360
their access to the best jobs at the same proportion that they had when the civil rights

90
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,280
movement was passed and in some cases in some types of occupations and industries they've

91
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,680
actually enhanced their access to those types of jobs.

92
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:10,040
So that the access for women of various types and minorities in the labor force have both

93
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:17,280
basically come from growth of jobs at the lower end of the distribution in terms of

94
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,000
authority income, etc. or in the public sector because these data are all for private sector

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,960
organizations.

96
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:32,640
The second finding was that although there was a slight decline in the segregation between

97
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,920
white men and black men from about 1966 to about 1980, small change.

98
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,560
Something has happened since 1980.

99
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,960
It's basically been flat in terms of the desegregation of black men from white men.

100
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:53,360
The desegregation of black women from white men never changed much.

101
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,560
It was very high.

102
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,200
It stayed very high.

103
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,720
Slight, slight shift but basically no change.

104
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,000
For white women from white men there has been somewhat more of a change.

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,280
It was slow to start.

106
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,280
It accelerated a bit through the 70s and 80s but basically trailed off about 2000 and has

107
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,800
not changed much since then.

108
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,920
While some white women have entered jobs that previously were held only by white men, it

109
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,160
has contributed to a resegregation between white women and black women in terms of the

110
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
jobs that they hold.

111
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,400
But even with the advances that white women have made in the labor force, essentially

112
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:46,920
they are now almost at parity with black men in terms of the proportion working in the

113
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,320
same jobs as white men.

114
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,520
Even if you look only at managerial jobs, again white men's over representation has

115
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,880
been absolutely not changed since the civil rights movement.

116
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,800
In other words, under representation has declined to some extent but again they are

117
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,520
still almost but not quite at the level of their representation in the labor force.

118
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:22,040
Black men and black women, there has been almost no change in terms of their representation

119
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,520
in managerial jobs.

120
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:31,800
Professional jobs, same story although white women doing slightly better in terms of their

121
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,320
representation and in craft jobs, essentially same story.

122
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,960
So white men still dominate the best jobs.

123
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,880
Over the last 50 years there has been advances for white women.

124
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,960
There have been modest changes for black men and black women but not much for the last

125
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,200
35 years since about 1980.

126
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,440
So I think that that's something to keep in mind when we're talking about what is happening

127
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,320
and why those dynamics haven't changed more than we would anticipate it.

128
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,240
That deals with the situation as it is.

129
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:16,680
It doesn't deal with why that situation has become so.

130
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,040
Why do white men still dominate those managerial positions?

131
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,120
Well, I do have an answer for that.

132
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,760
Let me give mine very quickly and then I'll turn it over to others.

133
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,040
The book that is sitting on the table out there that I recently published is really focused

134
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:44,200
on racial inequality but I think it is related to issues of gender inequality as well.

135
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,360
So my explanation for why there hasn't been more change in terms of equality in general

136
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,400
since the passage of the civil rights movement is because all of the focus has been on issues

137
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,240
of discrimination and racism or sexism.

138
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,960
Essentially framing everything in a negative way.

139
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,880
What bad things whites do toward blacks or what bad things men do toward women.

140
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,080
So again discrimination, racism, sexism.

141
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:25,600
But I think in the post civil rights period and it affects women as well as racial minorities,

142
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,240
but most of the action has been in terms of whites helping each other, whites helping

143
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,840
other whites or men helping other men.

144
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,440
And those kinds of things are not illegal.

145
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,880
Discrimination is illegal but giving favor to people who are like you is not illegal.

146
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:53,000
So while some public policy issues have focused on the discrimination against women, there's

147
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,440
been very little attention on how men keep hiring other men and promoting them and paying

148
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,520
them more and so on.

149
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,640
And same thing in terms of whites hiring other whites and giving them higher salaries and

150
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,960
more authority and better jobs and more promotions and so on.

151
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:16,040
Let me just add to that that I think there is something that everybody continues to neglect.

152
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,040
And that's the women that hurt other women.

153
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,480
It is a huge issue that I've seen in the workplace.

154
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,320
Not where I work now, but I'm just saying in general with people, I remember in 1998 Gloria

155
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Steinem was speaking at Union Square and I was younger then.

156
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,160
And I had read Revolution from Within, I had been working at ABC Television and I was the

157
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,440
last person who got to ask a question and she was launching a new magazine.

158
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,720
You know, just kind of about a lot of these different issues and women in the workplace

159
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
and things like that.

160
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,600
And I raised my hand and I said, with all due respect, you prepared me in how I could

161
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,600
choose to deal with discrimination, sexism, all these things.

162
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,400
I feel like I've been given a voice as someone who's going forward in my career.

163
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,840
What we haven't addressed is the fact that I think women in many respects are our own

164
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,480
worst enemies at work.

165
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,240
I think the fact remains that part of the sexism and things like that is the perception

166
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,800
that women are highly emotional, that they get into these other dialogues that have

167
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,440
nothing to do with the work at hand.

168
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:38,280
They are more inclined to suck up to men thinking that that will give them an advantage rather

169
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,520
than promoting the woman sitting next to them that is equally intelligent and qualified.

170
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:49,360
And until women start embracing other women in the workplace, they're all pitted against

171
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
each other.

172
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,320
So what does that mean?

173
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,240
No one supports each other so that if a second job comes up, that person has pretty much

174
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,480
been tarnished in a certain way and a man is free to get on in that spot.

175
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,600
I mean, this is just a theory I have from watching and learning and talking to people,

176
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:16,120
and I think it's something that people are forgetting to address and is incredibly important.

177
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,120
So I think that as women, we do have to take some responsibility as well.

178
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:30,600
That's actually very consistent with the research on discrimination, which doesn't necessarily

179
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,880
show that women are worse than or are tougher than other women, but they certainly don't,

180
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,040
let's say, help.

181
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:47,040
So both men and women tend to discriminate at the similar rates when it comes to promotions

182
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,480
and things like this.

183
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,520
And the reasons for that, I mean, there could be many, but it's certainly something that

184
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
you see.

185
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,720
You don't see a very strong favor.

186
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,280
It is between women.

187
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,520
This is for top jobs.

188
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,800
And that's a very important point to make, that there's been enormous strides in labor

189
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,680
for participation and things like this, but it's important to think of the role of women

190
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,800
in the labor force, not just overall, but thinking of the top positions where the situation

191
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,000
looks very different, where there hasn't been as much progress, and coming somewhat to

192
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,760
this point about different countries, these can actually vary a lot.

193
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,000
So some countries that might look very well on overall statistics, actually for the top

194
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,160
jobs might not look so well.

195
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,120
And it's not necessarily the same type of policies that would help women get promoted

196
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:48,560
to the top jobs than the ones that would help just women go out and get some job.

197
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,640
So that's something that still needs to learn more about.

198
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,080
Other countries, for example, like the Netherlands has great statistics when it comes to labor

199
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,200
for participation.

200
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,640
And so that's driven by a lot of part-time work.

201
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,240
It's driven by a lot of work at lower positions.

202
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,600
So in top positions, you see a lot of discrimination.

203
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,560
So it varies a lot.

204
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,080
I thought you were going to go somewhere else in response to the comments.

205
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,880
And I'm not sure I agree with you, and I'm not sure the data support, what you've just

206
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
said.

207
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,600
But with a couple caveats.

208
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,640
It is the case that men and women, whites and blacks are, for the most part, similarly

209
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,800
affected by the cultural messages and experiences that we all have.

210
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:48,200
So for example, when the distribution of resources overlays categorical differences.

211
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,600
So for example, most CEOs are white men.

212
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:59,200
And then cognitively, when we see that over and over again, we come to assume cognitively

213
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,360
that the people in those kinds of positions deserve to have them.

214
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,040
That's called status expectations theory.

215
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,640
And it's been demonstrated in a number of different ways.

216
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,040
So those kinds of messages we all share.

217
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,640
And if you look at implicit associations or implicit association tests, men and women

218
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,720
are so similarly affected by those kinds of messages.

219
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:33,480
But it isn't the case, I think, that having the representation of women in higher level

220
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,640
jobs wouldn't be beneficial in terms of hiring more women in general.

221
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,200
In fact, I think that there is some research that showed at least limited research that

222
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,800
when women, for example, in law firms, if women are represented in top level positions

223
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:55,320
in law firms, then they're more likely to hire other women in those firms compared to

224
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
men.

225
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,600
But where I thought you were going is what's called the double bind for women, which is

226
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,800
that because of these cognitive associations in our heads, we associate being a good manager,

227
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,280
being a good leader with being a male.

228
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,480
And so when we think manager, we think male.

229
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,160
And so women who enact the behaviors that we think of as being a good manager or a good

230
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:30,920
leader are thought of as not being sufficiently female or feminine in their behavior.

231
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,360
And so they're thought of as competent but not nice.

232
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,240
And if they enact the more feminine role of being emotional and nice and caring and so

233
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,080
on, then their thought about as being nice but not competent.

234
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,680
And that trade-off doesn't exist for men.

235
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,600
Men can be both competent and nice.

236
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,520
In fact, they are thought of as that way when they're in top leadership positions, but it

237
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,000
isn't the case for women.

238
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,440
So if women face that double bind and they are having to walk that narrow line, then

239
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,360
their behaviors in those roles may be somewhat different than men because women are having

240
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,400
to address other kinds of issues about how they're perceived and how they get evaluated.

241
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,640
So even they may be subject to those kinds of messages.

242
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,600
So if they are in a position to select someone for a job, they also may perceive a woman

243
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:38,120
as being competent but not nice or nice but not competent and also feel that they should

244
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,440
hire the man because he seems to have the traits that are the whole package.

245
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,480
The whole package, right.

246
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:56,200
But visiting that, how do you change that sort of cognitive perception that you have?

247
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:03,240
To me, that sort of change would take more than a generation, take several generations

248
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,880
of thinking in that way.

249
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,440
So it's a very difficult situation.

250
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:16,000
Well, I've had that question addressed particularly with regard to my book on racial inequality

251
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
a lot.

252
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,480
So what do you do if whites help other whites?

253
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,280
And they act with favor toward other whites and it's not really discrimination and racism.

254
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,800
Well the first answer to that is it's not an individual solution.

255
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,320
It's not something that you can do simply by changing your own behavior.

256
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,000
It's really a collective solution.

257
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,680
It's a public policy solution.

258
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,280
It's a social movement solution.

259
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:47,320
But short of that, you can also have organizational policies that change if organizations have

260
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,880
more accountability for the kinds of decisions that get made.

261
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,120
That can make a difference.

262
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,080
And then individual people can make a difference.

263
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,160
But to do so, they can't just try to be better.

264
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:08,920
The research tends to show that they have to be explicit about these cultural biases

265
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,160
that they hold and make them salient.

266
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,040
And when they do that, they're less likely to enact the kind of cultural biases that

267
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,640
would lead to giving favor to men over women.

268
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,840
So those are some of the kinds of things that could be done.

269
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,920
One thing that's not emphasized enough I think is a lot of this is put in a way that seems

270
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:36,800
to be like we should favor women in some way.

271
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,560
And organizations you can think they don't want to do that because they might be worried

272
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,800
that you will hurt their performance, that they will be just a political correctness type

273
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
of thing.

274
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,600
And it should be much more emphasized that that's not the case.

275
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:00,880
That actually even unknowingly if your organization, this favoritism or some sort of discrimination,

276
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,040
you are actually hurting your organization because you're not promoting the most qualified

277
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
people.

278
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:13,200
And that message should be out there so that let's say men, which are the ones that hold

279
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,400
now the top positions, start to worry more about and say we should actually worry about

280
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,160
these associations, these stereotypes that exist about what is a good leader.

281
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:32,360
And so we try to be much more objective about there's lots of evidence that show that women

282
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,840
perform equally if not better sometimes that men in many, many managerial positions but

283
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,360
the stereotype might still be that the man is the, or the qualities that are associated

284
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,960
with men are the ones that you want as leaders which is not necessarily the case.

285
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:55,320
But if we come back to the differences between the United States and for example will take

286
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,480
the Nordic countries.

287
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:06,880
Aren't there policies in those countries that the United States or women as a whole strive

288
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:17,240
towards for instance the type of leave they have, the existence of public funded daycare

289
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,040
centers and things of that nature.

290
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,960
Yeah certainly those kinds of policies make a huge difference is that in the Nordic countries

291
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,360
and in Europe more so than in the US or England I guess.

292
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:38,160
Having paid childcare for some period of time makes it easier to manage the work family

293
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:46,320
issues than the other, you know they have similar laws about non-discrimination and

294
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:55,320
so on but give more support for women who might have responsibility for children and

295
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,840
families or elder care and so on.

296
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,720
The other thing that I believe the Nordic countries have done, I don't know for sure

297
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,280
but I know some European countries and I think it's the Nordic countries have mandated a

298
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,440
certain proportion of representation on their boards of directors.

299
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
That's right.

300
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
I think 30%.

301
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
40%.

302
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:23,680
So the assumption there is that if you have representation of women in these positions

303
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:31,200
that then the policies in the firms will be less likely to be discriminatory or at least

304
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,880
will be more likely to be fair and the research on those kinds of issues of which there is

305
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:47,040
some emerging tend to show that there isn't a direct clear relationship between that kind

306
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:57,000
of representation and better performance but at least there is no evidence to suggest

307
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,160
that that kind of representation leads to lesser performance.

308
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,080
So it's not the case that's coming.

309
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,400
The changes are a little very recent so you would expect that at the beginning there might

310
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,720
be a shorter qualified woman to fill all these positions because the demand didn't exist

311
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:23,320
and now as years pass and then more and more women get.

312
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,960
There is something that let's say I see in my research or what I'm interested in my research

313
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,720
is this idea that if you think you're not going to be promoted you're not going to

314
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,800
work as hard to get those promotions.

315
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,800
So differences that look like maybe the man looks like he's performing a little bit better

316
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,800
was because he has better incentives to work hard.

317
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,040
Like this idea with the boards if suddenly you know that 40% of the board will be female

318
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:57,760
now there's going to be some woman that will start to think and say well if I want to be

319
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,360
a member of the board I need to do this five things and then get the necessary qualifications

320
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:13,120
and as this happens then my hope or my prediction will be that performance will get better after

321
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,840
you get enough qualified women.

322
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,720
But the comment that you made about if you think you're not going to be promoted you

323
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:31,360
don't work as hard is an anthema to a woman's ability to be promoted isn't promotion dependent

324
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,720
on performance so if you don't perform well then you're not going to get promoted.

325
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:44,920
It's a cycle right and that's the problem this is why it's so hard to break because if you

326
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,600
think you're not going to get promoted you're not going to work as hard so then you're not

327
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,920
going to get promoted because you're not as good as the equivalent male but you cannot

328
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:59,520
change only one side you cannot you need to change both sides for this to break the

329
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,360
conversation makes it sound like promotions and other kinds of choices like this are based

330
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:12,560
on merit and we know that is not the case that it is centrally based on who knows or supports

331
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,880
or is sponsoring whom and the fact that there are any number of people who might be thought

332
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,320
of as qualified so it's not the best person it's the one who has the right connections

333
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:31,680
the right people the right place in the right time and in general if white men are in the

334
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,000
decision making positions they will tend to hire other white men or promote them or give

335
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,280
them raises and so on and that's that's true actually throughout the labor force not just

336
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:51,480
at the top and it's very consequential let me give you an example that was very interesting

337
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:58,080
to me about a year and a half ago I was invited to attend a conference that was sponsored

338
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:06,000
by a major company fortune 100 company that wanted to have business school faculty do

339
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,760
a better job of admitting and training and graduating minority students because they

340
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,880
wanted to be able to hire them and they thought if they could influence the faculty they would

341
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,280
do a better job with the students so the CEO of this company came to this little conference

342
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:30,720
of about 30 people and gave an impassioned plea about the importance of diversity to

343
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,240
the survival of his firm he said that like many firms 75 percent of their profits and

344
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,080
the growth of the company was coming from outside the United States he said that people

345
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,720
had to learn to work with people whose names they couldn't pronounce and that in general

346
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:54,640
that the firm would not survive if middle management didn't become more representative of the

347
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:04,440
world and so on and so in this discussion I posed to him the issue about implicit bias

348
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,360
that so many people have heard about about unconscious bias the fact that we have these

349
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:14,200
cognitive messages in our heads he knew all about that he had brought one of the key researchers

350
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:20,080
from Harvard into talk to the top management of the firm he knew all about trying to get

351
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,680
rid of implicit bias and yet at dinner that night I learned from one of the HR directors

352
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:36,560
that that firm rewarded people in the company who recommended people they later hired so

353
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:42,400
he was supposedly wanted to increase the diversity of middle management but middle management

354
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,040
was disproportionately white men and so if they recommended people it was going to be

355
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:55,560
other white men and so his whole framework about bias was bias against he wanted to get

356
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:02,520
rid of the bias against people and gave no attention to the fact that in his firm continually

357
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:09,000
there was bias for whites hiring other whites and so he thought the survival of his firm

358
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,160
depended on having a more diverse labor force and yet they had policies in this firm which

359
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,840
were reproducing the system labor force. If I can also go back to the comment about a

360
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:27,200
woman who perceives rightly or wrongly that someone a male white male black male even

361
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,880
just a male is going to be promoted so they kind of just laws that become laws like there

362
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:42,680
I have to disagree I feel like there are a lot of women that work even harder when they

363
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:48,200
see that situation I feel like that's been our MO is that we have to to prove ourselves

364
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,320
and everything else but we're still not getting that job or that managerial position or that

365
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:05,920
CEO level you know I think that it's a real problem when people perceive women is giving

366
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,800
up or just going to accept the status quo because I really don't know any woman that

367
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:19,680
does that on any level willingly there's a difference in how they've been raised or the

368
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,960
values or their own self-esteem and I think self-esteem does play in a immense role in

369
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,400
this as well I think in those situations that you're talking about a lot of women because

370
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,040
they've either been rejected or they feel like they've been passed up or whatever their

371
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,760
self-esteem becomes smaller and smaller and so they don't demand what they deserve and

372
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:47,880
I don't think that's addressed men don't seem to engage in these same types of dialogues

373
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:56,440
at least in the people that I've observed if anything their ego is often inflated it's

374
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:03,400
true and so they don't they don't second guess themselves all the time I mean I speak

375
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,560
when at least in my line of work women are always coming back and kind of second guessing

376
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,440
one so I have right that it is like this perfectionist thing and men are just kind of like it is

377
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,240
what it is let's move on what's the next witness you know it's it's like this thing and I think

378
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:24,920
some of that is based on how we're groomed to to think about ourselves as women and I

379
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,320
also want to get back to the point I think you mean an excellent excellent observation

380
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:36,200
I'm just curious how you all would view yourselves in your work careers are you the nice incompetent

381
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:45,480
one or you the one who's um can I swear bitch from hell but like gets it done like

382
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,640
you know I'm just curious and where has that gone for you because I can say it for me

383
00:33:51,640 --> 00:34:00,520
I've grown I used to start out in pantsuits and things like that being kind of what I perceived

384
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,760
you know was the right track and then I said you know what I'm a woman and like I'm gonna

385
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:14,200
wear makeup and I'm gonna you know wear heels and I'm gonna you know not wear hose sometimes in

386
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,800
court and I'm gonna wear pink I'm gonna wear blue I'm gonna be who I am and I've seen how that's

387
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,680
worn out for me I'm just curious if either one of you has ever identified with one of those

388
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:35,480
I just want to raise a point about something you said that we all know that you're not promoted

389
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,960
because of what you do it's who you know and that that's generalizing though because there are

390
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:48,040
situations well there are a lot of situations and they are careers for instance in science

391
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:55,960
that's promotion depends on what you have achieved your ability to do it good or bad

392
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:04,120
positive or negative and it doesn't depend at all on who you might know in the department

393
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:10,760
and I know that because we have traveled so much and I have gone to various institutes

394
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:19,560
oftentimes not knowing anyone at all and it's only on a CV that your position and your salary

395
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,680
is estimated it doesn't depend on who you know or

396
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:34,440
that's that's a wonderful that's a wonderful setup for my response because of course a lot

397
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,040
of the research I've done are on scientists and engineers and my research does not show

398
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:49,800
what you have just said I did a study of 24 major multi-billion dollar US companies in different

399
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:57,160
parts of the country with 3200 scientists and engineers and we had data on their career experiences

400
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,440
and then we also had the evaluation of their managers and in the analyses that we did

401
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:10,440
we looked at two different kinds of outcomes one was their evaluation as being innovative

402
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,120
which is a key thing for scientists and engineers and the other thing was their evaluation

403
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:24,680
as promotable into management and among other factors controlling for all the kinds of things

404
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:31,960
that you think you should control for we looked at their access to favorable work experiences

405
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,920
which in science and engineering is being able to choose your own work as opposed to having

406
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:44,120
someone assign it to you and we found in that analysis that US-born white men were more likely

407
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,920
than other groups to be able to choose their own work and what's called access to technical

408
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:56,040
control and then over and above their access to these favorable work experiences they also got

409
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,560
higher evaluations on innovativeness and higher evaluations on promoted,

410
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:09,240
promoted into management, net of patents, net of publications, net of their education,

411
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,640
net of their years of experience so essentially US-born white men were getting the benefit of the doubt

412
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:23,240
and they were getting favorable experiences that affected their evaluation as being more

413
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:31,560
qualified and then also more likely to be promoted into management so even in science and engineering

414
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:38,040
where you think that there's a very hardened fast kind of measurement of merit they're simply

415
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:46,040
isn't and certainly in any university that is quite evident you can take any one's qualifications

416
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,800
and they can be interpreted in a number of different ways I've been on the faculty for

417
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:59,480
I think about 40 years now I've been tenured for a long time set on many many personnel committees

418
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:05,560
and the bar gets raised or lowered depending on who the candidate is and who in the room wants to

419
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,320
be favorable toward that person and you can fight against it and you can raise all kinds of questions

420
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:16,760
about merit but you know you can't finesse zero if the person has done nothing then you can't do

421
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:22,360
much but no one for the most part is in that situation everyone has done something and then

422
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,160
depending on whose friends with whom the case can get presented as the best things in sliced

423
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:36,200
bread or it can be sort of just not good enough you know needs to go somewhere else because

424
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:44,280
it doesn't meet our standards I suppose the difference is the type of science that you're

425
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:52,920
in you're involved in because I was in biological science and the fact that I never

426
00:38:52,920 --> 00:39:01,880
aspired to a management role in fact I couldn't because we moved so much but certainly my CV

427
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:08,920
or curriculum VITA made a difference and the papers I'd published and the research that I had done

428
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:14,360
did contribute towards the position that I was able to get.

429
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:20,680
Yeah that's true for everyone certainly patents and publications had a positive effect but the

430
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:28,200
issue is net of that controlling for that US white men still got the benefit of the doubt and

431
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,680
they got favorable assignments. Well I can see that might be the outcome. My data included you

432
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:41,320
know electronic and biology and chemistry and every type of science so it was not limited to a

433
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:47,160
certain field. Did you do one in law? I didn't do the work in law but there are lots and lots

434
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,360
of research on lawyers and they tend to show the same thing. Really? Oh absolutely. Okay.

435
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,280
I think one issue to think about here is

436
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:08,120
like to think yeah generally we tend to separate and say well output is really publications and

437
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:13,720
patents and for scientists and engineers. But if you really think about output it is not just

438
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:21,480
those two things but it's also networking and that's like part of your production of not just

439
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,320
science but in many other positions. There we see some clear differences in the type of networks

440
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:36,760
that say that white males might have and that women might have but part of that in a way I think it's

441
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,360
is the way they go about building their network. I mean it's not like it's not determined that

442
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,800
the social networks are the way they are. You can work on networking and that's where you see

443
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,160
ment and to network more than the women do. And women don't have time to network.

444
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:01,480
They might not. Yes. Working full time and taking care of families. Exactly. And those differences

445
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:08,360
let's say are but that's where I think that if there's a change of incentives at the top

446
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:17,000
the incentive to network might also change. And then you might if some cultural changes like the

447
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,640
man who takes care of the kids at home you have more time you can start networking and then

448
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:28,600
some of this difference is my my go away. Yeah let me mention that just these issues about how

449
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:34,840
you evaluate competence and whether one can do it on objective criteria or not really was underlined

450
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:41,480
for me this year because as vice dean for faculty and research I'm in charge of personnel issues.

451
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:48,440
So I have to oversee all the tenure and promotion decisions. And we had this year two cases in

452
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,760
the same department one white male one woman who happened to be European born who were both

453
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:02,520
coming up for promotion. And our appointments and promotions committee raved about him and said

454
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:09,880
you know this is such a clear case for someone who deserves promotion. And on her case there was

455
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:17,560
they're saying they're not quite enough she's not really ready etc. They both had

456
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,560
almost identical citations they had almost the same number of

457
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:31,400
published papers in good journals if anything I think hers were were more over her career.

458
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:37,800
She was on a major editorial board he was on an editorial board of a journal no one had ever

459
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:44,440
heard of and yet this committee represented his editorial board membership as being on a journal

460
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,360
which was not the one he was actually on. They simply substituted the name of a top journal instead

461
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:55,800
of the one that actually he was on. And you know this kind of stuff happens all the time and if

462
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,040
you don't have people who are paying attention to how these criteria get weighted and evaluated

463
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:13,720
then you will reproduce these kinds of inequalities. I made first of all I sent the report back to

464
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,360
the appointments and promotions committee and said you don't have the right name in the journal

465
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:27,320
here and then I because as vice dean I got to write the dean's report of course I you know tried

466
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:33,000
to write an equitable case now as it turns out he has been promoted we're still waiting to hear

467
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,120
about her so. Can we get back to networking because I think there is a difference in networking as

468
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:45,320
a woman and networking as a man. There's a no matter what if you're in a room full of people in the

469
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:52,680
industry or whatever and as a woman you approach a man who's in power. There is a observation by

470
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:58,920
people there's a sexual component to it there's all these other pressures and and things that go

471
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,880
into it versus the guys hanging out in the back and being the guys and I think a lot of times

472
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:11,720
I've heard a situations where men feel very uncomfortable just you know either having that

473
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:17,000
dinner or networking or having that follow-up conversation or whatever and I think that in some

474
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,600
sense that does hold women back in a way you disagree but I well it could also work the other

475
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,360
way let's face it it can go either way but the whole point is is that networking I think is

476
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:37,400
different for men and women and how you go about that and how it's perceived in everything else and

477
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:43,560
I also think that in science maybe networking isn't everything and perception isn't everything

478
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:49,080
but at least in the industries I've been in I would say that's 50 percent everybody's you know

479
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,640
at different levels obviously it's going to be behind you know between you know two different

480
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:01,720
people of kind of the same level but the perception and if this is someone that you can hang out with

481
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:07,160
and go have a drink with after work and all these other dynamics play a huge part not not in what

482
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,800
you're delivering it's extremely important again the research shows exactly what you're saying that

483
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,320
networking is not the same for men and women and not the same for whites and non-whites essentially

484
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:25,160
women and non-whites have to borrow social capital from white men yes in order to do as well but

485
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:34,120
and it's also there are also some research to show that it is more difficult to have the kind of

486
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:42,920
mentoring relationship between a female subordinate and a male superior because of this romance it

487
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,480
looks like a date as opposed to a professional relationship yes and then all your colleagues

488
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:54,920
are looking at it is that she's getting ahead not because she has merit and credence but because

489
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:03,880
favors of favoritism and so it's very difficult to walk that balance which is partly why it's so

490
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,480
important to have representation of women in the top level decision-making jobs as well because it

491
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:16,280
helps mitigate that issue to some extent one of the key things that I found in the research that I

492
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:22,920
did for my book which included detailed job histories for whites in several different parts of the

493
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:30,840
country between ages of 25 and 55 I found that 70 percent of the jobs that people got over their

494
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:37,400
lifetimes was because they got help from somebody because they got information other people didn't

495
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,880
have they had influence used on their behalf or they had someone who actually could offer them a

496
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:49,080
job or an opportunity so 70 percent of the time people had that kind of help and the jobs where

497
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:54,520
you didn't have the help was as one of my interviewees said when one job is as bad as another you

498
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:01,960
don't have to draw on social capital to get a job because you know anybody can get it but when I

499
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,920
asked the people that I interviewed so what do you think most contributed to your having the kind

500
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,400
of life you have now they all said because I worked hard because I was smart because I got an

501
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:17,800
education because I did whatever so they although they actively drew from this kind of social

502
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:24,920
connections they all individualized their success and thought they did it on their own I think that's

503
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,880
another thing that's important is that women want to do it on their own I mean I know I was in an

504
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:37,720
industry where my family well after the fact got very connected quit that job went to law school

505
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:44,280
went were no one of my family is and I think that that's very important in terms of knowing

506
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,880
and I'm not saying that I didn't have other things in my favor I mean I was well educated I came

507
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,720
from a nice family you know I had other things going for me but I think that for women to get

508
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,800
forward they need to believe in themselves and know why they got there there are plenty of women

509
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:05,560
that I have heard from that are like well the only reason I got it is because my uncles you know

510
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:10,440
whatever that never really kind of move forward or know their own worth or anything else because

511
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:17,400
they just kind of relied on those wings I mean I think that's important for women to work on

512
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:23,080
themselves I mean I do think there is a lot of work for women to do on themselves as well and

513
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,320
there are conversations that we need to be having with each other and supporting each other and

514
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:33,880
this goes back to my theory that nobody else really is but I think that there is a great resource

515
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:42,840
in the in the in the workplace of women sharing with women and empowering other women and looking

516
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:49,160
at you know the intelligence and the beauty and the and the potential and being happy for other

517
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:55,800
women I think that is counterintuitive to most women most women are in a competitive they feel

518
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,840
like it's them against someone else I know you disagree I am so stunned just

519
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:09,640
because you're standing yes okay okay now I understand okay let me let me support your comment for a

520
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,920
minute well she can support and research let me just say I'm not a research person I I prosecute

521
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,920
cases I deal with people who kill people like I'm a homicide I have no research but I have everyday

522
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:26,360
experience not as much as many people not as much but I also make the observations in the comments

523
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:31,560
that I think a lot of people feel that nobody does make and nobody bothers to research this is a very

524
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,760
uncomfortable area women don't want to hear they want to believe that women you know we're the

525
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:43,160
victims we need to be empowered and okay no no but I'm saying I hear this a lot that we're somehow

526
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,800
being repressed or this whether it be sex all of that is true but there is a great potential for

527
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:56,120
women to get together and really embrace each other I'm sorry I actually asked a bunch of people

528
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:02,760
at work this for a couple years I'm like what is the deal what is the deal in this office why can't

529
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,960
we say instead of the catie remark can you believe this can you believe that can you believe the

530
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:15,880
man she's networking with can you believe all of that is just contributing to the fact that we're

531
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:23,480
not uplifting each other and I think it's a real problem that needs to be equally I so let me say

532
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:30,360
first of all that I don't think in general that your observation is correct that in general I think

533
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:35,880
the more representation of women and decision-making positions the better off other women in the

534
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:42,600
organization will be and that well there may be the occasional catie remark I don't think that that's

535
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:48,600
general representation of what happens when women enter the labor force but the place where there is

536
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:55,960
some support for what you are observing can be found for example in work that Rosa Beth Moss-Cantar

537
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:04,040
who's currently at Harvard did years ago where she was looking at the structure of women's jobs

538
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:09,800
compared to the structure of men's jobs and she observed several different kinds of things first

539
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:15,640
of all that women were more likely to be in jobs that had access to fewer resources than the jobs

540
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:22,200
that men had and when you have access to fewer resources then you might hoard them and be less

541
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:29,720
likely to share right and then the second thing she observed was that men's jobs were likely to be

542
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:36,840
in the types of jobs that had ladders to better jobs whereas women's jobs were more likely to be

543
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:45,000
in ladders that didn't go anywhere and so men had more opportunity and had links to those opportunities

544
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,840
whereas women's jobs did not and then she also looked at the observation of the when women were

545
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:58,120
in a minority that certain kinds of things happened in terms of how people address them like it

546
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:05,000
tickly if there's only a very small proportion of women in the that work setting and she observed

547
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,080
that particularly when there was a small group of women and it seemed that only a few women could

548
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:16,520
get ahead then under those circumstances each woman might think that they're competing with

549
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,720
the other one because only one will get the job it wasn't a general experience it's mostly men

550
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,360
but occasionally a woman gets through and I'm going to be the one to do it so under those kinds of

551
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,720
circumstances you may observe the kind of behavior that you're talking about but I don't think it's a

552
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:39,880
general experience when you're talking about broader representation in the labor of the ballot

553
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,160
because that's the working environment that you would see I've always experienced and that many

554
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:50,600
women experience and I don't want to not have a voice or not have a way to express that because

555
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:55,880
I'm in a particular area and I'm not the general I guarantee I'll never be in the general you know

556
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:02,520
like it's just it's something that I think but even but even in law firms that there's some research

557
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:09,800
by Robin Ealy from Harvard who looked at law firms and found that when there were more women

558
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:16,840
partners then there's more chance that a woman will be hired in that firm compared to when there

559
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:22,120
are no women partners even with women in lower level positions then I would agree there'll be

560
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:29,720
different dynamics but don't you think it is a combination of things that result in a woman

561
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:38,040
and not maybe not general but certainly specifically in women getting ahead that you do need people

562
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:46,840
at some stage you may not realize it overtly as someone helping you and then the woman herself

563
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:56,120
has to have a diversion or a passion for a particular application so it's a combination of

564
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:05,400
someone who wants to do something and also someone who may want to help and most times women

565
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:14,120
well in my own case it's been men who've helped me get along so that it doesn't necessarily need

566
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:20,840
to be the one thing or the other well again most women will be helped by men because men are the

567
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:28,200
decision makers disproportionately but with women in positions of decision making they are probably

568
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:37,880
more likely to recognize and call to attention the issues of women's competence as well and

569
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:47,320
women are likely to do well but that's the problem of really telling about that that effect is it's

570
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:54,120
very hard right and because law firms let's say they have more women at the top are also law firms

571
00:54:54,120 --> 00:55:00,760
where the men are different from the law firms where there's only men at the top so it could be

572
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:14,360
an effect for from both right well again the well not not just history I think that you could be a

573
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:21,640
little more specific again there's lots of different ways that one could address it but the one that

574
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:28,040
I think makes the most sense is again from what's called status construction theory or status

575
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:36,600
expectations theory that finds that when resources are distributed unequally and overlaid with

576
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:42,760
categorical differences among people like men versus women whites versus blacks and so on and so

577
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:50,760
when you observe men always in positions that have more authority more income more training more

578
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:58,440
education etc or whites in those kinds of positions then you come to assume that the people with the

579
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:05,880
resources are the ones who are both competent and worthy and this sort of research let me just say

580
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:13,880
because it sounds like it's just you know describing something that isn't real the research has not

581
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:21,800
been done on men versus women or blacks versus whites it's done on artificially constructed groups

582
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:28,120
artificially constructed categories like people might be called over estimators and under estimators

583
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:34,920
or people that like Paul Clay versus people that like Picasso so the this social psychological

584
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,840
research creates these distinctions and then give the people with these different distinctions

585
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:47,640
different amounts of resources and then they evaluate how they evaluate each other and again

586
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,960
they find that people with the most resources are the ones that are assumed to be more competent

587
00:56:52,680 --> 00:57:00,120
to be more worthy to get the benefit of the doubt and so on and so forth so even without real groups

588
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:07,560
you just artificially create the groups you have this cognitive outcome because we have a tendency

589
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:12,840
to want to think whatever is is right and therefore if those people are in charge it's because they

590
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:18,680
should be in charge and again we do that to ourselves and there's the and that effect is

591
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:24,840
multiplied by then let's say a young woman or a thinking of a career if they never see a woman

592
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:32,200
in say in engineering they might assume that or they implicitly they might think that men are better

593
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:40,120
that even though it's not true and and then again they don't get the proper training and then

594
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:45,400
later on yeah they won't be qualified for those jobs and there is variation across countries

595
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:52,680
these better models that if you have a good model let's say you have a mother who is working

596
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:59,960
and successful that that will lead you also to as a woman to work and become successful

597
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,960
the research does show that

598
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:10,440
the research shows that women need to see other women in areas and that two things women need

599
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:17,480
to see women in other areas so they have a whole lot of women in elementary school are being

600
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:24,920
discouraged from owning into mass and sciences okay so Israel which is the most techy country

601
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:24,920
world described conference on and they had a representation from IsraelComp Dre

602
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,960
and they were saying that in Israel they didn't have enough women for wills and

603
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,120
that women needs now what you do we don't see

604
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:49,620
now you don'tails it's

605
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,160
way to join

606
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,160
Women do mentor.

607
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,360
Oh, no, no, I agree.

608
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,360
I have a mother who's still working even though she should

609
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,440
retire a long time ago.

610
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,480
She'll work to the day she dies.

611
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,240
I have incredible women influences.

612
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,280
At work, I gravitate towards women mentors and everything

613
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,120
like that.

614
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,440
But most of the professional organizations,

615
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,640
I belong to right now, are the only ways some of us

616
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,680
have counted that as a group of women.

617
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,440
We have gone together.

618
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:20,940
Yes.

619
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:24,480
We have been very helpful with each other.

620
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:24,980
Yes.

621
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,480
We've started a separate women's group.

622
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:27,980
Wonderful.

623
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,320
We're not sacred.

624
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:29,820
OK.

625
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,560
We've been to a professional group that's

626
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,320
partnered with the other group.

627
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,320
And we get good, a woman will talk about her new idea.

628
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,320
We will be there.

629
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,960
But most of us are in the same profession.

630
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,000
I'm in the same profession with all these women.

631
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,280
I'm not competing.

632
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:44,800
Right.

633
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,200
I have enough.

634
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,600
So you really have to be, you're not going to get the

635
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,160
support from the guys at the male

636
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,560
dining professional organization.

637
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,560
I'm not going to change that culture.

638
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,200
I can create another culture.

639
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:58,840
Right.

640
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:03,120
And I guess in my job, that's what I'm trying to do.

641
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:07,000
And I've had these discussions over the years.

642
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,680
I'm in a very different kind of place.

643
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,080
But I've been in that different place

644
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,320
in three different careers.

645
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,560
So at least in my experience, there

646
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:19,840
are certain types of jobs where it's

647
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,160
hard to get the women to get on the same page.

648
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,320
I had an office many years ago in Staten Island.

649
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:25,840
Ooh.

650
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,840
And I had to go to social functions.

651
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,520
And I was told that I quote, in Staten Island, women

652
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,040
don't talk to men.

653
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,160
Men come up to talk to women.

654
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,560
So what I had to do was to work hard on many people.

655
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,320
I was very friendly.

656
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,760
We would talk to everybody.

657
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,800
It was strictly business.

658
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,880
It was strictly business.

659
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,640
It was not an end.

660
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,440
If I hadn't had lunch with a guy, I'd

661
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,280
read them.

662
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,440
Lunch.

663
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,240
Lunch.

664
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,440
And then I made it never to leave the women, the wives,

665
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,800
so that the boys would get to know the ANC.

666
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,000
Oh, I don't understand.

667
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,560
Is the solution that women have to get together

668
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,720
and create groups to counter men?

669
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,200
Is that what the solution is?

670
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,720
It's not the solution.

671
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,240
There are many solutions.

672
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:14,760
Again, solutions include collective behavior,

673
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,480
collective actions, social movements, public policy,

674
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:25,000
organizational policies, and individual behavior.

675
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,760
There is some controversy, if you will,

676
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,000
in terms of women in leadership roles.

677
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,400
Should women simply have leadership development

678
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,680
courses, or should they have courses that are specifically

679
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,920
for women in leadership?

680
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,080
And the research tends to show that both of those things help.

681
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:50,040
So that you need different kinds of social support,

682
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,160
for example.

683
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,200
You need some people who will be instrumentally helpful,

684
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,560
who are going to help you with job opportunities,

685
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,600
and with knowledge about certain kinds of things

686
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,080
happening in the profession.

687
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,160
And then you also need social support.

688
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,920
You need someone to validate your experience,

689
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,840
who is going to help you understand that it's not you,

690
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,800
that it's structurally related to factors

691
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:17,080
like how women get treated versus how men get treated.

692
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,280
I mean, one of the famous examples of that

693
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,200
was the study of the scientist at MIT,

694
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,000
is that one of the women, and I think she was in biology,

695
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,600
I'm trying to remember, just got fed up one day

696
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,880
with feeling somehow she wasn't getting the resources

697
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,400
that she wanted.

698
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,600
And so she went around, she measured, physically

699
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,840
measured everybody's office.

700
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,480
And then she, to see how many square feet each of the scientists

701
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,840
had in her area.

702
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,560
And she found the women had less square feet of office space

703
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,640
than the men.

704
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:57,080
And she got together with other women scientists at MIT,

705
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,800
and they began to talk among themselves about, well,

706
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,200
what's happening to you, and what's happening to you?

707
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,440
And they were finding out they were having very common

708
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,640
experiences, which they didn't know,

709
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,120
because there was only one of them in each department,

710
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,960
you know, a very small representation.

711
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:16,440
And then their efforts to put together some data

712
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,360
to show that, in fact, they weren't being treated the same way

713
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,800
the men were, was facilitated by the fact

714
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,160
that Lottie Bailin happened to be president of the Faculty

715
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,680
Senate at that time, who was someone

716
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,120
who had done research on these kinds of issues.

717
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:35,360
And therefore, she kind of fostered the attention

718
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,560
to their concerns.

719
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,120
And then it went to the president of the university

720
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,000
who then said, well, you know, you're right.

721
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,800
We haven't been treating women the same.

722
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,040
And they started making some changes.

723
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,480
So that suggests individuals doing things, groups,

724
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,240
offering social support, having the right people

725
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,760
in decision-making power, who can influence decisions.

726
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,720
And at the right time, it happened to be at MIT

727
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,160
when they had the resources, I guess, to make some changes.

728
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,000
And then it spread across the country.

729
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,920
Somebody made Lottie, I think, made sure it got into the New York

730
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,520
Times.

731
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:15,640
And then it was picked up by all kinds of other media

732
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,880
publications.

733
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,240
And then other universities started saying, well,

734
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,280
maybe we should look at what's happening to our women

735
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,240
scientists and so on.

736
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,160
So it didn't change everything, but it had an impact.

737
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,520
Ultimately, to really reach parity,

738
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,680
let's say, in the men have to be on board.

739
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,400
Otherwise, it's just not going to happen.

740
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:43,840
And coming down to issues about perception of the jobs

741
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:48,840
and family issues, if men don't pick up

742
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:53,240
the taking care of the kids, it would be impossible for women

743
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,840
to be in this really competitive profession.

744
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,640
Well, men aren't taking care of the kids.

745
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,520
Other women are taking care of the kids, for the most part.

746
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,600
But that's what I mean.

747
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,160
That's what I mean.

748
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,720
They need to fully participate.

749
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,320
Eventually, you need to get the men on board.

750
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,880
Also, because what you don't want, I think,

751
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:16,760
it's a mistake, is to try to fix it by making women look

752
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,080
like men.

753
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,760
And to me, that's a little self-defeating,

754
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:25,680
because then it's just going to destroy the diversity

755
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,000
and the good things of having both men and women

756
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,080
in top positions is that they are different.

757
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,160
They think different.

758
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:37,440
Otherwise, we will have parity, maybe at some point.

759
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,600
But they'll be all acting like men.

760
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,080
And that's not necessarily a good thing.

761
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,880
Like to go back to some of your points.

762
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,000
Men tend to be overconfident.

763
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:46,920
That's not good.

764
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,760
I mean, it might promote them in their careers,

765
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,720
but they're making their own decisions.

766
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,240
Yes.

767
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,920
I'm kidding.

768
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,200
It's pretend.

769
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,880
But I'll open it up for questions.

770
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:09,800
OK.

771
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,800
You have a comment on the question of science.

772
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,920
There was a panel discussion here a couple weeks ago

773
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,560
on that on women in science.

774
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,240
And they mentioned studies where papers were submitted

775
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,040
to journals or for grants.

776
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,360
And they had women's names or men's names on the paper.

777
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,000
And there was clear discrimination

778
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,720
in terms of just what names were on the paper.

779
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:37,000
Also, my question has to do with how much

780
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,520
does the fact that, as was mentioned,

781
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,400
that the responsibility for having

782
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,600
and raising children isn't shared equally responsible

783
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,400
for the problems.

784
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,960
And I wonder, I read that if you look at single women

785
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,000
without children, that their salaries are the same as men.

786
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,160
There isn't discrimination.

787
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:58,920
Is that true or not?

788
01:06:58,920 --> 01:06:59,920
No.

789
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,600
No.

790
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,800
What's the difference?

791
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,800
How much is it?

792
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,000
The 20% they always?

793
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,920
I don't remember the exact data,

794
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,480
but at every point of comparison, you

795
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,080
will still find that when you control for full-time work,

796
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:20,720
weeks worked, type of job, type of occupation, and so on,

797
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,840
that men are going to make more.

798
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,600
And that's true whether you're talking about single women

799
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,880
or women with children.

800
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,200
It tends to be the case that for each additional child,

801
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:34,520
women pay a penalty in terms of salary and such

802
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,320
in the workforce.

803
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:41,280
But even single women tend to be disadvantaged compared

804
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:41,720
to men.

805
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,560
Even male nurses make more money than female nurses

806
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,960
and so on.

807
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,280
So even in overwhelmingly female dominated positions,

808
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,720
men still benefit.

809
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,720
But not.

810
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,160
It's in the New York Times.

811
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:54,920
Yes.

812
01:07:54,920 --> 01:08:01,960
And there was some effort to say that between the ages of 25

813
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,760
and something rather than there was parity.

814
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:07,600
But that's a very narrow thing.

815
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,280
And the gap widens over time.

816
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,680
But not to say that it's not a very important component.

817
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,960
It's not a very important component.

818
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,920
The gap is true that there's still a gap once you're

819
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,080
going to account for these things.

820
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,080
But these things account for a lot of the gap.

821
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,600
Well, job segregation accounts for the most.

822
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,600
And then years of experience.

823
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:34,760
And then the evaluation of women's work versus men's work

824
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,600
and so on.

825
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,080
I was going to mention, as Lady mentioned,

826
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:40,440
Abrams.

827
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,960
And the big case now at the New York Times

828
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,760
is really serious to look at.

829
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,360
Because we're talking about salaries of $500, something,

830
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:52,360
$500, an over.

831
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:56,760
Salzberger actually hired this person himself.

832
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,560
This is the person he fired.

833
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,520
And she'd been with this paper for many, many years,

834
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:04,320
and many important managerial positions.

835
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:08,000
He was upset because she realized and did

836
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,840
her research about how much the former person in her CEO

837
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,640
position got.

838
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,080
And when she was the managerial position lower one,

839
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,960
how much money she was losing.

840
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:27,480
And also, she had, in her job description,

841
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,680
and her responsibilities, the right

842
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:37,640
to put a new person on as a co-manager or take somebody off.

843
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,200
The judgment is not about the work.

844
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:44,920
The judgment is about brusque or indiscriminate

845
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,680
or insensitive or something like that.

846
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,320
They don't use that with men when they're making the decisions.

847
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:55,600
So when she came to the boss's office with an attorney,

848
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,000
he was in shock.

849
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,040
How did she dare come to him with an attorney?

850
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,480
Why did she talk to him?

851
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,600
Because she did her homework.

852
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:07,080
And when they responded, I don't know if you read this whole case,

853
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:12,680
when they responded, the answer was,

854
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:16,600
you're not making $75,000 less.

855
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,160
The original salary, what we offered you, was $505.

856
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,320
And then when you said this one was getting $5.95,

857
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,280
we gave you $5.35.

858
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,400
And you agreed.

859
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,760
Because we gave you perks.

860
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,400
And they showed how all these perks were

861
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,800
equal to the men's salary.

862
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,080
That was a straight salary.

863
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,080
Maybe he got the perks too.

864
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:34,880
I don't know.

865
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:41,000
But the point is it was the hutzpah of her coming

866
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,840
to his office with a lawyer, having the research,

867
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,960
having the evidence, having the facts,

868
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:52,560
and saying, this is not equal.

869
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,480
And she was fired.

870
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,200
Now that was the big report.

871
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,760
You can look at it on your internet

872
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,880
and see a lot of different responses to this.

873
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,760
But this is a case to watch.

874
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,360
Because it's a matter of turf.

875
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,080
You mentioned floor space.

876
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,680
That's not just segregated to women.

877
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:19,000
Architects have been told, top down hierarchy.

878
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,360
The CEO will get this.

879
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,360
This one will get back.

880
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,360
This one will have a window.

881
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,080
This chair will be higher than this one.

882
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,960
So when he sits in the guy is lower,

883
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,240
it's very psychological.

884
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,240
We're in a psychological institute.

885
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,280
There are a lot of games that were written.

886
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,520
There's a book from Harvard.

887
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,120
You might remember the games mother, the games mother.

888
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,520
And the told is to play.

889
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,520
The games mother never talked about it.

890
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,600
We don't have the bag of tools.

891
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,960
We should have them by now.

892
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,200
I mean, for Dan and her book a long time ago,

893
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,120
these books are all old books.

894
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,360
The problem is the culture.

895
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,040
Who said we don't have them?

896
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,720
No, I'm just saying the problem is the culture.

897
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:56,680
The women who were younger don't understand the struggle that

898
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,600
was done for them.

899
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,000
They take it for granted.

900
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,280
And we don't have the same force.

901
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,680
So the women that you want to sit around and say,

902
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,240
I don't need that.

903
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,120
I don't need that.

904
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,440
That's very good for men.

905
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,520
It's not good for the women.

906
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,120
Women need to stay together.

907
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:13,480
They have to help each other on every single level.

908
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,280
To reinforce that particular case,

909
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,880
there's been some studies of women on Wall Street.

910
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,360
And again, it's exactly the same thing.

911
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,320
Women may be making a million dollars,

912
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,280
but they're not making three.

913
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,600
And so in every point where there's a comparison,

914
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:32,200
men end up making more, there was recently

915
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,240
a study that was released about a year

916
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:38,760
so it go by catalyst, which is the research organization

917
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,320
that studies women in the workforce, particularly

918
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,920
in management and boards of directors,

919
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,160
in which they looked at, I think,

920
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:49,080
was 4,000 MBAs from all kinds of universities

921
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,240
from different parts of the world.

922
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:55,640
And they looked at controlling for issues of childcare

923
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:59,440
and full-time work and type of job and so on

924
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:05,000
that women start out in their very first job making less.

925
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,440
And then it just grows over the career.

926
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,640
And we're talking about people with MBAs.

927
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,880
You know, same.

928
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,720
I just lost it.

929
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,440
Actually, the gap is bigger at the top, right?

930
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,280
Yeah, it grows over time, particularly after 10 years.

931
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,600
That brings up a point.

932
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:25,800
What impact does the equal pay law,

933
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:31,600
which was passed in the 1963 or 1965?

934
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:36,040
Because that seems to be ignored throughout the whole country.

935
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,200
So what does it mean?

936
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,040
Anything?

937
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,600
That kind of legislation like the Civil Rights Act.

938
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,560
I mean, like the Civil Rights Act.

939
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,960
It depends on someone bringing a lawsuit.

940
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:51,720
It depends on showing that people are in similarly

941
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:56,880
situated positions and that they have similar kinds

942
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,480
of qualifications, et cetera.

943
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,560
It's very hard to use that kind of law

944
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,440
to lead to equitable outcomes.

945
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,160
And for the most part, the data that I talked about

946
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,520
for the Civil Rights Act, we assume

947
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,200
because the legislation is there,

948
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,480
the outcomes will follow.

949
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,200
That simply is not the case.

950
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:20,400
Well, does that mean that the law needs to be more specific?

951
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,000
I mean, how else?

952
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,520
That's exactly what groups are now lobbying for.

953
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,120
An equal pay act.

954
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,840
But there is already that one in place.

955
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,800
Well, what about how are they going to change it?

956
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,360
What they're lobbying for currently has to do with the right

957
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,400
to have the knowledge of the.

958
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,560
It's the exposure of public.

959
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,120
Like in government, obviously everything of us

960
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,080
is public record.

961
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,800
I like that because I know the guy sitting next to me

962
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,160
is my aunt, you know, that's good.

963
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:56,520
But you don't have that in most professions.

964
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,520
And I think part of the problem, and I hate feeling

965
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,960
like a woman, I'm a bargaining chip.

966
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,520
It's almost like you get the promotion.

967
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,960
Women get so excited.

968
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,360
They forget to ask, well, wait a second.

969
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,200
I feel so honored.

970
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,600
I'm so, oh my gosh, me?

971
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,480
OK, great.

972
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,760
This is so great.

973
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,760
And then they forget to do the research.

974
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,280
And then they don't have the hoods,

975
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,560
but in everything else.

976
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,760
I really do believe all of these salaries.

977
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,920
It's just like a house that gets sold.

978
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,120
You know how much it's sold for the last time?

979
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,400
So what's the job for going out?

980
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,880
I deserve that.

981
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,160
And it's a question that should be asked.

982
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,840
And we shouldn't be afraid to ask it.

983
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,400
We shouldn't be so taken aback by the fact

984
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,640
that we've been selected.

985
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,840
Women don't negotiate.

986
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,520
They don't ask.

987
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,440
Well, negotiation's getting left.

988
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,960
If they do ask, they get left.

989
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,360
And they're afraid that they're not.

990
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,720
And I think because we've been taught this way,

991
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:50,280
we're afraid that all of a sudden people are not

992
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,040
going to look like we're appreciative.

993
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,720
But hopefully you would go back to your professional organization

994
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,520
and then start talking to some of the older women.

995
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,020
Yes.

996
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,000
Mentoring for that.

997
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,500
Yes.

998
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:04,200
And it will be helpful so that each one goes back.

999
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,400
So I do with people in my field.

1000
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,160
And I talked to them about presentation, doing seminar,

1001
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,480
and asking for money.

1002
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,360
And hopefully your whole profession,

1003
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,600
you would go to some people and they would mention you

1004
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,880
as all right, this is what you have to do.

1005
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,960
No, the problem is that you are talking

1006
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,280
that we can't do coding.

1007
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,080
So if you want to say something, you're not

1008
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,200
going to talk to me.

1009
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,880
Yes, right.

1010
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,680
Oh, I forgot to say something.

1011
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:34,880
There are certain areas that have protected women

1012
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,960
that can't have gender or sexism or ages and that much

1013
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:39,960
as anything else.

1014
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,000
And those are places where you have unions.

1015
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,160
Like in the theater, you have a part.

1016
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,720
You have six women come up for the part.

1017
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,560
One gets the part.

1018
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,280
It has nothing to do with it's her talent, her reading,

1019
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,040
or whatever.

1020
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,640
And the guy gets the guys part.

1021
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,000
But there's less women parts.

1022
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,560
After an equity and all these other unions

1023
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,960
and health benefits, it has nothing to do with anything else.

1024
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,160
They had a breakthrough.

1025
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,960
The racism part of it, full Latinos and blacks and so on.

1026
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,400
But they did work through it.

1027
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,720
They had little clutches and people work together.

1028
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:15,160
Then you have also an academia.

1029
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,720
You have all this business and publisher,

1030
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,960
parish, and all that stuff.

1031
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,600
But it works for the men, same as the women.

1032
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,240
But it's a little harder for the women.

1033
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,600
Because even if they're senior, the men

1034
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,840
get into the men's bathroom and they have always discussion.

1035
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,600
By the time you're getting into the meeting,

1036
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,600
the meeting took place in the bathroom.

1037
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,680
You're just hearing the results.

1038
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:38,800
So very hip women who are VPs in different areas,

1039
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,880
in corporate areas, have figured out.

1040
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,880
We're talking about women.

1041
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,880
We're talking about men.

1042
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,880
We're talking about men.

1043
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,880
We're talking about decisions.

1044
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,440
The decisions were already made.

1045
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,200
That's what the people are talking about.

1046
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,360
Morning, there were showers in the men's bathroom.

1047
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,080
There were no showers in the women's bathrooms.

1048
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,400
They're coming in the middle.

1049
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,720
So the meeting takes place there.

1050
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,280
And they get there and they make their decision.

1051
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,680
It's always random.

1052
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,880
But there are some women who already are too smart.

1053
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,560
I know this.

1054
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,480
Because they read some of those books from way back.

1055
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:12,960
Now, one last question.

1056
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:19,760
OK, one example of one woman who took it on, straight on,

1057
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,360
she had a big budget, had a lot of airline tickets that she used.

1058
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:29,440
And she called up and wanted a VP.

1059
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,920
She wanted her her own.

1060
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,080
Superior.

1061
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:39,040
She wanted the same ticket that they had to the men

1062
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:39,560
with VPs.

1063
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,800
Because she was flying all over Europe and the United States

1064
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,600
and so on.

1065
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,200
And she had great these people with her

1066
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,760
and set up the lectures.

1067
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,720
So they said, oh, we can't choose to point them out.

1068
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,840
I'm not a vice president in charge of dishwashing.

1069
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,320
I run the advertising department.

1070
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:54,760
What do you mean?

1071
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,760
Why not?

1072
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,040
You wouldn't give it to you.

1073
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,440
She said, you have three minutes to do it

1074
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,400
before I call up Gloria Steinem, Harriet Van Horn,

1075
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,800
and all these famous people of those days,

1076
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,320
Dorothy Colgowan.

1077
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,080
And I'm not using your airline.

1078
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,720
And I'm sending these back.

1079
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,000
Guess what?

1080
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,520
She got it.

1081
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,000
She said, I don't need cigars.

1082
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I don't need first class.

1083
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,400
I want you to hold a plane for me if I'm

1084
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,920
like the way you do with the guys.

1085
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,920
I love the after-pump.

1086
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,960
I am such a case in point.

1087
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,480
You can do all the statistics on me.

1088
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:31,480
My brother told the family that when he was 16 years old,

1089
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,880
he went to there was an ad for you

1090
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:37,840
can fly anywhere for $25.

1091
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:42,600
And if the plane is full, we'll give you your own plane.

1092
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,440
I don't remember this.

1093
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,680
He said he went to LaGuardia Airport.

1094
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,120
He was 16.

1095
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:52,200
He waited for four hours till the plane was full.

1096
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,680
And then he was the next one.

1097
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,200
And he said, I want my own plane.

1098
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,280
I want you to know my brother's a very, very successful man.

1099
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,320
It starts when you're little.

1100
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,680
It has to do with your self-image.

1101
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:10,240
And mommy darling, mommy said to me, I'll never forget this.

1102
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,280
Your brother needs the bigger room.

1103
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:16,400
He has more stuff.

1104
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,240
I'd like to know what that stuff is.

1105
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,480
I want some of that stuff.

1106
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:27,400
Fortunately, I realized at a very young age,

1107
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:30,320
I've got stuff too.

1108
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,800
It may not be in a penis.

1109
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,000
It's maybe up here.

1110
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,720
My stuff is up here.

1111
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:37,960
And I'm going to use it.

1112
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:43,680
And I made damn sure I married a man who respected my head.

1113
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:46,040
And I told Freddie, Freddie is my boss.

1114
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:46,800
I work for Freddie.

1115
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,600
He's an artist.

1116
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:55,360
I said, Freddie, everything in my life is a negotiation.

1117
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,760
I negotiate for a cup of coffee.

1118
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,720
I want that coffee.

1119
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,160
I want it the way I want it.

1120
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,280
Harry said to me, and I write.

1121
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,240
That's what I do, unpublished.

1122
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,800
If you weren't such a good goddamn writer,

1123
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,200
I would have made you stay as a teacher.

1124
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:16,720
And I left teaching 30 years ago to write for the drawer.

1125
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,720
If you know what that means in Russia,

1126
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,040
people who are writing controversial stuff

1127
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,200
don't get published.

1128
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,080
They write for the drawer.

1129
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,720
I'm your writer for the drawer.

1130
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:26,720
Thank you.

1131
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:27,720
Thank you.

1132
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:28,720
Thank you.

1133
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:29,720
Please.

1134
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,720
Please.

1135
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,720
Please.

1136
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,720
I'm going to have some of this.

1137
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,720
I have a bad answer.

1138
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,720
Can we have an answer?

1139
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,720
Yeah.

1140
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,720
That's OK.

1141
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:39,720
Yeah.

1142
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,720
Oh, hi.

1143
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,400
My name is Miriam Stern.

1144
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,040
I'm also an attorney, so I'm not a researcher,

1145
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:48,160
but I have a lot of anecdotal feelings

1146
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,840
about some of the things said.

1147
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,520
You have to hold the mic close to me.

1148
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,120
OK.

1149
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,320
Miriam Stern, attorney.

1150
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,640
So I'm not a researcher.

1151
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:00,120
I have anecdotal feelings about some of the things said.

1152
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:03,080
And Professor Diddemasso, I thank you so much

1153
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:06,280
for all the research that you mentioned today.

1154
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:10,080
And I so agree with everything, feeling it.

1155
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,920
I just want to comment about what was said about theater,

1156
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:17,200
because I'm an entertainment lawyer, also an adjunct professor

1157
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,560
at several universities here in the city,

1158
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,440
teaching business law and law to filmmakers.

1159
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:28,880
There is tremendous prejudice in the theater industry.

1160
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:33,840
There are hardly any female writers that are being produced.

1161
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,840
There are hardly any female directors that are being hired.

1162
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,040
You can count them on one hand.

1163
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,600
Same in the film industry.

1164
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,200
And in terms of academia, I totally

1165
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,200
agree with everything you've said.

1166
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,480
And again, anecdotally, as a lawyer,

1167
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:54,680
I've read that 2% of females ever make partner.

1168
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:58,240
So there are no females up there to support other females.

1169
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,000
Any other questions?

1170
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Yeah, I'm Fran Dillon.

1171
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,920
I wanted to go back to implicit bias.

1172
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:27,240
I had an experience this morning with a visiting transplant

1173
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,800
surgeon.

1174
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:35,440
She was, I guess, one of 40 who were here in New York

1175
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:39,680
at the New York Academy of Medicine.

1176
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:43,200
And I guess at the opening meeting,

1177
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:48,160
she was sitting at a table with other surgeons.

1178
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:52,520
And they were introducing the people at the table.

1179
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:57,600
And they came to her and said, she's the coordinator.

1180
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,760
And she was shocked, of course.

1181
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:05,240
But she's one of the few, I think, transplant surgeons

1182
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,360
in the country.

1183
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,520
So I was interested in different sectors,

1184
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:14,160
what's happening in different sectors, particularly medicine.

1185
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:17,320
But I said to her, what did you say?

1186
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,720
And she said, well, I said, I'm a surgeon.

1187
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:26,120
And after that, she said, I didn't say anything else.

1188
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:29,760
So I just wonder about the language

1189
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,760
to deal with that implicit bias.

1190
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:36,960
Because I think women don't have the language to deal with it.

1191
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:41,640
And she really needed that.

1192
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,440
She's in her 40s.

1193
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:48,000
And she will go to meetings over and over again like this.

1194
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,680
And so I'd love your comment.

1195
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:51,200
Right.

1196
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:56,400
Well, I think, again, any time one is an only in a profession

1197
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,960
or in a group, you're going to have these experiences over

1198
01:24:58,960 --> 01:24:59,600
and over again.

1199
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,560
Because people will form prototypes in their head

1200
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:05,840
about who should be in this kind of profession.

1201
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,280
And it'll be like those that are in the majority.

1202
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,920
But let me mention two things that I think we haven't addressed

1203
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:16,240
yet, and that might be useful for the conversation.

1204
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:19,040
One is that while all of the kinds of things

1205
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,880
that we've been discussing are true in terms

1206
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,400
of the research that has looked at the issues,

1207
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,720
women get paid less.

1208
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,560
Women are less likely to be in positions of authority.

1209
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,800
Women are less likely to be taken seriously, and so on.

1210
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:38,600
But some women do make it.

1211
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:42,160
And that's one of the things that we do need to keep in mind.

1212
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:46,000
Alice Eglie and I think Linda Carley did a book called

1213
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,080
The Labyrinth of Leadership, where they argued

1214
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:53,240
that we have the wrong imagery to talk about the glass ceiling

1215
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,560
and somehow think that everything's just fine

1216
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,120
until women get to the top and then they get stopped.

1217
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,760
Because they argue that these kinds of things take place

1218
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,920
at every point along the way.

1219
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:09,640
But it isn't simply a straight shot

1220
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:13,520
that when women run into obstacles, they can go around them.

1221
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,360
They can find another pathway.

1222
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,520
And that's why they called it The Labyrinth of Leadership,

1223
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:24,120
that there are ways to manage to overcome the obstacles,

1224
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:30,720
despite discrimination, despite the favoritism that men enjoy.

1225
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,520
And part of that is persistence.

1226
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,280
Part of it is good luck.

1227
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,160
Part of it is skill.

1228
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:43,160
But knowing that there are examples of people who have

1229
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,640
somehow done it against the odds, I think,

1230
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:49,840
is something to be sure that we remember and to be encouraged

1231
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:50,800
by.

1232
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,800
One of the things I think along those lines

1233
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,960
to keep in mind that I teach in my classes

1234
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:04,920
when I teach them is that one shouldn't get caught up

1235
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:10,000
in that double bind about trying to act competent versus act

1236
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,880
nice or trying to do it like a man versus doing it

1237
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,600
like a woman, that essentially you can't

1238
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,280
win in that kind of a trade-off.

1239
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:24,000
Hillary Clinton can't do it because someone will always

1240
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,080
think that if she acts too feminine, she's being

1241
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,720
inauthentic, and if she doesn't act feminine enough,

1242
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:37,960
she's not someone to be admired, and so on.

1243
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:43,720
So Robin Ealy, again at Harvard and her collaborator,

1244
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:47,960
whose name I'm Deborah Rode, talk about opting out

1245
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:52,200
of that effort to balance between doing it like a man

1246
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,280
versus doing it like a woman, and instead focus

1247
01:27:55,280 --> 01:28:00,240
on the goal of performance and learning your job

1248
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:05,680
and looking for opportunity and doing it in a way that

1249
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:10,760
engages and involves other people and helps them develop

1250
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:13,680
their capacities and their ability to win.

1251
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:16,200
And when you keep the focus on what you're

1252
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,680
trying to accomplish and how you're

1253
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,520
going to get there and go around the obstacles,

1254
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,720
as opposed to be stopped by them,

1255
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,440
you have a much greater opportunity

1256
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,640
to not be undone by these kinds of experiences.

1257
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,600
This has been a really interesting conversation,

1258
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,200
and I'm just curious how you would

1259
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,160
see women and the world of work against what I consider

1260
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:47,320
the greater context, which is the American culture.

1261
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:50,440
I'm very interested in, say, the demise

1262
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:53,320
of the women's movement that I grew up with,

1263
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,680
and the role models that I had in the 70s,

1264
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:59,880
like the glorious dynames, and that whole,

1265
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,000
there were magazines, there were movements,

1266
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,440
they were very, very public voices who were inspirational,

1267
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:09,200
and they were role models for us.

1268
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:13,320
That seems to have been plotted or fizzled out.

1269
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,280
The role models we see now, the Oprah Winfrey's,

1270
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:21,200
are more concerned about celebrity or very soft subjects,

1271
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,800
like, I don't know, spirituality is not soft, but.

1272
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,200
Oh.

1273
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:31,720
So there seems to be, to me, a lack of cohesive movement

1274
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:33,080
and leadership.

1275
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,360
I see not to diss Michelle Obama,

1276
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,960
but she's talking about not women's work,

1277
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,280
but eating habits.

1278
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:45,440
The other thing, the concomitant trend that I've seen,

1279
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,960
we've all seen over the last, say, 20 years,

1280
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:52,120
is this hyper-sexualization of American women,

1281
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:55,360
American society, so that men and women

1282
01:29:55,360 --> 01:30:02,280
seem farther apart in TV, in movies, in music.

1283
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,760
I mean, the sexual images, to me,

1284
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:07,640
are shocking and stunning, somebody

1285
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,720
who grew up in the 70s.

1286
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:14,200
And I'm wondering whether the push for equality

1287
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,800
on the job front is made more difficult

1288
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,680
by these cultural and social trends.

1289
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:24,440
I mean, we're kind of fighting against a wave that's

1290
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:26,120
pushing us back.

1291
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:29,720
So any comments you would have on that, I would be interested.

1292
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,720
OK, I'll comment.

1293
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:43,960
Well, it is the case that many of the social movements

1294
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:46,440
that some of us grew up with have dissipated.

1295
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:49,640
I mean, there's a certain sense in which people have gotten

1296
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:50,000
older.

1297
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,800
They had to go in other directions.

1298
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:57,000
There became some downsides of being involved

1299
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,360
in some of those kinds of things.

1300
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,040
But I think that, to some extent,

1301
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,440
the energy from those social movements

1302
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:04,840
got professionalized.

1303
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:08,240
I mean, there were professional organizations

1304
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:11,400
that got created as opposed to just social movements.

1305
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,360
So I don't think that the pressure for change

1306
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:19,600
has necessarily disappeared, but it's taken a different form.

1307
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,600
However, at the same time that those kinds of things

1308
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:25,760
have happened, there has been an organized effort

1309
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,360
to turn the country back from liberalism that

1310
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,400
has been driven by a very well financed right wing movement.

1311
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,920
I talk about this in my book as well.

1312
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:42,800
And they have had a strategy for doing that that included

1313
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,760
creating public intellectuals and generating books

1314
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:50,960
and capturing the media and the development of Fox News

1315
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:55,120
and all kinds of organizations to sort of create

1316
01:31:55,120 --> 01:32:01,200
model legislation and many, many kinds of sectors

1317
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:06,360
of the society have been influenced by this effort

1318
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,720
to turn the country back from those social movements.

1319
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:14,440
So obviously, one of the solutions

1320
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:17,040
would be to sort of recreate some aspect

1321
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,720
of those social movements, but it's

1322
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:22,120
a very difficult thing to do, particularly

1323
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:28,520
because the Supreme Court and the campaign finance laws

1324
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:29,840
and so on.

1325
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:35,040
So unfortunately, as the successes of those social movements

1326
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:39,960
have begun to erode, the new generation of people,

1327
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,400
and I guess to some extent some of us as well,

1328
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:45,000
sort of have to fight those battles again.

1329
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:55,840
And that's sort of an unsettling sort of thing to me.

1330
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,920
I was very happy for those social movements

1331
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,600
and glad that I didn't have to be as involved as some people

1332
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:03,800
needed to be.

1333
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:08,400
But I do feel committed to supporting

1334
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,400
what other kind of efforts sort of emerged

1335
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:14,240
to sort of take things back again.

1336
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,840
You were like, today is the anniversary,

1337
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,240
the 50th anniversary of Brown-listed

1338
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:19,680
Board of Education.

1339
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:24,000
And it's now the 50th anniversary of the voting rights act.

1340
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,440
And we're going back.

1341
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,800
If there are no other questions, we will finish.

1342
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,440
I just hope yes.

1343
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,440
Thank you.

1344
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:29,940
Thank you.

1345
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:30,440
Thank you.

1346
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:31,440
Thank you.

1347
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:57,400
Thank you.

1348
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:18,960
Thank you.
