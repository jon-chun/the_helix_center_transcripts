 Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Okay. The last session of today is on identity. And the participants for that are counterclockwise. No, clockwise. Clockwise, Charles Melman. It's your Whitbrook. I'm sorry, White Book. Then it is Anvido. Then... You are not on the list and then it is Jean-Michel Kabat and then Marilya Isense. Charles Melman is chairing the group, so he will get it going. I think I would rather speak in English. So, when I started to tackle the question, what identity? Of course, identity is very linked to the question of education because to be educated and to get a training in any sense to be trained, to be educated means that you need to have your own identity. Because if not, then you are not educated. You become a clone. So, how to tackle the question of identity, I chose three points, mainly subjectivity. Secondly, what is the ability to say no, the ability to rebel and the ability to think. And the title of my paper is the very well-known sentence by Descartes. The past of history, I think that's identity. We were speaking of the terrorist attacks. When I started to think about this paper, what came to my mind was a book by a friend journalist whose name is Jean-Artsfeld. The book is translated in English and it's called a season of matchat. And the book relates, Jean-Artsfeld was very moved by the massacre of the two seats in Rwanda. So, he went, he wrote the first book and his second book is season of matchat. Is a book where he went for nearly six months and interviewed the killers. He interviewed those people who were good people, they were peasants. They had absolutely no hostility. But one day, they were given orders that they had to kill their neighbors and friends from the morning, half past nine to four o'clock they had to take matchat and to kill. Fifty thousand two seats were killed like that out of a population of 60 thousand, which is quite amazing that took place in five weeks. So, Jean-Artsfeld went to interview those killers and he is not a psycho analyst. He's a very good journalist and he was struck himself by the fact that the discourse was absolutely concrete. There were no emotions, no affects. And he says a language without images, which for a analyst is very interesting because it's what we would call a language which is no more rooted in the drives and there's no formal regression possible, no images, no representations. And about from this book, I went to what came to my mind are two other books. One is Anna Ahand, the banality of the evil, where she relates the trial of Aitman in Jerusalem. And he's also, it's not an emotive discourse. If you see the minutes of the trial, it's quite amazing. He relates and he says that he never imagined and he simply, he didn't seem guilty because he didn't want the shore to take place, but he was just obeying orders. From that point, one can think that is exactly, there are people who don't want to think. And in the previous panel, somebody was, we were speaking of the love or the obedience to the leader, which is for me, it's not really love. It is, I love him, yes, but I stopped to think because he thinks for me. And not thinking can be comfortable. Sometimes thinking is painful and not to have to think can be felt as comfortable. And that was one very crucial question when we think of terrorism, of attacks, of any kind of those terrible social problems. The third thing is you all know, I imagine, the book of Stanley Milgram. Stanley Milgram is this professor of psychology who did this experiment. Well, maybe if you don't know it, I can stop. I think everybody knows the experiment of Milgram. So I won't, I won't go. Yes, yes, yes. So this shows that it's absolutely incredible how people who are intelligent, who are good people, who even can be smart, facing authority and even a totally vague authority can obey. That means stop thinking by themselves. They act, they simply act. So that put me to the conclusion and I will stop at that point that identity is based on the capacity of continue to think and to want to think. And specially, that means also the capacity to say no. Because if you think at one point, you cannot always obey to authority. So I think that Freud has two main papers on that question. One is the negation of course. And the other one is the splitting of the ego in the defense process, where he shows very well that there are some, I forget the word, the case, scarves, there are some scars in the ego which will never, never heal. And this scarves in the ego is a part of the unconscious ego which will always be open at this car which will never heal. And that means that only working through constantly and trying to keep our thinking process alive is the only way to continue and not to be blind to what we are doing or not to do things that we wouldn't like to do but that we have the tendency. Because as it was said, evil is not outside, evil is in all of us. And sadism is in all of us and we could all become killers. Thank you. Thank you, Marina. Thanks a lot.

Yep, they congratulate us for seeing that. They later showed that, they saw Newton's proof, to explain. That would be difficult. Look, I will sum up because Shalman most had a lot of very interesting things. Well, he started saying that we are all driven by an object, the object of our unconscious fantasy. And that, of course, that is unconscious and we are full of it without even knowing exactly where we are going and what we are thinking. I think this is very important. Now, he raises the question, when does that start? When do we start, finally, to really construct an identity even if a huge part of our identity will always remain driven by something that we don't know? I couldn't answer to this question. I would rather say that I would put it around the adiabus complex around between three and four. I mean, around the construction of the superego. And a superego, which of course is rooted deeply into the id. I would put it like that. And finally, Shal talked about the three monotheistic religions saying that what is very different is that Koro is considered to be directly written or dictated by God. And what I understand is the difference because if it's dictated by God, it has not to be interpreted. And the two others monotheist are interpretations and lead to more and more and more interpretations. You agree with that. Sure. Thank you. Merci beaucoup somma, merui, merui serre le vous holidays grielen. Perc deserving initialize parts of theoud groiens and provide as churnera, interpretation leads to another one and so on and so on. So it's an ongoing work. I would suggest that we should make a distinction between interpretation and critique. And what I'm going to say, before I have to preface what I'm going to say with a statement, I in no way want to endorse the whole idea about class of civilizations or celebrate the West or deny the history of Western imperialism and colonialism. Nevertheless, and I will probably be accused of Islamophobia and Eurocentrism, but nevertheless what I want to say is this. You know, I don't know what it's like in France at this point, but here, especially Colombia where I teach, thinkers who have been influenced by deconstruction and post-colonial theorists are constantly making the point that identity isn't unitary. Identity is always heterogeneous, not unified, not solidified, not final. But they fail to apply their point to the West. The identity of the West isn't unified either. And as Castoriatos argued, the social formation of the West is made up by two competing projects, what he called the Project of Autonomy and the Project of Domination. The latter is the history of imperialism, colonialism, domination of the globe, domination of the nation, and so on and so forth. But there is something else that happened in the West which makes critique possible in a way that it isn't another culture. I mean, if you look to the Greeks, for example, and I don't want to celebrate the Greek miracle, but the unoxford classicist and philosopher, Loy, G.E.R. and Loy has done extensive research, comparative research between Greek science, Chinese science, and Indian science. And he is intimately familiar with all the texts and sometimes it makes it impossible to read, but I mean he's no dilettante, that's what I'm trying to say. And his question is why did inquiry go further in Greece than it did in either of these other places? And his answer is that there was a certain anti-authoritarianism in Greece, as opposed to certain structures of authority in China and India which allowed inquiry to go beyond a certain point in Greece where as the authoritarianism, the subservience of inquiry to power prevented it from going that far in China and India. And then, I mean, I'll probably be accused of being a defender of the Enlightenment, and I don't want to defend it in its 18th century mode, but I do want to defend it. But then, contact, though, all ours is the age of critique. And he enunciated the principle that we shouldn't accept any idea, any norm, any value, in the name of traditional authority, simply because it's been passed on and simply because the authorities say it so. And that, in principle, I mean, it doesn't happen, it's violated all the time, but in principle, every important idea has to stand before the test of critical reason. And I think these two sedimented historical experiences mean that there is something sedimented in our history, which needs to be defended and needs to be asserted against the other strand of our history, which is the project of domination. Would you agree that that's very near what you said is quite near, when I say the capacity to say no, it's very important? To say no to the idols of the tribe. Exactly, and to acknowledge, no, this is not mine. I don't feel this, and I don't want to feel it. And Lloyd even makes the point in the Iliad that the other soldiers stand up and say no to Agamena, which is almost unheard of. They had the right to speak up and to challenge their king general in a way that was uncharacteristic. Also, something you said, one of your earlier panels, that we see the death drive in thinking because the capacity to say no and separate is the same. That's true, but at the same time thinking goes against the death drive, because insofar as the death drive seeks the release of tension, this version of tension, thinking requires the increase in tension and a buildup in tension. Both are true. Both are totally true, and that's why what is destructive, it's not the death drive, or libido, it's unbiting. I might slightly disagree in terms of what has already been discussed earlier today. The question of the death drive and teaching and identification and the recent problems and attacks in California and Paris that are all connected. And I think what we see here is that education and identity or identification are somehow linked. And I will just begin by going back to the sentence that has often been quoted today. Freud said that education is impossible. Educate, govern, psychoanalyze, impossible, professions. Just to say that this is where we are now, but precisely I think our discussion is impossible. This evening. The study will come out of here with a good sense of what we're doing or saying, two languages. We won't understand each other, that is clear. Yet this impossible is what can be used, and I think we need to think through the impossible. And I think this is where La Conne or De Rida or Bataille can help us. Why? Because precisely the impossible is a certain paradoxical mode of thinking. And you know, like what De Rida often does in his text to bring us to an aporia. We don't know, we are stuck and so on. Which in a way interrupts a certain common discourse. And I think we should go back to Freud's idea of what is this impossibility here. How is it connected with the task of educating? Is it possible to educate while it is impossible to do so normally? On the other hand, we have the question and you started by quoting Descartes, right? I think therefore I am. La Conne, as we know, refrased it as I think, colon, quote, therefore I am. We can think it like I think therefore I am. I think therefore I am like a whole phrase. What I mean is that in terms of the institutions that have to do with identification or education, we can think of the two parallel institutions that have been cooperative in France recently. On the one hand, let's say high schools, universities and elite institutions. And on the other hand, the jails where most of the radical militants have learned to identify with an ideal. Which I think is also why we had that question earlier. Why we may be more moved by the Uldurahoke and Batacrano attacks in Paris than a plane, you know, a barout and so on. Why is it because it is just normal kids having fun, any sense what we always aspire to that our children can go out on a café at night and enjoy life. And so that looks like very different from with the Rousier 20 years ago when the Goldenberg was attacked, okay, use religion, ethnicity and so on. Today is just sort of everyday style of life with which everybody here in this room can identify as something we think is good. But if we think of the rapidity of the identification, we have all those accounts of marginalized, disenfranchised, bird kids from the suburbs of Paris who go to jail because they first drug, they do deep drugs, they are dealing, they get caught by the police, they go to jail and then they identify with an absolute faith. And so this is the function of identification. Against this, the certain impossibility of the institution of learning and teaching is a good counter-poison, I would say. I would put it as a particular thing. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. It's a Cullic formulation of his life, he thought it was good that theparamities, of course, of his life, and of course includes an identity. and civilization, and its discontent. HsuspandOM vou A L and Lacan, it was in her text, she is wondering if we can understand the the doctrine of the contemporary subject.

I am a Jew. I am a Jew. I am a Jew. I am a Jew. I am a Jew. I was hoping that you were more a universalist. I can't understand the anger of Freud. In that debate, what interested me in it? It was published in a collection in 1957 on the future of psychoanalysis. It makes you want to laugh or cry. When you see what the psychoanalysis would be like in, let's say, half a century earlier. There are many issues about education, identification, science and so on. But fundamentally, what you can see is that Freud, first, we talked about the critique of American ideas and the analysis, as he always does, the superficiality of American cultural life and the medicalization of psychoanalysis. But then he says, you don't know your own classics. He says, and Whitman equals Whitman, if sex were lacking or were lacking. So Freud still believes that what is shocking in, let's say, American ideology of the common man is the sexual idea. What he then discovers talking with Verek is that the most shocking thing is the death drive to return to what we were saying earlier. And he really goes on and on about the death drive, because Verek is ready to accept the idea, I think you were saying this, this morning very well. And I think Freud's anticipated, you know, the culture of Hollywood and the certain soft-pawn diffused eroticism and publicity and everywhere today on any screen we can open and so on, that has been completely absorbed by mainstream American culture and Western culture, whereas the idea of the death drive, that is still something that surprisingly somebody like Verek who loved the Nazis couldn't take. But you know, the story is even more complicated, because everything most of us find obnoxious about American culture and consumerism and how I would was introduced by Freud's nephew, Bernays, I don't remember. And he took his uncles ideas and invented what do they call it? Yeah, advertising. Public relations, yeah. And I mean, he was hired by the corporation, blah, blah, blah, and he was the agent of all of this. But I think it took to conclude maybe on this and something that I owe to Charles Merman, because I can say that I started learning about Lekkon in a seminar you taught in Paris in 1969, so that's a long time ago at the economic superior. In Lekkon, you have this awareness that in the text I quote, there is a pedagogy of the death drive, which is a little paradoxical to think today because you were suggesting that what can we learn from the death drive, basically, to avoid it. No. To understand what it means, yeah, yeah. And so for Lekkon, it has to do with language and perhaps with literature. This is, I think, why when we teach literature, we also have to work with the death drive, which is, I think, more difficult than to work with the fact that students may fall in love with us and so on. We know how to deal with that, but we don't know how to deal with the death drive. Perhaps even part of their transverse is also the negative transverse of the death drive. Transverse isn't just euros. Can you go to the microphone, please? Yes, please. We are in biography of Jan Parrett, the Martin Buber.

Why, forgive you? Thank you. Be careful never. This is to Maria. The identity is based on the capital of the country. The identity is based on the capacity to say no. Philosophically I do agree with you. From a psychoanalytical point of view, I'm not sure that identity exists as such. It's like the baby for Winnicott. You see, it does not exist as such. Freud's thought of identity as a social relationship. Identity was social. And you refer to the London genocide. There is another book which I recommend, Scott Strauss, who analyzed different villages, different regions, and read about the conclusions that the same type of people sometimes did resist other participating in the killing. In other words, the environment and the political environment was desiseled in the commitment of the crimes. So the question is, what does it mean, identity as such? I agree, thank you. I don't think identity is one entity. Identity is a long and fluctuating process which has to do with recognition by the other two. You have your identity, but you are also identified by the look of the other. Perhaps if I can add something to your remark, what Charman Man was discussing with the example of the supporters is a little more than identity. It's this mixture of results and identity that Clampera, for instance, analyzed very well in the language of the Third Reich. You probably know that book, showed exactly what Mussolini did in Italy. Not just an identity to being Italian or Nazi or German or Aryan as non-drew, but the resource that was allowed to happen. And I think this is what a good club and my city, Philadelphia is very known for having really very rowdy supporters of the Phillies and so on. You know, if you join that you will be able to kick out people's heads and bash them and so on. That will be part of the little premium. And so this is the kind of excessive enjoyment, I think, the flourishing of enjoyment in a crowd, in a massive. It's different from just identity, we all need a certain identity, but that's special kind of identity. A one line from Ovid, I think, that fits especially this country very well in our discussion is, if you are afraid to fall in love, go into business. The fourth thing I'll go into is the pipe.
