 Are you ready? I'm the associate director of the center. Before I introduce the participants of today's round table, I have two brief announcements. One is that the next program on the beauty and unity of mathematics is on December 1. And then on December 15, it's a program on animal consciousness. And then other programs you will see if you go to the website. I will make a very brief introduction of the participants today. If you want more information on them, you go to our website. There's a detailed bio there. Michael first, who is sitting right there, is professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University. Laura Hirschbein is professor of psychiatry at University of Michigan. Francis Lee is the chair of the department of psychiatry at Cornell Medical, Cornell Medicine. Robert Michaels is the Wach McDermott University professor of medicine at psychiatry at Wyl Cornell. And Miklo Stott is the neuroscientist professor of pharmacology at Wyl Cornell. So as you know, the format is a spontaneous conversation amongst the participants. Thank you. Who wants to get the going? Well, we were just talking a minute ago before everybody started about the fact that I'm a historian and I'm the only woman and the only non-New Yorker, so I guess I have a perspective. But we were talking about wondering whether the history should start first if we're looking to the future. But the problem with starting in the past is if you're imagining a narrative, do we want the way people tend to use history is to tell the story about the president. Are we talking about the past as the battle days that are leading to the future with new discoveries, new advances, new neuroscience, new whatever, or are we going to use the past to tell a story of decline that we've lost track of the things that we used to do that we used to do well and now we're in soulless territory of just symptom counting with due appreciation to DSM. So you can use the history to tell the story of decline, the story of progress, or as I tend to see it, the story of things that continue, the themes that come up over and over and over and over again. The things that we discover and rediscover, we discover brains, we discover symptoms, we discover statistics, I'm reading a great book on the history of statistics now that it points out that we psychiatrists were doing statistical counting in the 17th century. And so the idea of counting and looking at numbers is not new. We humans like to do that. The first step of trying to understand things is to put some order in things that hopefully patterns will emerge and will have understanding. So that's what going on for a very long time and that continues to be the main way everybody wonders in the DSM diagnostic statistical manual, what was the statistical part? And that was because it originally was used for collecting statistics in mental hospitals and nowadays I guess you could argue the coding allows people to collect statistics but that's really the only reason they keep the assets for historical reasons. It's a well-known document. It's really not a statistical anymore but you're right. The idea of starting out by the DSM unfortunately remains a descriptive observational system with almost no depth to it at all and people have criticized it for that reason which is certainly a valid criticism but it remains useful because there's no alternative. It's always the thing when somebody trashes the DSM it's okay so what do you want to replace it with? It usually don't get much response. So it's incredibly limited but it continues despite all of the advances in neuroscience and everything else it continues to have value as an organizing principle. It's very limited. I think the perspective actually is very useful. I remember 15 years ago I think when Paul the Genius came out I'm looking at everything from the basic science point you have to just a disclaimer but I remember that one of the traction of what this field is that this new genes came out and everybody believed that after a while we will be able to explain some of the symptoms and maybe actually we can define a certain disease based on diseases, disease genes. And historically now we know that it's actually absolutely another case. If anything it's even more complicated. So I've been struggling with this in my whole lab and in the university that how actually to solve that problem and we can discuss it later but obviously we have to move out from the single gene and even multiple gene because we have to understand how the environment is really impinging on this whole gene network and if you have time maybe discuss about that. I think still the genome is a hope that the genome can or epigenome rather can explain a lot of things. So historically I think we really moved a lot from genes and now we have the epigenome and hopefully we have some chance to get a little bit deeper into this how because that's still yes we are in a very simple case we have an epigenome now but like in the 780 90s that we have a lot of things but we don't understand how they work together how to interact. But I think it's a little bit more bad execution now we have more players so it's almost that we need another level of understanding. I think we do know more I'm also a neuroscientist and I was just out of symposium at Cornell and yesterday and from a lot of different neuroscientists I was coming from the sound of the video and was actually clear it was muffled here too. Is this better? Is it really or not actually much closer to understanding the pathophysiologists like yeah this order despite the hundreds of genes that have now been found. The best example I was at this meeting was that the success story now the best success story in psychiatry is autism. 99 genes will now have met genome wide significance very penetrative high effect sizes they account for 1% or less than 1% all autism in this population. But each of these papers is a nature paper. This is considered the best advance of what we can do at this point. And it's actually not clear how to move forward and I think this is something that I struggle with also. It's just that the hope as Miklo said was that 20 years ago or 30 years ago was just like in pulmonology or nephrology we could just get a bunch of genes and then be able to move forward and what's clear is that this is not a linear path. The brain is probably more complicated. There's some number like 150,000 or 150 trillion synapses. This is just us for us to think that a single gene or 100 genes could help explaining this is going to be difficult to answer. It was very sobering meeting. But if I may just to defect that so basically I think it's specific issues like 15 years ago in the Facebook was or Amazon started. So basically the idea if you think about it is that you get all of this information, they collect information, personal information and 15 years ago they just started. Now they have a tremendous amount of information and that's for me to ask. Now they have arguments that they can actually figure out what next move is and maybe send you an advertisement and we want to say that's saying some pet food or something because you know that you have a pet at home and more complex. So I was thinking maybe that kind of strategy because we have now genes, epigenomes and a lot of that low side. We have thousands of tests. So how to put together all of individual players as they would pull out the society to a comprehensive understanding of how the society works and how the brain works. But I was just thinking another day about this but it's still probably not the right template because it's a very two-dimensional of what they do. They just collect and they can interpret. What our problem is that we have multidimensional, we have genes, then we have synapses, connectivity, then we have circuit functions and then behavior which is very elusive. But most people work at that level. So I think it has to be something where you could integrate these data sets like the UN and Facebook interface but sets but you would be able to actually in a 3D almost fashion to integrate all of this information to a comprehensive understanding of the brain. I have no idea what basically I'm talking about here but I'm just basically saying that it's just something which will be the next most of time this research you don't really know what is the next big step but if something has to be very beyond this two-dimensional understanding what we have now and probably nobody knows this. It's just somebody will come up. So that's why I think it's a good idea to invest NIH and IMH puts a lot of money in these things. There are a couple of people now, artificial intelligence comes in. So maybe something is coming out but we don't know what it is and unfortunately we will not be able to answer the future if I can't see I'm afraid but we just have to put money and then beating 14 internet as a concept to coming out from this and I don't see it yet. I'm not for the major conditions let's say bipolar disorder or schizophrenia for example. Are the studies focused on finding out what causes the condition or are the studies also focused on dissecting it into the symptoms and trying to figure out what causes each symptom? I think at this point the main, at least from what I can get, the main thrust where the money is going is collecting as many samples as possible to get hundreds of thousands of samples of biological samples from ME, DNA and other and to try to do large statistical analysis essentially genome-wide associations and they've succeeded in finding now over 200 schizophrenia genes accounting again for low percentages of the risk, like 0.5% of the risk for schizophrenia. They just completed in England a study where they took 100,000 people with depression and they were able to find 50 genes that looked like they might be affected. 15, 5, 0. Again, low effect sizes for each of these but essentially this is where efforts are to. Again this is sort of like counting, it's sort of like they just want to accumulate as many potential genes that might be a risk gene at this point and these are still early days I would say. 20 years ago there was, there were none so if you divide by zero this is infinitely better. If you say 50 genes are responsible for the depression then what? But they account for so little of the risk so it's sort of like it's a small effect size so that there is a, the best example is one of the genes is a glutamate receptor which makes somewhat sense glutamate receptors are everywhere now. So but the problem, this one glutamate receptor they found is that it's everywhere. So how you're going to actually target a drug to or something like that is going to be very difficult. Drug companies have been targeting this class of receptors already so in many ways we know that this demiurs are stuck then with them again the complexity of the nervous system in the brain and then even if we have one hit that makes some sense it's still very hard to move forward. You know it's interesting thinking about all of this data because again this brings me back to this book I'm reading on the history of statistics and statistics in psychiatry in particular where they were drowning in data in the 19th century. You know one of the, one of Emil Cropelen's arguments was that he was spending all of his time with data. He had so much data he didn't know what to do with it and obviously we have a better capacity for managing data but the thing that came after all of this data gathering in the early 20th century was Freud and psychoanalysis has said okay we're not going to talk about these big groups we're going to talk about one person and we're going to talk about how what makes up this one person and how this one person's inner conflicts manifested in these symptoms or these experiences and so I'm wondering if the future maybe if somebody gets to the point where we have all this data and it's little pixels and it's everywhere and it doesn't cohere to a particular picture that we're going to have another wave of people saying no actually what we need are individuals, individual relationships. You know we're spending all of our time bumping into people as we're looking on our phones not engaging with people or we're going to have a backlash where maybe psychiatrists will leave maybe will follow to say no actually what we need to do is work on interpersonal interactions and that one patient again and go back in a different way. I don't know. Have we stopped doing that now? According to some of our patients we have. I think it's really they are not exclusive and they absolutely you have to just do both. We do certainly the last day but in the clinics you do certainly the individual but they our our goal is really to understand the basic framework of a disease rather than an individual and maybe how an individual can end up with a disease phenotype from this overall concept and you are more interested in obviously why this person got that but I think it's just the two sides of the same story and we just have to do both. There's an interesting sort of like similar backlash going right now in this other field of systems neuroscience where people thought that you just need your image more people and as they're going through various tasks or even whether sitting just to look at their connect their brain connectome just as a to bring everyone up to speed. Twenty years ago it was found that the brain actually organized itself into sort of like hubs within their in the brain and you can actually just get a right what they call a resting state without any task you can actually get a scan and actually see these hugs in the brain and this is the work of Marcus Rakel at Washington University and people were fascinated by this and no one has really been able to sort of understand how is it that you can measure blood flow in the brain and actually see these self organized networks and and so then everyone got excited and just kept on collecting thousands and thousands of scans so now we have hundreds of thousands of scans within studies now at WashU where Marcus was there they now decided that everyone's network is individualized everyone's brain is that when you average it you get some average of brain that looks like no brain on the planet earth so now what they're doing is that they're they're actually taking individuals and actually just scanning them over and over again for example during the course of depression or during something so they can scan them at the height of symptom pathology and then at some other point when they're not so I think this is the goal now that that you might want to basically go back to into and then learn something from these individuals in a way that that they're not they're not been thought of before. I think there's a there have been some drug studies on that that this end of one studies where you you take a single person is the study and how they interact with medication and that's sort of this new thing that's being there. There's so many individual differences this is essentially this is that you can't the principles that even of trying to put together a brain connectome is very difficult even though NIH is spending lots of money on these connectome projects that ultimately you it might actually just sort of like you sort of like if you want to understand fruit you don't blend it together. I believe that response is a little bit simpler because then you ask the question why this drug is actually working in one individual actually understand the pharmacology of that based on an enzyme which is either stronger or weaker in certain individuals it's called seep enzymes but basically they just metabolize the drug many times this is crucial so and we can even now a patient can be screened because it's genetically based one can take a sample from blood and it's every cell is the same and we can basically figure out that it's a fast metabolizer a slow metabolizer and maybe that's the reason somebody is actually a side effects or another person does not respond and it's just a dose relationship so that that maybe somewhat easier to understand than what the underlying cause which could be thousands of different ways but I still believe that there's a still something common feature or features that it is a circuitry I kind of start to believe in circuitry no nobody's but maybe it's just to be as it's fashionable but but circuitry in animal models at least you can understand how the circuitry can be linked to a certain behavior we can model the circuitry we can activate we can deactivate certain very different secondary even we can we can tailor we call it synaptic transmission in certain areas of brain and we can we can't respond but of course after below and underneath there's a lot of genes and synapse and other things you just don't really understand I'm gonna go back to where we started and be a little provocative to me psychiatry's defined like all medical specialties as everything that's relevant to helping people with a certain kind of problem and the neuroscience research base that we've been talking about is fascinating exciting intriguing and essentially totally irrelevant to helping any living patient it may have some hope for the future although a possible outcome of the work is that this strategy won't lead to anything helpful for patients or maybe to some modest twists on some of our current drugs almost all of our current biologic treatments were discovered by happen stance not by scientific research they're serendipitous if we never spent the penny on any neuroscience basic research over the last hundred years it would make trivial difference the current psychiatric patients but we didn't know that I mean obviously clearly that's the problem I mean it was that we were going to crack the problem by going neuroscience but as our historian warned us we have to study the past to find out we won't repeat so it wasn't money weight it was wasted in the sense it didn't give us what we wanted but it was wasted but it led to nothing yes it was a very intelligent gamble that lost so it's short term lost we don't know about the future I just want that for background because when we talk about the excitement of contemporary neuroscience research we're talking about possible hopes for a fairly distant future we're not talking about anyone who's mentally ill today or anything that might help that person but one of the side effects of the neuroscience thing is I believe it's been partly responsible for lowering the stigma of mental disorders and it's unfortunate because somehow if it's in the brain therefore people shouldn't be stigma I mean the fact that it has helped stigma in a way is sad that it took something like this but I think it has people having a brain disease calling schizophrenia brain disease I mean all over and calling substance abuse if you believe it's a brain disease but people call it a brain disease partly to try to reduce the stigma so this angle to split the besides the fact we're trying to look for answers is actually I think had an improvement with respect to the place of psychiatry and medicine and also the place of patients with mental disorders within the myths of medical history that's the rhetoric of neuroscience yes exactly no no but that's a part of the plan of all this money was well if it achieved nothing but that then it would have been well spent as much as I think it's my thing the problem the downside of that though is that the patients expectations of what we can do for them are sky high you know that they they sit there and wait for us to fix their brain disease while they don't want to put any I have too much serotonin I read about that which can give you a drug to reduce that and I'll feel better right right and so the expectations are very high our drugs are okay we our therapies are good but people have to put effort into it right I think these happen really outside of the neuroscience for example if it's infectious diseases going back hundreds of years and then figure figure out if it's a cleaner environment probably can avoid something we need a little microbiome or microbiome or microorganisms but I think eventually when this boxers discovered cloned the gene structure understood then we know the target we can design antibiotics more precisely not just by by lock like not that is silly most certainly a lot but now everything is designed or age would have not been treated the way unless you know we had the virus we had the structure we have the genome and actually the drugs which are double up that are targeting a particular gene so I think we are just a few hundred years maybe behind psychiatry but basically a history tells me that yes this is the typical curve their accidental and then for just findings and we use it because that's the only way we have maybe they are not even useful to them of further drugs like in a certain in blockers so that we couldn't go further behind that so we need some other information to build another way and be just not there yet but I think we have to just patient and I don't know we will be see that time but it just have to be this is the normal course I think every since and I said I mean first of all as I always say I agree with you Bob is that and I think it's sort of sort of reflected by the fact that the the Cornell resident's psychiatry residents really have to know nothing about the brain in order to be an outstanding resident that the training itself does not require us to even know the mechanism of action of any of the drugs that they're given because we actually don't know for example even how this year maybe it's not a good each them medical school it's not taken very seriously but will you say the way forward is if instead of putting our X percent GDP into neuroscience research how do you construct moving the field of psychiatry which is to help these people that are that are leaving very difficult lives and you but more proportion for example in prison and how do we help these with that psychiatrist and possibly difficult but very important question and I'll translate it pragmatically how should the nation devote its resources for toward the issues of mental illness and we're doing it wrong we're spending too much money in tertiary care for people with serious mental illnesses not enough money in preventive medicine even where we know certain things that would make a difference and would work we certainly would do much more for the next x years 50 hundred of the populations psychiatric problems if we put more money into early child development mentoring experiences at a facility then in tertiary care strategies for the persistent and chronic mentally ill that are biologic in nature we know that the pattern of drug use in this country has more to do with physicians needing to placate dissatisfied and angry patients rather than with knowledge about the impact of the drugs on their behavior or their brain but we know that the skillful physicians know that can reduce the patients dissatisfaction with the treatment by writing a description and more expensive the medicine better the effect of the pharmaceutical and this is triggered out of walls and we're going along with it but it's very hard to revise the system so the goal is total public health rather than satisfying individual consumers and current health delivery system has as its output satisfying consumers rather than the health of the nation that's a public health disaster which is supported politically that's not really psychiatry but it has a lot more to do with mental health in the next hundred years than neuroscience. The only thing I would say that is we've already put an x number of billions or millions hundreds of millions of dollars in these sort of early intervention studies public health efforts such as Head Start and I've not yet seen any data that that is it's just that we have not put enough or is it that it's not clear to me that we're making we're moving the needle even with the programs we have now or is it that the needle is just a part to move? Well I'm not sure Head Start's the answer Francis but for example you know the study of sure better than I do that the children of depressed mothers who are depressed during pregnancy and in the postpartum period have been mental health outcomes. We know how to treat depression better than most things we know how to treat including depressed pregnant women and depressed women postpartum but we don't deliver that treatment effectively to lots of populations. We would have more public health mental health benefit by organizing a more effective intervention to assure the mental health of pregnant and postpartum women. Then almost anything else we get for our dollar and mental health. I think the neuroscience is fascinating. I believe we should invest in it but I think that there's a there's a image probably wrong. I think we sell it with the implication that it's going to make a difference soon and I don't think that's true. On the other hand if we tell the truth we're going to lose resources so people act rationally. The way you get the largest grant and the greatest congressional appropriation is to suggest not that the connect homes are fascinating but they may lead to a cure for Alzheimer's disease possibly Thursday. You can't imagine anyone not using that strategy because we do have data that that strategy works. Well the trade-off there is a fixed amount of money available for research and we've seen it NIH the amount of research that's going into treatment development. If all got shunted over into this neuroscience thing. If we had unlimited money we can do neuroscience and we can do this but it doesn't work that way. We are we or somebody is getting the money or certain portions of psychiatry and neuroscience are getting the money but the patients I think the treatment research is really dried up. A lot of it is going to form a sort of depending on pharmaceutical companies and they have unfortunately their motives aren't always aligned with ours so it's a real problem. That's right this is the way you sell money from the government but unfortunately by diluting the government into these promises we get don't get good results for the research and we're really depriving the use of the money elsewhere. Again I don't know what the solution is but I think that's a problem with the success of getting money for neuroscience. What is in the hope that the research is going to give you the tools? Oh no that's right but I think it's Bob was implying that's not happening. Well the fact that's not happening Bob said it's not happening soon but what does that mean? It's not happening tomorrow it's not happening in 20 years it's not happening in 50 years. But maybe never is the problem. The one thing that's been very clear is everybody said the more we study it the more difficult it gets. That's the you know years ago this neuroscience thing see oh all we have to do is sequence the genome all we have to do is this all we have to do is that and every time we do that we're just waiting for that one is not a single biological test in psychiatry for diagnosis. One thing I remember when I was working with Alan Francis of the DSM 4 we wrote this guide book and we put a set to the guide book it was in the Alzheimer's section and we were saying that we're very confident in the next five years by the time this book is out we're going to be a biological test for Alzheimer's and boy was that all I'd still offer it 30- 25 years later and we're still you you speak to the Alzheimer's people they said oh another five year or years to get that right but there's this elusiveness to actually turning these into now it's not clear what you do about that you don't want to say well let's just give up and stop doing it but there is this problem with putting money in a direction that has proven to be very very complicated at what point again if we had an element of money I'd say well let's keep pursuing that but it's coming at the cost of resources being spent on research for better delivery of treatment you just mentioned the thing with the delivery of the treatment you know how to treat depression in pregnant women but there's a delivery problem I mean putting all our money into figuring how to solve those problems would probably get better short-term results but that's much harder to sell let's spend money on delivery of care when I was in medical school in a pathology lab one of the professors would walk around the lab while we were looking at microscopes of cancer cells cancer tissue while he was smoking and so we as medical students told him you know you are a professor of pathology we are looking at cancer there's a connection between lung cancer and smoking where are you smoking he said cancer is cured in ten years I'm talking about the six days so but that doesn't mean that the research in cancer has not borne a lot of fruit so that today with immunotherapy targeted therapy and so on we are so much further than when I was a medical student so why wouldn't the same thing happen and you're right the parallels there of course right that it's going to be cured in ten years the hubs all over medicine they've actually made a lot more progress like the precision medicine is a good example that entire field and all that you know when you apply that to psychiatry we are so far away whatever precision but it's discussed it's always cancer I mean that is has been the area of medicine with I guess you could argue infectious diseases always precision medicine but cancer is a great example and they have made I mean you could argue that all that money spent on cancer which is by the way historically much much more orders of magnitude more than was spent in mental health but you're right that's finally beginning to pay off and part of it I think however complicated the cancer story is it is more tractable than I think the psychiatry story because the of all the it's just it's just so much more complex the brain then I think that we always assume the cancer thing would be that hard because it looks like it should be simple that's turned out to be extremely complex or there's just a parallel there it looks doable then we see it's not and you put a lot of money in it and finally we're getting some results and that would be the argument let's just do it in our field and the same thing will happen and it's possible but I think the only downside of that is there's a limited pie of money and what's not being spent on by pursuing this goal but just as follow up with me closest as and what you're saying it probably means that we will probably have to spend as much money as we do in cancer which is probably ten times as much as being spent on all brain disorders so it's not surprising we've not moved the needle at this point in effect and that it took cancer maybe a better analogy is to think that we're about thirty years behind cancer that might be the best way to think about it at this point you know and that but that in order to get to work cancer is we're going to have to put more money in and I would not be as provocative as Bob I would actually say that the money that was spent on sort of fundamental neuroscience or fundamental biology is probably the best money spent because we really don't know the brain that well we think we do if you think about how why we move so quickly in terms of tackling HIV to a sort of a chronic disease is because of the fundamental biology of understanding how viruses replicate you know and so just basically emphasizing that neuroscience is not necessarily just linked to side cafe but we have to talk about neurology and then many other basically this money first of all is not a big amount from the basic science perspective to be honest compared to the cancer is like there would be not but but basically so this money is really not only understanding disease but also understanding how the brain functions which has different implications in the computer science or a society of problems or behavioral things which is nothing to do with an exact disease necessarily but still how we interpret each other social behavior wars and peace and a lot of implications so I think in fact I think there's no portion of the so would be a continuous and freshly spent on directly disease related and it's not a lot of money unfortunately and there's a lot of competition for this money that's I totally understand that it's not enough other field but I think it's not whether you put left or right the money just has to be conceptually different thinking of the governmental level for the city level so it's just a thinking but what we have not enough money going there I totally agree but it's not a problem the social basic science budget because it has to fight for no reason I pretty much agree with what's been said I would add something and suggest a possible inference one is I'm a strong advocate of basic research neuroscience is basic research like molecular biology or genetics the yield on that is greater than any other research we do but it has woefully little to do with psychiatry that's all I'm not arguing it's not interesting not relevant not helpful not practical it just isn't particularly related to psychiatry it's major relationship to psychiatry is the rhetoric of social funding you can't get somebody who's in control of a foundation to give you a hundred million dollars for connect dome study but you can for Alzheimer's study and therefore it requires someone who knows how to write the paragraph that starts with the statistics about Alzheimer's and ends with something there and ends with something about connect domes the other thing is that there is a sort of public image which makes perfect sense that we have these huge problems we have heart disease we have cancer we have mental illness and neurologic disease but it doesn't work that way from a biology point of view the brain is more complicated than the rest of the body put together the brain diseases are more challenging in terms of their understanding and treatment than all the other diseases we ever think of or treat that they're helped me we have basic scientists and I want help about 40% of all the genes go to the brain how much is it expressed probably 60 60% that's a measure of something or other but how do you express that's the question of course but just the magnitude is relevant in that we're dealing with what the maker thought was half of his problem and we know that anyone who ever went to medical school knows that you can slice all the other organs and then most biomedical research when I was involved in laboratory work started by slicing an organ and putting it in the wearing blender but you can't do that with the brain doesn't work that way so the fact that the brain is more than everything else in terms of the complexity of its problem is an important proviso so certainly we need more basic research psychiatry deals with very difficult problems and I think Francis is optimistic when he says 30 years that we're about 30 years behind you said that yeah Francis and I met 30 years I think we have to recognize that there's an order of magnitude difference in the problems we face when we talk about the future of cardiology or oncology or orthopedics or ophthalmology on the one hand and the future of psychiatry on the other one of the startling things we're going to face in the future of psychiatry is that most of the people will be treating 50 years from now we don't think of as being patients now because we haven't conceptualized how we can make a difference in their lives but the history of the last 50 years in psychiatry is we move from Ed's to major diseases schizophrenia and bipolar disease to recognize the huge pools of people out there who have personality disorders who have addictions who have problems in living that we're never thought of as medical or psychiatric but can be helped by interventions even at the food level we're at now I don't think we're going to see that growth of patients with cancer or heart disease or any other disease category but we are with mental health diseases but if I can't just go back to this cancer example I remember because Memorial Camp so cancer is just next door and we have a lot of collaborations so they were stuck with cancer like 20, 25 years ago they have been developing new drugs which are a little bit different than the previous one they certainly got a little increase but it's not tremendous movement and then suddenly there was a part of shift with this in therapy which was mentioned and nobody knew that it's coming nobody just came out from the dark and then obviously people have been working on it but suddenly there was a critical mass or critical finding the mass of critical findings which were translatable to humans in amounts one could do that well before but it had to be developed a technology where you could actually use it in humans and humans would tolerate this and I think in cancer research will tell you that there was a part of our shift because now I thought only personally but the the the curate is incredible it's very expensive but I think it's just you never know when it happens it can happen in next year and it can be in 50 years so but I'm just waiting for such a part of our shift which we don't really know as they didn't know that this will pan out because they are trying different things from bone marrow transplantation to different things but this for some reason became practical feasible in humans and actually this is but was it because of a I don't know it so well but is it because there were some basic meat made in immunology that made this happen? I'm not familiar I'm just hearing from them that this was just suddenly a change labs which switch to this kind of strategy they're far better and now we have these people who have been not not a spandex they suddenly a deeper of their throat basically they they have no chance they just come back this is what people need in psychology that somebody would be treatment treatment to just ask if a phoenix which is a really serious or an orthopedic side and then suddenly you have a treatment which we just cannot be comprehended today we should all study immunology at this point we have to return to study immunology that are important constraints for example the reason why they made the part of the reason why they made the progress immunology and so on is the ability to study cancer cells out there it's not that easy to study schizophrenia cells so cancer allowed you to study things in a completely different way from different angles and even now the treatment comes in from different. Well the lack of an animal model for schizophrenia I mean animal models for cancer have always been around it's a huge barrier I mean theoretically if there was an ant that could be a breakthrough some really amazing animal model for some of these illnesses came up that could be opened the door for a lot. I would say though that I think it might have been basic understanding of immunology because that actually also now we have drugs for MS multiple sclerosis that we didn't have and they're also in the immunotherapy realm also where they target the T cells so it turns out even if even neurologists just got lucky that it turns out that these advances that the drugs that they were making to basically make T cells quiescent are actually very effective for MS which and even and they didn't so I think this will and it's still a chronic disorder which was there's but they had nothing a decade ago you know the fact that they have four to three to four new drugs in the pipeline is still quite impressive so I think we were waiting for that moment also. So in terms of research where is the research in psychiatry in terms of those major illnesses I mentioned where is that research focused on? I think the genetics I would say most of the money right now is in genetics connectome these are the brain initiatives essentially in your imaging and then there's this continuum. A lot of money goes to epigenetic which is my epigenetic. But epigenetics I think just to mention for the audiences that basically what most people realize that genes do not solve the problem and we know that environment cannot work through genes so the concept came in that environment will actually produce some change in the DNA structure or the DNA function without changing a base pair so the sequence is the same but there are secondary modifications but if you view it from a function of perspective it doesn't really matter whether you have a mutation and it alters a gene function or you have a we call chromatin which is the larger assemble of DNA and surrounding proteins you can have that same functional change as a result of. So what we many people I know because it's pretty competitive know what is to write a grant but basically the chromatin is that you propose that environment whether this is early childhood adversity whether maybe it's a during pregnancy maybe the mother is depressed but there is something memory built into the child or a field DNA which is again not a change of the sequence but it's a permanent so the child will work with born with this it's a regulatory problem like a mutation would be and it ended up with a little bit different function at the gene level which is translated to a circuit level and then functional level one the child is less than typical even when his connection is made so I think that a lot of money goes into this which is fundamental is a very good concept and very new because we don't really know this we call this areas as a and want to sensitive areas maybe or we can call it marks or whatever you want to call but we don't really understand those but even outside of neuroscience epigenetics is also cancer cancer it's actually cancer is a more more developed phase again so we learn a lot from cancers but some of the cancer findings cannot be translated because the genes which are regulated are totally different and cancer you would have that how fast it's as proliferate or divide grow and in a sense more important how maybe a synaptic function is a little tailored so it's a little bit different and it's just several order of money to the more complex that's the problem the complexity but you pointed out which means that it takes more time but just to sort of simplify your work make less but what you've found in your own lab is that that this the level of stress of the mother the grandmother or the great grandfather or whatever all have impacts on the infant so we can trace down on the granddaughters I'm talking about animals here but there are some human studies but the granddaughters will carry the memory of a grandparent either you can have like stress infection or even early childhood adversity which is very relevant to psychiatry so so we can actually tell from the granddaughters DNA that the grandmother had some impact so that would be very useful to let's say you have a child and you are not sure whether the child will be more you see some sign maybe I'm not clinician but I can imagine that you have a child and you are not really sure whether the risk is very high or no but you see some signs you could go back and then test whether that child actually had some impact through some ancestor's life and you would say yes I see some impact so I would be more careful and maybe treat that particular individual and you can actually sample the epigenome not by having to get a brain biopsy but yeah we are doing from the blood actually from below we don't have to take cuter models so we just take a little blood and we can because the blood also responds to this and there is a correlation between the blood response to the brain response these are not so it's my talking of memory the memory in this case you cannot say this is how precise like an episode would be in our life or as room or remembering this environment it's really just the adversity component it's a negative balance of this whole situation which is really somehow alters certain genes which will be a genetic fingerprint so it's not a memory we like to use memory because everybody understands memory but it's a lose memory so you will not just remember you will not remember that the adversity occurred in A or B or C environment but you know that was some really bad experience it's not post-Trump Express's order where somebody can recall the exact location and going back to the same restaurant or a same battlefield it will have a reaction it is more of a general anxiety that in general the anxiety level is really high almost sometimes you don't even know why because the person doesn't have to have an input it's already built in the DNA chromatin or epigenome which was somehow predated maybe not even in the individual's life but in the ancestor's life so your mechanism is is beautiful and articulate and very sophisticated but that that that basic understanding that a person is affected by the the their ancestry psychiatrists have been saying for 150 years that's not new right so so the thing that worries me of course is that exact thinking is what got us to eugenics this idea that the best thing to do would be just eliminate those genes eliminate those people eliminate those races you know and with the obvious conclusion and what happened in Germany and so and the thing is that the scary part of those kinds of interventions is they they start off well intended and in the United States so it wasn't just you know these crazy folks in another country so again the question is so all right so you found this then what but yeah but but just expanding so what you would say that is known it was totally anecdotal there was no scientific evidence for that and in science you never believe so at least in basic science you never take it really true until you actually prove mechanistically so our standards are really mechanistic but for the standards of the time I mean but they looked at pedigrees they gathered data they interviewed families I mean for the standards of the time they do exactly the same thing yeah but yes so that was certainly a such an association we got association and now from scientific point of view you want to have the association to cause a relationship because if this association you cannot do anything about it because if two things can be associated and you influence one thing it doesn't feel like tonana things but my point is though for the standards of the for the scientific standards of the of the time 150 years ago that was true absolutely that was the true it wasn't I mean they believed that was causal now you're saying this is true and so I'm I wouldn't doubt that your science is more sophisticated question is 150 years from now is somebody going to look back and say well you know your science was all very nice but so and that's the that's the kind of but but a big difference is when you have a causative relationship then you have a chance to actually manipulate the system if an association then basically the two things are independent from each other it's a coincidental so you don't have the two you don't have the opportunity or a chance to actually influence your outcome with something which is correlated with so that's a difference but they thought they did I mean they thought they did but it's it's wrong the law of things I mean science we don't know that we don't know that our that our crude treatments because they're crude you know would match the sensitivity of that kind of science the treatment even in a SSRI sorry that's not really causative we don't want causative because it's a association so causative when you have an absolute known player molecule pathway which is linked to and then you manipulate the pathway and then then you fix the outcome so that's what we need for develop new drugs or any conditions where it is being shown specific epigenetic change is responsible for it so this is a this is this is another problem so there's not one single gene or single logos but and then we don't have a manipulation very multiple so that's very difficult to make the but I think that that's actually one way to think about it to figure out a way to work with multiple genes but I remember when I was school manipulating one gene was a total order nobody's that student field starting the lab and in my month the person can change that gene or single gene we can manipulate me three genes and if you asked these people this would be just a single cell and a lot of same cell they can manipulate thousands at the same time what we would need is that to manipulate hundreds of genes for thousands of genes in a complex mammalian neuron and just don't have a technology but people have been very working but in cancer aren't they using various H stack inhibitors right now yes try to affect the gene yes but they're not because selectivity that's also not enough they don't have it yeah select selectivity is really important that you basically target only those nothing else yeah and there's the the classical manipulation but we had 20 years ago develop we don't have to have we don't have any multiple genes a lot of genes because at all marketing so but not only the psychiatric condition of cardiovascular diabetes hypertension there's all the same problem and they cannot really prove because they have tens of hundreds genes one person has this combination other person that combination but we do know that this probably a lot of genes each has a very small contribution but you still need they have different constellations so these are all systems by which is I think system biology is another field which might need a lot of money but again much higher level than artificial intelligence would do nobody's which is one dimensional set fail I want to use this to segue to something that I think is often not seen this way but the availability of our finer tools for assessing genetic risk at the level even of an old means that we're really into a form of euthanasia except very early so when we decide to not implant a fertilized egg that's carrying the Huntington's gene that's just early euthanasia early eugenics biologically is the same thing we're clearing the population of a noxis gene by selecting who will support and who will destroy the Nazis waited a few decades afterwards before doing the same thing and we don't really have a dialogue socially about the meaning of that in our attitude toward it we're doing something you know way even more intriguing because the methods for doing this are available to some social classes and not to others so we've set up a system where if you're in a certain social class you get eugenics to get rid of bad genes and if you're in a different class you don't and we're going to distribute the bad genes class wise in the culture that's a very interesting psychiatric I don't know if it's a psychiatric issue maybe I think much of what our effective interventions might be in the next few decades maybe at the pre-implantation level of eugenics we can possibly get rid of some major psychiatric disorders if we have enough community acceptance of screening and selective implantation of fertilized of them that don't carry those disorders the thing that is I mean apart from the larger ethical issues of which there are many the other thing that strikes me is if we're trying to help say schizophrenia for focusing on schizophrenia where if we're trying to convince our patients who have schizophrenia that they have lives worth living that that that disease is not going to define them that they can live full lives that they have worth as a human and then at the same time we say that we're going to try to eliminate the genetic risk for that you know what does that say you know we care about you but actually we wish you hadn't been born I mean that and that you know we're not at a stage where we really have to wrestle with that other than as a thought experiment but that's we're close to it well depending on who yeah depending on who you talk to you know so just yeah totally agree and I guess we are just for accidentally open NIH and that's national super health that there's a whole branch trying to really address this question very relevant but I recall another effort from NIH which is more of a repairing the gene or genes so there are a lot of money goes into our field which is basically say this is a situation and it's a chart is born but can be really reestablished in normal regulation or whatever situation and now just a couple of weeks to people of you know the new technology where you can actually get in to sell again it's just a cell level we don't have the brain level but some yeah now some can do it and a single gene and you can actually repair it you can eliminate the physical or or or molecule problem and basically you it's very similar to to repairing an enzyme defect for example with a virus where you would have a child with an enzyme defect and it's pretty technically speaking is relatively simple because it's just an enzyme which is everywhere so you make make a white blood cell and this white blood cell be produced now and you exchange the deficient cells to their new the gene therapy so that's a similar concept except that you go to the brain cell or brain region and then you basically re-establish the normal situation it's it's a fiction and it's just laboratory things but it's certainly in the lab it's in a one-genent can be done and it's just five years ago that was the first of four years ago so there are new things happening yeah and we just need a larger I'm not only new things but we need a scale up from one it's always with one gene and then we have to have hundred genes simultaneously so it's going a little slow obviously well some degree of the repair of genes the technology is there now it's not only a mutation can repair you can reap this so-called epigenetic what I refer which is you know which is more complex you can repair that as well but the issue is in terms of mental illness is to first determine what genes we have talked about sugar yeah 100 dreams a small fact you can't be fixing those genes it's not going to make any difference but the whole idea is science that you have these hundreds of tracks of research and some people working with it and suddenly everything is just converge and that's the hope so they scale up the technology that they bring and we don't have access to the brain so we need new technology to get to the brain so when everything converges maybe a hundred years from now then then this is this is where you say maybe that was a birth to invest this money but otherwise we wouldn't be there and that's the hope but I think that was a hope in care sir the thing is though that our we do need to help our patients now and you know sure it isn't sexy but there is a lot in systems of care that we in psychiatry used to do a lot with the whole asylum movement the whole beginning of the the profession of psychiatry in the United States was based on systems of care this idea that we build the silums to take care of people to restore them to sanity and and so we have similar problems to what Dorothy the Dix was complaining about a hundred and seventy years ago we have people in the jails people in the streets people who are suffering who don't have family looking after them and in Michigan we are reinventing the idea that we need to take a look at state hospitals our Republican governors over succeeding decades closed most of our state hospitals and now all of a sudden we have to have a conversation about maybe reopening some reopening new new kinds of new systems of care and working on ways of taking care of people because gene therapy isn't available in our lifetime and it's hard to talk about that it's hard to say we need bricks and mortar we don't just need two different things so we have to talk about yeah I mean I'm not saying that you know the money should come from there I mean this is more a political issue actually what you're saying but for the patient the next 20 years neuroscience is probably not going to touch the problem at the social it's like you know probably be with all the astrophysics is not necessarily in our lifetime but we still pay or fund astrophysics or going to move or probably we won't be there in the next few years but still in some respects that's how humanity and then technology develops just to segue into something that might be a little more positive so even though I think that neuroscience is going to take 20 years there are certain things that and it just happens by Kirk Winston it's happening in my department but I put it in a Cornell we have figured one of the investigators at Cornell who's a psychiatrist has figured it out a way to use neuroimaging to subtype depression into four categories by the connectome and he is able to do it granted it's only one study of 1200 patients but he's able to basically get to do it with 90% specificity and sensitivity so he has the shot of actually possibly getting the first biomarker for a psychiatric disorder what subtypes where did the subtypes come from so what he did was he got 600 patients with major depression and then and for so of control made match controls got their resting state scans which I described theirs and basically through machine learning slash artificial intelligence asked the computer to tell them is there do these people fall into different subtypes do the brain connectomes look different from the controls and then the computer gave what they call a classifier sort of like yes here's a template where this this is the template for depression number one two three four then he took another set of samples of of 300 new people with depression or not depression or schizophrenia and this classifier could separate out people with schizophrenia versus depression with a hundred ninety nine percent precision and so so these are these are different subtypes and I'm just doesn't have no they're not phonological subs no these were the computer was not taught DSM so the computer was agnostic to it it was just looking at it essentially and each subtype has a slightly different abnormality in connectivity with the prefrontal cortex or first of all he can he confirmed that the prefrontal cortex is probably very important for major depression and they all have slightly different what they don't look different clinically is the point right I guess that was they really don't look that different clinically miraculously subtypes actually fall into anhedonic anxious they actually do really amazingly do and it was not taught the computer was not taught this and so that felt that's life yeah so that essentially they naturally which makes sense that if you're anhedonic then the hub that's involved in the reward circuitry is probably going to be the one that's broken while the one that's that where you're sort of more anxious is going to be probably more prefrontal cortical because of the anxiety circuits related there so it fell out naturally and now we're going but what is so remarkable is that so there's another form of treatment called trans-magnetics stimulation which is which we had wild enthusiasm ten years ago but has shown to be only effective for 40% than mild for mild to moderate depression what he found was was that only one subtype responded optimally to TMS so now the new clinical trial he's running is to do a that was a retrospective study that he did now he's doing a prospective study to see whether or not he can subtype them ahead of time then give them TMS and basically see whether or not that this is actually going to hold up but you can sort of now see how you can use this not obviously we say psychiatrists and psychologists and social workers we can diagnose pretty well but what this can tell you is is that what he noticed was was that after the people who responded to TMS their connect home changed to normal so basically you now have not only a diagnostic tool but something that could probably tell you whether or not the treatments you've had will possibly effective or not effective in changing at least one sort of non at least some objective measure and stuff but the future would be at least only in Cornell the media other than you would get your brain scanned in the outpatient clinic if you come in for depression and then basically then then different treatments would be tailored to that it sounds very but human one brain scan will tell you this yes so basically because he got the computer to come up with what they call it a computational classifier so then the classifier will then sort of sort it out and just say this you fit into biotype one two three or four and and so then and and if you put in someone who has schizophrenia they go you don't fit into any of these biotypes you know you do not you're not depressed so he's now trying to develop the schizophrenic biotype and the bipolar disorder biotype but for now he started with depression so but you but the reason why this was possible was because so many people country and and we're doing resting state scans so he didn't have to scan 1200 people he got people's data from 1200 people from 1200 subjects from and then just use the computer to basically do the analysis I think this is probably what's going to happen and that's why it's still important to do all these studies because who knew that this 10 minute resting state scan was going to be so important for this type of work I think you know and some ideas that we could be basically be able to tailor things but it is really quite remarkable even to me it's hard to wrap my mind around the fact that the brains has an intrinsic connectivity that can be picked up in 10 minutes it's in fire an MRI machine essentially that's been around for 50 years essentially technology was always there you know what he only what he did is he was just like he just put the pieces together and he was able to do this yeah so but replicates psychiatry is full of 50 years of starting to DST of tests that look like they're going to be great so two replications are now being written up for the replication spritifier type thing so people from other universities not us really that's for depression not for any other it's not depression that'd be pretty damn good if you have that we're we're very we'll see what happens but what's really nice is is that and and I the thing that I got from it was then we've all we've we've also begun or he and begun doing um anxiety disorders because that's the disorder and the people with anxiety disorders fall into that again our office the brain did not read DSM and truly gonna be these gonna and they're not the sort of problems are probably going to be very different for each sorry yeah I can assure you that I hope it replicates too but that's enough domestic notes so we can stop the open if you have a question you want the years facts and look at various fields of science over the years and how many years it took for half the things before the truth to be no more true so I'm wondering if you should you how many years will take the half of what you think is true now if you're not true yeah I'm not going to predict the future but I will tell you a funny story about yeah I found a book that was written from the American College of Pharmacology and in I think 1965 they wrote this book called Psychopharmacology in the year 2000 where they were predicting and they were drugs that people have helping them because we weren't going to solve the food problems but but Holisty was the answer to everything was going to cure outcome it was going to cure skin it was everything and then two years after this book was in the United States take long well what I was going to say we're back to hallucinogens now we're back to we're not going to have they not banned it maybe over the 30 years we'd actually have to stop it that was a big mistake okay that's going to be true or not true yeah like that that's the way paper that you can laugh at when it's funny the other you know you had an issue he was writing a paper about the ARDOC project people so our project was an attempt to toss out the DSM approach terminology and the tree base the idea is we're going to discover the the circuits of the brain and then we're going to build up you know this huge all these studies were going to explore treatments went out in the limit said in 15 years it will happen it was so off and the thing to me is the full predicting something in 15 years because those are these are all ever so you're right I mean assume a lot of what we now is going to be thank you doctor Lee at the end you mentioned our models to different in a rest of the brain from a typical brain look these are in huge these are in patients patients um and it's made me wonder what what is a healthy brain someone that doesn't meet any criteria for any just DSM disorder but you're absolutely right there are there people who don't it's sort of a circular argument but so I think what I think we don't have a really good idea of what brain is it's just what we call brain so brain these things codified as we have an idea of what the healthy mind is but analysts have figured that out thank you for the my question is with some questions about which way funding should go what will be the field what's the patience in patients and what values should guide institutional uh what values should guide medicine and administration what's the future of pakkari grants no questions so better so kakkari grants are supposed to be so there's been a we whatever various new things then we'll to the community that seem to look what really center but they're too complicated or something to be implemented and so they're supposed to be something where you take a treatment and grant is to actually dominate it's for example I think the types of grant early at the end of behavioral therapy that has been validated institution can you to the queen's the queen's clinic and have trained the people there and then rally around money is how sorry uh that the bigger question is is that we actually don't just to sort of segue we actually don't have the workforce liver mentioned the treatment percent of twenty percent of our population how that workforce sure i'm not actually sure i would say that no i think what rashed it out for the grants has been mainly due to the other treatment more sophisticated behavioral treatments have been able to be implemented and but it's probably because they don't have enough providers that can deliver it somewhat to pick up a thread that two threads of Dr. Mike uh one of them about about prevention and the allocation uh about being i'm going to echo that also uh given how we started off with the progress with the genetic research um given that we spent most of the time talking about that that this means so what what does that mean so i will offer a an interpretation is considering where we are and that and that and that there's an enormous cultural almost delusional denial of um of the source of most technology which which Dr. Michael's mentioned which has something to do with early development early development early attachment traumatic traumatic abandonment early childhood even even we know data from moving to another country the the the the and mental illness and yet there's no money uh being provided for that kind of research so i suggest we take all of the money and for my then we may just for our just the neuroscience research uh i think you mentioned expectation the nano m goose Need you going and how can you start the last section? I do. For Patrick, my picked up on the Def radiant road area. That's for 60 years. You know, I really want you to see 24 years old and you know. Yes? properly. Thank you. Sorry, By the fact that the Okay. This is if they were broken brains. We've just added another type of... Other. Okay. A person... Then he did case conferences. Okay. The conferences had less details about... That is a strong indication that there's a war of pharmacogenetic testing and getting history. Several comments. I'll start with the last one. I think the psychological psychodynamic immunity is probably in favor of talking to patients, listening to them and getting to know them in fine texture and detail, which you feel a member of, I suspect, from what you said. I think that community has failed to demonstrate value added from the information it collects for the majority of psychiatric patients. So although we may not like it, the fact is that if you want to be cost effective, the first thing you do is make a de-assist, then use the standard treatment for that diagnosis and wait eight weeks. A third of your patients will be better. And there's no point in finding out how they felt about their mother. It's irrelevant to the outcome of the intervention. If your focus is on the outcome of the intervention, you'd focus your subtle nuanced history-taking and relationship development on the group of patients who need it and might profit from it. But the community doesn't like doing that. And it has an almost ethical quality. It's not humanistic. No orthopedic surgeon worries about being humanistic before setting a colleagues fracture. But psychiatrists do sometimes, or conversely, they don't because they're tired of those that do, and they're arguing with them. So your DSM diagnoses begin to, in many psychiatrists' hands, substitute the person is sitting next to you on the bus. It's an unsolved problem. It's a major problem in psychiatric education. So that if you travel around the country and you make rounds and things like that, you find a fair number of young psychiatrists are very happy if they can document a DSM-5 diagnostic conclusion, even if they don't have the biggest idea who it is they're talking about. On the other hand, the research problem, not resolved, is when does it make a difference? And very importantly, when does it not make a difference? Even more provocative. I think the lack of engagement in the reaching of a proper diagnosis. Sometimes people being in an house, sometimes they're even doing it proper work. Sometimes. I would agree with it. I think too often. I think you can't do it. I created a structured interview for research. I see people do horrible jobs because they don't ask the right, you know, get below the surface. I mean, it's not a checklist. Nobody who's ever worked with a DSM has ever claimed otherwise. However, because it looks so simple, people, there's a human nature here to do this simple quick thing. And the DSM, you could argue it's one of the worst things that happened because it's a loud psychiatrist to do what our colleagues and the rest of medicine do, which is trying to do the quicker thing, like getting a bunch of blood tests and not talking to the patient. So it's facilitated that. It's had a plus. I think it's treatment and people have responded better, but there's a huge cost. And I agree about the psychiatric education. It's up to psychiatric education to go against that tendency for people to want a cookbook approach and tell them over and over again, that is not going to get good results. Now, unfortunately, it would be nice if there were studies that could actually show for sure that they would check actually in an outcome. It's hard for me to believe that it would be something I could do so quite a bit. God, people who... God, it's my gift. What do you think? Don't. Who's going to fund that? You're right. It would be a great thing to do. There's also an ideology in the profession. You're patient in depth that it's almost virtually rather than efficiency or efficacy. Right. And that's a weak argument in a competitive world. No, you're right. You see how we've gotten where we are. And it'd be great if we can undo that with data. If you had thought, like, the head of some federal finance, health finance, and said, well, we need to do this, then they would ask, well, just show me why we should invest in billions in this direction rather than in this direction. We need that study. A series of it. Well, we may be going backwards and having to do that retrospectively with the current generation of kids we're raising now. We're raising an entire generation of consumers of mental health care who think that all they have to do is sit there and somebody will do it. They will do a checklist. They'll get a diagnosis, they'll get a pill. Then they roll in that. It's our failure to treat rather than their failure to engage. So I just had a patient in the hospital, a 19-year-old student. And we get a lot of university students that U of M on the inpatient unit. And she had depression, I don't know what that means for this teenager, but she'd been on every drug I could name. She'd gotten ECT. She had never engaged with therapy because as far as she was concerned, that was effort that she didn't want to put into. And we were done. She was still depressed. She was not bothering to go to surgery. And she needed to actually put some work in. And she didn't want to hear that. She wanted the magic pill. We're raising a generation of consumers of mental health care to not take a role in their own recovery. And I worry about that. I'm pleased that we've repositioned and we still have the beginning, the sociologic. My question, I have that statement. Have any of you been studying? Now there's anxiety. Anxiety may be identified as a good state if it's no guided correctly. A person is facing something in society that is not right. Again. It's a symptom. Not necessarily, it's a state. It's not bad. I mean, we all know, you know, if you have a test due and you don't have enough anxiety to study for, you're going to fail it. Anxiety or adaptive parts of being human being. You can't live with that. Like if we don't. No. Okay. Sounds like well until they GG not thereby I'm not sure. Deal with illness in that context, but when you have these systems coupled with some disability that's causing, it somehow impacts the ability to function. What you need to do is work. The symptoms are getting severe enough. It's always been normal. Every day in pre-op, you agree with that. So there's always a point where you figure out when these symptoms are healed, when they become saturated. By case basis, it can be very hard to do, but it's a bullet. Let's... My name is... I am in terrestrial. I suggest to me, I would like to have an answer to it. David... The man who can stop... Obsessive compulsory disorder. My question here is that in the review of the book that I have, Adam Argyz. He is in favor of a more complex... Regests from my categorical approach, mental illness, which the categorical approach driven by the DSM. Thank you. I'm in... That was the... When did the preparation... The... The... The... The... The... The... The... The... The... The... Ya... What it... I mean, I was expecting... And you know I was meeting the guy, I remember he... And it was an answering test over for life, and it... F Tian Michael... I, my... The rest of medicine is categorical. And to measure people's a U.S. category. So this tension between measuring and recognizing that there has to be a point where you go from a measurement to a category. The DSM has been people reified. They think these boundaries in the book handed down from something, not the high. And somehow they have some meaning to really shouldn't have. I've always seen it as a lifelong deal. But yeah, it's a good thing with it. So we're struggling with what happens to the cat and how they become real clinicians to practice because you wouldn't know time to give medicine. Right now, if you have five out of nine symptoms of depression, and all the clinical trials would use that definition, you could say, well, if my patient's version of depression, the one that was in the trial, I don't know their probability of responding to this treatment is because that's what the study is in the article about not enough for an illness. And the boundaries are yes, that you have to, that's why it says at the front of the book, when you go into training and see patients to be able to get the feel of what they are. But the... is they opened the door up to continuous revisions. They realized that it was ordinary to see the years we were going to redo the whole book. Now they said, one of the reasons they did that is very difficult to roll in the electronic world. The belief is you can't do that. And now there's actually a committee set up that anyone outside can make proposals. Now, if you make a proposal, you have to have the data to back it up. But the... The other thing with the system, it's great in theory and very critical of... have had issues with this and this... to something that are not criteria. But the dimensions are incredibly... sort of a lot of... want to put a little bit of control on it. There you don't. But systems that were created by a second. So you have their own professional stake in all... So complicated that I can't imagine anybody actually using... these factor analyses with, you know, 20 different domains and if you're high in this... it's like a... Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's incredibly complex. So it's... any more... it's not... it's one set of problems. Okay. Thank you. The issue which... is... this observes, in general, dimensional approaches... observe information. Hetagorical approaches discard information when you reduce multiple dimensions and... the... you're willing to spend a lot of time... clinician... to throw out data. They have... so that you might guess... 20 diagnoses and certainly not much... and there's an argument... DSM is a fission... for repurpose. It says that... the first sentence of the introduction. But the authors of DSM are largely not... they're largely invested... primary loyl... well, of you disorders. Lots of data... but the dimensions are most complex. So the committee that was supposed to solve the problem... came up with a dimensional system. Then the parent can be worried about it... and extra committees were brought in to review it... and decide about it. And we ended up with both of you, losing. If somebody was in treatment that was correlated... the dimensions would suddenly become very, very popular. Yeah, I agree with that. Thank you. Thank you very much for participating in this. It's been very good to hear everybody's... I just... when you guys were referring to the issue that... as... the separation that occurred at the turn of the century... with Freud versus Jiasper. You know... don't really... in the proper way. I think that there was a group of people... that were mainly in psychiatrists... dealing with a population... which was... history... in individuals... whereas Jiasper and the German philosophical psychiatrists... were looking at people who were much more profoundly dysfunctional. They were in... and... had different depths of illness. Jiasper's and his treaties... had... not... the meat... and... the biological psychiatrists have seen some kind of biological basis... whereas the outpatient psychiatrists predominantly were... what... is that... or that... but continued for a century. And... in complete... it's pretty clear that... the first... and... sort of termed profession so Can I silence? biggest As if they are you know Disciplines these are Event and that's One of the leading Misunderstandings because what's happened is that you know 100 genes About the brain is a Psychiatry from a lot of the Two Disciplines that deal with the brain No Which is much more linear and I mean of course they've expanded because at one point they were Taking out because you could find the lesion and they thought they were all gonna be Part of which was initially Met for communal let's go and leave Represent Oracle level organization that has its own code so Answers that becomes misleading it's too linear for the majority of Orders that are based on genetics usually it's in the why there hasn't been more Literature that has been able to prove is because of course linear Mechanisms are much much easier to so now we start to understand that those people The world is what is making them feel When they take Can you come to a closure because there are people wait we have to stop I But That's why you You can't rule water you Those are the most important things that make life worth living those are the things that are of the mind and even blood The information theorists When he said you know was the father of information it's not really about information that he proved it was just statistically Your data, okay? Thank you made your point Hi as a data person myself I wanted to offer up the results from a literature review out of the University of Colorado Denver's School of Medicine They looked at analysis of all the published studies up until 2012 on anti-depressant use versus the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy and what they found was that the effect size and The study there were 74 studies on the use of anti-depressants alone was point three Which means about three standard deviations between the control group and the intervention group that received Antidepressants and when they looked at studies and where patient where they had control groups versus patients that had received psychodynamics I could be the average effect Standing it seems that there's something about establishing a client's a Relation focus on expressing feelings when those things are established in the treatment patient You You Answer myocardial infarction or tuberculosis or dentistry Right we be horrified that's important there are different treatments there are several types of psychotherapy Cognitive behavior therapies very popular Dynamic therapy is the beloved of dynamically oriented psychiatrist pharmacotherapy Treatments seem to have a order of magnitude similar effect to mild to moderate depression My own reading is that with severe depression the pharmacotherapy shows an advantage But even more striking you don't even mention it the most effective treatment for severe depression is electroconvulsive therapy There's a huge amount of data that it's not even in your in your survey But again more important You Midge of depression is your well Pressed Cover or you may need treatment and then you get better and then you're well again That's not the natural history of depression the majority of depressed patients have a long-term usually lifelong Pre-disposition or vulnerability to depression and they have more than one episode And therefore an important goal of the treatment is to modify that vulnerability and the likelihood of subsequent episodes We've been medically effective in that with bipolar disease, but that's a small amount of total depression It's not quite clear how effective we are Want to Know is that if you continue the treatment indefinitely it continues to work, but no patient continues treatment indefinitely Pathologic transfer No, no go we have a problem I don't finish Blind though is You That the drugs are effective take the drugs first in fact the best drugs we have help about one third of the patients who take them That's not widely recognized partly because the pharmaceutical industry doesn't advertise it that way They'll tell you two-thirds of the patients who take the drugs get better, which is true But with a placebo One-third of the fact efficacy our best pharmacological treatments affects one-third of the people who take the treatment The same might be true of our psychotherapy in terms of reading depression Look on your face you like that No, it's the other gentleman I think first I'll be quick I'm interested to know what the panelists think about the future hope for psychiatric treatment by hallucinogenics specifically civil, Simon and cheming interested to know what the state of the The situation is now and what the prognosis is for future research and application It's still pretty early. I think that studies are not so suddenly that the ketamine story So it's kind of illegal to give and easier to study As with most things it's got a little height in the beginning But as more studies are being done, there's clearly solid evidence that people Respond to ketamine and people who don't who are treated resistant depression and don't respond anything else Sometimes respond to ketamine the problem with ketamine of course is requires continuous treatment and we don't know how Often we can get there's a lot. We don't know there's a signal there that has been now established I want to take it will be better for one week But that's about as far as we know as far as the rest of the psychedelics go again There's a signal there as well. I mean this is a sad thing is because of you know what happened in the 60s and the overreaction to the misuse of psychedelics these things a bit out of the hands of researchers for 40 50 years now Luckily and it's coming back in and the studies are now coming in more and more that the clinical trials for all kinds of you know originally with cancer patients who were terminal because you know There's only people who could be given the meds. They were allowed and they got a very good results And and it's now they're trying for more more application than the future of psychedelic Treatment is looking very promising so I but the problem is we don't want to start telling people they should go buy mushrooms on the street And start taking it because there's so much that's unknown dosing and these things have bad effects even that you know The studies that you still aside in their certain It's complicated Like what is the placebo that's a problem because you're right people know I think I Have something has fact so we'll say I think we'll stop after this. Thank you. So there were two that were brought up one was between medicine and psychiatry You know Somatic medicine doctors and psychiatrists and the other contrast was this between Book was from my generation the way patients is better No patients, but it seems to be that there's kind of been an irony that in the course of my career as a psychiatrist We're I've watched medicine people very interested in narrative. So now with Columbia. You get a master's degree in narrative medicine and the medical courses That's psychiatry We we Abticated great skills in the sense and it's funny to me that we're not the ones teaching narrative medicine to the nation of medical students And what Almost universal myth that's untrue and is interesting Of course was not a psychiatrist Freud was a neurologist who treated patients who ended up with we know the rest of this but the Psychiatry grows out of general medicine neurology wasn't a specialty Freud was seeing his patient outpatient with physical symptoms the History analysis into its moving away from medicine and away from psychiatry but in fact Analytic interview skills and patient recognition are most With not The collided patient Who are supposed to learn the or used to be supposed to learn these although the inpatient seriously mental Popular Skid disease They're much more important Physically ill or La But Stuff on an inpatient Shant you Deafs, you know You You Hospital He's not taking his meds anymore after him so there's a The story and it's funny at University of Michigan Reinvented a medical humanities program quarters of the Because we say our stuff we need to admit okay I'm a fourth year medical student applying for psychiatry So very interesting this talk and really thank you all for being here today So my question when I visit the future and understanding all the neuroscience We're talking about immunology and more target therapies nanobots hallucinogen All the neuro stimulation before well hearing from this is the future of psychiatry sounds more like Reallocating resources delivering care Is my future psychiatrists are we going to see more the acceleration of kind of fancy new therapies modalities or should we really be advocating for spending money where it's going to be both impactful things like housing or the early challenge vengeance Shotted so in five years after you finish your residency you will only see the most ill patients And then at some point so that most of the other mild to moderate will hopefully be taken care by primary care or some other You will at some point realize that treatments that your armamentarium you have is limited then you will go I heard this talk about Salas Ivan I got to do something for my patients This is why I think there's such great interest because we have a limited repertoire of what we can offer our very very ill patients And we
