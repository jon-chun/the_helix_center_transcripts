At her career, her work has been funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. She also currently directs an NIH pre-doctoral training grant on mechanisms of learning across development and species. Paul Harris is the Victor S. Thomas Professor of Education at Harvard University. His research is in the development of cognition, emotion and imagination, reflected in his past books, Children and Emotion and the work of the imagine, his most recent book, Trusting What You're Told, How Children Learn From Others, which received an Eleanor Maccabee ward from the American Psychological Association and the Book Award of the Cognitive Development Society, describes his current studies of how children learn about history, science and religion on the basis of what trusted informants tell them. Regina Pally is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice with a special interest in parents and couples. She has studied and written about neuroscience for mental health professionals and the lay public. In 2008, she founded the Center for Reflective Parenting, whose mission is to promote healthy child development by strengthening the bonds that children have with all those who care for them through an emphasis on reflective thinking. The current focus of her writing is reflective parenting in relationship to child development, brain development and the parent-child relationship. Colin Phillips is professor and distinguished scholar, teacher in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Maryland, where he directs the Language Science Center and is a scholar of the Neuroscience and Cognitive Science program. He investigates the mental and neurocoding of language, children's effortless acquisition of language and linguistic illusions. His research has investigated 15 languages and he directs Langscape, an online portal for language diversity that combines interactive mapping with diverse resources for 6,400 languages. He's also an advantage of science, a broadly interdisciplinary field that connects fundamental science with applications in education, technology and health.

Paul Zilinski is a children's book illustrator and writer, a winner of numerous awards, including the Caldicott Medal for his Retelling of Rapunzel and three Caldicott Honors for Hanselungrettle, for Rumpelstilskyn and for Swamp Angel. His styles range from Renaissance-inspired oil paintings for his fairy tales to more cartoonish drawings of the reason Z is for moose. Certain of his books, particularly The Wheels on the Bus, one of my sons, all-time favorites, by the way, communicates strikingly well with learning disabled or autistic children. He holds an MFA in painting from the Tyler School of Art and a BA from Yale College, where he was the first class that Murray Sendak ever taught. He sits on the board of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, co-chairs the Children's and Young Adult Committee of Penn American Center, and volunteers with other organizations that promote books and literacy for children. And now on to our panel. Well, I'm particularly glad to be here today on my own turf. I guess I'm the only one who's used to this building and this organization. But many years ago, Paul and I met, we were classmates in college, although we didn't know each other in college, but I knew his name because my children grew up on the wheels of the bus and Rumpelstilskyn. And they came to the reunion, and after Paul and I started talking in the Peabody Museum where all the dinosaurs were, I asked my kids if they would like to meet him because I figured they'd be so excited about the books and actually meeting the man who had done the illustration. And my daughter was in fact very excited because she said she had never met a living author before. That might be one illustration of the difference between children and adults' lines. I didn't grow up wanting to be a children's book maker because I had the same point of you. I didn't really know that living people did them. And I had books that were very important to me, but I kind of assumed they were made by dead people. It's largely true, I guess. Well, I don't know if we should just join in, but I'm stimulated to think about, in, I've always been fascinated with why children are so fixated on stories. I used to tell my kids stories and I could do, I could take nine-hour card trips with them as long as I kept up the story. And so fast forward, now that I'm studying about the neuroscience of the brain, I'm writing a book on reflective parenting. My research, I came up, there's a lot of research on the importance of storytelling, stories, telling stories, reading stories, talking about stories, discussing stories, in terms of the development of reflective thinking in the mind, and that children learn a lot from their encounter with stories. And even part of their imaginative play is involved in making sense of how the mind works and other people, particularly other people's minds. We all have privy to our own minds, but it's other people's minds that are troublesome. And telling stories seems to be a really important component of child development. Is that different from the patterns, the importance of stories? Stories seem to be the way advertising agencies glom on to people's wish to buy things. Everything gets better when it's attached to it. It is, I think we're all drawn to stories because we can personally relate, but theoretically a person, an adult's mind should be developed by now. And the child's mind is actually developing in relationship and how they will discuss stories and what the points are that they're able to comprehend will be different. It's just a developing process. But there was a neat study published a couple of years ago, I think, it was done here in New York, and they got the adult subjects to read fiction. And after this brief dose of fiction, they tested them on various psychological insights. And the people who'd read fiction, I mean George Elliot, as opposed to John Grisham say, did better on these psychological insights. So even adults have room to grow under these circumstances. And certainly one of the most important functions of stories are stories about ourselves and about our families and about the people in our families. And it's through those stories largely that children come to establish that sense of self, that sense of self as separate from, but related to others in the family. And those stories form the core of our autobiographical or personal memories that obviously are very important to us and that we hold most dear. So Patricia, can I ask you a bit more about that because you've done so much research on infantile amnesia and the sort of recovery from it, so to speak? Recovery from it, actually, I refer to, thank you, I refer to it as the onset of childhood amnesia. We often think about childhood amnesia that as adults we have difficulty remembering the early years of our lives. And often that's talked about as when we start to have autobiographical memories as the offset of childhood amnesia. I actually think conceptualized the other way, that it's the offset when we begin to retain those stories. We're always, those stories, those events, those memories. We're always forming them, even infants. We were talking about your 10-month-old grandchild, your 10-month-old grandchild is forming memories and retaining them for short periods of time. And it's as we become able to retain those memories over longer periods of time that we see the offset of that childhood amnesia. And that's one of the centers of study in autobiographical memories. Why is it that even though children are forming memories that we as adults have difficulty retaining them? It's one of the great mysteries of in the memory research literature. So can we probe the mystery of the research? I suppose if we look back at the last 20 years of research on infants, there's been dramatic evidence of how smart toddlers are. I mean, 9-month-olds, 12-month-olds. You give them a social scene. They can work in kind to whom, who's been nasty to whom, and they prefer the person who's kind and so forth. So in some sense, they have all the intellectual or cognitive equipment to lay down a little narrative in their growing brain. So that makes it all the more mysterious that in fact virtually none of us have memories from our first year of life or even our second year of life. There's growing evidence that what we, what accounts the, the, the, this amnesia is accelerated for death. So as you say, their, their forming memories, they're able to create a representational trace. They're able to use the same brain structures that we as adults use to form those memories. But the immediate experience, cognitive work has to be done to turn an immediate experience into an enduring memory trace. And the neural structures that are responsible for that transformation are very slow to develop. And I talk about this as kind of a leaky sieve that as infants, certainly they're forming memories, but a lot of the information that makes up a memory representation kind of leaks out and it leaks out more rapidly than it does for adults. And there's actually the, there's a growing body of literature demonstrating that it could be forgetting that we think is therefore accounting for the loss of those memories that are formed and are held on and retained for some period of time, but then ultimately become the victim of a fall victim to the. So what is it that ultimately clogs that sieve and makes sure that that the holes get about this is the colander memory that if you have lasagna noodles and you have a colander with big holes in it and you dump your lasagna noodles in, the water rushes out, but the lasagna noodles stay in. But memories aren't like lasagna noodles. They're like orzo, those little tiny bits of pasta. And if you're going to make orzo and successfully hold on to it, you can't pour it into a colander with big holes, you have to pour it into one of those fine mesh nets. And what happens over the course of the development is that with neural, neural changes, we trade in essentially our holy colanders for nets. Hold the grid. So the way you're saying it there, it's suggesting that it's the container that is changing over time. So is it the orzo is changing over time? The way I cook it, it gets more sticky and it doesn't go through. There you go. I actually think we're developing cheese sauce or something of that nature. So the elements of orzo, we infants are encoding the same bits and pieces of information, maybe not as many as elaborated. And they don't have as much of the sticky stuff to hold it together. I wonder if this goes back to the point about the stories. Yes, indeed. As adults, we're good at making a story out of our experiences. We can connect all of the different things going on. Life isn't as inherently structured as it gives you is something which has the narrative made more explicitly. And it has all those connections built in. Is it the earliest stage? Is it the case that the pieces of the memories are there? But because it lacks the connections between them, because it lacks the narrative, that means that the individual pieces are more fragile. And I think that we have beautiful data to speak to exactly that. That the more coherent that story is, the longer that memory tends to live on, and less coherent memories that aren't very well connected to each other. Those are the ones that fall prey to forgetting particularly rapidly and particularly vulnerable to that kind of forgetting. So the story is the cheese sauce, the story is the starch in the pasta grains, and that really does play a very critical role in maintenance of those events and stories. So, the role of language, though, so by the time the chart is two, two and a half, they're starting to tell these little stories, which is the kind of rehearsal, which is the kind of strengthening, right? Yes, yes. Yes. And I certainly speak to that in terms of development, yes, the children have, you know, they can tell you who did what to whom. But that kind of reflection on the significance or the importance of that experience. So the fact that, you know, this actor A did something to actor B, can be encoded in a very elemental way, or it can be encoded with respect to how that impacted you as an individual and the impact it had on the actors and the meaning that that has for the child's life. And I think that that's what's critically missing in many respects in very young children. Right. So children are quite prepared in the development of the form of language. But in understanding the uses that we put it to, that tends to be much more delayed. So they will say things that we can do a little bit more than they may do themselves. You know, I think also there's a big part of this that has to do with learning or memory for what? What's the purpose? And the purpose of the infant, if I could put it that way, is to learn how to attach to that person who's going to be the reliable source of safety, comfort, soothing, not just food, but the whole emotional, social interaction. It's the very first purpose, I say, of what's going on. It comes into the world really skilled at knowing how to do that, as long as there's an environment that engages the child in that way. So what you need to know and keep in memory is really ultimately what's relevant to your life. And what isn't so relevant should be forgotten. I call it forgettery. There's memory and forgettery. And you need to forget. It's a good thing to forget what's not relevant. And because the brain, while it can hold on to millions of pieces of information, billions of pieces of information, it's still a limited place. And particularly conscious memory. How do we know? How do we know that though, at the moment? It's only sometimes in reflection, in thinking back that you see the relevance of it. Well, that actually was good. Yes, exactly, that's a really good point. We don't know in the beginning what's relevant, which is children are much, at least my understanding of it, is children are much more good at learning kind of generalities. And later on, they learn more specifics. And so they need to hold on to those generalities to see what's going on in a specific situation. And you don't know, you have to be open-ended for the many potentials. With a good specific, fairly quickly, after all, by the time they're 10 or 11 months, they're attached to a particular person. At 10 or 11 months. You're talking about it. So you're talking about it up until that point, they're more into generalities. Yes, and I think in general, it takes a long time for a child to learn. You know, there's the furry animal. But first, they learn furry animal before they learn kitty, sheep, bunny. That's what I mean. And that there are categories of experience that apply in a very general way. Which I think one of the things children are kind of learning and playing with. So they can say open-ended, yeah. But one thing we know is that memories are not necessarily accurate. And that memories change as they're needed or not needed. So clinically, if we can get one story from a child, that that is. And we've told with great detail and specificity about an event. When we talk to the parents, they say it actually didn't happen that way. And one of Freud's most moving, and I think important papers, was on screen memories. I don't know if you're familiar with that, which is the ability of a childhood event. Which has a very specific quality of being very, very clear. And often the person who's remembering this doesn't remember seeing it through his own eyes, but remembers observing it as though he were watching something else happen. And what makes the paper so moving is he talks about his own memory of an important event in childhood. And what it means for his adult experience. But I think clinically we see this all the time with kids. I think part of what they remember is what's useful in explaining something right now. I made a mistake. I was mistreated. I didn't get something that other kids got. And might not have happened. But it's remembered with absolute clarity. I think that one of the things that we find challenging is finding the expert who actually does really remember the event. And in our longitudinal studies with children, we also involve typically their mothers. Because their mothers are bringing them into the laboratory each time and are willing to participate as a longitudinal participant. And one of the things that's very striking is the fragility of adults' memories as well. So sometimes I think we overestimate the extent to which the adult has the right answer or the right perspective on the event. And sometimes it's the child whose memory may be more of a radical. The type of mental mind to eating, and I think a sense of memory is because somehow everybody I think your microphone is not on my answer. Well, that's a beautiful question. What do we mean by a memory? And what do we mean by an event? It is my weekend trip to New York to participate in this wonderful discussion. Is the event picking up this bottle and taking a drink out of it, right? To what extent where we parse the events is also something that is, we know very little actually about how we parse events. And what's the beginning, the middle of an end of an event? And again, as you sometimes reflect back, it's the beginning of that relationship. Here I'm going to encounter on the subway or something. But it turns out that that was the beginning of an event. We don't always know. Well, with children, that is a key part of what we got off their mind. Those experiences, those events are what is helping develop the mind of that particular child. Absolutely. It must be, it can't be just limited entities that we can bring out of them. Well, I think the thing that is important is we know, I mean even adults talk about memory of an event as if an event happened or there was a specific event or that everybody would see the event in the same way. And one of the signs of maturity, and we're going to talk about children, I mean one of the, I like to think about this, one of the purposes of childhood is to learn how to become an adult. And so as an adult, probably the greatest sign of maturity of the adult mind is the capacity to realize everything is perspectival. I like to say beauty is in the eye of the beholder and so is everything else. That everything is perspective. And the capacity to realize that your perspective is really only one perspective and there's always somebody else's perspective. I mean in this panel we could take the same water bottle, I'm sure, and have whatever number of people there are here, different perspective or even the whole. This is one of the things we're really teaching children, aren't we? It's about a theory of mind, thank you. I just feel like telling us the thing about a memory that I had myself that was sort of like Freud's screen memory, I guess, that I was reading a Babar book to my then very young daughter and came to a page, it was a page with a monkey ville where all the monkeys were climbing, roped ladders and living in the houses in the trees. And I suddenly remembered this same page from when I was very young. It's not a memory that I remember going over and over. Again, it wasn't part of my life, it wasn't really an important thing. But I suddenly was seeing this thing that I had seen as a kid and it was different. I was seeing almost a double exposure of two different pictures on the same page. I was really very disappointed with the current one. So much detail and imagery in the other one. So the memory of an image, it's a creative act. It must have been important to you in some way you didn't realize. I loved it. And then the real thing wasn't so great. But to just take an ordinary example that everyone has been through, a kid will say he was screamed at by a teacher. And he still hears the reverberating screaming. If you actually hang around the school, I mean the teacher won't tell the truth, obviously. So you can't ask. But if there's somebody else who happened to have been in the room, they can say the teacher was angry but wasn't screaming. Or when it happens in your own house, we all know his parents, we never scream. What kids remember is screaming. They remember horrible violence where there was none. And I think this has to do with their conscience. It's not necessarily about cognitive structure. It's that in what we call early latency from say seven to ten years old, kids have a very primitive conscience. They're very afraid of doing something wrong and getting hurt and being in trouble. And they perceive the world so that every time they do something wrong, you know, mom is going to kill me now. And on some level, they actually mean kill. And they might remember it that way. And remember that for the rest of their lives. So we have to be very suspicious of reports that we get. Of course this is true with adults as well. But it's more true in different ways, in different phases of child development, that would preoccupy as a kid at a certain stage of life is going to influence what he or she actually experiences. We all know that if we're in a terrible mood, if something horrible just happened to us, to see what someone else said. But it's much more true in kids because they have so much less structure. What about the reverse? I have a lot of people who have the opposite happen where they're very upset about what happened to the kid in school. You know, it wasn't fair what the teacher did. And you and you the kid's vantage point, they don't care about it so much. It wasn't so bad. And I assume you have that where the parent is more anxious in a sense than even the child is. Is that... It's said it happens all the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You could also argue though that as we get older we gain these structures. And if anything, those structures render us adults to distorting incoming information. Or at the very least. I don't think we're in some sense moving toward a steady state of objectivity. So you could imagine, for example, the same people listening to the same speech but they have different political perspectives. I'm pretty sure they will have different memories of the speech. Whereas if we took younger children who were less politically biased, they would probably be more uniform. So I don't think you disagree. Go ahead. I think you never get to a stage of objectivity. There's no such thing. But I think kids are more limited because they have more limited minds. Well I'm saying the richness of our intellectual abilities can be seen as an advantage but it can also be a handicap because it leads us to assimilate, distort and reconstruct in ways that a child would be incapable of. So to that extent. I wouldn't celebrate adulthood for greater objectivity. Far from it. Give me a child any time in terms of objectivity. You probably know more about this than I do. But one, I had been in this very large interdisciplinary group that met every week in my office for about 20 years. A group of people like this group talked about stuff like this. And there was a linguist there. What they were telling me was that one of the reasons that children can learn language so much better than adults is because their minds are different. And kids are really into what's, you know, where's Waldo basically. Children are tuned in to what doesn't fit. What's different? Because their brains are constantly preoccupied with regularities. That's why they like to repeat things over and over and over again. They're very tuned in to what's different. And they're more likely to be able to walk into a room and notice that something's different. And I think that may have something to do with why they may be more accurate. We've had so many experiences that our brains fill in things that they haven't had those experiences. So we're less accurate often because our minds just fill in. We scan the room and we don't pay that much attention. And if you know, you might not see that your wife had a new haircut or whatever. Whereas a child will hone in on it because that's what Temple Grandin talks about. Autistic people and animals. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Well then I think that that's something to keep in mind is that's probably as much an individual difference as it is a developmental one. There's actually a reasonably large body of literature on children's memory for the atypical action or for something that's not long in a room or how to order as usual. And they are quite able to detect those aberrant or those discrepant events and experiences. So it may be that bringing up Temple is a very good example that it is probably as much an individual difference as it is a developmental one. It might also be talking about discrepancies between cognitive protections and interpretations that either the adult or child names, the response or the promotion. Well can you so can you repeat that? I was just saying that perhaps we're talking about the difference between cognitive dimensions and the emotional ones in terms of the child's perceptual abilities but what interpretations of the child bring to that base on their own. So it's back to the story. Back to the story. Yes, I did. Well like I think you were probably saying just to your point where you say you prefer the child's interpretation. The child's interpretation at the age of two of something. The child's interpretation of something may have no relationship to the actual occurrence. So when you say you will trust that more, I'm not sure. Yeah I mean you say this from your point of view of course. Of course I'm being slightly provocative but just slightly. But it does seem to me I would still like to defend the point that we shouldn't assume that there's a steady progress toward objectivity even if we never meet it or get there. I would say there may be a steady progress away from objectivity as we gradually erect these elaborate ideologies and things which through which we filter what people are telling us. We see this when we're looking at those cultures. So as adults when we're encountering situations and from another culture it's very hard for us to interpret it in the way that people steeped in that culture will interpret it. That's something we see all the same. Even within slightly different cultures that speak nominally the same language you'll have the same expression will be undertaken to mean different things. Yeah. Different people it's very hard to overcome that and so consistent with what Paul's saying. They're less bound by that but they may not be able to make, they're probably missing an awful lot that adults are putting in different ways. But the reason they're missing an awful lot is they don't understand a lot. Anyone who's studied cognitive development in children comes up with the same findings that there's a steady change from a fantasy understanding of the world where there's no cause and effect. There's no sense of time and the world revolves around me to beginning to understand that there's a difference between wishing something is going to happen and having it happen, having a thought versus acting and fantasy. I don't think so. No, I think what you see in cognitive development these days is when you're looking at all the different individual pieces, the evidence that all of those pieces are there you can see that very, very early and children are quite precocious but the hard thing is pulling them together into this narrative to from a much more complex situations what are the different motives going on, what are the different agents doing. The different pieces are all there very early. That's my read of what's happening. What about the phenomenon that children will insist that something is true because they want it to be true and it can't be. We don't consider kids who say that to be liars. You can only lie if you know the difference between what's true and what isn't. At that point we say the child said something that isn't true or the child took something that didn't belong to him. They have to be older before we can say the kid is a liar and a thief. I don't know how to conceptualize this but as Colin is saying all of the laboratory research the empirical literature on infant development is really quite of one voice that children have what will be referred to as infants have what will be referred to as a very sophisticated understanding of causality. In order for this to cause this to move they have to actually make contact with one another. If this just comes and stops and then this starts on its own that's not a cause. They have these understandings. Paul referred earlier to the perception of the helper versus the hinderer in these elemental visual events that are staged for infants. There's something between that infant perception and the child's declaration of how they're using those bits and pieces of information but the basic cognitive elements the basic raw materials are evident very early in infancy and whether it's the together or the contextualization of them in the real world complicated interactions that people have. But I think it's based on the empirical literature I don't think it's the best characterization to say that it's lacking. It's there in some form. What's your understanding about why it can't be used until later? Colin. That's the really hard thing. There's a very clear contrast so take famous findings about children's difficulties and reasoning about false beliefs for example. It's very robust and very clear that even through age four you're going to have trouble with that. That's as true as it ever was. What makes it all the more interesting is that now you can demonstrate that is it, was it eight month old? It's all in the first year. Late in the first year of life you can show that there are key elements of that place that doesn't change the fact that the four year olds are still as hapless as they ever were. Right. So it's something about putting that into use which in more complex situations which is the real challenge. Well I think that's true throughout development it's not just in infancy. I mean you see teenagers, you can measure teenagers reflective function and it's as high as adults. They can't use it. They choose not to. They choose not to but they're but and it's considered to be somewhat related to brain connectivity because the brain doesn't mature until we're in our mid 20s and so having a capacity and being able to use it in the appropriate context is different and I think maybe that's a little bit like what you're talking about. Absolutely. The white kids need so much scaffolding because the parent provides help with the context of how and when to use whatever those skills are that they. Being able to record that this is a situation where rule one applies and then being able to execute rule one. Both of those are important steps that kids aren't always taking. In children's books there's for as long as there's been kind of an industry of children's books there's been a controversy with one side saying children should be exposed to the real world and things that are like their life and other side saying there should be fantasy and beautiful wonderful things and there are these two arguments that don't ever have a meeting point but I saw a quote that E.B. White who wrote this was I think about when he wrote Stuart Little about Little Mouse who was born to human parents on 14th Street. He said something like little children jump over the fence that separates reality from make believe like little spring box. He said the fence that will throw a librarian is has nothing to. That's a great. That's a great. Well I'm sympathetic with Stephen though because this in reality is what you see in kids and whatever the discrepancy is between the research and the actuality because this is really so much a part of what well certainly analysts are teaching kids when they who have real troubles with this but I mean obviously this is also the role of a parent is to help the child make those distinctions and one of the things we talk about is the difference between hot cognition and cold cognition. So hot cognition is in the moment when your sibling is stealing your toy or you got caught with your hand in the cookie jar you got caught lying right and that we may be we may reason differently in that kind of a hot situation than we do in the laboratory where everything else every other possible source of variance is taken out the room is draped in a black cloth so that the infant won't be turning her over here looking at the stimulus right the sound is controlled everything is controlled and so part of it is that embeddedness in this rich world in which we live and the complications that arise when you're not the only actor when there are other actors in each one of them is contributing something and I think it makes it that alone makes it more challenging to bring out those pure rule or that reason and that way those types of experiments they're like stories so stories strip away a lot of the irrelevant stuff what makes mystery movies hard is that they deliberately throw in lots of irrelevant stuff to throw you off and life is more like that and the experiment with a very young child like a story is something that pulls out all the distracting stuff. Can I ask a broader question to the two psychiatrists psychoanalysts so I mean if I look back over the last 20 or 30 years in developmental psychology and to some extent developmental psycholinguistics you see an increasing acknowledgement as we've been saying of the really competent the competence of the infant whether it's with respect to the understanding of cause and effect or social relationships or even good and evil and so the sort of classic picture of the child being egocentric confused about fantasy and reality and only the course of the preschool years conquering that naivety I mean I think we've moved away from that somewhat negative portrait now being said that there are all these complications about well how to reconcile child's behavior under these circumstances with the child's behavior under these other circumstances but okay but nevertheless there's been a pretty big revolution and we're much more we're much dazzled by what young infants and preschoolers can do. Are you saying to me that in psychoanalysis or in psychiatric theory nothing much has changed you still assume that there are these are deeper rationalities these deep naiveties these deep tendencies to deny reality? Well I would say this is back to the question of why is there such a difference between what's found in basic research and what we experience in real life and in clinical work we deal with the kids the way they present themselves we don't have the opportunity to study their capacities so for example if there's a study that shows that teenagers have the same reason as adults do nobody would want to live in a world run by teenagers right because something else gets in the way. I don't know if I'm not an adult. That's hard to know and it's an idealized version of adults because most adults don't function on that level either but there are other issues that gradually change right the kind of self-centered falsiveness and fear of ones that characterize teenagers soften and change it might not change 100 percent but it gets a little better as people get older and more tired right. We also see in adolescents people committing themselves to all sorts of ideologies extreme political movements we don't see young children doing that. Well actually I think psychoanalysis fortunately has embraced all of this science in fact psychoanalysis I mean you know the adenocesion is the best one of the best examples of this and that psychoanalysis are embracing neuroscience child development all these factors in the environment of real parents helping real kids you discover that children have these two just really different ways of thinking about the world and they need help with it they need support you know when a child thinks you know the teacher hates them and that the teacher actually really does hate them if that's the child's experience that child actually really needs a supportive environment to help them see it differently. Does it change the way in which you react to the children's needs so if there's a difference between the capacity not being there and the capacity needing some help to make its way through all the other obstacles does that does that have any impact on what you do to help the children or does it in the end not make a difference. That's a good question I haven't had their question before so but I would hope it would I would hope it would I mean you know we now know that children are having this incredible capacity for empathy even you know we were something we didn't think about before and so I do think it has influenced how we raise children. What the discussion is going in the direction of that in a way we've been underestimating how much kids children little children infants I don't know if the word is understand or are capable of or but how much is different in other words what's the other side of that because obviously children are not the same or not thinking the same at the age of two as they will at the age of 12 so what is different what changes or the direction of towards adulthood. We could all retire if we knew the answer to that I think you know certainly one of the things that's changing this is not to say that this is the only thing that's changing right but one of the things that's changing is that children with development we become experts in more and more areas we learn more content and things that we can't underestimate the extent to which children have in some cases some very maybe sophisticated looking reasoning abilities but they have much less content over which to use and apply those reasoning abilities they have many fewer experiences they don't have the political indoctrination and therefore they don't know the way the political beliefs hold together politics maybe is way too old but even the politics of the school yard they have they have less understanding of relationships they have less content over which to apply some of these fundamental cognitive operations and as I said that's certainly not the only thing that's changing but it is one of the things that we do see that when children are experts in a domain their reasoning looks more adult like than when they are the novice in the domain and that's even when the adult may be the novice and the child is the expert and what you'll see is in that particular domain the children actually can outperform the adults you take them out of that and they look just like a kid again but within that expertise they're able to use some of these higher level higher order cognitive processes. The other thing is executive function I would imagine would have to play some role in this is that you know you can have an ability but if you can't control your impulses enough to be able to display that ability then I would assume that has some. So I think maybe you're correcting a misconception of mine I took my grants on a number of years ago when it was around four years old on the subway and so we went to the subway and I said we are going to take and he couldn't figure out what's the difference between the subway and the express. So if I understand you correctly if I had prior to taking him there explain to him that the subway is a train and it has one level it's local and then you go down and it's express that if I came to him he would have understood and would not have asked that question whereas I thought he didn't yet have the ability to conceptualize the notion that a subway can be expressed or local. I think that's a very good example and we could actually do that experiment that would be a easy experiment to do but I think that's exactly right. That we make a lot of assumptions about what other people in our world know and most of the time we're pretty accurate about that and it's when we misunderstand what someone knows that communication becomes very challenging. I find actually when I do things for little kids and I also go to schools and I talk to them sometimes and my wife is a retired teacher. I mean she was for a long time not a retired teacher but a teacher and she would help me out a lot of times if I was going to say this or done something in a book or with kids and she said well you said this but they thought that and it was the most difficult and interesting thing for me to learn what I wasn't thinking through what I was assuming that kids just didn't have the content knowledge to know about and that's one of the most difficult things about or specialized maybe things about being an adult dealing with children is realizing what it is that you should know if they don't know how they're going to misinterpret obvious things that you say in some creative way. This sort of thing happens all the time so I can give just one example this is something I happened at home yesterday so when there are lots of verbs that talk about different things we do and you know you can hit the table or you can read a book and you know eat is also a transitive verb you can say I ate right but when you say I ate it doesn't just mean you ate something right it means you ate something appropriate to a meal time right so yesterday my daughter who's 13 came home from playing with her friends and my wife said did you eat yet and she said pretzels and I was very impressed with that because what that showed is the understanding that to say yes to that would imply the declaration that she had eaten an appropriate to a meal and she recognized that pretzels wasn't and in that dialogue you know that showed a kind of sophistication that we normally take for granted but things like that are buried in everything we do. It's a great example. Did you ask her if she took a shower? Two weeks ago. And it also shows a sophisticated level of reflective thinking because it implies that your wife understood what she meant by pretzel and that she knew her mother would understand so in that brief communication they had an amazing amount of understanding of how the other person would perceive what they're doing. That's what makes things so hard for younger children so understanding literally what was expressed there wouldn't get you anywhere and a lot of the problem that you have with young children is they can in some ways they're very sophisticated in terms of what they know about what are possible things to say but all the additional things that go into understanding the motives of what is said and what is not said. That's the sort of thing where kids seem not to be that precocious and it's because of... I think that helps some of this discrepancy. They don't understand the motives. There are a lot more literal or concrete. That comes step by step. There are different parts of it you can show. Again you can show that some of those abilities are there if you put people in the kids in the appropriate setting but we do this all the time very quickly without even realizing what we're doing and that's where there's huge opportunities for misunderstanding. So I've got a related example of this which is that from time to time when my children's friends have come over I've indulged on it remarks since you and I are English we know we are tempted to do this from time to time. My younger sons turned to their friends and said oh don't worry he's trying to be funny. He's just trying to be ironic. So yes. But you know the feeling is mutual. I didn't know what the structure of this roundtable was going to be so I've been collecting children's jokes for the last few weeks in a very scientific way. Interrupting sessions and making it seem like it was part of the session to say what's your favorite joke and I made a long list of these children at different ages and they're very different and they're very predictable at which ages certain things are very funny and they change over time. I'm not going to tell any of them because none of them are funny to an adult. But these kids. Some of them are more youthful than I asked me. Well the idea that there could be a premise that there's somebody named Ha Ha Ha standing next to his friend whose name is Oh shut up and another friend saying who cares and the policeman just happens to interview them. It's not something that I would ever tell at a cocktail. What about it? It's very rich. A lot of things happen very quickly. Children have figured out by the time they're 12 months of age they've figured out the sound system of their language. They're very good at distinguishing languages. They're acquiring a vocabulary. By the time they're age three they've figured out most of the word order properties of the language. They have a vocabulary in the hundreds. When they're age five they're performing technologies that Google and Apple have spent billions on. And yet putting that to use in complex interactive situations that's the thing that's hard. So what we find it's interesting what often when you look at kids who are delayed the children's language development seems to be ahead of much of the rest of their cognitive development in the sense that a lot of the things that count as cognitively sophisticated develop later than things that count as linguistically sophisticated. So you can look at some population so rare but very interesting cases the syndrome known as William's syndrome. Which for a long time they were thought to be severely cognitively impaired and precocious. It turns out that's not really true on closer inspection. Really their language is more or less consistent with the rest of their cognitive development in most respects. It's just that language development is so accelerated that if you put it in the context of cognitive delay you still look linguistically quite good. Although going back to what you were saying earlier is it fair to say that even if the grammar and the semantics is rich and complicated the pragmatics takes a lot longer to be mastered. I think that's the clear consensus on what things are right now is the things which involve relatively formal routines, children have got that quite very well, things involving building a large vocabulary, things involved in building literal interpretations. But the pragmatics which plays such a role in what we do most of the time that takes a long while because in order to learn the pragmatics you need an awful lot of other things. You can learn a lot about language without being that cognitively developed but to get the rest of it you need the rest of the structure to be in place. Back to young babies again I've been recently really impressed by some work a lot of it going on again in New York where there are two, there's an infant watching two adults or it could be two cartoon figures but at any rate the infant is merely a spectator and the infant sees this person for example showing a particular object in front of her and it might be out of reach and this person then vocalizes and the child watches as the other person either responds appropriately by handing her the object she prefers or responds inappropriately by handing her as it were the wrong object but what's amazing about these studies is that these these 10, 11 month old infants seem to grasp that how communication works even at that age so they don't necessarily have any words themselves it can be indeed a nonsense word that this speaker utters so I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about the extent to which so I guess my but at this way my working assumption for a long time children gradually work out what communication is for insofar as they engage in it they discover what what a handy tool it is so to speak but here we see these infants sitting back being a spectator a third party and yet grasping the cognitive consequences of the you know the information the the audience is received where the interlocutor is received right yeah so I think this this is another situation where we're seeing that when strips down to the their minimum the there's a capacity that's there so maybe it's even at the pragmatic level where kids are most delayed the ingredients of that are in place I think we need to be a little bit cautious about how we interpret some of these findings about the young babies 10 to 12 months of age because what is generally shown there is there is some degree of sensitivity in this carefully designed task so they're not behaving randomly so there's something there the way that then gets presented is kids can do this and that's a little bit of a of of extension and then as we know from people who are you know dealing with kids in real situations now kids really can't do it and they can't do it for much longer so domain even there some of the things that they need are already in place but making effective use of those tools is such a knowledge intensive task that it's going to be very hard to do that in practical situations for a long while after and I think where we what we haven't got to in the science is so much working on how do we take those basic skills and then work it work towards scaling them up to other things a lot of the action has been in showing while kids can do these amazing things a lot of people have built careers on showing kids the geniuses and that you know that there was a nice piece in the onion five or six years ago which headline you know news flash baby and it's very informative because yes we know that babies are limited but there's you know you're not going to get by the way babies aren't very smart but how to go how to go from these sort of pieces of genius that they have to putting that to use in practical situation which is where we are now and that's going to be a long hard job and one of the problems that we have is that tend to be at least in the scientific literature there are people who study infants and there are people who study children and that transition you know as as the infant becomes a language user as the infant becomes able to direct her own action and to be to locomote independently and all of those accomplishments we we have a dearth of information on what happens in the second and third year of life basically you have the infant studies where the baby will sit and watch right and then you have the verbal studies where the child can actually be countered upon to listen to an instruction and respond appropriately or not right but at least they can listen to the instruction and make a verbal response and there's that territory in between that is really still not well researched and therein is going to lie some of the answer to this these paradoxes of this early competence and later lack of performance essentially. I asked about the nonverbal I mean the baby is mostly nonverbal and so what what influences do you think that plays on the development or how the infant is experiencing the world because I'm thinking about your example and I'm thinking of you know like all the nonverbal cues that would cue into what's going on in that situation the baby only has the nonverbal but we go pretty far in our communication with people with nonverbal so I'm just wondering how much information can be gleaned in that kind of a situation from nonverbal versus verbal. And one of the ways that people have come about that attacking that very question is through comparative research where you ask whether kapuchin monkey or whether a rhesus monkey or a chimpanzee or a dog the the increasingly we're seeing the literature on on dogs as as comparative subjects and that's one of the favored ways that we go about addressing those questions because there you don't have even that latent capacity for language that you're considering and some of these abilities I don't actually don't know if the helper hinderer has been done with a nonhuman primate do you know well yeah I don't know if it's been done but my my guess is that people's family pets in some cases might you know be able to solve some of these problems based on exactly you know some of that sensitivity to where people are looking you know dogs do joint reference where if I look at this and then look at you right sharing that reference and people's pets dogs will do will solve that task and that's obviously critical for understanding these kinds of interpersonal situations of what the person wants or is trying to accomplish if you don't have that component ability of being able to understand that this is the object for both of us you're not going to be able to solve that problem so I actually don't know what the comparative literature says but that's one way try those questions yeah yeah so pursuing that theme then the comparative evidence I think is certainly setting aside dogs since there are somewhat special case they you know they they've they've lived in human society and been selected within human society for a long time so if we take chimpanzees I mean one of the differences I think important differences between chimpanzees and human beings is a chimpanzee don't really and point I mean some sense you could argue that pointing is the very first stepping stone to some ordinary communication among human beings because yeah you can as you were saying use pointing to converge on the same object or to call some it is attention to something or even sometimes to ask a kind of question I mean you can point to something in in an interrogative fashion you know and I think it's the beginning of at least whether the baby has the capacity before pointing or not but at least the first demonstration that the baby shows us that they have some why sorry just the baby points the baby points the mother points but that they are each pointing about something that's in their mind they have an intention they've seen something and then they have an intention to share what they've seen I mean that's my understanding it's the simplest story it's the simplest story okay yes it's it's organizing the experience that's around you and saying okay it's about this yes it's about this right and but and I want you to pay attention to what the aboutness is for me I mean I think that's the joint the jointing part yeah so there's some fascinating work published recently on cross-cultural variation in pointing so they did a study in China the Netherlands and an Amayan community in in South America and all they did was to ask the adult to carry the toddler into a room with various interesting things hanging to look at so to speak and they looked at the frequency with which the infant pointed to these items or indeed the caregiver pointed to these items and the most active pointers were the Chinese caregivers followed by the Dutch followed by the Mayans so I don't know whether these were these were dedicated grandparents with one particular grandchild to focus all their attention on but at any rate they were they were up and running so to speak earlier than than than the Dutch and then the mind you know does it correspond to any observable difference in how the children develop well it does so there's good evidence that early pointers build their vocabulary more rapidly so there's a headline there excuse me there's a headline there yeah yeah point point to your infant capillary developers are better pointers or that early vocabular is a better pointers although so we'll know soon because a colleague of ours is is carrying out an intervention study where she's encouraging mothers to point more on and so we'll see whether that has a knock-on effect with respect to later language development so yeah so little books for very very young children are often um uh wordless books are supposed to be for the youngest children which that just seems to be appropriate to this discussion um you don't get wordless books for older people very much and yet I mean there is language in the stories they tell I mean maybe these books are designed so that people will you know use language to read the books to children but they do go through them and find thing thing thing and and also the very youngest board books that are made for children um they tend to discourage there being too much story in them and often they're just this thing then this thing and this thing maybe the final thing has some ironic relation to the rest of them probably so that the parent can have some relief for the end of this of these seven eight things but I just thought maybe that's something to to throw in there yeah can children do they tell the stories without the picture I mean without words without words yeah that although is this this research on you know spotting helpers and hinders is correct the is that you could have a little figure pushing somebody up the mountain on one page and uh having a you know a smile of the next page and in some sense the implication is the infant would be understanding it and then you could have a a villain who comes along and pushes them both back down again and so anyway these it's but it's possible that these publishers are underestimating the story comprehending capacities of one year olds I don't know we all we all understand facial expressions from very early don't we yes what we know is that babies differentiate facial expressions it's actually been very difficult to get evidence that they actually understand them so from a very young age babies will look preferentially at a happy face as opposed to a frowning face or an angry face but it's really not necessarily clear that they understand the implication behind that you're saying that it may be that it's likely that they don't or that we just can't figure out a way to talk to them so that they can explain it out of it very clever about asking the questions and I think we still don't know that they really understand the implications of those emotions until they are about nine months of age there it's very very clear that they're understanding a wary look on an adult's face or a happy smiling face they'll approach things you know a novel object if I smile at the baby the baby will come and approach that if I do this and look very afraid the approach the object or across the room or or this can also be done with other people so if I make a you know an angry face at you or something and there's a baby then she will not befriend you whereas if I but at nine months it's very clear earlier than that it's it's much less clear but even this evidence is sort of black and white I mean black and white in the sense that the baby thinks oh this is a an approachable person or an approachable object or let me stay away so so it's not very differentiated this emotional lexicon right that's true right right of course there's some people who never learned to do that well that's true right and that's there are clinics and they don't recognize facial expressions or they don't know how to interpret them and they verbally how to figure it out and so so that raises an interesting question because if you look at a lot of emotion research in psychology it's been hung up on facial expressions in my opinion rather too narrowly so I could imagine a person who did have that that facial problem so to speak but nevertheless setting the state had a pretty good conceptual understanding of what particular emotions were like their consequences and so on and so forth or is that not the case that you have to have that decoding ability in order to build up the conceptual understanding might be an intellectual understanding but it can't be used in real life and they have to be taught how to use it which is something that going back to over and over again in this discussion that the the capacities can be identified but then the question is why aren't they put to use more naturally there are there are kids and adults who always get it wrong and it's a very dangerous thing if you don't know whether someone's angry at you or whether someone's cheating you right can they pick up pick it up through other cues they have to be taught it doesn't come naturally but is it that they can they be taught to get it through faces people try to do it I don't know how successful it is do these expressions appear on their faces somebody they have facial experience yeah so but they just can't remember the association even on their own no it's a disability it's it's it's true of many autistic children this is where the whole mirror neuron system kind of becomes relevant that we have this system matching we match the particularly facial expressions but we match behaviors and it's and the matching system happens right from birth pretty much where you know when the mother makes a a kind of person of her lips the baby will match that and this expands and you know to facial expressions but what happens is our own body is connected to our whole body physiology so my facial expression is just the outward manifestation of some emotion I'm feeling unless I'm deceiving you and so that body physiology is connected to that facial expression and the brain seems to be wired to match those facial expressions and others so theoretically at least you're having some physiologic inner experience when you have that facial expression and when my body matches that in you it starts to activate my body physiology and that's how you transmit to me in some way that you're having that feeling then I know you're having that feeling and it's the beginning of learning about the connection between the face and the body and the emotion and the feeling and and people with you know people with autism have some kind of impairments in their mirror neurons lack some of that linkage and other disabilities it's not just autism it's not autism is the sort of clearest example of it yeah when my first son was born being a developmental psychologist he was i was in two minutes i tried a little experiment which was to stick out my tongue and he thought about it but then he did stick out his tongue but then i panicked because he wouldn't put his tongue back in again he broke in him psychoanalysis would cure it so eventually he eventually did i may say he's but i mean going back to your point i'm not i would hesitate to say that we've always figure out the meaning of somebody's facial expression by resonating in some sense to it it seems to me we could also have i mean i would be tempted to say we we would want to understand that somebody was angry without needing some minimal anger ourselves ourselves or ditto for sadness or or fears and i so let's so here's actually here's some good evidence so we were talking about empathy a moment ago and you do see in the second year of life toddlers being quite empathic so if even a parent or a sibling is in distress they will sometimes go over and pat and hug but you don't necessarily see them showing distress themselves it's as if they recognize what the distress is but it doesn't require some kind of mirroring of the distress in order for them to behave appropriately i i think the excitement about this notion of mirror neurons is in some ways been an impediment because i think one thing that is important is understanding connections between things you're seeing out in the world how that relates to things that you do that's obviously very very important people went crazy with the idea that there are these little cells that solve the problem and and the message that i think we've got through all of this discussion is making all these connections much more complicated and putting the blame on just that you know there's there's some you know little tiny piece that suddenly solves that trivializes the problem i think and probably stands in the way of figuring out all the complicated things you actually have to do to do this successfully it's the harder part i mean the the notion that you have things that are shared between or speaking and understanding all right well we've we've known about that for thousands of years that's called words all right a word is something which is the the link between things you say and things you understand and what we're talking about in all these other domains is you know you need to understand the connection between things you experience and things you do and it's and it's kind of hard um and it's there's there's not a single single piece solution so if it's okay with you i'll ask the audience for questions you have to get it it's going to turn out not to be worthy of having come up here to use the microphone so i'd better think of something really significant to say now that i'm standing here i've been a teacher for 52 years in the same school so students have memories of me that go back more than half a century and i'm often stopped in the delia on the subway by a student who will say to me i'll never forget the day that you and i stop them and i say before you recall this memory to me was i crazy that day or did i say something significant only once did the students say i'll never forget the day that you stood me up in front of the class and embarrassed me and that was a student of 52 years ago and she'd been waiting 52 years to see another colleague most of the other times i've come out pretty good but i have occasion to to speak to teachers especially graduate students in schools of education and i tell them you get a group of students in your room they close the door they let you along with them for 40 minutes and you are creating memories that can live a lifetime and you will forget those experiences but you'll be amazed at how many times you will be reminded of something you said or did that you've forgotten decades ago but have lived on the memory of somebody else scary the other thing i want to say about um the kid who goes home and says the teacher yelled at me and threw me out of the room when the teacher reprimanded that student in a mild voice and then just opened the door and said i think you'd better go out because you're disturbing the class isn't it to the students the child's advantage not so much to remember the experience that way but to relate it with that exaggeration because it then pinks the picture of the student as an innocent victim of a crazy monster of a teacher and takes the emphasis off what the kid did to i'm the victim of this brutal monster and since i have the microphone there's one more thing i want to say you talk so much about amnesia and i wonder if we're living through a different age now because every parent and grandparent has a cell phone which is a high quality video camera and is constantly recorded recording every second of a child's but in my day i'm sure that there are so many people in this room of a certain age who have very few snapshots of themselves as children let alone videos and if the videos were on eight millimeter film they were black and white and silent but now everything is being recorded constantly so more than at any time in the history of humanity so does that take the place of the need for memory do you really have to remember anything if anything is if everything is recorded and instantly played back a bowl and then when you see it years later it's not so much that you remember being there and doing that and saying that as that you have concrete proof that it happened because you're watching the recording of it so that's what i have to say i actually thank you so much uh for that i actually think that we are creating a society of probably a world of people who are going to have fewer memories for exactly this reason it's going to be more and more difficult to be able to separate what is your memory what is your internal recollection and your internal representation of that event relative to the thing that you saw on this disembodied this little rectangle um that you carry around i actually think it's going to have yes i think we're destroying our culture frankly with i you know with all this but but uh i think it's going to be more and more difficult to separate what is my memory from what is an external representation of that event but when people started writing letters couldn't there been similar form of anxiety about the extent to which you know narrating some experience to your family members interfered with the pristi memory you had had before you started writing the letter i think possibly the difference there is that that's your output so when i'm writing a letter i'm writing about my own internal representation as opposed to looking at something that is physically separate from me and then there are these these actors in it and one of those actors is me i think that's i think it's a different i think it's a different representation and therefore i think it will have different implications but it's a great question i mean the opportunities to rewrite what happened are so great when you come to be even photoshop i don't remember exactly but i remember hearing or reading about that exact anxiety when writing came into existence that would destroy you know a home or you know you would memorize the entire odyssey and now you don't have to anymore and and culture will crumble and maybe it did but i do think that that was brought up yeah that's interesting memory has an important emotional function you know almost every parent who comes to me with a child who's having trouble says i never ever spoke that way to my parents and that's so sure they didn't and i had occasion a few years ago to see some old home movies of my early childhood with my sisters and i think the three of us would see things that we saw in that film could never have happened i certainly never treated my sisters the way these fake movies show that's great thank you very well whoops okay thank you very much uh i'm getting back to early childhood education myself at a time where people my age would be retiring so i've been struggling to try to figure out you know how an adult functions you know for a lifetime because i was taught to be infantilized you know that's the secret to success but anyway i'd just like to share first of all i have a little video on youtube called no adults left behind where i have five year olds who live on 200 feet who talk about life with more understanding than adults what makes you happy say why do people like cheat and fight but the five year olds answered you know and i asked them if you what would you gift to the world be five year olds were able to say my gift to the world be everybody should share people should help each other be friends get along together little girl at very set everybody should stop fighting so five year olds can manage to put it together it's the emperors new clothes the child is the father of the man things like that also creating my educational launch it's called i-opener is a mind-opener is to help kids with attention learning disabilities build their ability to focus and pay attention naturally by doing vision based on the ability to help naturally by doing vision based i exercises so this other thing the developing brain which is still new to you know the father's compulsory education and all of that like for instance Oliver Sacks you know in his book seeing voices it's all about children who are brought up a lot of deaf parents have normal hearing children but they learned sign language first which is a more natural way our ancestors learned sign language before we learned to talk so when children have been developed trained that way he says it's also laying down the neural pathways with which language it's syntax is based in your head and four year olds are outperforming high school students in spatial relationship tests so it's the natural way the brain is put together and then somebody you know like you know who Alice Miller is right she said emotion attaches meaning to experience the drama of the gifted child without an emotion nothing means anything so hardly anything was saying that you cannot literally create any meaning or sense without adding emotion to the situation and with the i'll just let and with the vision based work that i'm doing believe it or not in a state of nature how it brings evolve you can't see without moving your eyes so a human brain is capable of being aware of seven streams of awareness simultaneously because ironically when we read and write all the lives we lock up our eyes on static letters don't move our eyes and we like dumb down our awareness by almost six to seven hundred percent so seven when you hear some of these things that we're talking about a seven point awareness and that this focus on reading and running because our end you know had no idea what the brain was capable of doing i mean they cart literally thought the brain was a place in your head where sperm was stored i mean that's the father of enlightenment how but anyway when you hear some of these things about human potentiality this four-year-old's outperforming high school students seven point awareness and maybe a responsibility that people like you who know understanding might have a certain responsibility to bring some of these ideas into compulsory everyday education besides stem and steam and core you know okay but i'm just when you hear these things about human potentiality these greater awarenesses i'm just curious how do you respond where the child is developing it and has it naturally and so much of education is about how to eliminate it because we're following you know a 200 year old model of okay thank you well i actually think um we i work with schools a lot and i have to say i think some of these ideas are really getting incorporated into schools maybe not some of the struggling public schools so much but there's a lot of private schools charter schools are popping up all over in los angeles anyhow and um are incorporating that children have an enormous capacity for learning um if you let if you follow their lead if you let them learn what interests them and the other thing that really seems to enhance learning is being able to actively participate in the learning process so instead of just i think some of this is even happening in public schools in los angeles instead of just teaching chemistry the kids are really engaging in active learning and so i think a lot of the ideas about what is enhancing learning for kids is actually being incorporated i don't think we're as stuck as you are presenting it i think financial limitations are we're keeping people stuck rather than any kind of philosophical or education advice maybe more than financial limitations which is old farts are getting in the way as well because you can have children learn those things successfully and learn how to be effective learners but then when people come along and say well tell me what tell me which things you know and finding that you know children who are effective learners they're they're equipped to acquire new information effectively to discover new things throughout life if they don't meet certain expectations that were established like tests like facts right like things you can google then they're deemed to be failing yeah hi i'm making a movie about what parents ought to be doing for their kids right now to have them ready to respond to the world of tomorrow particularly vis-a-vis climate change um and we sort of have taken as our premise that the world's going to be changing fast and that kids have to adapt to things that they can't necessarily see or observe in very sort of altruistic and synthetic and complicated ways involving working with other human beings um so my question to you guys would be what do you think parents and grandparents ought to be doing with their kids right now to help them develop those kinds of skills what do you do with your kids to help them ready to get ready for the world of tomorrow basically if you could really know would depend on on your ability to inculcate you know values and ideas that will last past adolescence and past the point where politics enters into and they all everybody changes it becomes horrible as adults that would be great maybe and i'm afraid of too much terrifying children with the destruction of the world to come and the fact the idea that they would have it would have any responsibility for it and that the idea that you should do something to fix it maybe very nice but part of that is the idea that if you don't do it won't get fixed and you're responsible for it that that's the the element of of this whole uh bringing um we must fix climate change to children i i think it's so much an issue for the adults who are in control of the world to fix uh and that it's outside of the power of children to actually do something about it and when you have them do small things that make them feel like they're doing something about it that might be nice but to me that doesn't really answer it you know it's a really good question because i think the parent cares about um whether it be what religion i'd like my child to have or for me it was wanting my children to read the good readers and this is a value i think the best thing for parents to do is be that way themselves i don't think we can teach someone else what to believe believe is so personal you're gonna really fail if you try to teach someone too much what to believe if you put too much emphasis on it but if you portray the belief yourself as an adult and show the values you have as a person in your actions and how you interact with the world children are they you know absorb and internalize a lot of these things and i think that's the best way rather than try to inculcate be it yourself be authentically that way yourself i think they would do the most successful way um but for adults to do these things that adults can do and adults can do right and right and the children are participating in that family if i could just ask you to bear with me for one more second though you talked about hot cognition and cold cognition so let's say you've inculcated these values moral courage standing up for things that you believe in working with other people etc are there particular things that help people in moments of hot cognition keep their heads particular psychological skills no interesting well one of the ones that was um that it's a great question and one of the things that was eluded to earlier was executive function which is this ability to stop and think inhibit an action that you were maybe just going to reach out right and stopping and thinking about the consequences of your action and reflecting on that action and although famously adolescence is the period of time during which we quote develop executive function those skills are developing beginning in infancy deferring gratification right being able to wait a minute to get a bigger treat as opposed to taking a small treat immediately that's developing very early on and that's a very powerful um cognitive skill that applies in social situations in cognitive situations in school settings in all kinds of interpersonal situations and that ability is something that we can help children develop and appreciate and to be more reflective and that may be something that and that that works even in the even in these hot cognition domains absolutely I just going back to your comment I I think this is an area where I would like to stop and think that's to say part of me wants to say yes you're right that childhood is a kind of protected space and the adults that adults may have created for future generations shouldn't weigh too heavily upon them but part of me also wants to say that you know maybe we could sometimes underestimate children that way that's to say they you can educate their thinking about the long-term future and indeed the deep past we don't need to we don't need to assume that they live so to speak in the here and now all the time I I think we would under but but I'm torn because I can see that it would be it could be burdensome but in some ways it could also be liberating if if one were to give children the sense that you know there's a we're part of a species we put it this way children growing up in the United States will be exposed to a considerable amount of American history and it's not a very comprehensive history at that it's mostly a history of heroism well you could argue that a broader picture both looking backwards and looking forwards would actually be more valuable than than that particular curriculum so anyway all that to say I have some sympathy with the idea that we might think about just how how much we could expand the child's horizon temporally I think a lot of that's already being done I mean if you I don't think that American history now is just about heroism and about how we are always saving the world and better than everyone else in the schools my kids have gone to they're taught that when Columbus discovered America it wasn't such a good thing for the people here and there's a lot of discussion about that and I think it's the same thing with climate change you know my father the world wasn't a kid he grew up in the 1930s right there have always been terrible problems and we try to teach kids what they're ready to absorb it has to be different at every stage of development so I think the easiest thing is to to live what you believe in and and kids will pick up what they can but every child is going to have to deal with sex sooner or later and we don't teach them we don't give sex education in kindergarten and we don't wait till they're in high school I mean it's they're taught at their own capacity to take in what they can take in and I think it's whether it's it's sex or racism or the nuclear threat or you know kids have to learn at a certain age the reason I say how to pay your taxes is because I had a kid come in and his chief complaint was he was something like seven or eight years old and he didn't know how to drive a car or pay his taxes yet and the idea that that can come later that he shouldn't worry that he doesn't know how to do it now was foreign to him so I don't think we should be scaring kids with things that they are not ready to absorb but that doesn't mean we can't adjust what we talk about to where they are cognitively and emotional. I think the circle is back to the origins of our discussion about storytelling because it's in and retelling of the childhood stories that children gain a capacity for trial action and understanding the world you know when you were talking about Stuart Little I was thinking back to my encounter with it and how much it meant to me when I was a little boy that here was this little mouse who couldn't be like a big adult and yet was able eventually to go out into the world in his toy car and you know this is this is what stories for children help them say a future so you know I don't know that we necessarily have to be doctrinaire about the kinds of stories but we if we tell enough stories it covers a lot of ground in anticipation will be formed whether you try to tell them we're not they will form yes everything can become a story when you were talking about stories without words you know the cartoons without words I think probably most of you know this very beautiful wordless video for very young children called the snowman that a child of one and a half can already fully appreciate and the other thing is the historical thing about reading and writing and worries about memory of course people were worried about it and rightfully worried I mean I think it's been shown or at least I've read that in non-literate cultures people do have much better memories anyway my question is is really to you about about amnesia some of you talked about amnesia in the first two years of life and it could be even longer but is it full amnesia I mean are you talking about event memory or representational memory or are you talking about emotional memory well that's that's a very interesting question because we don't have amnesia for everything in the first years of our lives we learn to talk we learn to walk we learn to recognize our caregivers right we we and to care about our caregivers we remember a great deal from the early years of life what characterizes the prototypical case of childhood amnesia or infantile amnesia is that we do not have any memories that of ourselves of personally relevant or significant events so they're really event memories and the way it's been defined in the literature is unfortunate in many respects because the question will be an event that happened at one time in one place that you can absolutely identify the age at which that event occurred and of course most for most of us our lives are repetitive we we don't have singular events unique events every day and in fact a lot of us if we reflect on our autobiographies who we are what made us who we are it's those Sunday dinner at grandma's right it's every summer my family took a vacation it's not the one-time event it's those those the the fabric of our lives are these repeated events the same people over and over and I actually think autobiographical memories this kind of odd man out but yet that's where a lot of the literature has focused and when we talk about childhood amnesia that's really what people are talking about could you come closer to the one that comes to mind is I with I witnessed this once a child who was separated from a nanny at the age of one after a very long lapse of time when the nanny returned not only recognized the nanny but pushed his mother away to be within any so that's a very strong emotional memory and that was formed by the age of one right there it's it's interesting that if this this childhood amnesia is very very well documented phenomenon in an audience of this size we absolutely would replicate the finding that the average age of earliest memory is between three and four what we would also replicate is that at least one person would have an event from at least the second year of life and at least one person would say my ear is it until I'm eight or nine years old so we have this enormous individual difference and I think it's one of the few areas in which we have such a pronounced individual difference related to the age at which language you know which language develops you know thus far not proven to be the case and I think that's because language always if you're a typically developing child language develops between one and three years of age so there's not enough variability it is related to a lot of interesting things it's related to birth status individuals who were first born tend to have earliest memories women tend to have memories from earlier in life than men is another cultural differences western cultures we tend to have memories from earlier in life than eastern cultures so they're all kinds of really interesting individual differences I have a daughter who my daughter was started speaking with a little bit of an impediment and and you couldn't understand anything she says she remembers this trying to communicate with it's so interesting obviously something like that was and that happened more than once right you know that was a it was an ongoing event ongoing struggle for her yeah that's really interesting there wasn't the sort it was language but it wasn't our language but it's not your language yeah that's really interesting you've given me a lot of ideas a lot of questions including what is memory which you asked then you left it's like what is memory what is a memory thank you for mentioning this uh they um alumni research my mom got a birthday card it was eight panels there's a little baby girl on a birthday hat the next one she's a little girl in a birthday hat and then she's a teenager in a birthday hat she's a young adult in a birthday hat and an adult in a birthday hat and she's a woman in a birthday hat she's a senior then she's old and the last panel says well that sucked oh you made me think that there might be a reason to make wordless stories for adults thank you and it just uh this panel it just reminded me of a lot of things i can't say that i remember anything you said i'm thinking about my own memory if i call home and somebody else i'll say well this one had rosy cheeks he talked about steward little this guy didn't tell us the joke he didn't tell us the other jokes she had a scarf he had a warm voice he's the illustrator it's all being videoed you'll be fine remember us i'm just talking i'm talking about the limits of my own memory i'm staring at this orange chair and when i close my eyes i don't have any orange chair in my mind and maybe you do you're an illustrator it just makes me wonder what memories are and when you talk about the stories that people tell i think that they do preserve our lives but i also think they pick our lives people tell the stories in the same way and maybe it happened differently or there's some other part of it that you didn't see or it and then you keep hearing this story the same way and i think it might obliterate some of the truth of what happened and so when kids are telling when kids are closing their eyes or when kids are are remembering things or when kids are thinking things that's tremendously exciting and i don't spend a lot of time around kids but what i know about kids is that their minds are near adult minds a lot right it's not that the kids just have their life and i wish that as a kid other people i think you said to take advantage of the way a kid things and the and the way a kid's mind works rather than trying to turn it in you know make it work a different way to be in school i would have said if i had been in school and anybody been trying to teach me something and i've been able to sit on a bouncy ball and learn it that i could have learned it better because i am and or with music or with dancing or with play acting or improvisation and i just hope that there are opportunities for you know we're not just studying kids minds but they were open to the the magnificence of of what's possible and not just trying to train it up to be something smaller and and more uniform thank you thank you i love a little description that stories can pickle people's lives so i have to what i hope to be concise questions for you the the first question is in terms of amnesia of autobiographical memory is there any evidence that that manifests in dreams in dreams i personally just find that sometimes i have dreams of um you know sort of you know what i what i could see very conceivably you know being you know in in the you know the body of an infant and you know and and sort of operating paradigm and so so that's question number one um and uh question number two is in terms of you're talking about the interpretation of facial expression and i wonder about the other side of that is there any research in you know it essentially does a deficiency in in the ability to make facial expression exist and and if not if that's considered to be sort of an innately human thing then what are the implications for that for communication for the development of communication i don't know i i think our experts um are are here well in terms of amnesia i mean i'm thinking that uh you know what what pat already patrisa already said was that we do retain certain aspects of memory it may not be specific events and time but it could be things like just your sense of your body and i could imagine something like that that you could retain something like that um so i think and if they're in the dreams how are we you know that's that's my you know that i think dreams are very very significant but i think of them more in terms of being what it means to you about the dream rather than it being a replica representation or replica of something that literally happened i guess my question is sort of the distinction between being able to sort of call upon at will a narrative of something that's happened as opposed to having that be embedded sort of implicitly in the subconscious in a way that would would manifest in a dream but not in in real life i actually think that is what this what patrisa was trying to distinguish between this episodic explicit kind of memory versus more implicit forms of memory that have more to do with emotion and behavior and nonverbal experience yeah i'd also say a dream is is just a thought you have when you're asleep and it's it's not you know people throughout history starting certainly with the bible and joseph have like to believe that that dreams are special communications and what makes dreams different from ordinary daydreams or thoughts that you have or fantasies that you have is that you're asleep when you happen so the kind of thinking that you do when you're asleep is different from the kind of thinking you do when you're awake it's more visual um things don't always make sense things happen that aren't real and all of those things can happen in a daydream too but you're pretty clear that that's going on while you're doing it so i think we have no way of knowing if you dream something in which you're imagining yourself as a child whether that's because that's a real memory of when you were a child or whether you're having a fantasy of what i wish my childhood were really had been like or thank god my childhood wasn't like what i'm just thinking about right now i mean dreams have motives to them but i don't think we should ever assume that we know in advance what the mechanism is any more than we would you know if you're just sitting by yourself bored and having a daydream it doesn't necessarily you don't know where where it comes from just by that did that answer both of your questions well my second question was about does it does a deficiency in the formation of facial expressions exist and if it if it doesn't really it does i think so there's a condition a condition i mean everything's on a spectrum like Patricia was saying everything's on a bell shaped curve you know normal is you know a wide range but yes i think there are people who are not as much in tune with their emotional life and i think it's reflected in they have less affective expression in their faces yes i think there are people like that i think i've seen them and just that then manifest and also sort of mirror neuron problems like you know they they cannot manifest expressions to mirror other people therefore they have you know less of a conception of what i think anyone has actually studied that but one of the um you know we're a lot of what we have to understand about ourselves as people is the impact we have on other people so if someone is not expressing very much they're gonna have a different impact on someone else than if they're very expressive and unless they know that life will be very confusing um and so whereas someone who's very expressive like me you know has a different impact and sometimes it's a little too much for people and i have to you know contain myself and so i have to know about that impact and so it's just the range and i think it's uh but i'm nervous about assuming that some of you is not so expressive lacks some inner emotional life i mean the British are worried about that yeah i think people who are not in touch are maybe less expressive on their i think they demonstrate not always i mean they have different per no but i'm entertaining yes if there's a category of people and i think there is a case i don't mean that is a broad generalization yeah but i'm just entertaining the thought that there could be a certain type of person who's deeply in touch with their emotional life but for whatever reason masks it they've been yes so much irony well so yes well i think you know one of the things that i understand about children is and that is unique to the human species unlike other animals is we are raised to with the with the social cultural norms of the society we're raised in which means you can take a child born in russia you know carry them to you know patagonia and they're going to do just fine because the way of life is something you learn from the adults around you and so if you grew up in britain you're you're perfectly well socialized to behave in a particular way that to a new yorker would seem you know cold right but it isn't you said it like my husband's from iowan i'm from new york and i live in los angeles and when he first came to new york he said oh now i get it everyone yells at each other but he thought it was just me but there's something of an emotional two-way street isn't there and that you're just if you spend your day smiling just the fact that your smile muscles are turned on yes does have any from red not that i do it but you know so i presume that if if you if your muscles don't work and your face won't express maybe you would have a harder time emotionally uh feeling the things that you would otherwise but two observations from the talk that i wonder if you guys would comment on uh the first is uh essentially i guess you've been talking about declarative memory and have not really been that explicit about that during the discussion um and declarative memory is about conscious you know recollection as opposed to all the other kinds of memory which have been kind of mixed in having to do with skill acquisition stuff and that which is not necessarily conscious and consciousness is very selective you know so for the most part consciousness serves uh in in in terms of expectation and when we see situations which are beyond our expectation we switch from our habit system to a more conscious system because we're attempting to adjust our model to these surprising circumstances and and update our model and integrate this new experience so i wonder if maybe you guys could comment on that the other issue was uh the thing about hot and cold cognition and uh so there were some interesting discussions about you know how adolescents don't switch that on and so you know i i always recall this 12 year old that sat next to me in a bus and she said excuse me sir is this seat not taken and she spoke to me like an adult and i just had to ask her a whole bunch of questions and she lived on a cattle ranch in northern california where she had learned to ride when she was seven and she had her own horses her father took her out hunting she learned how to shoot a gun by the age of nine she was a sharp shooter and she told me about one time when she had to stay in the woods because a cougar was circling around and she climbed the tree and fell asleep and what i'm trying to say is that you know there hasn't been much of a discussion of other cultures and other cultures have a lot of demands you know and and when we were you know a couple hundred years ago you know by the time you were 12 or 14 you you you had a lot of expectations put on you and your brain had done that flip from being mostly you know reflexive and imitative to starting to be more prefrontal and being able to you know adjust to those expectations and demands so cultural issues as well as biological issues work together in turning that system those systems on and i wonder if you might comment on those things that's a great observation of course you know what those of us who study brain development we often we do it from a brain eccentric perspective right we talk about the impact of brain development on behavior but of course the environment and the behavior impact brain development so your observation about you know over evolutionary time it's entirely likely that we have somewhat slowed down the development of the maturation and the the development of the pre-frontal cortex because we aren't making those demands on our adolescence we have this extended period of adolescence so it's not a you know it's not a coincidence but it does work both ways and you're absolutely right to point that out that we we can't just talk about brain development and its impact on behavior we also have to think about the demands and the situations in which the individual and the culture right places the individuals and that does impact the extent to which or the speed at which and the extent to which we are seeing development so that's that's an excellent observation the issue of declarative are the the explicit conscious memory that's what we can bring into the laboratory that's what we can bring into the session except through other probing techniques that that you can study but certainly from the standpoint of laboratory science that's the that's the focus and when we think about autobiographical or personal memories find in terms of these consciously accessible memories so the category is limited to that five percent of our of our lives that we spent being consciously aware most of our behavior is determined outside of our awareness so they're both very good observations though for people in my world almost everything we're studying is things that people are not consciously aware of so you use language all the time you're not conscious how you're doing it and it's it's almost declarative is the last thing we deal with on two things that I recall reading somewhere was something in one of the Malcolm Gladwell books about I think a fellow by the name of Erickson who had categorized all the muscles in the face to talk about their what they were thinking emotionally and in fact I remember one thing that he said in there was when I think Erickson was or whoever it was was watching the Democratic Convention and he saw Clinton and he said pecs bad boy just from the muscular expressions so I wonder if you could comment about that and secondly something I remember reading a long time ago sometimes where we can't articulate a feeling it might be something that we absorbed as an infant where we couldn't speak but yet we still had that feeling so either I'd like to hear Eckert is the is the is the Ekman thank you Ekman Paul Ekman there we go that's right locally stupid units right you know we we we managed Paul Ekman and he did it is an exquisite categorization scheme that is 277 points I think on the face I don't know the scheme so I I've never labored to learn it but absolutely where you can characterize every muscle in the face and those that are associated with positive expressions negative expressions and the like so and he I won't comment about Clinton he does I mean just a cautious word about Ekman he's in part sold this research as a way of analyzing the extent to which people are misleading you and so the security agencies in the United States for example have funded quite a lot of his research on the grounds that it will help them figure out who is telling the truth and who is lying and I think a psychologist experimental psychologist would be much more nervous about the claim that he tends to make which is that he can distinguish truth tellers from liars it turns out to be very difficult he claims a certain success but anyway I'm just I just want to insert a question mark there into that yeah absolutely our last question okay my question is about like the stories that children are told like and especially like fairy tales I mean it seems to me that like you know the Walt Disney version of say Snow White or Cinderella is very different from like the Grims you know Grims fairy tales you know and how that kind of affects even like in the story of like Cinderella well now you have like a more feminist kind of perspective on what like you know sits in the well or Snow White is so how kind of cult revolves and I guess I should respond to that. Well for one thing a very pragmatic thing is to Walt Disney movies take what 45 minutes or an hour and a half or something and a fairy tale you read in five minutes so they add a lot of things but clearly there there's a lot of values being looked at and thought about and taught and and commercial values especially I think in the case of Hollywood studios so the fairy tales are not necessarily really the ways to plumb the depths of the social mind that the Grims brothers and claimed because there's a lot of actual literary content to those by you know by artists writers who are writing things but but it's it's a matter of different values basically I think that I prefer the the Grims and a lot of people grow up preferred. I was under the impression that those fairy tales were not necessarily specifically for children when they were originally. No they were collect and I sort of believe it is that the Grims brothers were involved in the program to collect stories that would define the German nationality and create a German culture that didn't really exist as one thing and that was what they you know they were also linguists creating a German addiction area of etymology so so this was kind of the same thing in terms of stories and and that was what they were doing but as soon as it came out in 1815 they published their first collection and people all over the place bought it and gave it to their children and they had to go back and sort of rewrite their preface this things changed they they started changing the way they told the stories and even they as they went on through the years revision and making different editions they changed the stories to make them in their case they they made them more appropriate for children as they saw it because they got more vicious and the punishments were worse and simpler in the in the morality that they were telling because there were a lot of things in the first edition that were very morally weird and funny and great in anyways because they because they got them in some cases straight from the storytellers who were having a good time so okay well please join me in thanking our participants for providing such a fascinating discussion today so you're able to come to dinner yes oh good yes good nice because you're are you here alone or is your wife oh yes otherwise thank you
