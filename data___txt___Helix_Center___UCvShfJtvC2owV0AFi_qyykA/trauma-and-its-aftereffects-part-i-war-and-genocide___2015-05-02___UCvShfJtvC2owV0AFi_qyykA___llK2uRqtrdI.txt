I'll announce today's program. I'll tell you about our program in two weeks which is on Friday. I'm going to summarize what is here. In 2010 he served as an Jewish center fellow under the center of Jewish history in New York and was awarded the dissertation grant of the central European history society. He has been long concerned with cultural responses to catastrophe and has engaged issues of trauma, war, general side and cultural representation and production. The association for Jewish studies journal as well as a forthcoming conference proceedings under the Armenian Genocide Institute and museum. He has a master's of divinity from the St. Vladimir's orthodox and certificate in Armenian studies from St. Nersez Armenian cemetery. His wide range of research interests include the relationship between psychology and theology, positive and existential psychology, forensic psychology and therapeutic applications of binaural beats. Godfrey Wagner is a music college media director and publisher. He is here visiting us from Italy. He works internationally as a lecturer of music and politics. He completed his PhD in Vienna and is now based in Milan. His studies are centered on German culture and politics of the 19th and 20th century in connection with Jewish culture and history. He has published on Kurt Weil and Bertolt Wehr and taught in universities and culture institutions on five continents. He was engaged with the post show opera Lost Childhood with music by Janish Hammer and Liberato by Mary Israel, which was developed since 1992 and first presented in 2014. His autobiography, the Twilats of the Wagner's was translated into seven languages.

He was recently honored with the Bates Farnham Outstanding Achievement Award by his graduating class at Princeton University. Okay. It's really a great honor to be with such a distinguished panel and to welcome our guests from Europe especially. And I hope that the volume is acceptable. I will raise my voice. I thought a logical place to begin is the process of actually coming to knowledge of trauma and the experience of it. Because from one point of view trauma perhaps could be seen as making the world a stranger place or making removing a sense of home from an individual in the world. And whether that be descendants of trauma, whether that be family member, have the role as bystander. And so I thought I just had the question that I would love to hear all of the other panelists answer very simply is how did trauma first become a result of a trauma. One could argue either there are genetic or physiological components that we all have a passive birth of trauma. But how did we actually begin to confront and engage the challenge that trauma poses to writing history, telling stories about ourselves, about our families, the countries, the world that we live in. Anybody can pick up from there. Well, I don't think I have an answer to the question. I wonder if anybody here has. But still we, a psychologist, we are bored. I'm sorry, first of all I wanted to say thank you for inviting me. And English is not my first language so I'll try to become a psychologist and try to be comprehensible by you. And please interrupt me if you don't understand. For a psychoanalyst we get to trauma through the that means that we immediately go into the field of psychopatology in a way, which means that we know the trauma, of course, as a person, as a person we know the trauma like anybody else and even as professional we know the trauma by its effects. The effects it has on the people and probably the patients that come to us, which is in the way of some kind of a bias because we only know of the pathologic of psychopatologic effects of trauma. So we have to work all the way back to what is trauma, how is it in the theory since the beginning, but I won't go into it now. I think we can discuss psychopatology or not. But not, you mean every, there could be alterations after a trauma that will not necessarily be psychopatology or every alteration is going to be psychopatology. No, I don't think it's, every head is psychopatology, but we, the course, I mean the field of the theory relates to psychopatology, which is the field of psychoanalysis in fact, which is a real bias that we hope we can discuss between us because that's all we're supposed to know about. This seems to start with questions. I mean, I think probably reflects each of us in our own backgrounds and such. And I think for me it was growing up at a time at the height of the Cold War essentially. And so all the stories that are associated with that and then that you learned through history you think, I think one is perhaps inclined to think, well, what happened to those people? You know, what's the story after this story I've just heard? And how do you then investigate that? And as you get older you see these things are consistently happening. And not only are they happening in real time, but it seems a bit of the nature of trauma is that it stops time and then stops populations or individuals, freezes them in a given moment that could have been a year ago, it could have been a hundred years ago, could have been five hundred years ago, and you constantly get these opportunities to ask more questions and try to figure out how did it happen? What happened afterwards? How does it manifest? And you know, in a way we all have plenty of material to work with for better and for worse, but once you start asking those questions it's kind of hard to stop. Well, I think part of what we do need to do is define what trauma is. And I think you've provided a good example of this experience of wanting to make some meaning out of something that's happened to us or to other people for that matter. And trauma, I would, if I can just proper my own definition, which is, of course, compiled by composed of things that other people have said for me, is that trauma is that which our psyche can't deal with. We can't make meaning out of that experience. There's not some easy way that we can plug it in, conceive notion of who we are, who another person is, and what that relationship looks like. So I think to think of when I became aware of trauma would be in my own personal experience to think about when was the point in my life, the first point in my life where I thought, I can't make sense out of this. What is going on? And of course, then also how closely it is related to the starting point to become later on, having chosen also the way of a historian or a psychotherapist. There are political, there are always deep reasons why we go astree and get interested and committed also for life. So first of all, I also want to thank for the invitation. My name is Gottfried Wagner and I came to the topic already very early as a child. I grew up in Bavaria in the so-called American occupation zone and there was a re-program and there was, you cannot imagine, but there was a time without television. So what the information we got by the real news, there was a kind of real news, no television. So we put us in 600 kids in a huge cinema and we saw the rise and the fall of the third Reich without having been prepared by teachers, parents and grandparents. We know also why. But anyway, we went in and so we were all in. And this was not the time of cruel video games. It's also very important. It's a very boring provincial city. The best thing was for me always the highway. Even that was built by Adolf Hitler, which I found out later on. But the way to escape from this provincial city, nothing happened. So we were confronted without being informed on the third Reich. So we saw 600 kids, Hitler, what he did for the German people and all this combination with Nuremberg. And then I even listened to the music Nuremberg with Riechad Wagner, which I as a kid heard in a different connection. And then it was even shown with a Wagner plan. So and then Nick's sequence was then World War II. And it ended even worse with pictures from Buchenwald concentration camp. So the after effect of 600 kids was immediate because normally we were rather normal kids. Oh, no, school is finished. So one went out of the cinema as a group experience also in deep silence. But in this variation, my situation was different because the family was shown on the screen. So there was this kind of association immediately. Oh, these are all Nazis and they have to do with a place Buchenwald and what is about the Jews. And so this was all a kind of a really, yes, I would say this was a really the start of a trauma. And then also becoming reacting and wanted to I wanted to know more what was going on. And that certainly was a starting point for the life I later on followed up. I think Dr. Wagner has introduced some of the direct content. If we link the two parts of the program, war and genocide specifically with trauma. And when we think about it, the 20th century is a century that really has been defined by the trauma of war and genocide. And no previous generations in history ever had to live and die with the knowledge of Auschwitz, Hiroshima, the Armenian genocide. And therefore trauma in a way is universal and germane to the human race in an innocent way. And it's a unique way that will define for the rest of human history its very presence. And learning of the genocide as part and trauma is now part of a human education. And trauma is unavoidable. And at the other hand, as Ryan was saying, in some sense impossible because we can't grasp it or it can't be written or it can't be assimilated psychically perhaps. And just to perhaps connect it to the note of, well, in a very basic terms really what is the trauma of war and genocide. And I think to put it in very simple terms, I would perhaps propose it's death, it's mass death. And in imaginably large scale numbers and I know that when Phil's work investigates directly people who have the experience with death at least in some ways. I think in some ways related to what you're talking about is the perpetrators of trauma are probably less studied, less understood because they're less likely to talk or you may not want to talk to them or whatever they may be in prison, whatever it might be. I would though expand, I mean I would think, you know, I would think that the majority of populations war and death are definitely a big part of it but if we look in this country now I think trauma is very much associated with soldiers even though far and away the most trauma victims are rape victims. So I don't think it's just, I mean, which could be called a kind of a death, I mean, but are kind of a, you know, as injurious as it could be but in terms of getting to that point where I was interested in what happens when people are although it's one of those problems that Darling, who is not a Playersribal soldier has only has injuries that one killer over time as well because there's all these different elements and once you know because I've been doing this for a while and the almost default setting is to go to the victims. You know go to the people who've experienced it and absorbed it without getting both sides so to speak and it's not a sort of equivalency but it's just parties to this thing and both roles matter. I mean I think both roles matter you know who it was that injured you, who it was that killed your people your family whatever it's all related in a way that I think is relevant for a long time to come and just as you say when you look at the 20th century we can go back further I mean we talk about Native Americans in this country what happens to those people who do this thing to you and your people that matters and what happens on the flip side as well it all matters in the evolution of one's own experience of trauma their own and their people as I'd say. Abel and I had lunch yesterday and we were talking about the study of perpetrators and the importance of doing that study but do you think it's possible that the perpetrators have not been studied enough not only because they're not available because obviously large number of them are available in Cambodia but that we really are not that interested in hearing their story because in a way it's happening a little bit with Turkey they have an explanation for their behavior so why would we be interested? Sure well I think that I think that's true and I think I think on a larger scale especially when you get something like Turkey you get the political explanation that everyone is supposed to follow on that side so to speak it's hard to work around it and I think you have to find individuals really and then individuals who are willing to talk about it individuals who are able to articulate it in some way and really a setting that works and I think we've probably all been the panels like this before and even the most interesting ones are somewhat controlled I'd say measured and I happen to go to this thing the other night it's called Theater of War it's a group that reads classical plays about war usually to soldiers and soldiers and groups related to soldiers and they did one for journalists who had covered war and they had David Straytter and the actor and Francis McDormand reading from Sophocles's Ajax and I thought oh this would be you know they'll sit around the table and they'll do a nice little reading and whatever and I walked in a little late and David Straytter and was shouting and Francis McDormand was wailing and like having that injection of it into the more intellectual discussion was fascinating and jarring and nearly overwhelming to be honest with you and I think that that's what's hard about studying some of these things where you have Ajax as rendered by Straytter talking about the feeling of you know disseminating death essentially in ways that you rarely get when you look at when you have more clinical settings or more standard interview settings so you're raising an interesting point it's not that we don't want to hear about it because we don't want to hear the justification we also don't want to hear about it because if the person expresses the emotions it would just make us too anxious to sit there and listen to it well in part and I think it triggers a lot of things but I also think we all know as we hear these stories there's an impact on us as well I mean this is dark stuff this is this is not you know we have a beautiful Saturday afternoon and we're here talking about this I mean I think it's it's it's that's a version of I think what happens when you study these things you start asking these questions and then maybe you all have had similar experiences but then it becomes something you yourself have to bear and that's that's hard and I think that's hard for populations at large to do it's not only I think you're right it's not that we don't want to hear but first of all perpetrators usually I'm talking about war perpetrators they don't usually seek for help or seek for anything outside because they act for instance in the Aramaic trial is a point disappointing it's a it's a small word for what happens a small world word not it's that they were not guilty and they didn't say anything about what happened I taking the Aramaic trial because it's an icon you say an icon so usually we don't know anything about perpetrators we know now being in 2015 we know a lot about victims we know more and more I don't think we can even I'm not sure we can know more than we know now about victims but the other side let's say the we the if the victims have witnesses of what happened of history the perpetrators are witnesses to and the bystanders are with witnesses as well so we know very little about perpetrators and it seems to me that the focus has shifted now to the perpetrators and the way of knowing directly what happened there wouldn't talk otherwise there wouldn't be perpetrators maybe that's any purchases if they would talk and present what they will do or not do maybe there won't be perpetrators I don't know but still I wanted to stress two points maybe which seemed very obvious for we talking about collective trauma today and the way that it's resented by individual which is a field maybe we could go in with later the trauma could be could appear as everybody war genocides this I mean everybody goes through it but everybody reacts in some and then that it's man-made disaster we're talking about not what happens in a in a life but it's manufactured disaster to other men which makes it very complicated it raises the issue of evil you say evil and for us psychoanalysts this evil is not a psychoanalytic or emotion but we still we have death drive we have all kinds of other words for it but evil is not so we have to deal and in fact it's not fascinating it's not the good word for it but what makes people aggress kill because we talked about death before that's the main the main issue of our of our research if we are researcher so I think we can maybe we have not yet talked about transmission transmission of trauma to the other generations second third maybe fourth generation we have not yet talked because we're just starting our panel but I think we'll get to it so what happens to the transmission of the paper traders what happens to the other generations the children grandchildren psychoan third generation maybe it's a way because as patients we have had I'm sure all well the people who are in this audience they they heard about descendants of paper traders being asking for help so maybe this is a way of knowing more but it's only a suggestion please but anyway I think it's I can talk also about a certain one experience when I was discussing with Aishma and junya and Hebrew universal in Jerusalem as well those who really have this kind of top Nazis as fathers they believe me they also there are some traumatic stories to tell and when you meet then in Jerusalem to discuss that I was done but on you might of course born voice for the discussion for the contract how can we start a dialogue it's much too much how can we come from molar walks one day to the discussion one day might be personally even to a dialogue and then communicated even via books and publications and the possibilities we have for the video there's still a lot has to be done a lot of work and as you said rightly but of course let's might be I would like to know from you now with a kind of his also historical distance always very close we have the trial of course then of Aishma in Israel and which of course you know the famous book then of Hannah Arendt in all the after effects even of include my generation how to handle those extremely prominent voices as also then part of the Numbag trial and I see now we have 70 years after we talked about 1945 and I'm witness of the discussion also in Europe especially in Germany was still as exploding when you touch these topics it's amazing so when we talk about also was just two weeks ago in Istanbul and they have their president who's publicly denied you know the genocide of Armenians and now he found himself as under high pressure internet high pressure by the Pope friends fences by the German French Italian government and suddenly he had to make a step which was quite an international tough discussion and even for me as a participant in this kind of experience genocide talking about the Shouwa the Chinese Armenian genocide finding yourself with having like in our case as a group bodyguards to talk about it shows that still is everything is very delicate and sensitive you know so we have to choose very well our words when we when we touch these browns but you are you are expressing something about the after effect of trauma hundred years afterwards so it's because of the Armenian it's hundred years and we can still watch I don't know if we can describe them after effects after one century Shouwa 70 years so maybe there is a period of social latency which is like well I thought I want some I published something about that being 40 years social so collectively and see that it takes even in Vietnam it took even the Algerian war of you know in France it's very important what happened anyway like a very long period of time which it's more or less that's a more than less and we don't know why it is it is silent because the victims wouldn't talk which I don't think it's true the recipients wouldn't listen it takes about 40 50 years of collective latency I'll say it again to bring the topic into the public scene and so people could feel free to tell those stories which maybe they couldn't feel feel somebody will listen to them too. I think the leg of it yes we don't sometimes we're living in this kind of also a self-censorship I mean I'm talking about the media I mean really who really asks them in a way but why why censorship self-censorship also else and yesterday we talked about why hundred years afterward it is so important to deny the genocide what does it make any difference to Turkey now to recognize that has been a genocide what would it change so there must be a psychic it's not economic because there is no economic but I have to defend the groups of those young Turkish people I have contact with them they do really outstanding work serious work and they do not get the right chance in the Turkish media here we are so this is I think so you'll be talking about politics again so if you better don't touch certain topics but the time now in Turkey I'm sure that it's changing even after the collective latency is the belated recognition the belatedness of what actual psychic recognition happens after the period of latency and clearly the case with with Turkey that they haven't even begun that process which means rewriting the textbooks changing their national identity to some to some way that has not that they have evaded and eluded to some extent and just as a brief note about perpetrator versus victim it's kind of interesting that in the historical scholastic studies of the debates about war and genocide are from the perspective of the choices made that war and genocide is a can be a political choice made by governments and that option has been produced in the modern world because it's ongoing in Darfur in Sudan to some extent in the Middle East well although it's fascinating to hear that from the psychoanalytic research point of view the individual analysis has focused more on victims rather than perpetrators and some of the research that has been done on perpetrators of evil a couple of very interesting things one is that perpetrators just look normal they don't look that differently than we do they don't they would have normal little bit differently or well we would hope we would hope but the scary part is that as much as we get into an investigative I think we understand that within us there is evil or we are capable of doing evil however you want to you know phenomenologize that um construct but I think that that's one reason why we wouldn't want to study it so much because well it there isn't it's so hard to explain and I think even harder to explain on a collective when you talk about rape and that's a very violent act done let's just say one person to one person and that's hard enough to explain right yeah I think that's something that was trauma can also be called the thing that tells you the world is not what you is and it just upsets that balance and if you talk about I mean to both your points if you talk about a period of latency when a society or a people have to begin to process this thing that's not happening in a vacuum at the same time there's competing forces that would want to seize that narrative and use it for whatever their purposes might be and you know to say there's something inside us that means we could all be prone to horrendous acts is a similar thing that thing is developing and the context around us or the people around us who are creating the narrative or we were figuring out a way to make to try to make you tip over to that side where you will do those things is is out there I mean and then it could be it could happen in any number of ways I mean like you say you were seeing these films as young as you know as a boy and then seeing that happen rendered in 10 minutes the whole process or however long the film was I mean like that is a thing that is going on making steps not been laid out right and I'm sure some of these people that are that were at rallies early on in Nazi Germany or in other circumstances exactly like us I mean I think they were and they were us in some ways but the context was such and the charisma behind the people or the individuals or whatever who had this way to tell you or tell me that the context of your life is this so you should do this and it is possible to make people believe that but then of course also for me for the perpetrators this for me always very important to know how the children of perpetrators are educated how confronted with the war and might be the war crimes of the fathers so here we are and as we know if this is not discussed out already within the families it goes on from generation to generation and you know it's it's not finished with that if the courage at least within the family one day to put it on the really to discuss that out even with pain but it's necessary to do that so I'm talking about really now the third and fourth generations of course now I'm talking about I'm also Italian citizens so I have the confrontation with Italian fascism and denial to work over that seriously you know so the way it is treated also these days of remembrance it is enormously superficial and it's always touching you know in a way which is not acceptable so of course here we are again we're entering them the media what are we doing it do one day in it in such a way you see all the horrors one day of Auschwitz Birkenau and the next generation is paralyzed you know but instead of creating a continuity of serious teaching at school at university in Mediana there's so much still to do only in Europe but also in the United States to make it much more profound can I if I can ask you a question I when you say when you start to undertake an investigation of your own family and their relationship to this did you have resistance from other people in your family of course from all generations right I mean my my sisters represent officially the Wagner Festival in Pyroid and with now especially also again with my last book of course you know this is absolutely a taboo book for Germans to upper society so anyway but now I'm not any longer in my 20s so you have to like my own my own life and you see that and that I'm not only my 20 so it's time at least for the next generation talking about my son and might be one day also my grandchildren and I want to not to leave this kind of not to act over past but it can come usually it comes very often even with the week or the other world run it means that the grandchildren they ask you right yes and well we have all kind of explanation like for instance that for the survivors it I'm talking about the survivor part but it was difficult for the for the second children of the survivor to ask the parents because of an or a dip in reasons because it's too hot and too close it's too close sometimes to one development but grandchildren often often very often ask the grandparents because it's generation later they can ask it's it's gone into history with a big age and all saves you say that big and great age so it's not only the personal history but it's goes into but it goes on in generation different forms so very often the grandchildren ask questions and even Germany there was one German researcher Vensler I think yes yes yes yes yeah he made research and the the title of his book is no grandfather was not a Nazi yes although he was but the narrative of the story by the grandchildren is to always pick up a nice event in the in the life of the Nazi yes I mean and to show that he had some kind of consolidation of his victims it's very hard to accept that your grandfather more grandfather than grandmother but is was a perpetrator in a way so they do reconstruct the whole history yes but then of course we also have to take very serious in consideration that we certainly have had for a long time two Germanies no don't forget that the education the communistic system is a completely different one in the in the west Germany and even the problems the communication within the Germans from the from the two sides even my generation next generation there's a lot of problems to communicate about that now so they had two forms of totalitarianism Hitlerism then we had Stalinism and so how can you get along with this such a kind and then coming to them to Europe not for Europe so it never ends so we have we have the topic is slowly but shifted from survivors I thought I think everybody sought survivors being victims but we shifted slowly to survivors perpetrators are survivors as well too the one who survived so it's kind of frame thinking which is changing slowly if we want to get a complete picture of the situation that's what I wanted to say I'm sorry please that's a very very key point for me always a global event in automatically then one is sensitive 17 million people died so it's all the world is connected and automatically we come to to also your specific you are constantly but those are just two huge points I think one is the slippage between traumatization and victimization and what do they share in common how shall we separate them conceptually and then also between war and genocide that genocide happens kind of structurally under the shadow of war and how do we extract it if we take the case of the Soviet Union where there is no culture of practice of commemorating genocide and the Holocaust specifically because they lost 25 million people so what is six to them therefore and the way in which though that in contemporary European society that this commemoration has become part of a culture it's become part of a practice and then of course it's over determined by the fact that victims genocidal victims I mean the case of the Armenian Jews were long persecuted these are minority groups that existed in at the fringes of society that are often exploited for their their talents their adaptations socially and culturally as well and it does have a form of exploitation the fact that for effective reasons outsider groups are chosen in order to employ some of the you know the id instincts essentially in culture but it's also just a response to how to victim groups practice commemoration or develop those practices because I mean just a very colloquial thing that I often run up again discussions about this is a very simple phrase that I've heard from very complicated minds such as why don't they just get over it and why is it just not dropped and this perhaps could lead to many questions I think one immediate response that Dr. Weil mentioned simply that they haven't gotten it yet there's nowhere to get over it if you haven't gotten it yet but they do overcome too because we talking I started with psychopathology but it's only part of showing signs of two victims they never seek any profession they never seek will look for professional help they do overcome and they don't I think it's it's both in a way because they lead lives they have I mean they construct families they construct institutions for the victims they do all they they they build the country they they do all kind of things and at the same time in various from place to place of course I lived in Vietnam for a time and was endlessly fascinated and wish and hope to perhaps look at it more one day but in Vietnam who had the war the French the war the Americans were the Chinese the war the Cambodians I mean not just we forget about some of those other ones and then a near near famine in the 80s and you go there now and the attitude is absolutely like if you'll work with us we'll work with you I mean as an American as the Chinese and they do not like the Chinese that's generalized but they don't like the Chinese but but but but there's this this sense of like we need to get over there and I don't care what your grandfather did I don't care what your grandfather well I care but more important is is how do we get over there and and then you go you know I mean you look in the Middle East and you see like well in the 12th century this happened and so we're still going to fight about it and then like why sorry for me I'm very interested in in in your points what is the discussion of the young Vietnamese I mean how do they then you talk to them if you're young say you know 20 years old that means when you were a kid the country was nearly starving and in the countryside they were near famine conditions and so as you grow up then you get some you know the economy gets loosened up you get some generation of wealth people start actually having possessions they start taking their money out from under the mattress and thinking they can put it in a bank because there's a sense of a future and then you get a hunt and then the Honda scooter was the thing like that that was that meant you had kind of made it and that evolves over time and you look even China right now which you know went through I think one of the if it's not strange to say this but one of the most underappreciated mass traumas of this past century or last century there are things now and often they are things filling some of those spaces I think and some of it is commercial but some of it is just this sense of like we are moving forward we don't have time for this and it could be a sense of denial it could be like in the discussion with you when you talk with them personally when you talk about your work are they are they curious to know about your point of view well the government of Vietnam was not terribly interested in my point of view that's one of the people there and I and I remember when when I left I had lunch with a guy who who ran the spokesman from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and I said to him I really wish we could have talked about this because I think it's very interesting and I think you have other examples of countries in that area that perhaps show aside what else it might look like but at least in his role he couldn't have that conversation and I don't know how much people would want to dwell on it either and you could call that a form of denial or you could call that you know but I think there's a strong and underground email communication there are activities which are of course kept still secret to not putting risk those who are interested now there's a little bit my experience and you have north of yet to me what we're not going to be me is authors writing memoirs that you can buy that people sell you on the street I mean yeah and I think and and you know because we were talking about mentioning Iraq before when American sniper came out here you know talking about attempts to seize a narrative whether it's de facto or it just sort of happens but but a guy named Brian Turner who was a soldier who read a memoir called My Country Is a Foreign Place or something like that he said we're not going to know the history of this war on our side until we get their side you know we need to get those stories too and as they come up somehow and I don't know what the compact is amongst you know again I don't want to speak to you generally but in Vietnam like what was the compact that said we collectively are going to do this or we are we or enough of us are going to do this that that becomes the the path forward rather than you know fighting or still fighting or or doing whatever else might do they might do to just stay in that place to I mean it was like refusing to be frozen in that place that someone else wanted them to be frozen in so I mean also we had of course a whole discussion with ex Yukusilab here you know what happened there now so now they had the trial at least in in then so this is really discussed out in Europe the trial with the I think most cruel also form of perpetrators or so here coming to the point now what is in your experience of course you are much more qualified than I then the common points when you make comparison can you make comparison between the different in a certain way of point of psychoanalyan analysis the behavior of perpetrators in the different route is there something which you would say is there deeply inside the human being the very darkest rectusite to to kill we know very little about perpetrators I psychoanaly and purgatory look for because that comes to what you say to the core of the evil which is our field of study to what makes people what makes human beings act the way they act but we have only theoretical ed you will correct me do we have anything but theoretical answers to it like I think we may be in a position where we can ask questions be able to formulate questions then have any answers whatsoever we have no answers but we have a very thick chemical material that we can but we we must be very careful not to generalize observation for what happens on the couch over the hour hour how you say offices to generalize to what it happens to the whole population but what would you say that genocide or mass massacre of a wide population is different than the kind of trauma for example soldiers had during the first World War they had trauma they had symptoms serious symptoms some of them afterwards there's a great deal of money being spent in the US right now on research about post-traumatic disorder which has to do with the Iraq war so there soldiers went as fighters and they ended up being traumatized that's seems to me there's a difference between that and what when you deal with the issue of genocide which is where like with the Nazis or with the Turks during 100 years ago is they literally killed children and not that accidentally a bomb blew up and there were a couple of kids around but systematically so there is a difference there i don't know what that is but in one at least you are fighting you have a chance of fighting or you are the fighter yourself and still get traumatized and in the other you are you have absolutely no recourse absolutely i think i mean the original psychoanalytic impetus i think to develop war and arocyss and trauma theory was originally in the service of the war effort i believe that how can we make a more efficient mechanized soldiers to avoid sons themselves were serving in the Austrian army at the time and i think that the the targeted population or the policy which is really a modern option of genocide i mean to come back to this idea of feeling unsafe in the world that somehow the awareness is of it's a to extract the very conditions of life for an entire people and to live under the shadow of a death sentence and specifically if we take the idea the the Armenian homeland and the eastern part of turkey at the time of saying this ancient home of this people will not be there anymore and we can essentially wipe them from the face of history and the famous quote that hymnal made this will be a never to be written rheumus brat a page of glory in a never to be written history book as the undertaking that somehow it has a structure of a secret as well that an impossibility that can be carried out but shouldn't be known or or disclosed and clearly it's a distinctive the ability to do it i think of the spirit of science it's been argued it's a surgical operation that only after Darwin with population engineering and genetics did it even become possible to conceive of the idea of the removal of a people i see all the problems we have in this now right now they are clobed problems we are talking about from the global indifference because when we are really going to the bottom of the whole discussion which i'm living in a country where we have just a month 80 000 people from different north america from seer ever from Africa sorry from Syria so we are in a situation that we are concretely confronted with people dead bodies in the sea you know so this is a for me it is a very strong signal also for the academic world in which way we will in future now also confront these issues even in our different disciplines i think it's there's a major need for for me to be more courageous to to coordinate much better those who have a certain kind of similar visions but were always different but they're called global coordination for these issues to communicate much more profound is i think one of the for me most urgent issues but you are the best example of that i encourage if we take the other directing and in biorite how is it possible that out of the same family you came and went a different direction and your sisters didn't i have good i have even i have to defend parts of this for me terrible Wagner clan but they are also those who did not were not part of that i'm talking about my direct aunt who is really in Wagner who left as as a young woman nazi-charmony she was on the list of him to be killed in the hotel bower or luck so let's talk about that too and there's even a direct also descendant whose name is france will him by the and the rhyme a republic with leo kessenbach one of the most important cultural figures he had to escape from nazi-charmony already in june because he was married to a bélene a jewish woman out coming out from a very important it's a family and so i had to escape so within the family uh so i had also orientations including my own mother so you have to make individual out your choice which way you want to follow i think it's all i think it starts there and then of course you have to find of course you need urgently in a certain period also the right people who look after you who who who give you advice who who help you because it's difficult when you are generally spoken the son of a pepper it's very difficult to be also a child of a victim so you need this kind of exchange putting yourself in you know in the position of the other and and as i know free decades experience it is a very delicate and sometimes also very painful experience but it has to be done there is no other choice i think your question was more how come the same father the same mother the same education more or less give us such different outcomes but of course it all depends who is influencing you more it must not always be the father who is who has an impact on your order so we all have might be in my case i was lucky to have someone like a entreated into who was also a rebellion but you're also presenting an argument i think which would the the the Turkish governments should listen to because if you you Germany has recognized its role yes and so it makes it easier for you to have developed from that position forward but if the government doesn't recognize the role the Turks can't really work this out some have but the general population cannot have because they don't have the recognition to say okay so that did happen and now we are going to move forward they are stuck and it's i think the in my view the Turkish government should realize should recognize that no matter what they say the world population considers them as having committed this atrocity so they're in a way walking around with the stain on them which is affecting the relationship internationally it's affecting their whole application to the european union and if they so in the past this was done we apologize and move forward they start removing the stain but for some reason they can't so they have been effect criminalize criminalize the action in the business I think or helplessness i'm hopeful for turkey i mean this is and i don't see that it's negatively no i mean i really had um i'm talking with also scholars in this issue for three decades and and i'm not it's not only about this here so it's not going on and we should give them help we should so apart they should be actively integrated the young Turks but i think the the hopelessness and the helplessness um a big factor in in collective trauma that isn't um necessarily present in those cases where a soldier will go up with with his company but it's also interesting to think of um collective consciousness so it wasn't the first consciousness that we thought of it was individual consciousness and and we're kind of going up and down this ladder of uh disability and individuality if you will and it gets interesting to think of and collective even a psychological term it came from sociology it's Durkheim um and and he talks about the social organism we can make building on that i think some interesting comparisons between how societies cultures ethnicities um however you want to define a group uh are able to deal with traumatic experiences by looking at how individuals do that we can look at how groups of perpetrators manifest certain characteristics that are very similar to perpetrators that are individual and so what would happen if turkey said okay what would happen if Armenians just got over it how does that happen individually and if you have one perpetrator saying no i didn't do it i didn't do it i didn't do it saying you're doing it what's what's my natural inclination if i'm the one who's denying it honestly it's probably to deny it even harder dig in my heels let's go at it until the other side says you know what i'm done and you think how many times have we gone through that in our lives with individuals maybe we can think of how that might also play out on a larger theater well i think that's clearly a case where that kind of denial is part of the trauma i mean it becomes perpetuating it and i would you know love to hear more about you know your own work to what extent do you think impacted survivors generations of survivors in the Armenian case the fact that the struggle over recognition of identity in public has been so contested or and it's often raised as a question and i mean even if one takes the case i think just recently down and lower Broadway near wall street the plaque commemorating a slave market i think is being affixed and if how would that transform the geography of new york city if we finally realized okay all of these docs were built by slaves this was where the market was and would transform the perception of the non-recognition in that case that still plagues our society but i'm wondering about how do you think that it impacts psychoanalytic therapy or the process of working through the denial and recognition yeah and and maybe i can address the psychotherapeutic situation first and just um dovetail on what you said earlier that um beyond would talk about the psychotherapist the analyst and the analyst and in the same room together and that's all you can go off of you can't go off of anything else that they're bringing in that's all here say so you just stay in the room and every individual that you're going to deal with every Armenian every Jew every Vietnamese person every person from a one day we can go on down the list of genocides that have happened um will manifest those traumatic experiences differently so there is again going back to this these different levels of consciousness there might be something in common with other people who had similar narratives but they won't be the same narratives never are they going to be the same narratives how can you do your work and your sister does her work it so how are they the same narratives how closer can you get than siblings and i think it also accounts yes just say something sometimes also a very political political city i'm talking about very concretely uh the three hundred letters of autofitler with a bachnachlan there are in possession still handled like a private property but they belong to the to the to Germany so i'm since 20 years that this has to be put on the table and discussed out with his story interdisciplinary discussion and no here we are that if it is still because there's a contradiction for me or from the government side they know about that and they are silencing it up and they are miss maklil or one side oh yes we of course health and israelon all the moment on the same time you're covering three hundred letters from autofitler in the period of 1923 to 1945 so there's a contradiction which is quite you know which has to also be discussed out it's not a family issue it's a public issue three hundred letters of uh people are an international topic for me at least so here we are it's centering the family structure and the public and the society structure is much broader the topic than that's what we're trying to say that there are different in interaction of collective and individual of what we you were trying to express absolutely but and and there i think um you can't really work through a trauma unless you can talk about it i think i and i think that the discussion hasn't been able to be opened in a lot of ways for Armenians in particular because it hasn't been able to be discussed as openly as possible documents on your side now should be known yeah and that's going to take some time and once you once we can talk about it then we can start to work through it and that might take another 40 years that might take a couple of generations so that stuff can be not just on the on the individual level but grandparents can ask or grandchildren can ask their grandparents and that's the beginning of talking and perhaps that's also a factor in that 40 year gap but i think you know we it's come up a few times that the sort of seminal events in these processes are trials like literal trials nuremberg and and and others and i think what you're talking about in a individual setting is a form of a trial i mean it's a much safer thing but but really because it's not just to discuss but it's to have a reckoning of some sort i mean like an acknowledgement of the the gravity of the situation of the acts and their ongoing consequences and i and i wonder like what you all think like do you need a trial of some sort um no matter what your role is in this is as victim as perpetrator i mean especially as victim you talk about our meanings it's like if you don't have the trial and it's not recognized by the Turks or in this case by the american president what does that do to your your how you carry this weight i mean it's a bit of a denial it's a bit of a betrayal almost of your sense of what's right and in the meantime also i mean we're talking about if it this takes time over 40 years when you have people who are traumatized we're talking about big picture but at the same time all the little things are happening and not just you know i mean depression anxiety uh sleeplessness lack of concentration all these things that amongst a group really affect how you develop a year as a family or what have you and if you don't get this reckoning of one form or another that's just going to keep going absolutely and and so what would be gained by a trial one could ask for some people that might be very important that might provide them with the meaning making framework and now we can say okay now we've been we've received whatever vengeance that we've put them on trial okay for another Armenian and by the way you asked 10 of them what would you want from turkey and you'll get 11 different answers but really i think it's up to um individuals to start making these um making their own meaning and being able to share that in a way that can and viscerally impact the other as time goes on and and one way that the Armenian community has tried to do that is say all right turkey's not going to recognize the genocide probably not now probably not in the but what we can do is try to make some sense out of it and so what the church did is they decided to make all of the million and a half martyrs or not all of them but um or not not just a million and a half but um they're all all of those that perished during the genocide are now martyrs so that's a way at least spiritually to sort of provide some sense of meaning but that's not going to help everybody no no but i think you look at say uh Rwanda right now would there probably people here know this better than i do but they have in place of sort of criminal trials they've had kind of public acknowledgments of bringing together victims and perpetrators to to sort end up the the killers um the genocide errors they've had to publicly state what they did and it's a you i don't know if you could call it a form of cleansing or a form of reckoning or something like that but having both parties participate that is a bit of a a contract to say yes it happened i hear you you know now we can maybe carry on and and from what i hear and what i've read there's been some good effects of that but at the same time of course right over the border in drc and in Congo you have the the sort of detritus of this war ongoing people still killing each other and total chaos for rundies on the brink as well i mean yeah so i mean right and so i think you have a problem of scale if nothing else like how do you address all of this beyond just the individual level all right but this is sot Africa find a way to move forward i don't know too much about i mean it was it was public truth commission so i think they call it truth and reconciliation that it just is an resounding committees yeah and i guess you know even just important to build that into the process and recognize the situation oh yeah i mean because if you have to a perpetuates the cycle i mean but it's very understandable but that perpetuates you cycle the other thing you're a victim you take revenge then you're a perpetrator and so you still have that you have to take that on as well and maybe it feels good and certainly you can understand in many cases why you would want to do it and then like on a visceral level how you would might feel or a cultural level you might feel compelled to do it but if you're going to talk about getting in that stage where you reach what you know what's called post-traumatic growth that's not going to do it i think also especially now you with you also story i think it's that the voice is now so clear and it cannot be changed historically this is extremely it's depressing that it took 100 years but the fact that it is now recognized let's also see the the i think for you it should be very important as a for the future how do you see that well as i said i don't have any personal it's okay but anyway i know because of my very different from the Armenians who were in Turkey i have i come my family comes from a different part of Armenia but i think and it seems to me that the this year at least and this is more the views of an observer it seems to me at least this year with the pope taking such a clear position uh awaken a lot of recognition amongst everybody about what happened and i think it's a positive development i think there is a problem however and which Germany has to be solved in terms of the matter of restitution but what we are talking about that whole eastern part of Turkey Armenians have can claim right to property there are churches there are all sorts of things that Armenians if it is recognized can start claiming and that's another i think difficult issue you can one have any kind of reconciliation that's not i mean purely instrumental for kind of the functioning of the economy and how do we get the basic wheels moving again and i do think the issue of justice ultimately restitution not just reconciliation but has to happen in the context of justice as well and that might even involve putting that void that absence of building around the void and saying that we can't actually this is something that will always remain unbridgeable and there isn't a possibility to that's a wound that can never be healed and there are some i think historically and going forward every future generation will have to go through part of their education in engaging and confronting with the these traumas but i think that they can be worked through at the same time and and even there is i would say some sense of spontaneous recovery from trauma at least i can speak for myself as a fourth generation Armenian-american my great-grandparents all of them i came here few before the genocide a few during and i have met several Turks from Turkey and we'll talk and there is a way in which implicitly we just know that we don't need to say anything about what happened that we have moved on somehow in a way that we know what happened it affects us it will continue to somehow an acknowledgement of what happened in both of our minds makes it possible to have a discussion that doesn't even need to go there and can be very amiable and how did that happen did i work through this in therapy no did my family you know my extended family go how did this how did this happen and i think perhaps from another perspective nothing is spontaneous but i don't want to get into synchronicity right now however i think that we're built i think as human beings to be able to at some point perhaps make sense of something that we're not necessarily meaningless for us or we struggle to to wrap our minds around it i mean it sounds somewhat adaptationist so socially adaptationist and i wonder if its perspectival the weakest link or the strongest and even though it's almost a cliche of narratives to say they built a business and they have all these generations and they're kind of these heroic human but the sort of hardcore the broken links the stories that will never be told are for whom survivors ship is a crisis that survival is in itself becomes there's almost an envy of the dead or an envy of the victims that i wish i ended up there and because i have to confront and they were released from having to witness their own their own death but i think i think seeing the world of today i think we what is my feeling about what's going on we nevertheless of all what happens become cynical about human rights i think that when we come to this point and we have that physically you know we're talking about 80 000 came in the last two months so this is a very physical experience and one has to find ways of international communication it's really this is like a house is burning down and people watch and nothing happens we have that now very literal case so but you know we have even in our little village i'm living a little village where my wife is the mayor of a little so there are empty apartments and now it's was a decision of the also of the government so we have to bring them give them a house so that is the situation it's rather rather present and can create a lot of social tensions and all that so we better watch out and so unfortunately these issues are much more concrete racism is growing and and prejudice as we have italy lee-garnard who are preaching really all the racism it's a tough period but i think one has no choice then to resist and speak up you can try i mean to that point i mean there's a there's a group in um israel and palestin territory is called combatants for peace which is israeli ex-sold denny and ex-militants from fatha not from hamas but um and they've come together to do to to say you know we used to fight each other we were both victims and perpetrators and on that language but but um and they're trying to work to affect social change on some level psychologically it's a remarkable story and some of the things these guys have done and transitions they've made in their own thinking and lives are quite astounding functionally i don't think it has much of a difference it doesn't make much of a difference it's not to say you shouldn't do it but but you need a chorus of these sorts of efforts to happen all at the same time and and i think like you say notice the ones that are doing something really quite special but also you know you mentioned uh a house being on fire and no one's looking we had houses on fire neighborhoods on fire just the other day and everyone was looking in and focusing just on that and isolating it just the house or the streets on fire without trying to unravel it's like where does that come from why is that happening why would people do this? a long story before right exactly and i and i think it's related you know you can talk about slave markets in New York city and like could you draw those lines could you unravel the situation and and and who is going to go that far back and who would then act on that in any way that was i think in which role play the media again what's that the media well you know unfortunately you know we had i'm living a country where 70 percent are controlled by balasconi of the media i know what we are talking about yeah and this is all manipulation of information well i think so this is tough education comes out of the right media huh yeah but i think there's fewer and fewer there's more and more around that now and i think the stories that one would want told are out there it's just trying to connect them and i think it is you know it's easy when you show the same piece of footage 50 times in an hour to make it seem like that happen that is still happening the whole time when it's not it's one clip but at the same time i mean you know these broader stories are out there and this is one of the great things about the internet and other things and the immediacy of things like social media which is there is not a control on the narrative it's just a competition that's your not okay i think one side's winning still this competition is changing you know it's very it's a very tough situation with the media we'll stop here and go for questions so if you have questions you walk to the microphone here hello hello i was interested you know moving forward what steps i guess practical pragmatic steps can parents and those who have any influence over the education system k-12 and universities to reduce net future traumas so if we can assume that wars are going to continue happening in our lifetime my lifetime everyone's lifetime i guess who has some time to go you know what sort of steps aside from you know being proponents of therapy all sorts of you know psychology psychiatry what other things moving forward is it perhaps showing more clips spending more time in the curriculum focusing on what the effects of these wars were kind of you know conversations like this you know boiled down to kind of have some sort of effect so when they do actually happen the net absorption of trauma is less so i don't know maybe someone read something about that or know something about that many questions i wish i could answer all the questions i wish i could have a good answer for all these questions but maybe that's talking together and getting to know the other the other side of oneself and the the way they act like maybe you could help because i have no good recipes to give to that question maybe add you have some recipes i'm not sure what what you are what what what what you are asking after saying all that i guess that what it comes down to is um how do we reduce future net traumas attributed to war not traumas i personally have a very pessimistic view of that which is that it's impossible it's going to happen time and time again there is a part of us that has it's no different than animals who jump on each other and kill each other and i don't think we can ever i guess perhaps it's just uh getting our youth and those that are even in older ages to have as integrated and wholesome of a psyche so that whenever fragmentation does occur it doesn't the toll of the trauma doesn't take as much of an effect i don't know i'm just trying to get my great if we could achieve that uh we're talking about human nature too which is um is it educate educate the blue we're experiencing more expansion i think within trauma studies one of the ideas that was floated is essentially a movement about the awareness of death of death awareness movement that even within end of life debates today the role of the doctor in whether it's medical intervention with disease or choices there still seems to be a way in which that there's a taboo that a move towards a greater awareness of what that ultimately means in medical ethics and education and in treatment and therapy that at the heart as we said earlier of these two traumas of war and genocide is mass death is awareness of death and perhaps if we began with the individual confrontation that could be a bridge to the larger political question whether there was a story in a times magazine i'm sure this i've only read half of it to be about the brain empathy um a researcher who i think was in taranto please correct me if i'm wrong because i'm halfway through who is actually studying what in the brain is the thing that gets triggered for someone to have an empathetic reaction to others the suffering of others um and and i think that's a different sort of thing we talk about brain science could you then adapt something like that and there's certainly some some possible sinister uh applications of this and to try to create a soldier who does not feel trauma but uh to be watched out for but i i think you know to on one level have those sorts of understandings i think like evisynthesis involved if you're trying to understand a situation don't just take it from one side or the other or or or what have you and then i think also when you're talking about the future generations going forward try to impart a sense that this you know these living in the aftermaths of these uh events is a fraught enterprise but it is not inevitability like there are options and and those who can introduce some of those someone can use their lives i mean i i don't and i don't say that lightly i mean someone up on uh pine ridge reservation or in gaza or and or wherever you know would think like that's where my life is going you know where there are opportunities to say like well what about that or like here's another possibility that just opens up uh i think the the abilities in ways that that can perhaps remove one from the reason of that trauma can be you know the chemical oxytocin increases empathy what's that oxytocin? Anybody there now for you for your discipline of course there always the concept of the enemy is one of the for me the most important issues that the need always to have the enemy you know this is there is something profoundly profoundly talking about your discipline outside enemy inside enemy exactly yes but but yes but it is a very serious issue yeah it is a good issue because there's no one behind me there's just a couple of thoughts that just came to my mind uh i know you know there's such things as terrorism drills and bystander intervention training and things like that yes um also what you just mentioned i think it reminds me of uh you know there's certain death cafes i guess they only talk about death and how it makes you feel more alive than ever and there are things like death meditations as well of which i personally done and have really transcended what what can happen um so i guess i don't know just okay very very helpful any other questions anybody else come up to the the mention was made about uh american soldiers i think you did comparing it with the the Nazi thing and we just recently had a discussion about me lie and it was very interesting because there's a lot of gi's that are stressed out dramatically some of which have gone back to vietnam to live and the extraordinary thing i'd like to hear some comments on was that this one fellow american found a little boy who was in me lie or somewhere near by where there was this massacre that went on and these soldiers apparently from what i can learn and i was aware of it when it happened back in 60 whatever it was 60 eight uh they just started tossing grenades in and firing and then this cali character gave the order for them to kill all these people there's only women and children they're no combatants but the extraordinary thing was that the vietnamese boy who's now a man didn't seem to bear any anger it was just really hard to understand he said well you know he he was talking he was being translated but he said well the point of it is he says you know you have to move on and they're very they're so hospitable and kind to americans they go over there and the american guy that was doing the uh had went there the soldier he said i couldn't understand how to how the vietnamese people could be so so kind and and forgiving well i mean i i think it's is the cmore hersh article right and the new yorkers that well that was one of the other red that and yeah that there was also there's been some a flurry of them on the radio right and there i mean there there are a few people americans living in vietnam still who fought and who do demining and work on agent orange and then other than that i said um i think um you know like i said earlier i think it's just kind of remarkable what what some people in vietnam can do but i also think uh there is self-interest in in it and i don't mean that in any bad way i mean it's just i think there's and i don't know where it comes from because i don't to be frank you know enough about kind of the culture and then the underpinnings of um is it confusion is it buddhist or you know like how these different strains of things play into it um but yeah that sense of of moving forward i think is very very profound and i think in a way that you spoke of with with uh speaking the Turks in the sense of like well we were all there we don't really need to talk about it i mean we were kind of and live it together our processing uh as we move through it is pretty profound and and also it was not the last war i mean i i don't know i don't think war is as big of a deal there as it is here even though the impacts were far more profound but it was part of a tapestry of events that i think were the story of the second half of the 20th century in vietnam was all these wars and then it's it changed the after war you know post-war um and it's it's also an interesting thing where you have these guys going back and there's there's guys who go back to Iraq too um when you look at you know the evolution of trauma in someone's life or the evolution of someone's effort to understand their wartime experience it definitely changes over time i mean what happens when the kid who's 22 comes home and when some of these guys are older very different because later on you're confronting your own mortality you're you know you're starting to think about taking stock of your life and why did i do this and why did i do that so having having a story like that come out now 40 years later is very instructive i think in a lot of ways um and if you look you know we talk about military suicides that the the majority of those are people over 50 it's not people who just got back um because if you get to a point where things just don't make sense and you're so far past the context where you can't remember why it was that you did that thing or it no longer suits it no longer makes any sense anymore i mean it can be i think a huge huge rupture but i think in the cases of um quite a number and i don't want to say all of it but vietnamese people and and i don't have the answer of like why or how i wish i did and i'd like to kind of hopefully look at it further because i think it is really a quite incredible example thank you um respect to the first person's question uh steven kinker has documented there's been a very noticeable decrease in violence and wars over the centuries and people forget how bad it was hundreds of years ago um as all forms of violence but my question is is there a difference between trauma experienced by victims do their human causes versus natural causes all right the difference between say the japan and tsunami or the earthquake now and sibet what's that trauma like compared to war trauma what i i would say you know the similarities and the aftermath is this sense that all of a sudden something can happen that can end your life or change it irrevocably but knowing what the causes are you know sort of mother nature should we say versus another person who may have been your neighbor or may have been somehow similar to you speaking i think it's quite different i think it's a different experience of trauma when you know it is someone else did that to you versus the power of of the god so to speak i mean and i think that's why a lot of those gods exist because that that power that's out there had to be manifested in one way or another represented in one way or another i don't i was not to say it's easier but i think you don't have that same sense of quite the same sense of well you definitely don't have a sense of how could somebody do this because there is no somebody and if you lived in place i mean if you're living in Nepal you know it is a uh on a fault line you know there are huge mountains you know there are snowfalls things like this that could do that i mean you know if you're living in coastal Sri Lanka the ocean is a powerful thing and you have some sense of that and it can rise up and i think that that um it's almost you know weird way it's almost more logical and i think that helps like having some sense of why and how it might happen helps in a way or can help in a way well i think the additionally as it said that humans are really the only species to gratuitously kill the the uh the uh defenseless without any instrumental reason i mean that it does provoke a very direct and profound challenge to any kind of basic sense of security in the world um and also politically and i think even just the debates over the causes of genocide why it is so perpetually baffling and productive of debates is this this search for an instrumental cause was this a self-interested act was this a suicidal act and the the lack of satisfaction that it leads for the the after world uh there's a way in which that a natural disaster doesn't pose the question of of interest of human interest and therefore for explanation but it's a great question because i know that originally the very organizing principle for the roundtable and trauma was to separate precisely natural versus man made as a basic divine there's some species of monkeys that kill pretty fivously to steal the other tribes women and females and it's pretty i think it's pretty well documented now that well it's also a question of whether genocide why are we distinguishing mass murder from genocide and why this does have a different category and that it's again a function of modernity of its itself a capacity that human achievement has made possible that was not there in previous centuries so it does a narrative of progress and even though right i mean pinker has been very heavily criticized for again creating a kind of triumphalist narrative of progress that all the examples of war and genocide seem to militate against that are germane to the 20th century so if you make a quant qualification or quantification of well there are x number of wars have been reduced but how does that stand with the capacity for nuclear annihilation and genocide against i think it's a value it's a value discussion perhaps but thank you anybody else yes i would just like to raise the issue of how much certain people's unconscious carries a trauma that they don't even know they've had i have colleague tina who have worked with patients and their dreams bring up that their parents are not really their parents and then it turns but the the ones they think are their parents are those who killed their parents who were among the disappeared so i think that's an incredible and and that's i've had instances where someone who's jumped they were jewish and didn't know it but we're carrying all this imagery from the holocaust so i would just like a couple of comments about that Eva? Eva? Yes well i'll try to that raises a question of what the unconscious knows and doesn't know and the way it is it it it does not know it's in dreams of course our way of of of expressing what is not consciously known it's true but it's it's you can push the question further it means how is it transmitted how do you get all these notions an emptiness is it true or blank is it unconscious communication which is not well known but still we know it exists it is true certain signs that we don't recognize as obvious signs it raises a whole question of transmission of transmissions and what but it's this this stories of desa paricidos in orientina it's it's still it's still open not when the idea of the ron table dr mccesian mentioned i mean some of the most kind of exciting research is epigenetic transgenerational trauma the fact that we now have more evidence that can be encoded even in the the genetic material before actual experience priori to the human life yeah but epigenetic means that it's uh encoded but it can only appear in certain and their environmental situation it means it's not genetic complete i mean it's not like you inherit the blue eyes or whatever to in order to be active it has to find and some kind of encounter that means something between the genes and the i've and how do you say unviral ron how do you say unviral ron? yes so okay thank you
